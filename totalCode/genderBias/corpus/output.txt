  thanks, can you use the edit button the doc page to update it? you can get a URL by dragging the image into github issue.  A-Frame uses THREE and the logic to recover a lost context you pointed out should be used by A-Frame now too.  Windows / Firefox is my work setup and never seen this issue. Can you also reproduce in a different machine?  thx  Left eye camera frustum is used for culling both eyes in THREE. As you saw it has to be fixed on the THREE side first.  This is expected behavior. `componentchanged` is not emitted anymore for rotation, position, scale for improved performance. You can read the values on a `tick` method in your component and update `a-text` accordingly:

```
tick: function () {
     var cameraRotation = this.el.sceneEl.camera.el.object3D.rotation ; // or this.el.sceneEl.camera.el.getAttribute('rotation'); this will return degrees not radians.
    textEl.setAttribute('value', 'x: ' + cameraRotation.x + ' y: ' + cameraRotation.x + ' z: ' +  cameraRotation.z
}
```  **Description:**

Rather than create a new object each time to create a new `oldData`, just have two objects representing `oldData` and `data`. Also when updating, rather than create a new `data` object, have a `newData` object that is used for holding the new data which then gets copied into `data`. So in total, only use three objects: `oldData`, `data`, `newData`.

**Changes proposed:**
- Adapt `style-attr` implementation to be able to pass in an object for reuse instead of creating a new one each time. Also remove lots of callbacks, `Object.keys()` array creations from their code.  Also tweaked to do prettier stringifies. We manage this forked dependency now. 
- Use object pooling in core component code to reduce object allocations. Recycle them when component is removed.
  - 1. Remove object allocations on each update for deep cloning data to `oldData`.
  - 2. Remove object allocation on initialization for initial `oldData`.
  - 3. Remove object allocation on each update during `buildData` for default value copying.  
  - 4. Remove object alloaction during `buildData`, was using `Object.keys`.
- Add some helper properties to component (`isSingleProp`, `isSinglePropObject`, `isObjectBased`)
- Update our `styleParser` utils a bit to not allocate object + array + use callbacks to convert keys to camelCase, and to cache regexes.

Updated to not delete the keys when recycling an object, but just set every key to `undefined`. This means object pooling best used when objects share a common schema, in case we iterate over keys. So I create different object pools for each type of component, since their object keys will be the same. I also update schema parser to ignore undefined keys.

- [x] Still need to polish/comment a bit more (and try to remove the clones for default values). But up and working again.
- [x] Tests
 Ready to go. Did another test with the /performance/animation-set-attribute stress test to measure memory. These recordings were taken over **4 seconds**. We save the following allocation calls:

- buildData (component) (~400KB)
- getKeyValueChunks (style-parser) (~160KB)
- cloneData (~80KB)
- updateProperties (~28KB)

With the particular stress test, it does lose out on ~5FPS (20FPS vs 15FPS), but it's also an unrealistic example since we wouldn't use setAttributes that hard and often for animations. Dodging GC is more important because GC will lose you entire frames.

We could perhaps have an option for components to not do any diffing, cloning, comparing, and just always run the update method no matter what, and let the component sort out data changes. We are probably losing a lot of time making sure redundant calls don't get processed.

 What's the rational to not bubble state events? It was for performance and semantics. For my laptop, a stateadded or stateremoved call each take ~.1ms (1% of a 90FPS budget), didn't quite like the cursor used it, so figured I could ameliorate it a bit. I thought it didn't make sense to bubble these events when they are very single-entity-specific.

I could go either way, my full desire would be to remove the API, and just use the cursor events provided. Second would be to remove event bubbling so it doesn't fire on like 10+ ancestors. If there's disagreement, don't mind closing either. When I write that API bubbling was what made it valuable. I used it to have a bunch of entities (created dynamically) changing to a specific state (`dead`) that I wanted to get notified for. Maybe we don't bubble but emit also on the scene so one can attach a single listener? @wmurphyrd Would that work for you? How about using raw events + data attributes? I feel using both state + events can be redundant. Instead of like listening for `stateadded` with `grabbed` state, just emit and listen for a `grabbed` event.  needs more info. Well, you don't provide any code or any leads. It's a warning that could come from anywhere. This is perhaps a StackOverflow support question to ask here https://stackoverflow.com/tags/aframe  **Description:**
The click event is not fired anymore if the mouse is not moved on the element. If the mouse moves a bit, then the event is firing again.

After clicking on the start button, a navigation menu appears on bottom. Pose mouse cursor on right arrow without moving the mouse and click, and click again and again. Only the first click event fires and moves the white thumbnail indicator. If you slightly move the mouse between clicks, click events are fired.

All of the fiddling with the alpha didn't really help and made things look worse when blending with other entities with alpha, and at distance.

  What about a single `reverseDrag` flag that works for both mobile and mouse? I think this is fine  **Description:**

Loading screen to avoid blank screen while loading assets and scene render loop has not yet started. The loader animation doesn't require 60fps to mask main thread pauses.

The logic is a `pseudo-component` since it has to initialize and render while the assets load. 

The title of the page is displayed above the loading indicator.

The color of the dots, background and style of the title bar are configurable.

  Are you able to share a demo of the scene? Confirmed the issue. 

Here's what I think is causing the problem: the `material` component uses a default `alphaTest` of 0, whereas three.js uses a default of 0.5. That would be fine (both are reasonable values), but `THREE.GLTFExporter` has to choose _either_ opacity or alphaTest to write, it cannot export both to glTF. Because alphaTest appears to be non-default, compared to three.js, alphaTest is chosen.

The workaround would presumably be to set `alphaTest: 0.5` on the model, but that isn't fixing the issue for me on a quick test. Will need to look more closely at why that is.  For discussion and not ready to merge, see https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3509. It looks good to me. What's pending? Some questions in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3509#issuecomment-417955800. This code is working, I'm just not sure if this is the right API to give users a colorspace option. I would probably like to create a new example rather than editing the anime-UI one, too. How about a material system because it only applies through the material component? e.g., `material="colorSpace: srgb"` Yep, probably a property of material makes more sense. @dmarcos just to clarify — are you OK with this being a material *system*? I think something at the scene level is preferable to including colorspace on every material component.  We recommend using Stack Overflow for help questions — I've commented on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52078385/aframe-a-entity-template-data-thumb-transparency-not-working.  Are you talking about the component or the built-in [cursor component](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/cursor.html#properties_rayorigin) using the rayOrigin property? Can you provide an example to reproduce and what you get vs. what you expect? Closing issue regarding mouse cursor: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3754#issuecomment-417400062

The code above has some bugs (`aycaster`, mouse cursor being child of camera). Don't know how well mouse cursor would work as a child of a camera on a polyfilled device. Can create new issue if there is an example with code without errors.  Thanks! 👍  I'm OK with this — I think we could just add the option to the scene [renderer.js](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/scene/renderer.js) component?

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 Doesn't sound like a bug in A-Frame. You can file a new one. netpro2k mentioned it might be a physics issue.  I encourage to open the question on StackOverflow. It will get more visibility. We use github issues for bugs and feature requests.  This is a utility that can be called optionally. It's extremely useful, and reduces bugs by today's components never cleaning themselves up. Rather than:

```js
{ 
  init: function () {
   this.bindMethods();
  },

  bindMethods: function () {
    this.click = this.click.bind(this);
  },

  addEventListeners: function () {
    this.el.addEventListener('click', this.click);
  },

  removeEventListeners: function () {
    this.el.removeEventListener('click', this.click);
  },

  pause: function () {
   this.removeEventListeners(); 
  },

  play: function () {
    this.addEventListeners();
  },

  remove: function () {
    this.removeEventListeners();
  },

  click: function (evt) {

  }
}
```

We do:

```js
{
  click: utils.bindEvent(function (evt) {

  })
}
``` It could be an auto-magic option by default, though there's less magic in calling it manually. I usually lean towards explicitness since it encourages understanding. Sometimes you don’t want to for instance remove event listeners on pause and only on removal. bindMethod will make all those decisions black boxy. I think plane, explicit, simple code is specially important in the core. It makes it more accesible since it requires less context to understand. It's explicit because you explicitly call it. It only does those behavior if you use it. You run into bugs if you *don't* use it. Components rarely clean themselves up. What is black boxy is the proposal of a magic flag or overriding addEventListener.  Sentences starting with But are fine, it sort of changes the meaning the the message, but will just merge anyways.  If one wants to reset the value to a previously set position the component is not updated:

```javascript
el.setAttribute('position', '3 3 3');
el.object3D.position.set(5, 5, 5);
el.setAttribute('position', '3 3 3');
```

The oldData value will be `3,3,3` and the second call to `setAttribute` won't have any effect. Really narrow edge case where it's not worth adding additional code paths to address. I' prescribe to choose one route over the other, strongly towards the `object3D` API. Yep, I filed because the bug hit me so not a crazy use case 😄 I had an entity pool and one component was requesting entities and reseting the position with `setAttribute` at no effect while other components manipulate object3D directly. The sequence illustrated above can occur across different components. We cannot guarantee consistency of use  `setAttribute` or object3D direct manipulation specially when using 3rd party components.  @arpu setAttribute won't be deprecated because it breaks the API consistency. object3D direct manipulation is just the recommended way for perf reasons. Also because it's just more ergonomic. Change an axis individudally by changing a number, having access to the three.js Vector3/Euler suite for operations, vector copying and cloning, world-to-local space and vice-versa transforms. Can fix the bug, but would prefer to see setAttribute use for pos/rot/scale eradicated. Eliminating setAttribute for position, rotation, scale is probably premature. A lot of 3rd party components rely on it. It's also good to keep the same consistent API to update all components and leave object3D manipulation as a power user feature. Yeah, not deprecate it...but would like to see it become a 100% adopted practice.  You can write a component that updates the material or texture (advance the frame, then set like `textureNeedsUpdate = true`.  I'm okay with requiring from `src` if it's just for debugging A-Frame installed through npm. Otherwise, the alternative is to go thru `git clone`, `npm install`, `npm link`, and then build the `dist` on every change.  A-Frame can be imported with a single script tag `<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.8.2/aframe.min.js"></script>`. For 3rd party components I don't see a practical way to enforce using EcmaScript modules. A-Frame does not favor any pattern or toolchain. Developers usually distribute the code so it can be imported via a script tag or consumed via npm but nothing is preventing the use of EcmaScript modules as well. It's not clear to me what can be done on the A-Frame side. Suggestions are welcome
 Yeah, no need to make anything changes (not sure what specific changes are proposed).

ECMAScript modules seem only available on the newest version of browsers too. It will take time for it to be able to be adopted in production.  @primedcore FWIW Neither https://vivid.unit9.com/ nor https://konterball.com are made with A-Frame and use old versions of THREE and the WebVR Polyfill. The authors need to update to more modern versions. Nothing we can do from the A-Frame side. I tried with Chrome for Android 66, 68, 69 and 70 on a Pixel 2 and cannot reproduce any of the issues described with the A-Frame examples: https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/

@Gauzz What phone are you using? Can you double check that you are on Chrome version > 66?
 @primedcore Can you check your Chrome browser version? What device?  @primedcore I think that the problem you're describing is also different than the original filed issue where the gyro does not seem to work. Can you open a separate issue? @Gauzz Can you check this URL? https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/anime-UI/ That’s weird. if any restriction I would expect it to be applied to HTTP over HTTPS What about this sample: 
https://webvr.info/samples/03-vr-presentation.html?polyfill=1 What about this one? https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr-polyfill/examples/
  thanks!  should be fixed  they're meant to be more taken from 2D, not in VR. Could try to patch perhaps, but maybe be messy  Can you provide error messages, npm logs?  Good catch. Just corrected it  Thanks for reporting  Better to share a complete runnable simple example: Your particular file might no be loading, You might be attaching the event listener too late... Your approach seems correct with the info you shared. I also recommend opening a questions in StackOverflow. We use github issues for bug reports and feature requests. Also consider upgrading to A-Frame 0.8.2  This is a [duplicate](
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/354) It’s fixed in the master branch. Available here: 
https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/6888165/dist/aframe-master.min.js  That was a change in Chrome that was accounted for in [0.8.2](
https://aframe.io/releases/0.8.2/aframe.min.js). Upgrade your application. Let us know if it’s still a problem.  Thanks for doing this. Just a minor comment and it's ready to go  Thanks! A small modification needed and ready to go.  Can you share a minimal example to
reproduce?  I'd link to the code versus the live example: https://glitch.com/~aframe-refraction-system

Don't worry about the test, thanks!  Thanks! Congrats on your first PR! 🥇   Not sure what build you are using in your fiddle but 0.8.2 works for me(https://aframe.io/releases/0.8.2/aframe.min.js). Example: https://jsfiddle.net/tg5qorkc/3/

Closing this and will reopen if this is still a problem I see. In the meantime. You could make your own build by taking 0.8.2 and applying (cherry picking) the canvas bound scroll fix:
``` 
git checkout v0.8.2
git checkout -b canvasBoundFix
git cherry-pick fb9024f229994477962
npm run dist
```  It's fragile to depend on non-public API and including directly from src. I have other ways to debug A-Frame than requiring from src in production.

If you want to debug directly with A-Frame, clone A-Frame repo, start the dev server, and a live build is ready at `http://localhost:9000/dist/aframe-master.js`. Or clone A-Frame repo, change package.json, and npm link. We could include `src`, but still exclude all the other crap. yeah  thanks!  I've fixed it. Somehow these Glitches are getting edited by someone, I've filed an issue on Glitch  Probably a fault of Chrome's policies https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes ... I don't particularly agree with them, it's what happens when VR is not a first-class citizen in a browser.

I believe if developers want to support video on Chrome, they need to register a listener to a click on the page then play the video.

I think Chrome should address it, it's not worth trying to make it work out of the box for A-Frame as we've seen the struggles on iOS Safari. There's not a strong focus for A-Frame to support all the video cases, but more full VR applications. So I think Chrome should either address it, developers work around it, or just leave a notice not supporting Chrome...or start targeting the rising class of VR-first browsers.  This is intentional behavior. WASD based locomotion in VR is motion sickness inducing. I recommend other mechanisms like [teleport](https://github.com/fernandojsg/aframe-teleport-controls). This is also a question better suited for [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aframe). We use Github for bugs and feature requests. For future readers:

See aframe-extras and https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/controls/README.md - you’ll need to have an entity (“camera rig”) wrapping the camera. This also applies for things like teleportation.  @viperphase1 Thanks. A PR is more than welcome if you have bandwith.   repeat is not a property of any THREE material but of [THREE.Texture](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/textures/Texture.repeat)  I can't reproduce the issue: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/rainy-jester?path=index.html:15:37

A complete example will help. Your HTML might not be well formed. Those warnings are innocuous and come from the `<cursor>` primitive that has a [ring](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/geometry.html#ring) geometry. Your HTML switches to `sphere` geometry that does not have `radiusOuter`, `radiusInner` properties. You can avoid the warnings by writing the cursor in the entity form:

```
<a-camera look-controls-enabled id="cameracontrolers">
      <a-entity cursor="fuse: true" objects=".interactive" position="0 0 -1" geometry="primitive:circle; radius: 0.008; segments: 32" material="color: #fff; shader: flat"></a-entity>
 </a-camera>
```  Thanks! Congrats on your first PR!  You’re welcome to open a PR. Probably easiest is modify the clone function to treat arrays differently: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/utils/index.js#L120 Just to make sure. What I meant that in the case of arrays we should not clone them using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))`. We should do a special case in the clone function to iterate ver the array. Something like this:

````
var newArray;
if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
  newArray = [];
  array.forEach(function (element) {
     newArray.push(element);
     return newArray;
  });
} else {
   return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
}
````  Curved image should not make any difference when it comes to raycaster intersection.  It will help clarify if you provide a simple runnable example and a description of what you see vs what you expect. 

The raycaster gives the intersection point with the geometry in world coordinates. Is that position wrong?  Look at the network tab in Developer Tools and see what response is coming for your OBJ file. This error probably means the OBJ or MTL file is not at the URL you've referenced. There was a [similar issue](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3686) opened two days ago. @wlhm1984 are you working on the same project? 

As commented in the other issue. Can you share your OBJ model? It seems your file is not well formed and you're getting a parsing error. I'm closing this since we keep Github issues for bugs and feature requests. For usage questions we rely on StackOverflow. You're also more than welcome to join the [Slack channel](https://aframevr-slack.herokuapp.com/) and repost the question for more visibility. 

  Thanks! Congrats on your first PR to A-Frame 🎉   Try adding `side="double"` — https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/material.html#properties. 2D objects are rendered only once (i.e. from one side) by default, which is more performant.  @Giorat Thanks for noticing. Do you want to submit a PR with the docs? It should be almost copy paste from the [oculus touch](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/components/oculus-touch-controls.md) one  Cool. Glad that it got fixed in THREE r94. Thanks for remembering writing the test and congrats for your first PR. Keep them coming 🥇   Can you share your OBJ model? It seems your OBJ model is not well formed. I will reply here but I'm closing this. We use github issues for bugs and feature request. For usage questions we use StackOverflow and you can share the link in the [Slack channel](https://aframe.io/community/#slack)  Thanks!  Yeah, unless we refactor the system and have some sort of forced dirty flag, they can't be updated with the same object.

An alternative is to flip-flop between two vector objects as you update.  Thanks! `if` is not terribly important. Just for Inspector for certain types of components.  Thanks!

 Hey, got time to copy it in? Add as a separate module to `utils.js` in like `events.js` or `decorators.js`, then attach it to `AFRAME.utils.bindEvent`. Any more context about this? It’s hard to follow what this is for. The associated PR is adding a fair amount of code of complexity and the value is not obvious  > It seems to me that a proper fix would be for three to support setPoseTarget on WebXRManager

Yeah let's just wait for that. three.js's support is incomplete. WebXR is not going to ship until Q4 at least, and even then it's going to be incomplete (proper controller support). I'm sure Google/etc will address it in three.js shortly if they want to push WebXR and most WebVR sites are A-Frame based.  I see those gampads. `navigator.getGamepads` is populated by the browser not A-Frame. @kearwood @daoshengmu Do you know if Firefox is populating the gamepads list even if the controllers are not present in Oculus?  Thanks!  It will fire on the rig. `document.querySelector("#rig").addEventListener` Use a tick handler to detect changes in position, we've moved away from using pos/rot/scale components to manipulate pos/rot/scale, and instead using object3D directly, so that event may not always fire. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38907857/how-to-listen-to-changes-in-the-rotation-of-the-camera-in-a-frame Replace position with rotation. Player will almost always be moving especially in VR. Better to just always listen rather than rely on events. Can store previous position if you want to compare  https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/orbit-controls  In the example you link to, WASD is working normally for me. Could you explain a bit more what issue you see? Simply pressing <kbd>W</kbd> briefly moves the camera far from its original position? Are you using a headset, too, or just a keyboard/monitor setup? Works fine. May sometimes glitch if computer is under a lot of load.  @Xrispy7 This should have fixed by https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/aaa3bf0bf4e0dfc744e2964dc4c8f11b24620333

You can try the examples in master to verify: https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/examples/

I'm closing but will reopen if the problem is not fixed  This perhaps belongs on the community page, next to the existing NYC entry (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-site/blob/master/src/community/index.md), rather than the root introduction page on  the core steps to getting started with A-Frame.  I was able to reproduce the problem with the THREE example as well: https://threejs.org/examples/webvr_video.html

It does not seem to be specific to A-Frame @DigiTec Any known problem with the Oculus Browser + Video on the Go? Problem not exclusive to A-Frame.    What do you mean by marker? Is it a marker as defined in `ar.js`?  **Description:**

I was doing a non-recursive raycast, and defined some objects that had children. These children were getting added to the `objects` set due to the `flattenChildrenShallow`. So I had an entity with 700+ non-visible children that were toggled off, and they were getting added to the raycast set.

The original intent of the logic was to only add like `getObject3D('mesh')` and such. So rather than loop over children, loop over `object3DMap`. Makes the logic simpler as well.

**Changes proposed:**
- Don't add all of groups' children to `.objects`, only add `object3DMap` keys.

 r? @donmccurdy want to check it out since you did the initial flatten  Can you also try with Chrome Canary (m69) to see if it still reproduces?  Maybe we should just remove the whole preload logic for audio and video, letting it stream as normal?  Not sure, should have left a comment back then. You can try removing it or moving to a tock.  This is a proposal for a built-in post-processing API. Setting up post-processing in a comprehensive manner that works well in 2D and VR modes is not trivial to do. It requires tight integration with the render loop. A built-in effects API will help raise the visual quality of the content and will make very easy for everybody to experiment with the different effects while ensuring good performance. At first we would not have a public API for user defined effects since many are not suitable for stereo rendering. By providing the effects we can control how and what order are applied to guarantee consistent results and FPS. Once we settle on an API we can consider open it up. 

The API is built by defining `effect-` prefixed scene level components for each effect. The order they are applied is fixed and independent on how and when they are defined. e.g:

````html
  <a-scene effect-bloom="strength: 1.6" effect-sepia background="color: black">
      <a-box color="white" position="0 1.6 -2"></a-box>
  </a-scene>
```` 
This PR just contains a bloom and sepia effects but I will expand before merge. I would love to hear what effects people want to see first.

I would love to hear what effects people want to see first.

SSAO please! Having functionality based on a prefix and HTML attribute ordering is a bit magic. I would define the order `effects: effects-bloom, effects-sepia`. The order does NOT depend on attribute position. The order is fixed and will be documented. e.g: 1. tint, 2. vignette, 3. sepia, 4. bloom... it won’t be user configurable Sketchfab also has a fixed effects order: https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000728943-Post-Processing-Filters?mobile_site=true  Let's try to fix the `text` component's reliance on same-name textures: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3651. Otherwise this looks good to me. If that PR will take some time, then I'd prefer to merge this one and recommend that users use the `fontImage` path rather than relying on our inference of the image URL from the JSON filename.  It seems a Chrome issue with the permissions granted to a WebView. I found this reference: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=852543   Nice. I wanted this because, yeah, fullscreen on Macbook is a drain.

You don't have to build the dist for PRs, you can remove that.

Perhaps `renderer="maxCanvasWidth: 1280; maxCanvasHeight: 720"`? And I would make it so that if you enter VR, the height and width are ignored? I played around. I am not sure setSize helps with Retina. The size is already reported as 1440x900 and pixel ratio is 2. Setting pixel ratio to 1 seems like what you'd want to do for Retina? Don't know what that means, size larger than the screen. It varies between screens. My MacBook has a pixel ratio of 2, and it's OS-configured too, my Windows is at 1.25. Rather than maxSize, we should allow configuration of `renderer.setPixelRatio(maxPixelRatio)`? Also don't know how that plays with the VR renderer. Thanks! Let's see how it goes.  In the current version of `gltf-model` there is no option to specify the draco loader. You could certainly fork the component (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/gltf-model.js) and add those lines of code:

```js
THREE.DRACOLoader.setDecoderPath( '/path/to/decoder' );
loader.setDRACOLoader( new THREE.DRACOLoader() );
```

We could add this in 0.9.0, but it would be a breaking change since there isn't currently a `src` property:

```html
<a-entity gltf-model="src: foo.glb; dracoDecoderPath: /path/to/decoder;"></a-entity>
``` Does your model work on https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/? Glad it's working! :) Re-opening this as a feature request. I'd like to provide some way of using Draco while still using the `gltf-model` component. TBD if that is possible without breaking `gltf-model="foo.gltf"` single-property syntax.  There's something unusual about this model; it appears incorrectly in my native OSX quicklook plugin as well, and Cesium parses it as shown above in their converter.

You can try exporting differently from your tool (perhaps triangulate before export, if you haven't?). Otherwise the only thing that worked for me was importing the OBJ to Blender and exporting as glTF with https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter. I don’t know, unfortunately. It could be that the model uses a rare OBJ feature, or is slightly incorrect in some way. Often OBJ models contain n-gons (faces that aren’t triangles) and this breaks some tools, and triangulation happens automatically when converting to glTF which fixes this.  This PR is empty 🙂 Closing this. Probably opened unintentionally  @ShashankaNataraj You'll need to create an A-Frame component for this, using [THREE.GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/loaders/GLTFLoader). Most likely you'll want to use the `.glb` version of a glTF model, which turns into an arraybuffer if you load it through Webpack.

```js
var el = this.el;
var loader = new THREE.GLTFLoader();
loader.load( buffer, '', function (gltf) {
  el.setObject3D('mesh', gltf.scene);
}, function (e) {
  console.error(e);
});
``` I recommend opening your question in StackOverflow. It will get more exposure. We use github issues for bugs and feature requests.  Thanks! Congrats on your first PR! 🍾   Oculus Go has a built-in Web Browser that can display WebVR content. https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5aebc7ad49d28.jpg Chrome for Android is also WebVR compatible. You should be able to use it with Daydream headsets  I left an answer in the other issue you opened (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3633) Pasted below:

In VR mode the data from the sensors override your tap to move. Move a camera rig (parent of the camera entity). More info in the docs: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/components/camera.md I also encourage to open usage questions on stack overflow.

https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/examples/showcase/anime-UI/ What do you mean by move? A-Frame does not come with built-in locomotion in mobile. Try @donmccurdy movement-controls component https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/controls  In 0.7.0 A-Frame moved to glTF 2.0. Make sure your model follows the new spec. Archilogic uses an old version of glTF that we no longer support, yes. You may be able to use the `gltf-model-legacy` component in A-Frame Extras: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/loaders  In your page you can place a-scene wherever you want or hide it like any other HTML element by using the [embeded component](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/components/embedded.md) Mirroring is the default mode because its the simplest, most performant option. Showing something different would imply rendering the scene twice degrading performance in VR. You can opt into an alternative perspective by using a specator camera: https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/camera.html#properties_spectator An example of spectator camera:

````  Cool, thanks. We don’t want to merge failing tests. We can incorporate this once the problem is solved on the THREE side  What are you trying to accomplish? styleParse does not have any kowledge about schemas or datatypes. That function is the last step before asigning the value to the entitiy via setAttribute and after all the component schema parsing has been done. if your schema has a property called distance: { type: “vec3”, default: “0 0 0”}  the `AFRAME.utils.coordinates.stringify` will be called before `AFRAME.utils.styleParse.stringify` Yeah, stringify is just the basic CSS / style string parsing. It only parses a plain string fed from HTML.  Yeah, it's expected. The child and parent are their own entities. The events also bubble, use `evt.target` to get the specific target. `raycaster.recursive` property can also affect things.  I would circle with the THREE folks to see if it makes sense to enhance THREE.AudioLoader to fulfill your needs. Can you open an issue in THREE with a proposal and reference this issue to keep track?   Not sure I understand the problem. I just tried on Chrome 66 and 69 (Canary) on a Pixel 2 and the scene you pointed out enters VR mode as expected after enabling WebVR in `chrome://flags`. Can you describe exactly the steps you followed and what you expect vs. what you get?  Thanks!

Could you also PR this to https://github.com/spite/rstats?  To properly render languages like Hebrew or Arabic
  You could create hotspots with regular DOM elements positioned with 3D transforms but they won’t render in VR mode when used in a headset. I recommend using StackOverflow to ask questions. We use Github issues for bugs and feature requests.  Thanks! 👍   There’s not `right-to-left` support in the text component. I opened a more general issue: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3612
Any community help will be more than welcome  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38835415/how-to-defer-or-load-an-a-frame-scene-programmatically  Thanks This has landed?  Thanks! The site installs A-Frame through npm at different versions / branches for documentation. I think we just need to also allow `docs/` in as well for now, which shouldn't be too large. We used npm as a medium to install and copy documentation versioned from the GitHub repo. We could rejigger it to perhaps fetch and download the ZIP instead, but for another day.

The Markdown files (just flat files) shouldn't be included in applications if they aren't `require`d. So easiest to just leave `docs/` for now, and continue to wipe all else from npm. Will just live with a few Markdown files for now so we don't have to break the entire documentation system (or spend days rejiggering the build system and the bot). At least the examples are out. npm is messy, if there are libraries that suck in everything they fetch from npm, that's rough. Gonna merge for now and push a fix to continue to include docs, apologies if it isn't ideal yet!  **Description:**

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50493717/how-to-get-aframe-to-only-upload-canvas-contents-to-texture-when-needed/50505535#50505535

Canvas textures was re-uploading to GPU every frame.

**Changes proposed:**
- Don't use VideoTexture for canvas...
 Good catch, updated. The linter is complaining Updated.  Thanks for reporting. Just tried your demo on the Go and I was hitting 55-60 fps consistently in 2D mode and performance in VR mode looks good to me as well. We need additional information on what you're observing. The perf tool has some overhead but the numbers I got is with the tool enabled. I don't see any issues with perf on the Go with the provided example. I'm closing this but will reopen if there's additional info.  Weights cannot just be added to fonts at display time in WebGL like they can in HTML — I think you'll need to generate a font with the weight you need. See https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/text.html#generating-sdf-fonts. https://github.com/etiennepinchon/aframe-fonts  I cannot open the link that you provided to test. Can you provide another one?  **Description:**

The intersection in the event detail requires object creation. Pass a function instead. The intersection data is only used in certain and more involved cases and calling a function to get the intersection data is easy.

Can update docs if looks good.

**Changes proposed:**
- Instead of emit an object per intersection on tick, reuse the event detail, and offer `getIntersection` method to fetch intersection data. I think you still need to filter compute newly intersected entities / cleared for the `raycaster-intersection` and `raycaster-intersection-cleared` events, even if you ignore the `raycaster-intersected*` events. The raycaster-side events only get emitted on newly intersected or cleared events. Used sometimes when you want to know something is intersected. There is the cursor, but that only emits on the nearest intersected.

The only thing we'd save is some event emits. I don't think that has much effect. The loops and processing will be done regardless. If you aren't using the events, then I'd make your own raycaster. Rebased. Possibly, I think `getIntersection` is a bit more prescriptive / offers more guidance on what to do with the event. We could do both.  You have to put the script at the top so the A-Frame custom elements: a-entity, a-box... are registered when the DOM initializes. That’s how custom elements work. A-Frame does not scan / parse the DOM. Let us know if you have any other questions  Thanks.  Those examples you listed first are external demos we link that probably don’t have an up to date A-Frame. The A-Frame
built in examples live in https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/ and those should all work as expected  This is covered at https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/material.html#video-textures, I would add a link to there. Hey @wrjanan, can you update the PR to just add a link to above? `../components/material.html#video-textures`? Thanks! If you view it in GitHub, or npm run docs, you can test the link. It looks good!  Can you open a question on StackOverFlow and post it on Slack? We use github issues for bugs and feature requests. Not sure how `super-hands` works. Better to ask in [the original repo](https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component). The A-Frame [tracked-controls](https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/tracked-controls/) example works as expected. In console:
![hand](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/3U2B2X101t2v0F43382k/Image%202018-05-14%20at%202.01.58%20AM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=222920&v=3149d6b2)
 FWIW, the `super-hands` examples work also as expected. For instance: https://wmurphyrd.github.io/aframe-super-hands-component/examples/physics/
In console:
![super-hands](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/2r1U3n0O471a2U3K1D1P/Image%202018-05-14%20at%202.06.19%20AM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=222920&v=cc9a819c)  You’ll need to set `texture.flipY=false` when manually adding a texture to a glTF model.  This happens automatically for textures included in the model. Oops, I should have looked at the images before replying. Never mind about the "textures included" thing. Does this scene use a mirror modifier by any chance? This looks like a bug from previous versions of three.js. You may be able to manually fix this after import with something like:

```
var el = document.querySelector('#my-model');
el.object3D.traverse((node) => {
  if (node.isMesh) {
    node.material.normalScale.y *= -1.0;
  }
});
```  Some of the unit tests are failing with the change. Thanks for the PR. It looks good. One thing that you might want to consider. If you are calling `setAttribute` on a tick I recommend reusing the same object, the values will be considered trusted and type checking / parsing skipped altogether (https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/introduction/best-practices.html#tick-handlers) also reducing object allocation. For instance:
```javascript
init: function () {
 this.yourComponentData = {coords: {x: 0, y: 0, z:0}, enabled: true};
},
tick: function () {
  this.yourComponentData.coords.x += 1;
  this.el.setAttribute('your-component', this.yourComponentData);
}
``` If you are in a tick, better to just avoid setAttribute altogether. We should have the raycaster component update the origin/direction directly. We already do the object reuse, that only saves on parsing. Thank you. First PR achievement unlocked 🎉 Congrats!  It's hard to unpack what you're seeing vs. what you're expecting with the given info. If you can share a simple runnable example that reproduces the problem it will be very helpful. I'm closing this due to the lack info. I will reopen if there are additional details  @bklava Is the result the same on the Oculus Browser?  What is exactly the problem? A PR for that would be welcome!  @j-conrad Did you by chance observe the same problem in any THREE example as well?  Thanks for sharing the info with us. Can you share a bit more detail? Any specific examples you can point? Do you mean text resolution? Are you referring to 360 video or real time 3D? I tested the A-Frame examples yesterday on the Go and they looked good to me. The examples in aframe.io have antialias disabled by default on mobile for increased performance. You can enable it in your experiences by doing `<a-scene antialias="true">` Cool. Yeah it seems to be missing from docs. FYI, it will be replaced in next aframe version in favor of the renderer component:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/components/renderer.md  Are you using a `cameraRig` property, as shown in the example? A code snippet or demo URL would be useful.

```html
  <a-scene>
    <a-entity id="cameraRig">
      <!-- camera -->
      <a-entity id="head" camera wasd-controls look-controls></a-entity>
      <!-- hand controls -->
      <a-entity id="left-hand" teleport-controls="cameraRig: #cameraRig; teleportOrigin: #head;"></a-entity>
      <a-entity id="right-hand" teleport-controls="cameraRig: #cameraRig; teleportOrigin: #head;"></a-entity>
    </a-entity>
  </a-scene>
``` You'll need to use a camera rig (just an entity wrapper around your camera) with `teleport-controls` in A-Frame 0.8. From the changelog:

> Remove VREffect / VRControls for three.js WebGLRenderer API. VR camera pose is managed by three.js.

The docs for `teleport-controls` have been updated to reflect this as well. In VR mode, the position of the camera is locked to the pose of the device. This solves many issues from previous versions, but also requires a change to your markup. The rig should be moved when animating or teleporting, rather than the camera.

If you find that isn't working well with `wasd-controls`, you may want to try `movement-controls` from aframe-extras instead, which has better compatibility in this situation: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/controls#usage @WintermuteGermany I have created a simple glitch example using teleports and A-Frame 0.8.2 and a camera rig as @donmccurdy described: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/fixed-range

 I don't think there's anything actionable here on the A-Frame side. @WintermuteGermany If there's any usage questions besides the info we provided I recommend opening a question on Stack Overflow. @WintermuteGermany You’re welcome from a fellow Spaniard  Both dependencies are forked versions of the original, as some changes were necessary for whatever reason. I don't recall the particular changes, but things will likely break if they're switched to the npm versions. We also occasionally need to reference a forked version of three.js, although that's usually a temporary thing.

If these changes don't make sense to merge into the official packages, I think the best option would be to just put both dependencies in scoped npm packages.

This could be done on our end, as `@aframe/debug` and `@aframe/document-register-element` or by your company. Would defer to @dmarcos and @ngokevin whether it seems OK to do this on our side. There are a couple more in devDependencies — are those not an issue for your security review? Ocasionally, we need to fix bugs or additional features in the dependencies and PRs in the original repos take time to be merged or are not accepted. 

Can you point your application to the bundled a-frame directly? https://aframe.io/releases/0.8.2/aframe.js

Another solution is to take those forks, publish them in npm yourself and repoint the package.json (as @donmccurdy mentioned)

Just curious, What are the security concerns about npm only dependencies? npm does not have any security or review process that I know of. I'm looking at scoped npm packages and we can definitively do it. Forked dependencies are an exception  . I feel pointing to github makes it clear and easier to follow through and see the changes. A package published on npm hides away the context and it's harder to trace back. A few issues / PRs and debugging have come from the community since the info is exposed in the package.json. @IntegersOfK We can definitively consider scoped packages but wondering if there's an alternative that we can explore that also works for you   @IntegersOfK Thanks for escalating the problem. It's the first time we've heard of such an issue. We'll look into it. In the meantime, I think the described solution will work. You can republish aframe yourself in npm with the dependencies also pointing to npm published packages. Would that fulfill all of your employer constraints? Is that an interim acceptable solution for you? Do you have a corporate npm account you can publish from? @IntegersOfK Even if we point now the dependencies to npm in master we would have to deploy a new A-Frame version and for that we would have to go through all the usual Q/A process. It will take us a few weeks to get there. If there's a way to republish A-Frame on npm things will move faster for you. Might simplify things if it's possible to skip devDependencies (e.g. `npm install --production`). Easier to deal with just two dependencies. Can confirm that at my company using an external CDN like `https://aframe.io/releases/0.8.2/aframe.js` would not be permitted. What about an internal CDN? @IntegersOfK Do you have an internal CDN where you can copy the A-Frame bundle where it's consumed from internally? @IntegersOfK That's awesome. Thanks for doing that work. I will definitively direct people with the same problem to your package.  This is due to changes / bugs in Chrome m65. Make sure you update to A-Frame 0.8.2 and Chrome m66. More info here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3476 @Lissy93 Upgrade to 0.8.2. It’s the latest published version:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe

  Can you rebase? I pushed some fixes for the failing tests, then we can re-run the test suite. I think we added this a long time ago for a reason, so it has a little risk. We should have documented why that was necessary. We should avoid touching it if we can. Can we tell Babel somehow to ignore it?  Will merge, I think that was a no-op since yeah, browsers don't let you do that.   Can you share a complete runnable example with for instance glitch.com? There’s not enough context to see what’s happening  It is a design decision to keep the virtual and real horizon always aligned in magic window mode. You can copy `look-controls` and add the logic to pan with touch in the vertical direction. We don't use the polyfill panner in A-Frame. You have to modify the logic in `look-controls`:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/look-controls.js#L285 @didacher if you are using the webvr-polyfill their repo is a better place to ask https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill  Thanks for the ideas. In a cost-benefit analysis:

- As you said syntax is uglier and more verbose.
- We already have a [list of registered](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/propertyTypes.js#L11) types on a single place in code and docs. The list is not very long and most of types not often used. New users will still have to check [the documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/core/component.html#property-types) for details and more typing, uglier code for experts. 
- Extra maintenance to keep those lists up to date and greater risk of bugs. In the case of events specially there will be inconsistencies. We don't automatically collect all the events that all the components emit since they're not declared before hand (we could enforce event declaration). To emit an event you just call `el.emit('eventname');` anywhere in the code. We could manually collect the core events in a list but all 3rd party components would be missing. Potentialy confusing: Why are some of the events in the list and not others?

I see some of the value on protecting against typos but after consideration of the costs an implications not sure if the balance is positive.  @PlumCantaloupe Thanks for your suggestions. I'm closing but will reopen if you still think we need to revisit this.   https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3764  Got bit recently with an unexpected issue writing a component, thought I'd write it up for ideas...

The `nav-mesh` component needs the mesh from the entity it's attached to, and needs to account for transformations on its parents. I'd imagined this would be simple enough:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('nav-mesh', {
  init: function () {
    this.loadNavMesh();
    this.el.addEventListener('object3dset', () => this.loadNavMesh());
  },

  loadNavMesh: function () {
    const navMesh = this.el.getObject3D('mesh');

    if (!navMesh) return;

    const navMeshGeometry = navMesh.geometry.isBufferGeometry
      ? new THREE.Geometry().fromBufferGeometry(navMesh.geometry)
      : navMesh.geometry.clone();

    scene.updateMatrixWorld();
    navMeshGeometry.applyMatrix(navMesh.matrixWorld);
    this.system.setNavMeshGeometry(navMeshGeometry);
  }
});
```

Unfortunately this fails — when `init` runs, the entity's parents do not have their position/rotation/scale applied yet, so `scene.updateMatrixWorld()` does nothing, and the transformation isn't applied to the Geometry.

Next I assumed `update()` would be a safe place to put the `loadNavMesh()` call, but it too runs before parents are initialized. I don't want this code to run on `play` (it shouldn't reload when the scene pauses) so instead I ended up with:

```js
tick: function (t) {
  if (t === 0) this.loadNavMesh();
}
```

Anyway, all of this was a little more complicated than I expected, and harder than component lifecycles in e.g. Angular. Saw this issue (or similar) called out as a [pain point compared to Unity recently, too](http://portfolio.anthony-scavarelli.com/2018/04/24/thoughts-on-multi-user-vr-development-using-unity-and-aframe-webvr/):

> Have to wrestle with asynchronicity issues that you generally don’t run into with Unity (e.g. why is this model loading BEFORE something else it is dependent on …)

Anyway, I don't have a concrete proposal at the moment but wanted to think about tightening up component lifecycles in a future version and documenting clearly what component authors should expect. Initialization order is from children to parents. When `init` and `update` run for an entity all of its children have initialized but not the other way around. You could listen to the `loaded` event on the parent to get initialized. Asynchronicity is more a general problem of the Web than specific to A-Frame due to the single threaded JS context. I think the problem is more complex than that. Using the `loaded` event gets complicated when you need to consider:

1. component may be attached before or after scene has loaded
2. component may be attached before or after entity has loaded
2. component may be attached before or after entity's mesh has loaded
3. component itself may have async behavior

I don't see asynchronicity as a problem, given ways to direct async program flow, but currently I do some guessing and rely on undocumented behavior that can and has changed over time, like exactly when `update` will initially run. It's overkill, but see the much more granular initialization hooks that Angular provides:

- ngOnInit 
- ngAfterContentInit
- ngAfterContentChecked
- ngAfterViewInit
- ngAfterViewChecked
- ngOnChanges

https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks

They also provide a clearly-documented order for all hooks:

I don't know React or Unity, but I believe they have some additional controls here as well: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html

The fact that I can't know the initial _position_ of my entity until the first `tick` has already begun seems like a hazard. I don't think we should rush into any changes here, but I do think it's worth considering whether we can make things more predictable for component authors.
 You could move the component up the tree, or run it on play with a check
that it only runs once, run it on scene loaded, or manage it in a system.
It's fairly common even in web development to write event listeners to wait
for something to happen first (e.g., DOMContentLoaded).

> The fact that I can't know the initial *position* of my entity until the

Seems like you want to know the position of the parent entity, no? The
position component initializes first if present.

We could add more hooks if we need, but wrote like apps with dozens of
components, haven't run into something where there wasn't a clean solution
(usually using events).

I think we have an issue open for allowing dependencies on components with
an event (e.g., depend on model loaded), though can be accomplished with
event listener, haven't felt too much need to add more API.

Any specific improvements or areas of documentation suggestions welcome.

 @donmccurdy In your case above I think it would be sufficient to do:

```this.el.sceneEl.addEventListener('loaded', () => this.loadNavMesh());``` 

This way all the entities all the way up to `a-scene` (that can influence the position of your entity) are initialized.

If you can describe other scenarios we might offer solutions with the current APIs. We could then collect the best practices in the docs. Oh I see. You might need to do in `this.loadNavMesh`:

```js
 init : function () {
    this.el.addEventListener('object3dset', () => this.loadNavMesh());
 },

  loadNavMesh: function () {
    var sceneEl = this.el.sceneEl;
    // Postpone if scene has not loaded
    if (!sceneEl.hasLoaded) { 
      sceneEl.addEventListener('loaded', () => this.loadNavMesh());
     return;
   }
   ...
  }
``` > I find the "loaded" event is a bit of a misnomer as it doesn't account for the actual content within the entity being loaded (i.e. a model and its associated textures/materials are not necessarily loaded as well).

An entity can always be loading things at any time, the `loaded` event is for loading all of its components and attaching onto the tree. Maybe it's better to use granular events and listen to what's needed than a catch-all loaded event that tries to consider every thing. I suppose we can introduce a way for components to hook into the loading process.

> When building a couple of components that accessed materials/meshes I had to approach similarly to Don's tick method. I see there is an "object3Dset" event I can listen to but that also doesn't necessarily mean the material is set correct?

There's a `materialtextureloaded` event. 

> Also, what about use cases where there are multiple dependencies within the ThreeJS layer. I am just getting to understand promises in js but how would we approach this within an asynchronous event-driven model (without having to resort to a bunch of questionable booleans in a tick)?

The `tick` boolean isn't a recommended solution. three.js has callbacks anywhere where asynchronous, and from A-Frame, there are always events that can be used to hook into anywhere. 

> Are some of these issues related to trying to maintain two areas where setting properties can take place: setAttribute(...) as position/scale/rotation as attributes vs. setting them directly to the object3D.position.set(...)?

Not really, they do the same thing. Perhaps components can have like a `async: true` property, and it has to call `this.load()` in order for the entity to be fully loaded. For like models. Though will cause inconsistency, some async components will adopt it, some won't. 

It seems more explicit to wait for a `modelloaded` event versus a general `loaded` event. And it won't block further initializations and such. Yeah. It's actually probably better not to force it to allow other things to happen while a model is loading, and anything that needs that model listen to the specific event.

Did you try to look it up somehow? Or we just need to put a disclaimer somewhere to read events in component readme? Or describing the async nature somewhere? Hopefully we covered bases with:

[Googling for example `aframe listen texture`](https://www.google.com/search?q=aframe+listen+texture`) and near beginning of [material docs](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/material.html#events). It doesn't seem like that information is too far out of reach. > Seems like you want to know the position of the parent entity, no? The position component initializes first if present.

You only have local position until `play()` or `tick()` is called. The entity could have N ancestors all with transforms, and to account for that you need their positions/scales/rotations to have been applied. World position is simply not available in `init()` or first `update()`.

> We could add more hooks if we need, but wrote like apps with dozens of components, haven't run into something where there wasn't a clean solution.

The points i'm describing here are easy to avoid when writing a particular app, but hard to do right if you want your component to work robustly in other people's scenes. E.g. many, many community components become buggy if you start adding parents with transforms around them.

> this.el.sceneEl.addEventListener('loaded', () => this.loadNavMesh());

You're correct that this would work IF the component is never added dynamically, but again, I would be more comfortable doing this if lifecycle order were documented. I assume it's  `init -> update -> emit:loaded -> play -> tick`?  But it's easy to imagine `update` and `loaded` changing places, or `loaded` not being available at all for components added dynamically, and I don't want to rely on undefined behavior more than necessary.

> Perhaps components can have like a async: true property, and it has to call this.load() in order for the entity to be fully loaded. For like models. Though will cause inconsistency, some async components will adopt it, some won't.

As an example, some of the most common questions and "bug reports" I get are related to users trying to do things before `model-loaded` or `body-loaded` have fired. I would gladly adopt `async:true` in these cases. Obviously there would be many questions about how that would work (does it delay traversing up the scene, or just block first render like `a-assets`?).

But, I'm not suggesting we rush into any changes here — especially not before 0.9.0. Just want to brainstorm around some ideas. There are also ways I could imagine this being done with a helper system on top of A-Frame...

```js
AFRAME.registerSystem('async', {
  // ...
});

AFRAME.registerComponent('sword', {
  init: function () {
    var sceneEl = this.el.sceneEl;
    sceneEl.systems.async.awaitAll('mesh', 'body', 'material')
      .then(() => this.doStuff());
  },
  doStuff: function () {
    // ...
  }
});
```

The current API works well and it's possible to solve most any issue for a particular experience, but I think there could be things we could do (or document) to make it easier to write components that are more reliably reusable across many scenes. > I would be more comfortable doing this if lifecycle order were documented.

- https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/core/component.html#overview-of-methods
- https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/core/component.html#play

Suggested approach:

```
play: function () {
  if (this.hasSetupNavMesh) { return; }
  // ...
  this.hasSetupNavMesh = true;
}
```

I have also filed in the past to differentiate between scene initial play and a resume handler (Inspector).

Or better, if behavior depends on parent entities, the behavior should move to the parent entity or a manager.

About most of my components I develop within applications are application-agnostic and can be dropped into other apps. There's not much difference in building a component within an app and a robust reusable one. > About most of my components I develop within applications are application-agnostic and can be dropped into other apps.

If by "robust" and "reusable" we mean (1) can be added at any point in the scene lifecycle, and (2) can be nested under parents with position/rotation/scale, then many components fall short of this. My own physics components and controls code, for starters. Both `ngokevin/aframe-physics-components` and `kframe/components/geometry-merger` make exactly the mistake I'm describing above, assuming that world position is available during `init()`, and will fail when nested under parents not located at the origin. Maybe the easy steps would be:

1. Add a cute little diagram showing overall order of lifecycle methods and events.
2. I'll experiment with async flow in my own components and report back if anything interesting comes of it.  @deckewandboden Is this still a problem?  It's deprecated. If people use it, their scenes will break on every A-Frame update.  Can you update the docs? Probably three.js changed the behavior? This is a dupe. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3551  It might be a change in three.js logic. But setting `objects` is best practice.

You probably don't have to manually refresh. > You probably don't have to manually refresh.

^Assuming A-Frame 0.8+. The raycaster should log something if you are using an `objects` selector it can't auto-refresh. They still auto-refresh with or without the selector. Yes, but there are some selectors that autorefreshing will not catch. E.g., if `setAttribute()` call is not serialized to the DOM. I just mean that you'll see a warning logged if you are using one of these selectors. > would it still not make the most sense for the raycaster to ignore an entity with visible="false" regardless of whether or not it qualifies as a raycaster object? 

I often have hidden raycaster targets to pad the click range (e.g., small targets). Often, you still want to trigger with invisible objects. I even have a `raycaster-target` helper component that drops a hidden raycaster target by width/height.

> If it's desired for the entity to not be visible while also being raycastable, material="visible: false;" can still be used. This seems cleaner to me than having to add/remove/replace query selectors.

Regardless, you want to use query selectors, else everything will be raycastable. Some things I do is I create a `raycastable` component that can be mixed in. Or `data-raycastable` with a helper component that toggles them on / off based on like what menu you're on. Or with the state component, `bind-toggle__raycastable`. I always limit exactly to what should be raycastable because it's expensive. 

Explicit > implicit in this case, especially as it involves performance and visibility of objects is not always a determining factor.

But yeah, docs should be updated with best practices. Been building complex menus and have mastered the art of the raycaster. Not anymore without hacking the component, it's best practice and prescribed to control what is being raycasted. What I propose wasn't showing off (I'm not a wizard), it is simple. Rather than depending on what is somewhat an arbitrary condition (visibility) and doing `object3D.visible = false`, do either like `<a-entity data-no-raycast>` or `<a-entity data-raycastable>` with `objects: [data-raycastable]` or `objects: :not([data-no-raycast]`.

If you are depending solely on visibility, it sounds like the app has no system in place to toggle what is being raycasted, and your app is raycasting every single object, which is a killer for performance. I think that's just three.js behavior. Regardless, you should *always* define `objects`, and *never* depend on visibility. It is consistent if you ignore the case where you don't define objects because that should be done, or perhaps even required.  Yes, this is causes by a Chrome bug.

Thanks! @kevinsimper https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/dist/aframe-master.min.js @kevinsimper Did you get a chance to disable armModel? Does if work as you expect? Is not the native arm model already applied and passed to the gamepad pose?  +1 from me for providing a way of setting sRGB here. It should apply to `map` and `emissiveMap` but not other textures. See also: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3509. The alternative to this approach would be setting sRGB on `map` and `emissiveMap` _by default_, as well as `gammaOutput=true`, but that would make a lot of breaking color changes for 0.9.0. That sounds like too much pain, IMO.

Despite the three.js terminology, I would suggest naming this option `colorSpace` rather than `encoding`, and using `sRGB` and `linear` as the values. Thank you. @ncode congrats for your first PR. A few changes and this is ready to go. Hey @ncode, want to make a few changes? Thanks! The linter is also throwing some errors. @donmccurdy does this approach still look good? i don't have much experience with colorspace and encodings. This is still correct, but I think i'd prefer to do something at the scene level (like https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3757) rather than putting a setting on every component in the scene. If we merge the other PR we should be able to close this. Thanks @ncoder, we're going to go with a scene-level solution.  When using a headset you want to honor the user head rotation or it will cause disconfort. It’s a design decision. What’s your use case? You can try wrapping the camera entity in another entity and write a component to rotate it. The samsung S7 is not daydream compatible so Chrome is using the polyfill code path. I cannot reproduce the problem on the iPhone. exiting VR mode renables touch panning. @azmarte look-controls does not implement rotation on x axis. Are you using your own component? @azmartone My understanding is that your problem is not VR mode but after exiting VR mode. threejs controlling the camera in VR mode should not affect you. If you are loading A-Frame scenes in iFrames you have to adhere to the policies (https, allow attributes)

This breaks consistency because the approach won't work in VR mode when the pose of the camera is modified internally by the VRManager in THREE.  @machenmusik Any position and rotation in the entity will be overriden by THREE in VR mode. @machenmusik It's just a fact, I would ask three.js to provide an offset on the camera.

to those devices. Do you see any errors on the browser console? It sounds like a problem at the drivers level of your OS + device combo. Something might not be working at the shader level since it works for other OSs versions. Just curious. Is this THREE example rendering correctly: https://threejs.org/docs/scenes/material-browser.html#MeshStandardMaterial It seems the problem is deep in the guts of the OS / Drivers / Browser / WebGL
implementation. We cannot do much on the A-Frame side. I keep this issue open as a reference and to collect further info. If I have to bet is a problem with the shaders. The shader branch of the MeshStandardMaterial is hitting some bug in the OS / Device / Driver combo you have. @gabrielgrant Would you mind opening an issue on THREE.js too? No, I don’t the DB issue is related since also reproduces on THREE.js Let's wait and follow https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/14137. Not opposed to adding Lambert but there hasn't been much need for it, and there may be a simpler solution.

Does `material="flatShading: true"` (with standard shader, *not* the flat shader) make any difference here? As don said there has not been much demand for lambert. It would one more code path to maintain. It's a problem with the shader path for the standard material in THREE and your particular combo of device / OS / driver / firmware: 99% sure. Yeah, I was curious about `flatShading` because it compiles away one difference between standard and lambert but apparently that wasn't it..  Closing this temporarly to leave the issue for new contributors  Rather than removed it should be fixed since it's the example for embedded scenes  Can you do a sanity check locally? My bad. I meant the A-Frame examples: you do npm install && npm start and visit localhost:9000/examples I would go through all the examples to do a sanity check (not just the tests) since there are multiple things that can break. We are going to do a 0.8.2 minor release and it’s too risky. We will postpone bumping THREE until 0.9.0 but we can merge this into master after we cut 0.8.2 @arpu We will fix it. Can you work with your own build as a temporary solution? Point releases are for small fixes and bumping THREE is a big change that might introduce regressions and breaking changes in components. It's better to postpone to 0.9.0 to give time for regressions to surface. We can bump THREE on master right after 0.8.2 release so there's time to test it.

Thanks for info  Thanks!  `controllerconnected` should not fire with Touch if `gearvr-controls` is the only component in your entity  A-Frame 0.8.0 brings in some upstream fixes to THREE.GLTFLoader that are technically correct, but potentially inconsistent with existing scenes and examples. Pre-0.8.0, `gltf-model` assumed all textures were in linear color space — `material.color` and `material.src` still make this same assumption today. That's incorrect — images are usually sRGB, and the glTF spec explicitly requires color and emissive textures to use sRGB.

Following best practice:

1. Textures are converted `sRGB` -> `linear` at the beginning of the fragment shader if the image encoding is set to sRGB.
2. Renderer calculations are done in linear space.
3. Renderer output is converted `linear` -> `sRGB` for the screen if `renderer.gammaOutput=true`.

By default in A-Frame and three.js, `renderer.gammaOutput` is _false_ and step (3) never happens. As a result, glTF models look darker than they should. Textures using `material.src` look mostly right, because we don't set the encoding to sRGB, even though the images usually are sRGB. So the colors are being treated as linear in lighting calculations, which practically isn't very noticeable.

User **danilo** in Slack created this PDF, which illustrates the problem nicely:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BRdCU9nDzUHOfDYYXdbAV1cMW60Md6uv/view

I don't have any quick answers on what we should do here... in short, I think the three.js defaults assume some familiarity with color spaces, and ideally we would abstract this away from our users, or at least provide some best practices as a reference for users who are going to care about matching a color palette precisely.

If we _were_ to change our defaults, here's a straw proposal:

* [ ] By default, set `renderer="gammaOutput: true"`.
* [ ] By default, set `src` and `emissiveMap` both to sRGB encoding. Perhaps provide `srcColorSpace` and `emissiveColorSpace` to override this, but I think those properties would be an escape hatch to restore legacy behavior and not otherwise useful.

The one thing this doesn't fix is `material.color` values, which are assumed to be already linear in three.js, and don't have an encoding setting. So either (1) we could provide guidance about converting an sRGB hex code to linear, or (2) we would automatically do this in the `material` component.

I'm also not sure what this all means for vertex colors...

My vote for first step would be to add `srcColorSpace` and `emissiveColorSpace` in a PR, verify that it improves outcomes, and then enable them without changing any defaults. It would be nice to have feedback from someone more familiar with color spaces and/or rendering pipelines. 🙂
 Maybe an even more user-friendly option would be creating an option `renderer="colorSpace: sRGB"` that (1) sets `gammaOutput=true`, (2) sets `texture.encoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding` for diffuse and emissive maps, (3) automatically converts `material="color: <color>;"` from sRGB to linear space. This is a bit more complex, however, and user-land components would still need to convert any colors they create themselves. I recommend that we do all of the above except (3) in a future release.

- [ ] default to `gammaOutput=true`
- [ ] add `gammaFactor` property, default to 2.2 (_not_ 2.0)
- [ ] use `texture.encoding=THREE.sRGBEncoding` by default for diffuse and emissive maps

By doing all of these at the same time, we'll minimize broken scenes on upgrade — images and models should appear a bit less washed out, but not significantly darker or lighter. Directly given colors like `material="color: #f00"` will appear lighter than before, but I'm not confident about changing that default.

EDIT: Unity has some really nice references on the differences in lighting when using linear or sRGB colorspace: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LinearRendering-LinearOrGammaWorkflow.html For anyone stumbling across this issue before it gets fixed, here’s a hacky workaround to mark non-glTF images as sRGB:

```
sceneEl.addEventListener('loaded', function (e) => {
  sceneEl.object3D.traverse((o) => {
    if (o.isMesh && o.material.map)  {
      o.material.map.encoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding;
      o.material.needsUpdate = true;
    }
  });
});
```

Combined with `renderer=“gammaOutput: true”` on the scene, that should give consistent and correct colors for all images in the scene. One possible first step here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/compare/master...donmccurdy:feat-colorspace

With that branch, users may write the following:

```html
<a-scene color-space="sRGB" renderer="gammaOutput: true, physicallyCorrectLights: true">
  ...
</a-scene>
```

Result:

1. All color-related textures loaded by `gltf-model` componen will have correct colorspace. (already the case)
1. All color-related textures loaded by `material` component will have correct colorspace.
1. Lighting (from upcoming glTF extension) will have correct attenuation.
1. Output to screen will have correct colorspace.

But that's not a backward-compatible change for most scenes. Vertex colors and `material="color: #ff0000"`  properties will appear significantly lighter in this mode, and that's hard to automatically fix. I'd suggest we make a correct mode available, as above, recommend it for users who run into these issues, and work toward using it in our own examples.

Things I'm still not sure about:

1. Could `gammaOutput: true` be combined with the colorspace option? Maybe, but you might want to use colorspace _without_ gammaOutput if you're using post-processing, too.
2. Should colorspace be a property of the renderer? Also maybe, but the `renderer` component doesn't load until after all of the `material` components, so it would be kind of hacky to get the right data at the right time.
  This is a limitation of iOS. A website cannot enter fullscreen unless you add the page to homescreen.  Sorry for that. I just bumped the examples. Let me know if it does not work. Latest stable is very bad because people will copy the examples, start using it, and then when A-Frame updates, everyone's scenes will break instantly. Deploying examples also is more than the script versions, includes all of the modifications to examples + any new ones. @machenmusik FYI You can easily try the examples of any version: https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/examples/ (replace master with any tag or commit)
  @dsinni What do you think of this PR? Instead of looking for ```e.target.id```, you would look for ```e.detail.id```, and it will give you the id of the sound being loaded/ended, even if there are multiple sounds on the a-box.  Hi @Syedwaheed — For help, please use Stack Overflow or Slack. We use this issues list to track bugs and features. Additionally, when posting your question in either place, you will need to provide more information — code (or better, a demo) for what you've tried so far even if it's not working, and a clear description of what you're trying to do. The meaning of "frames" is not clear in your question.  The property side is part of the material component (https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/material.html#properties_side). It should be `material="shader: flat; src:#image; side: double"` Please reopen if this is still a problem   Hi @samrae7, please feel free! My feeling is that it should probably be a sub-property of the `material` component, like:

```html
<a-entity material="src: foo.png; blending: additive" />
```

where values are `none`, `normal`, `additive`, `subtractive`, `multiply`. I think it is OK to leave out three.js's "custom" blending modes for now.

@feiss does that sound reasonable for most use cases? https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3543  Thank you!  @vaibhav2203 Thanks for submitting. Can you describe what you are trying to accomplish with this PR?  Thanks! But this PR is invalid  When modifying `el.object3D.position` directly, incorrect/outdated TRS transforms are shown after calling `.flushToDOM()`. Not sure how much of a special case it's worth to fix this, but it would be nice for the debugging methods to work as expected here.

Example: https://jsfiddle.net/donmccurdy/gr2oo3um/ Ok no worries about the demo, I'm fairly sure it's 0.7 vs 0.8 causing the issue.  Thanks!  I restarted the tests Thanks!  This is a duplicate of https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3441 Thanks for filing When models do not appear, do you see network requests for them? Or any errors in the console?  try a-frame master, we removed the examples dir from the package and now pointing to three.js proper. perhaps it was trying to fetch all three.js repo.  It is a known constraint of THREE that it uses one eye Frustum for culling: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/13236 @omgitsraven commented on https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/13236  In your tick method try the following:
```javascript
var renderer = this.el.sceneEl.renderer;
var vrModeEnabled = renderer.vr.enabled;
renderer.vr.enabled = false;
renderer.render( this.surfaceScene, this.surfaceCamera, this.surfaceTarget );
renderer.vr.enabled = vrModeEnabled;
```  Will be fixed by https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3475 Fix merged, will be solved on next ~0.8.2 release.  Talking in Slack, for clarity the second code snippet with `movement-controls` is a red herring I think; that's aframe extras and no current release of aframe-extras works with aframe 0.8.0 yet. Extra details... we're talking about a vrprimus VA4 device, which has a joystick included.

Are you sure you don't need any other components but `look-controls` to get this working in 0.7.1? And the joystick moves the camera around, not just rotates it? I'm not sure how `look-controls` would have moved the camera in 0.7.1 unless this device is faking 6DOF pose or something... The master branch of aframe-extras may work now, with a syntax like this:

```html
<a-entity id="rig"
          movement-controls
          position="25 0 25">
  <a-entity camera
            position="0 1.6 0"
            look-controls="pointerLockEnabled: true"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

But the core issue is that i don't know whether this device's joystick is generating gamepad axis events, dpad events, MouseMove events, or something else. If it did in fact work with only `look-controls` before, then it may be faking MouseMove, in which case aframe-extras will not help — i'm relying on `look-controls` for mouse movement as well. 😐 Oh, to clarify, if it was just rotating the screen (and not moving the player) before then it was probably causing either mouse or touch events... I think aframe-extras is unrelated here sorry.  Thanks! Welcome as a contributor! 🥇  This PR is not merging for some reason. Github displays an error: `You can't perform that action at this time.` @jason90929 Can you please reopen to see if it solves the problem?  Thanks! Congrats for your first patch!  Please see https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/introduction/faq.html#can-i-add-links-to-my-scene and https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/link.html. We ask that questions and requests for help use Stack Overflow or Slack — this tracker is for bugs and feature discussion. And (to get helpful responses) you'll want to check those docs first and ask about parts you don't understand.  This is because the data is copied internally instead of holding a reference. The behavior you are getting it is what I would expect since type `array` in your schema is not the same as `Float32Array`. Was it automatically a typed array before, or only if `setAttribute` was called with a typed array?

Inclined to say the more consistent behavior in 0.8.0 is good, and we can recommend use of a custom property type definition where typed arrays are wanted. You can create your own `parse` and `stringify` property type definition.  Minor, but in logo clouds like this glTF ecosystem screenshot...

.... the A-Frame "logo" (I think that's just the title from the website?) sticks out a bit. Maybe we don't need a logo per se, but an official version of the title with nice padding would be good for branding situations like this. Might also be interesting to try condensing the 3D hero "A" from the homepage into a smaller icon.

PR any there if anyone wants to propose more.  This is because `DeviceMotionEvent.rotationRate` units have changed from degrees per second to radians on Chrome m66
 @RaoelHulst The fix that @jsantell has mentioned has shipped already. Update A-Frame to 0.8.2 @jsantell do you think we can close this issue? You can try to build yourself. Clone the repo, checkout v0.5.0 tag, update package.json, `npm run dist`. YMMV @jonwaterschoot With A-Frame 0.8.2 and Chrome m66?  Thank you! 🎉   @DigiTec Thanks for the fix and the test coverage. Much appreciated 👍  Thank you!  That's a known Chrome bug that will be fixed in m66. See https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3458 Closing as a duplicate.  Thanks for filing. For position, rotation and scale you can modify the object3D directly:
```
 entityEl.object3D.position.x = 5;
``` You can serialize to string with like component.stringify or AFRAME.utils.styleParser.stringify Thanks for filing. Unfortunately while this may suck, we can't provide that sort of API. If that means Elm won't work well with A-Frame, I think that's how it is. For the purposes of building VR applications, Elm is not strictly necessary, and we won't be bending A-Frame to fit Elm or existing Web tools built for 2D Web. Will be closing, but happy to discuss further! We're not going to introduce, support, and maintain multiple redundant APIs/codepaths to do the same thing. The example given so far was for position which is a simple case. There are hundreds of components that can each have dozens of properties. It's messy to attach a ton of random nested properties onto the element namespace. And setting component properties have massive side effects that should not be represented as a simple JS property change.

Frameworks and toy integrations are cool, but I rarely see these apps go beyond the constraints of placing basic shapes and models.  I merge and I'll add docs  Confirmed. @ngokevin, this is an indirect result of optimizations in #3250 — the `raycaster-intersected` event now only fires on _new_ intersections, meaning that `cursor` has outdated information when it fires a `click` event.

I think those changes to the `raycaster` API are reasonable; we shouldn't have events on every frame from the raycaster. What if we update `raycaster.checkIntersections()` to programmatically _return_ a copy of all current intersections, so that the `cursor` component can use recent coordinates? A further issue, in `cursor.onIntersection` we sort the intersections _in the current event_ and mark the nearest as active. if another nearer intersection is still active, it is incorrectly lost. See #3475.  Thanks!  Closing to consolidate these on a single issue: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3458  Thanks   Maybe an I-Frame would be better?  See: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3450 It fixes some long-standing bugs in which the camera's position would be "in the floor", or at 2x height, or drop into the floor after exiting VR etc., for various devices. Quite a lot of alternatives were looked at... see https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3327. 

We're aware it breaks some existing components, e.g. I'm in the process of updating aframe-extras to support the new VR API. But, I think the change is necessary. Could you look through the comments on 3327, especially https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3327#issuecomment-360019236, and see if this is workable for your case? The move toward having a camera "rig" and not just a raw entity is IMO positive, so I'd like to see if we can get contrib modules and documentation updated to match. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3451 provides (some) documentation, are there other updates you’d suggest? I've added this to an 0.8.X milestone in the hope we can improve documentation and update some examples. Another note, I've overhauled the controls in aframe-extras for 0.8.0 and documented them here: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/controls

^tl;dr `universal-controls` is now `movement-controls` and should be attached to a camera rig. The examples are probably similar to what other components should do as well. @mokargas do you mean using `look-at` to reorient the camera? Bit confused sorry. For `wasd-controls` and aframe-extras we'll need a way to get absolute rotation of the camera, haven't spent much time on that but `cameraEl.object3D.getWorldQuaternion()` seems like the place to start. > Probably a bit of a stretch to ask non-devs to discover if they are starting on v0.8 and install an updated look-at contrib or other contrib that requires camera rotation, but I'm not sure how to handle that.

Worth noting that this change is not strictly breaking billboarding, it was always true that `cameraEl.getAttribute('rotation')` returned only local rotation, and the camera might have been transformed by a parent. We've just begun _recommending_ use of a camera rig, which surfaces issues in components like `look-at` that didn't convert to world coordinate space.

But the main thing is to report bugs on the third-party components when they no longer work with current A-Frame. We try to avoid breaking backward compatibility but sometimes it is necessary.

I've proposed some new docs in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3498, but feel free to suggest more clarifications!  0.8.0 was hot fixed on the CDN with a couple of small patches so everybody benefits without having to bump versions. On npm though we cannot hot fix and had to bump the version number.  Confirmed. Looks we broke this with the major VRControls -> WebGLRenderer changes in #3152. From your [comment on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49387640/how-to-disable-tracking-position-in-aframe/49389033?noredirect=1#comment85794332_49389033) it looks like `hmdEnabled:false` functionality was lost with #3152 as well... thanks all!  @jeanmatthieud  this should be fixed on master now. Can you confirm? @Kezzsim On the A-Frame side we won't be able to work around all of the problems introduced on m65. We will have to wait till the fixes are deployed in m66 to have everything working as before. @FeralRizvi Update to 0.8.2 @Adilmar are you using 0.8.2 As far as I know phonegap goes behind in the chromium version they use. If they are behind m66 then the bugs introduced in m65 will remain until phonegap catches up. @Adilmar You're probably on Chrome m66 or on a version older than m65 that's why it works, right? Phonegap might be shipping a Chrome version affected by the bugs described in this issue.  @eggybot what phone?  Thank you and congratulations for your first PR! 🎉   Thank you. Good catch.  Thanks for the PR. We can now close this  FYI @meatwallace The fork we use in A-Frame is r90 + 1 cherry picked commit to fix a bug in the raycaster. The PR you opened if it lands will be available on THREE r92 that A-Frame will pick up in the next release. In the meantime you can build your own version of A-Frame as you did. I don’t think there’s any action we have to take on the A-Frame side. Thanks all for investigating this I bumped three to r93 in master. Two options to try:

- Point your script tag to https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/dist/aframe-master.js
- Point your package.json to `"aframe": "aframevr/aframe#8a203f475b3"`

Please let me know if the issue is solved. Is the issue still open in THREE then? Nice! Glad to hear that it got fixed in THREE r94.  Thank you!   You can do it in a parent entity because now threejs controls camera
rotation in VR mode.

 Proposed some wording: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3451  Thanks, I had been seeing this issue on page reloads. Yeah, initializing camera earlier somehow would be nice.

Shouldn't enter VR wait for the camera to initialize, and then try to call again in this case?  Can you do the enter VR but defer the setPoseTarget?

  Thanks! I think this is the same issue as https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3467, which should be fixed after https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3475.  Thanks! I'm not sure this is a FAQ or useful to know, don't want to make the FAQ too noisy. Unfortunately, will close this one as it's more of a nugget than an FAQ that simplifies to "josh named it". Thanks though!  Moving this to milestone 0.9.0 as the fix will require updating three.js. The alternative would be to include a patched version of `THREE.MTLLoader` without updating the rest of three.js. I think we should get 0.8.2 released without waiting for that, but would not be opposed to doing 0.8.3 with this fix if it seems urgent enough. +1 from me. I bumped THREE on master with the commit of the MTL loader fix. @wmurphyrd can you verify that it's working now? https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/5d30e926859cf31129b2a5b101db14bca0d78c13

@donmccurdy nice new gravatar picture 😎   Thanks for staying on top of postprocessing and make sure it still works. Rebase needed @wizgrav This is almost ready. Since the main use of the tock method is for post processing it makes sense to pass the camera as a paremeter. What do you think?  Yeah, it changed to `evt.detail` to not have to create an object. I will update the release notes / change log. Thanks!  The plane is rotated 90 degrees on the x axis so it's perpendicular to the camera. That's why it's not visible. The following works for me on Firexox (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/languid-scissor):
```
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.8.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="0 0 0" width="10" height="4" repeat="4 2" color="blue"></a-plane>
      <a-camera></a-camera>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```
We will reopen if it's still problem.  Thanks for filing!

Yeah, primitives are an abstract wrapper around `<a-entity>` where the `setAttribute` is the vanilla DOM `setAttribute`. That's why we'd recommend using `<a-entity>` for more serious work. Or living with the setTimeout. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be changing or making major changes to primitives to improve this.  Okay I will update the changelog to note the breaking changes and migration requirements. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/ea836cffe7a994882f17024e97d934ca2860be8e  Let's just keep all the strings and merge it.  Two work arounds:

1. If you are applying a color to the background use the background component on `a-scene`: https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/background.html#sidebar

2. You can build your own entity instead of using the `a-sky` primitive:

```
<a-entity material="src: #yourImage; side: back; shader: flat" 
                geometry="primitive: sphere; radius: 5000; segmentsWidth: 64; segmentsHeight: 32">
</a-entity>
``` @i3games The bug is fixed now on master and it will ship in the next A-Frame version. You can use the workarounds [described above](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3428#issuecomment-372076295) or use the master branch in your application (https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/dist/aframe-master.min.js) I've hot-patched the fix into 0.8.0. So check it now!  @dustinkerstein Thanks for the detailed info. 

So my understanding is that there isn't anything we can do on the A-Frame side and everything will work again once M66 ships. I leave this issue open as a reference and as a reminder to verify M66 when available.  Thanks foe filing. I suggest reopening this question on StackOverflow. We use issues for bugs and feature requests.  Thanks for filing. In these cases where you need to interact more with three.js, I'd just create the geometry you need in a component. Like...

```
AFRAME.registerComponent('my-box-geometry, {
  schema: {
    width: {default: 1},
    height: {default: 1},
    depth: {default: 1},
    vertices: {default: 8}
  },

  init: function () {
    var geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(data.width, data.height, data.depth);  // etc.
    var mesh = this.el.getObject3D('mesh');
    if (mesh) {
      mesh.geometry = geometry;
   } else {
     mesh = new THREE.Mesh();
     mesh.geometry = geometry;
     this.el.setObject3D('mesh')
   }
  }
});
``` Geometries aren't updated in A-Frame. They are recreated. If you receive an update to the geometry, update the mesh `mesh.geometry = newGeometry`. Oh, if you only need the segments properties. We would appreciate a PR to `src/geometries/box.js`! It would be a simple add. Sorry for the chase, I had mindset of doing most stuff in components so whenever I need something, I just make a component. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3426  Hi @paperkettle, thanks for the suggestion and student feedback 🙂 For one option there is a [`cube-env-map` component in aframe-extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/misc#cube-env-map).

> Allow gLTF & obj+mtl material overwrites from the material component

Somewhat related: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3155. This behavior is what a lot of people expect, and it would be nice if it could just work, but it's a pretty large change. I would be curious to see if it can be added (either part of `material` or a new component) that doesn't require maintaining duplicate copies of the schema.

> Is maybe premature given talk of [this possible extension](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/issues/946).

I'm not sure that would be ideal for A-Frame, as you wouldn't want to include a different `envMap` with everything model.

Another idea would be adding a property to the new `background` component:

```html
<a-scene background="visible: false; addEnvMap: true; src: url(...);"></a-scene>
```

^Assumes we update `background` to support a texture.... right now it only allows color. The component doesn't really need to deal with loading models, it can just listen for `object3dset` events and add `envMap`. Example here: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/99535cd878eb36cb25cdcda4a32a40eb248c990a/src/misc/cube-env-map.js It depends, but definitely there are lots of components that modify a model after it's loaded. If you use `object3dset` events for that, then you don't have to worry about what format the model was in.

Maybe A-Frame should have an `env-map`, maybe not, I'm not sure on that one. But in any case there will be many situations where you need a small component to modify a three.js object like that. :)  Thanks for filing. This is more appropriate for StackOverflow.

 Broken after three.js bumps

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/56dc163e23bec610c46506b22818a5ed84678b69

or 

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/5f196765f329b9478b75fb5a9f5620eb3302812f Yeah   You cannot enter vr automatically. it has to be triggered by user gesture like a mouse click. Forgot to say `thanks for filing`, sometimes things pile up and one needs to cut corners 🙂  Happy to wait for webvr-polyfill changes to fix this, since it is Chrome that have broken it from their side.  …method is called when they change. We were holding a reference and the deepEqual test was passing and the update method was never called (fix #3403)

-
 This fixes the problem but introduces extra object copies when instantiating `oldData`. I'm open to alternative solutions.  Yeah, need to think of another way. The perf hit isn't worth it (also using a Object.keys/forEach/fn creates an array and function over for...in).

I'd say create a method of the line component to accept updates. Assumingly this would be for `tick`ed changes, we wouldn't want to go thru `.setAttribute` in that case. Bare in mind we are already instantiating and copying properties to oldData. Strings, numbers, etc. It is allocated memory that is also eventually garbage collected. This patch makes also copies of plain object attributes. In practice the performance won’t change much.  The problem is not exclusive to line either but to all the component that have vector properties so a specific method to line will not fix the bug. The getAttribute flow often doesn't matter because for most entities, we never need to retrieve the data, only set. For example, it would be rare to want to retrieve the opacity of an animating button. If we set start/end points of a line and want to keep track, then can store those a in vector in component controlling the line.

The pos/rot/sca was a good perf improvement, with a minor fix on Inspector needed because Inspector was depending on componentchanged event, which also isn't a necessary API. I just simply told Inspector to update the panel when the handles are used. Performance is #1 priority IMO, because sites are unusable otherwise.

this commit should be fine, but worth nothing setAttribute has some overhead that should be avoided on frequent operations. @fernandojsg If this PR lands, what other inconsistencies are you worried about? If you modify obj/rot/scale via `setAttribute` componentchanged should fire normally as before. It is only when you modify the object3D directly (which is an advanced feature) that the `componentchanged` is not fired because you bypass the `setAttribute` code path. This should be ready to go. @fernandojsg There are no inconsistencies that I'm aware of. If you modify the object3D directly, `getAttribute` / `setAttribute` will work exactly as before. See example below on: https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/examples/showcase/anime-UI/

To get a good answer on StackOverflow you will have to provide code samples and more details about the different solutions / approaches you tried. https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-aabb-collider-component  Hi @CPSuperstore — before A-Frame has loaded, `getAttribute()` is just the [plain HTML .setAttribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute), which always returns a string. After A-Frame loads, it is changed to return a JavaScript Object that is much easier to work with. If you want to log the camera's rotation you should wait until the scene has loaded and then do one of these:

```js
var rot = el.getAttribute('rotation');
console.log( rot ); // { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }
alert( rot.x + ' ' + rot.y + ' ' + rot.z ); // "0 0 0"
```  We save the reference to those objects in the `component.data` and when modified externally and passed to `setAttribute` the comparison with the old value will return that old and new are equal and the update method won't be called. The strange thing is that we have not caught this bug before. Does it reproduce on 0.7.1?  How about 0.8.0?  Is not that the expected behavior? The height of the camera should apply automatically if you make the hud a child of it. If you add 1.6 then the hud will be at `1.6 + the height of the camera` as you described.

 Ok... but going back to what you were trying to accomplish. If you want to head lock entities they should be just children of the camera. Is not that working as expected? Just tested on Oculus and both cone and text are headlocked for me on https://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/QQJyXV @luiguild what device and version of A-Frame are you using?  Let's move the check, and we can merge, thanks!  Will redeploy.  Can someone translate :D ? Google translate hints a problem with click events on 3D models but that's everything I can extract  Good questions for Stackoverflow

1. see model docs
2. there's cursor="rayOrigin: mouse", otherwise no  `hand-controls` rotates the model a bit. It doesn't play well with laser-controls. 

Hand-controls are more for when you using pure 6DoF, laser-controls when you want support both 6DoF/3DoF. You can manually set the raycaster origin/direction in this case if you want to combine both.

It should feel right if you use pure laser-controls.

Tell me if this is not the case. Thanks! Yeah I think either copy/patching laser-controls is appropriate here since it's taking a path of combining with hand-controls. 

Can't set raycaster straight up because laser-controls will overwrite it on `controllerconnected` event. You could write a component that waits for laser-controls to set the raycaster, and then you overwrite that and set the raycaster.  pivot is deprecated, that's why you don't see in the documentation. We kept it around for the few that were still using it before removal. I don't recommend relying on it. @theraccoonbear It's better to use the scene graph to accomplish this. Example:

```html
<a-entity id="pivot" rotation="0 45 0">
  <a-box position="5 0 0"></a-box>
  <a-animation attribute="rotation"
               dur="10000"
               fill="forwards"
               to="0 360 0"
               repeat="indefinite"></a-animation>
</a-entity>
```  Thanks for getting this going! Could you remove `package-lock.json` from the PR? Curious how it got in, as it's on our `.gitignore` list. @greengiant83 not yet 🙂 I made several comments requesting some changes. Thanks for staying on top of it @greengiant83 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3394/files We may want to enforce that `orientationEl` be a descendant (or direct child?) of the controlled element. If we don't, there are some challenges and footguns:

```html
<a-scene>
  <a-entity rotation="0 90 0">
    <a-entity id="ctrl" rotation="0 -90 0"/>
  </a-entity>
  <a-entity id="sceneWrapper" rotation="0 45 0">
    <a-entity id="cameraRig" wasd-controls="orientationEl: #ctrl" rotation="0 -45 0">
      <a-entity camera/>
    </a-entity>
  </a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

Now obviously that's a _bad idea_ I'm showing above, but:

1. If we call `getAttribute('rotation')` on the `#ctrl` element, we're only getting its local transform.
2. If we call `setAttribute('rotation', rotation)` on the `#cameraRig` element, we're updating its local transform relative to a _different_ element's world transform. 
3. We could fix all of this in code by using `el.object3D.getWorldRotation()`, but there's a performance cost to calling `updateMatrixWorld()` that I wouldn't want to pay on every frame.

tl;dr — as nice as it would be to have a general solution for `orientationEl` isn't tied to a "camera rig" concept, we get into edge cases pretty quickly when using this feature for anything other than a camera rig. Better to limit our complexity for now, I think.

@dmarcos preference? My thought is to log warnings if this is used outside of a parent/child setup. Then, at most, we have to multiply `orientationEl`'s rotation by the `cameraRig`'s rather than going arbitrarily through the tree.

EDIT: Maybe we merge this to a branch and iron issues out in followup PRs? I guess that depends... do we want a faster path than `getWorldRotation()` if the camera is a child of the rig? What if the camera is a descendant of the rig at depth N > 1? Assume we want for the rig's movement in world space to be in the direction of the camera's heading in world space.

IMO, we should be opinionated. This gets complicated and slow for anything beyond a simple parent/child camera rig, so for now I would restrict what we attempt to support. Even with the basic rig we still have to handle the case where the rig is rotated independently, which isn't in this PR yet. I'm fine adding a warning for now. We can polish the API for 0.9.0. I have a couple of ideas to create an `<a-entity player>` or `<a-entity avatar>` component to simplify everything. FYI, I have updated aframe-extras (master branch) to do pretty much what we're trying to add to `wasd-controls` here. [Docs](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/controls). It might be nice to converge on similar behavior. The syntax i've used is:

```html
<a-entity id="rig"
          movement-controls
          position="25 0 25">
  <a-entity camera
            position="0 1.6 0"
            look-controls="pointerLockEnabled: true"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

Where `movement-controls="camera: [camera]"` is the default binding. I'm trying to be pretty narrow about the camera rig use case, rather than a general "steer any object with any other object" type of thing. Haven't implemented proper handling of a rotated rig yet, going to leave that for future work. Remaining issues here: 

- [ ] Are we OK with the `orientationEl` naming? I slightly prefer either `heading` or `camera` but realize I'm bikeshedding now. Also, we haven't used the `*El` suffix elsewhere that I know of, e.g. raycaster uses `objects` rather than `objectEls`. 
- [ ] Need some basic handling for a rotated rig. If no one gets to it first I'll make the change in aframe-extras and then share a suggested implementation here. Is it necessary because you either using motion controllers, or you are using WASD, not both at once, so it's not needed to move the whole camera rig with WASD. WASD moving the camera seems sufficient. Other use cases? See discussion in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3351, but yeah, technically this may not be critical... If I move around with WASD before connecting an HMD you'll be teleported back to the origin, so that's a bit unpolished, but not a huge issue. 

FWIW I've thrown out the rotation parts of `universal-controls` to just focus on locomotion, renamed to `movement-controls`, so it can be used alongside `look-controls` now. Depends explicitly on a camera rig setup. I don't know if that should influence our recommendations here. I'd like to steer people toward using a camera rig, and it makes that easier if `wasd-controls` exemplifies it.

But since nothing is technically broken now, maybe we should take this off the 0.8.x milestone and leave it to decide for 0.9.0?

**EDIT** Moved this to 0.9.0.  Try https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation We've deprecated a-animation. Try https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation and file issues, and component will be merged in in the future.  Thanks!  I do not have Oculus Go to test. How is the Oculus Go controller. @frankolivier Does it have the same buttons than the regular GearVR remote? @mkeblx What do you propose to use instead of the string to discriminate between controllers and properly map buttons to actions? I don't have an Oculus Go to test on. @DigiTec Could you verify if Oculus Go is working now on 0.8.0? Thank you Oculus Go landed on master a couple of weeks ago. It will ship with the next A-Frame version. If you want to play with it now you can use a master build: https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/dist/aframe-master.js
An example of responsive controls can be found here: https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/examples/test/laser-controls/ @machenmusik  https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/examples/test/laser-controls/  I think this example should remain "pointlight", registering "light" will throw an error as it's already defined. The intention here is to show how a user could create a new component for their particular needs. Maybe `area-light`, using `new THREE.RectAreaLight( 0xffffff, undefined,  2, 10 );`, would be a better example since that's not already provided by A-Frame? @donmccurdy is correct. Thanks for submitting @polygontwist You might have got confused with object3D named `light` which can be different than the component name. The example illustrate how to add / remove object3Ds on a custom component and it is named `pointLight` so it does not collide with the built in `light` component in A-Frame.    **Description:**

 Thanks! The fonts in aframe-fonts would need to be updated too, they are generated from https://github.com/Jam3/msdf-bmfont, which is still using the old msdfgen version. Users reporting issues because of that: https://github.com/etiennepinchon/aframe-fonts/issues/1#issuecomment-352407302

I'm hoping my little web app can help out here, and let you generate just the character set you need (especially necessary for chinese users), but i need to [iron out some issues](https://github.com/soimy/msdf-bmfont-xml/issues/21) first. So, probably won't want to change the default for 0.8.0 I don't think.  +1 for mentioning this, although I might clarify it a bit:

> When using PNG images as cutouts or masks (where part of the image should be fully transparent, and the rest fully opaque), use `transparent=false` and set `alpha-test` to something like 0.5. @js-d-coder This almost ready. Are you incorporating the changes that @donmccurdy suggested? Would also use `material="alphaTest: 0.5"` versus the primitive form. Will address comments in follow up commit.  @johnshaughnessy Thanks! Have you tried the track-controls example to check that the hand animations still work as expected? wfm. Doesn't change the behavior much, but I guess this is more correct.  Wireframe material and look-controls should not affect each other. Can you share code that illustrates your problem?  I usually have most of my components have an enabled property that I flip on/off if I want to say turn off the tick handler or return early from event listeners. Then how those are flipped are up to the application. Perhaps try as a third party component and see how it goes.  I think this is a sufficient place to put it. If it becomes outdated, won't be too bad, and someone will probably fix it. Thanks! 👍   I've removed the angle pieces. thanks!  Use `shader: flat` or `shader="flat"` for some devices with i guess older/weird chipsets  @meatwallace Make sure you do `npm install` when using master because the `three` version pointed by the `package.json` has changed. @dmarcos The dist is built by the bot on each commit (whether using via the rawgit or npm), so the three.js version is up to date if they use master). Console says three Version: github:dmarcos/three.js#r89fix I think a workaround is to wrap the camera children in another entity. Does that work? @Plaritxu Have you tried with master?  @meatwallace Sweet! Thanks for veryfing.  Thanks! Congrats for your first PR. 🥇 
  @acm0055 Thanks. this is not A-Frame specific, it is how DOM APIs work. In order to set an attribute you need to pass a value: `el.setAttribute(“click”, “”) / el.setAttribute(“click”, {}`  Can you share a link with the before and after? Have you tried `0.7.1`? The componentchanged event was throttled in 0.6.0 onwards. Instead, use a tick handler to read rotation changes. You should be reading every frame because the camera rotation always changes in VR.

I've edited my answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38907857/how-to-listen-to-changes-in-the-rotation-of-the-camera-in-a-frame  No. What is your use case? The way to insert logic in the render loop in A-Frame is via the [tick, tock](https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/core/component.html#tick-time-timedelta) methods of components. Github issues are for bugs and feature requests. Please, use [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aframe) or the [slack channels](https://aframe.io/community/#slack) for questions  iPad and iPhone work fine. I don't have access to any Windows Tablet / Samsung Tablet to test. The only thing I can think of is the lack of DeviceMotion API available in the browsers running in your tablets. Does this example work? https://webvr.info/samples/03-vr-presentation.html?polyfill=1

You can add a vertical scrolling by writing your own component that implements the feature. Possibly related: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3427 "scrolling" as in camera rotation, you can modify look-controls to allow it.

"scrolling" as in 2D page, you can set `<a-scene embedded="true">`  merged  Hadn't seen this before; that's awesome — thanks! Would be awesome if the Vimeo React component was available as an A-Frame component. You'd still be able to use it from aframe-react like `<Entity vimeo={{url: 'blah'}}>`  Currently the `text` component supports only a single texture page. For chinese characters, even the most common ~1000 characters require 40 texture pages using an msdf bmfont generator. 

Related: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/text.js#L209-L211

Here is a zip with what should be the most common 1000 characters, in the Microsoft YaHei font:

[yahei.zip](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/files/1666534/yahei.zip)


```
npm install -g msdf-bmfont-xml

# simple test
msdf-bmfont -f json yahei/yahei.ttf -i yahei/charset-test.txt --pot --square

# 1000 characters
msdf-bmfont -f json yahei/yahei.ttf -i yahei/charset-1000.txt --pot --square
```

Related: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3343 As long as I keep the charset small, this method does work:

![screen shot 2018-01-25 at 7 46 54 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1848368/35424446-8d2b6d9a-0208-11e8-896f-eec3f7e3eb61.png)

Should also point out that those 1000 characters are 2.4 MB in this format, so users may still need to generate these fonts specially for each scene unfortunately. That sounds like a good option. Anyone have thoughts on whether:

1. canvas can be a fallback option within the `text` component
2. a second text component should be available in A-Frame
3. we should add an FAQ entry about options for intl text, linking to outside components like [aframe-canvas-text](https://github.com/ejeinc/aframe-canvas-text) and [aframe-text-geometry-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-text-geometry-component)

SDF is the default now because it is performant and looks nice, but it is unfortunately harder to use with some languages. > Apparently, game devs generate fonts with the exact characters needed for a given script. I'm not sure if supporting every character is feasible.

Hm yeah that sounds realistic. It would be nice to have a web-based tool where you can autogenerate that JSON for some common free fonts automatically, with your own charset. Unfortunately getting `msdf-bmfont-xml` running on the cloud seems to be a bit inconvenient. :/ I've put together a little web tool for generating these MSDF fonts. It will support special characters correctly, and you can provide your own fonts if you wish.

^note, this requires the `negate: false` setting on A-Frame's `text` component, which is only available on the master branch and will be released with 0.8.0. Will have http://msdf-bmfont.donmccurdy.com/ be the soluton?  Note that antialiasing is a setting you can control, have you tried putting `antialias="true"` on the scene? see also https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2666, i'm not sure where/if it is documented how antialiasing behaves by default. 

Also I suggest checking the model against a "just threejs" viewer like https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2666, as Sketchfab's viewer is highly customized and will not necessarily match our results.

There are also some z-fighting artifacts in all versions, but those are part of the model itself. We prioritize performance over visual fidelity. That’s why antialiasing is disabled by default. Sketchfab is a single model viewer with limited interactivity so they can make different choices.  `antialias="true"` does force it, you may be seeing just low resolution for other reasons? see https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill/issues/273 and https://github.com/immersive-web/cardboard-vr-display/issues/7 ...there are some issues on Samsung phones, manually setting resolution in phone settings may help.  Can you share a link to your example? What browser / OS?  After #3327, it will often be preferable for `wasd-controls` to move the camera rig rather than the camera itself, relative to the camera heading. Similar to `teleport-controls`, we should add a `cameraRig` property to enable this:

```html
<a-entity id="cameraRig" position="25 100 25">
  <a-entity id="head" camera position="0 1.6 0" look-controls wasd-controls="#cameraRig;"></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls="cameraRig: #cameraRig; teleportOrigin: #head;"></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls="cameraRig: #cameraRig; teleportOrigin: #head;"></a-entity>
</entity>
``` Instead of coding this in the component I would provide examples where we use the camera rig pattern. The controllers and camera wrapped in an entity where the wasd-controls is applied:
```
<a-entity id="cameraRig" position="25 100 25" wasd-controls>
  <a-entity id="head" camera position="0 1.6 0" look-controls></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls="cameraRig: #cameraRig; teleportOrigin: #head;"></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls="cameraRig: #cameraRig; teleportOrigin: #head;"></a-entity>
</entity>
``` The problem with this pattern is that `wasd-controls` will always move in the `-Z` direction when pressing <kbd>W</kbd>, rather than matching the `#head` element's heading. An alternative to the `cameraRig` selector would be a `camera` selector to specify the element used to determine heading. How about this as proposed syntax, then:

```html
<a-entity id="cameraRig" position="25 100 25" wasd-controls="camera: #head">
  <a-entity id="head" camera position="0 1.6 0" look-controls></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls="cameraRig: #cameraRig; teleportOrigin: #head;"></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls="cameraRig: #cameraRig; teleportOrigin: #head;"></a-entity>
</entity>
```

The `camera` selector could default to `''` (for current element). The position of the camera will be overridden with the headset position, hence the need of a camera rig But the position of the camera is saved when entering VR and restored when exiting so you should get your `0 1.6 0` back  I have not tried that specific example but https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/tracked-controls/ works fine for me on a Razer Blade 13" with also NVIDIA driver 388.59 My windows version:

![winver](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/291D3U1R1c1e221W3a1b/Image%202018-01-23%20at%201.57.37%20PM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=222920&v=d97ece4d) I'm closing this since it seems it is not specfic to A-Frame. We will reopen if there's any action to be taken on the A-Frame side.  Does it work on a regular browser on the Amazon Fire? You will have to figure out how to access to the browser console for phonegap and see if there are any errors. I don't know much about Phonegap and I don't have access to an Amazon Fire phone. I'm closing this since I'm unable to reproduce. We will reopen if there's additional information  I’m not 100% sure what it is the problem this solves. When you pull entities from the pool you can position them wherever you want. In the case of bullets you pull an entity from the pool, place it at the tip of the gun and animate it. The application has full control where the entities are placed. There is also the renderOrder parameter from Object3D for finer control: https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Object3D.renderOrder I would let content manage the position of the entities. The main problem of this PR is that it couples the internal data structure of the pool with the public API. The pool contract should be just `give me an available entity if any` / `return this entity to the pool`. External code should not care if there's a list, stack or any data structure internally. If that data structure changes the public API breaks. I think the proper solution is just position the entities so they stack in the order you need.  @ngokevin What do you think here?  **Description:**

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 I'm still skeptical about pointer lock by default. With pointer lock you need content to provide gaze based or alternative selection mechanisms while a cursor based raycaster is probably the best solution and not compatible with pointer lock. With respect to my personal workflow. Developing and testing is a worse experience than before since I have to hit `Esc` continuously to unlock my cursor. I would disable the pointer lock for development purposes.

In production, I think providing a reticle-based raycaster is best, how most games do it. Before, mouse drag and mouse-based raycaster was conflated, sometimes you'd want to drag the camera, but accidentally interact with the scene. The mindset you approach a game is totally different than the expectations when you are browsing the Web. The screen real estate is shared with other elements like 2D elements in the Web site or the browser URL or tab bars that pointer lock makes harder to interact with. When you launch a game you are fully committed to it and are not expected to multitask in the same way you do when browsing the Web. The conflation between drag and mouse based raycaster could be solvable by delaying a bit the clicks to see if they are followed by a drag movement. Ultimately, A-Frame is focused in VR and the 2D mode is not the expected primary mode of interaction with content. It is more like a preview mode.

Pointer lock makes development and casual Web browsing more tedious. It optimizes for exclusive long sessions interacting with a specific piece that I do not think it will be the general case in the Web as it is in more traditional games. For development purposes I do not always have control of the different experiences I have to debug / test or QA. The fact that pointer lock will be the default makes it harder. I agree, I don't think pointer lock improves the experience when viewing panoramas or 360 videos. > The mindset you approach a game is totally different than the expectations when you are browsing the Web.

> Ultimately, A-Frame is focused in VR and the 2D mode is not the expected primary mode of interaction with content. It is more like a preview mode.

I think the fact that A-Frame is focused on immersive VR means that sharing screen real estate with other 2D elements is not a primary use case, and so the fact that tab bars are harder to interact with isn't high-priority. I also agree that pointerlock is not preferable for panoramas or 360º videos. But for example in an immersive social VR experience where users on desktop 2D want to look around and feel present alongside users in VR, I think that pointerlock is a good improvement, more like a traditional video game experience.

But yeah I'm completely fine with setting `pointerLockEnabled=false` by default, as long as the option is there and we don't have to tell users to re-implement `look-controls` I'm happy. :) @donmccurdy Yeah, I'm happy with keeping the code. The controversy is only on which mode should be the default. Ok, let's set `pointerLockEnabled` to `false` by default.

When `pointerLockEnabled` is manually turned on, should we also ignore the setting if `utils.device.checkHeadsetConnected()` returns true? Can't use `sceneEl.is('vr-mode')` since that also fires in fullscreen mode... Any better indicators? Yeah I have a branch with that. I'm OK with it false by default. Well all I have is:

```
+    if (this.data.pointerLockEnabled && !this.pointerLocked &&
+        !(this.el.sceneEl.is('vr-mode') && utils.device.checkHeadsetConnected())) {
```

Have not written tests yet Looks about right 👍  The default fonts don’t come with chinese glyphs. You need to use a font that comes with them. This project contains all the google fonts: https://github.com/etiennepinchon/aframe-fonts
I don’t know if any comes with chinese characters. It would be nice if someone finds one and makes it available for the community. Someone has to process them to be used as SDF fonts.  See: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3355 I've put together a little web tool for generating these MSDF fonts. It will support special characters correctly, and you can provide your own fonts if you wish.

^note, this requires the `negate: false` setting on A-Frame's `text` component, which is only available on the master branch and will be released with 0.8.0.  Could you test your code with A-Frame master branch? There have been some fixes related to this. Is it possible that you're seeing the same thing as #3276? Should work now, try it out on master.  @takahirox Thanks! Nice to see back here 👍   I cannot see any problem in the provided screnshot. Do you have an alternative one  that shows the issue more clearly? It's hard to see if you don't have a frame of reference for what the scene should look like. I've drawn a circle around the artifacts in this example: 
![inkedsticky_li](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10034859/35186869-06e7e3e2-fde1-11e7-9995-b5217ac0694d.jpg)

@scheerio is your scene using aframe-environment-component? I'm not sure, but I think the issue might be limited to when that component is in use
  I would try `json-model` and `object-model` from aframe-extras first: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/loaders

I think that `object-model` should work. You can also export glTF from the three.js editor.

Registering new geometry types, as shown here, is likely to be a bit harder.  Hm I see. Yes if the goal is not just to load a JSON model, but also have it work with the `material` component, then being able to use `registerGeometry` to create a geometry type that loads custom models would be helpful.

Creating JSON models is its own problem (the three.js editor isn't really a modeling tool, and the three.js Blender exporter has a lot of open issues) but maybe a similar thing could also work for more common formats.

The reason this doesn't work, I think, is that the geometry system expects `this.geometry` to be set during the `init()` call, and so asynchronous loading isn't possible:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/2fe545627f8487475b2be80c99f91a585cb93a92/src/systems/geometry.js#L92-L107

If we could make that asynchronous it would allow this, but might also affect how materials are applied etc., so maybe not a small change. Would be curious to see a PR implementing it if you have time. :) Can have as a component, just skip the registerGeometry API  Cool thanks! Can you add a hover effect on the elements to emphasize you can interact with them using the mouse? Thanks! Congrats for your first PR  @meatwallace Thanks for investigating.  Is there any action to be taken on the A-Frame side here?  I can't reproduce the problem on iPhone X or Desktop (Firefox / Oculus) with the provided steps and example: https://glitch.com/~private-scent  Fixed this in #3201 Closing now! Sorry, I'm a bit late on this.  Thank you! 🎉 You're probably the last new contributor of 2017. Happy new year! 🥇   Yeah, I think this is a bit difficult to do with an all-HTML API... perhaps there could be a single manager exposed on the `<a-scene>` or `<a-assets>` object, and `*-model` components can be changed to reuse that? This would make some other things easier like displaying a loading bar, too. For the drag-and-drop use case, which is a bit trickier to implement, developers could do something like:

```js
var manager = sceneEl.manager;
manager.setURLModifier((url) => url.replace('foo', 'bar'));
```  Instead VRManager from THREE does update the pose applying always `standing` coordinates so a user height is always present in the pose: defaulting to 1.6 in the case of 3DOF headsets.
 r- as is

This stacks the Vive's absolute pose in the room on top of a defined 1.6m on the camera rig. Resulting in being way too high up. This PR adapts to the changes proposed to the THREE VRManaged in https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/13158 Tested on:

- [x] Oculus Rift
- [x] Windows MR
- [x] Vive Shouldn't the non-VR mode user offset logic remain? We want a 1.6m (or configurable) user height on 2D mode, but when entering VR, use the headset pose.

See `laser-controls` is on the ground on desktop:

<img width="1153" alt="screen shot 2018-01-23 at 3 18 00 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/674727/35306010-a554eb3a-0050-11e8-96df-45a60ec9a247.png">

If we try to add `position="0 1.6 0"` to the camera rig, then in VR, the height will be too high. @ngokevin It is up to you to put the camera where you want in 2D mode. You can just place the camera where you want. You don't need a camera rig. The default A-Frame camera is placed at 1.6m already for people they don't want to mess with it @ngokevin Look at `tracked-controls` as an example r+

Can you dump some knowledge here for future reference? Everything about the sitting to standing transform, how the camera is handled internally by three.js, etc. The code is now much simpler than before. The camera pose is managed completely by THREE and you will always have a user scale height: Either the one coming from the VRDevice sensors or a 1.6m default otherwise. The use of sittingToStandingTransform can be safely ignored by A-Frame. All poses coming from VRDevices are normalized to `standing mode`. In other words, the camera height will always be relative to the ground: measured by the tracking system, inferred by the headset user configuration or default to 1.6m in the case of 3DOF headsets.  I updated the commit comment to reflect what this PR ended up doing that it is different that the original camera rig approach. By normalizing to `standing position` it is still possible to provide a camera rig to move the user around like for instance the teleport component. Lots of questions about how to use this now. 😅 If camera pose is handled by THREE for 6DOF, I don't see any code here that would set the camera's position back onto the entity ... How do I look up the user's position in the scene? And how would components like `teleport-controls` move the player from some current position to, say, a target position at a different elevation?

In `tracked-controls/index.html` example I see:

```html
<a-entity position="0 1.6 2" camera look-controls wasd-controls></a-entity>
```

Please correct me on any of this that is wrong:

1. For 2D devices, camera height is `1.6` and that's configurable through the `position` component.
2. For 3DOF devices, camera height is `1.6` and that's __not__ configurable because it's hard coded in WebVRManager.
3. For 6DOF devices, camera position is handled by THREE, and is entirely independent of the starting position placed on the camera entity? Or it reflects initial `position.x` and `.z` but not `.y`? Magic, in 0.8.0 you don't need to do `el.setAttribute('position')` you can modify directly `el.object3D.position.set()` and you will get back the correct value when doing `el.getAttribute('position')`. The same goes for the rotation. THREE updates the pose on the entity.

To move the user around you just create a camera rig that you move around. `teleport-controls` is moving to a camera rig model already (https://github.com/fernandojsg/aframe-teleport-controls/blob/master/examples/mesh/index.html#L44)

```
<a-entity id="cameraRig">
  <a-entity camera look-controls></a-entity>
  <a-entity hand-controls="left"></a-entity>
  <a-entity hand-controls="right"></a-entity>
</entity>
```
To position the camera in 2D mode you just position the camera:
```
<a-entity position="0 1.6 0"></a-entity>
````
The position is saved when entering VR mode and restored when exiting. The A-Frame default camera already sets the height to 1.6.

For 3DOF devices the height is 1.6 by default. Not configurable but you can move up and down the user with a camera rig if necessary.


 Thanks to @arturitu for testing on:
- [x] Chrome on Daydream
- [x] Oculus Browser on GearVR
- [x] Internet Browser on GearVR Ok, I think this all sounds good but just to clarify....

```html
<a-entity id="cameraRig" position="25 100 25">
  <a-entity id="head" camera position="0 1.6 0" look-controls></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls="cameraRig: #cameraRig; teleportOrigin: #head;"></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls="cameraRig: #cameraRig; teleportOrigin: #head;"></a-entity>
</entity>
```

Means that...

1. The "floor" is essentially at y=100, so if my height is 1.51 meters in a 6DOF device the `#cameraRig` position will be left alone, but the `#head` position will change to `0 1.51 0`, for a cumulative world position of `25 101.51 25`.
2. If I need the position of the player relative to the scene floor (e.g. for nav mesh stuff) I'll use `cameraRigEl.object3D.position`
3. If I need the position of the player's head, I'd use `cameraEl.object3D.getWorldPosition()`
4. Teleport controls will move the rig, not the camera, and most community components should do the same.
5. The cameraRig can safely be rotated around the Y axis but probably users shouldn't change pitch/roll.
 @donmccurdy correct to all of the above 😄  Ok, LGTM. 👍

Other thoughts: 

1. `wasd-controls` should probably either offer a `cameraRig` or `cameraEl` property, so that it can move the rig but set direction according to the camera heading.

2. I might delete a lot of the rotation-related stuff from `universal-controls`, and focus only on components that affect position instead... so for example components like `touch-` `checkpoint-` and `gamepad-controls` will move the rig around but will leave rotation to the `look-controls` component. That way things are less complicated for everyone and I can focus on things like navmesh traversal rather than these userHeight issues. 😅 @donmccurdy Can you file an issue for the `wasd-controls` property to indicate a camera rig? 

Rotation composition is tricky 😄  Thanks everybody for your help on this PR. I got stuck for a while unable to make a decision I would feel comfortable with.  Is it [this model](https://sketchfab.com/models/1a9db900738d44298b0bc59f68123393) from sketchfab? It may be that the specular glossiness PBR materials don’t support shadows yet. Hm, yeah here's a live demo showing the lack of received shadows pretty clearly: https://bug-gltf-specgloss-shadows-lbxbxojcha.now.sh/

/cc @takahirox any idea if this is something we can patch in the spec/gloss ShaderMaterial? Oops just saw your comment above. I'll open a new issue on three.js for the spec/gloss issue then. Filed: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/12980 Yeah, metal/rough is the core default but all the Sketchfab exports use spec/gloss so we do try to support it. It's just harder to implement in three.js so there are some edge cases like this.  Sweet! Thanks 👍  Doc tests failing. It complains about the link to `setAttribute` Thanks 🎉   Do the examples in the website work for you? https://aframe.io/examples/ If they work good for you. That's probably an issue specific to `ar.js` that it seems to be what you are using. I suggest filing an issue on https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js  Sorry, I cannot understand 🙂 Is this PR made by accident? Is it spam?

 What about making `background` not a default component, which effectively defaults to transparent. If developer wants a color, they can then set `background.color`. If want transparent, then don't set. At the moment, it defaults to a dark/black, which I'm not sure about. @ngokevin it defaults to black. You usually don't want a transparent background to start with.  Thanks!  The geometry of text when used with A-Frame is usually a plane/box which is more appropriate to call the compute bbox on, and it won't match the precise bounds of the text anyways since it can be longer than the text.

I use a formula `totalWidth = data.value.length * (data.width / data.wrapCount)`

The TextGeometry is probably created by the `three-bmfont-text` which is sort of a black box, and can't do much about that. Related: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system/issues/74  This should be fix on the A-Frame side. I have a PR to fix this that introduces a camera rig to set the height of the user instead of using `stageParameters` in similar way than the THREE examples
    There's a `test.only` left to remove and this is mergeable:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3310#discussion-diff-157641487R69 You're right! The Github PR conversation is not the best to keep track of updates.

 @antoniohof thanks for investigating. Is there a way to crate an `isCordova()` function to detect the scenario and the condition to the if statement. Feel free to open a PR.  🙏 Thanks  **Description:**

The first `updateSchema` call to determine whether the schema needs to be changed.

The second `updateSchema` call to build data with the new schema.

We need to find another or more performant way of doing this. It can become expensive in common cases if you are animating `material.color` or `material.opacity`. Perhaps limit `updateSchema` to check only on one property (as we use it for now), and switch the schema from there, to only call build data once. Right now, `updateSchema` can update based on a variety of factors, which is overkill.

I recommend raycaster should be checked every frame so that interactions are responsive. Otherwise they can feel delayed or laggy, impacting the perceived performance.

**Changes proposed:**
- Remove default raycaster 100ms throttle.

  This is not a bug or an A-Frame specific question. You have to either wait for the scene document to load or put your script at the end of the page in order for the elements to be ready to query. Glitch example: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/incredible-risk?path=index.html:20:32  Reports that this can be fixed with `material.side` = `back`. Perhaps the negative Z scale thing isn't working out anymore? We bumped A-Frame to THREE.js r89 a couple of days ago. Is this still a problem? Yep, it seems to reproduce on master. https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/12787

 On the branch, not on stable. The warnings are from the custom color animation code of that example, but not related to the text not appearing. Commit was for being able to get rid of VREffect and use three.js's more performant VR renderer. It could be the case that it's an intentional change on three.js part, we need to investigate the exact issue and determine from there (perhaps three.js bisect).

I have two cursors, one with `rayOrigin: entity` on the controller, and one with `rayOrigin: mouse`. The controller has an event listener on `mouseenter`, and it is somehow getting triggered whenever the mouse cursor hovers over anything.

Entities that are excluded by `raycaster.objects` can be reported as an intersected entity if they are a child of a selected entity. It makes sense that descendant meshes are included in the raycaster's search, but I would expect that the the parent which is specified in `objects` would be reported as the intersected entity in the `raycaster-intersection` event so that the reported intersections are exclusively with entities specified in `objects`

 Note that the “position” attribute in these BufferGeometries has only X/Y, it’s not local Cartesian coordinates. That’s also breaking physics components. 🙃

https://github.com/Jam3/three-bmfont-text/blob/master/index.js#L77  You need to have a VR headset connected on desktop or run it on a smartphone. Closing since this is not an bug or a feature request.  The change coming with r88 can be patched in via:

```js
sceneEl.addEventListener('model-loaded', function (e) {
  e.detail.model.traverse(function (node) {
    if (node.isMesh) {
      if (node.material.map) node.material.map.encoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding;
      if (node.material.emissiveMap) node.material.emissiveMap.encoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding;
    }
  });
});
```

An effect of that will be that textured glTF models look darker. We can offset that by adding `renderer.gammaOutput=true`, which arguably should be the default anyway. The obstacle would be that `renderer.gammaOutput=true` will make existing scenes look brighter, so it's not fully backwards compatible. Compare these effects by dragging glTF models into https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/ and turning gammaOutput on or off.

I don't think we need a special one-off build with r88, since developers can opt into the sRGB texture encoding change easily, but when we do update we'll need to decide how to handle it for correct rendering vs backward compatibility. A-Frame has upgraded to r89dev. Couple things to fix, but tracking in other issues. Proposed fix in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3424. Encoding on `.map` and `.emissiveMap` will be handled by `gltf-model` and `THREE.GLTFLoader` already, so you'd just need to set `gammaOutput` for the correct result:

```
<a-scene renderer="gammaOutput: true" />
```

In retrospect it should likely have been true by default (same applies to three.js actually) but it will cause people grief if we change the default now. Consider that later on?  Does this reproduce in master (and do you still get the truncated ray) or with v0.6.0? There are several issues with the 0.7.x raycaster and cursor that have been resolved It sounds like the same thing is happening on all versions. v0.7.0 just has an issue where the line never shortens.

Could you try adding `"objects: [test]" to your raycasters? They may be colliding with each other's rays lines or with their own controller model as the current config in your example enables collisions on everything.  Did you ever try setting `raycaster.near`? I think I mentioned that on slack but  I'm not sure if you noticed it. That should help if the problem is colliding with the controller model itself. Could test that (using `near` instead of `objects`) and report back? If it helps, maybe we could suggest it be added to the default `laser-controls` config. 

However, it's never going to be perfect without setting the `objects` property because the rays will collide with each other's lines. @ngokevin it looks like we have an issue with the `laser-controls` raycaster colliding with its own controller model on Oculus Touch such that no ray will appear. Would you consider a PR to `laser-controls` to set `raycaster.near` to a small value by default to prevent this?  There are some plans in the roadmap for supporting spectator cameras, which might affect the concept of an "active" camera. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/ROADMAP.md

In the meantime, I don't think there is any technical policy - multiple active cameras won't work, and is not guaranteed to have reliable results.  The last to initialize would be the one that wins. It should be deterministic but I don’t know without trying what the order would be. As @donmcurdy pointed out I would not encourage having multiple cameras active simultaneously. Not sure if there’s anything actionable here. Closing it for now.  Does the laser-controls example work for you? https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/test/laser-controls/ Yes, click should work. That demo uses
the click event on the cubes. Try mofify that demo as a starting point. It does not seem this is a bug on A-Frame since the demo works. It is something particular to your content. I recommend asking the question on stackoverflow or the slack channels. https://aframe.io/community/#slack  Can you shar a complete runnable example?  thanks @jan-thoma!

Support for `play()`/`pause()` ([docs](https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/core/systems.html#methods)) were added recently (0.6.0?) but no longer seem to be working.

Tried:

1. Just registering a system.
2. Registering system, registering component, and using the component in the scene.

 I actually most of the time just use components versus systems. They can act like systems, have more features, and are more stable. Until we port systems to use component code and add features to systems that give them an edge over just using a component. > However I never have seen actual usage .play() and .pause() in systems.

Up until 0.6.0, none of the lifecycle events worked on systems — not even `update()`. Now, in 0.7.0, `play()`/`pause()` again do not work. So the fact that we haven't seen actual usage is not terribly surprising. Being able to use `pause()` in the physics system to stop physics simulation (running separately in a WW) would be an example use case.

> I actually most of the time just use components versus systems. They can act like systems, have more features, and are more stable. Until we port systems to use component code and add features to systems that give them an edge over just using a component.

We should fix this... we're doing the ECS model, systems should have functional lifecycle events. If `registerSystem` just becomes an alias for `registerComponent` that throws errors if you try to instantiate components anywhere but `<a-scene/>` that would be sufficient. Yeah, we should fix. Just been on the backburner since it's too easily workaroundable. We can call it entity-component system vs entity-component-system :)  A-Frame does not try to advertise pure 100% interoperability with the entire Web and Web Components stack. It piggybacks on top of DOM to provide a full game development framework that mirrors DOM APIs. In some cases, it works just fine (Preact, jQuery, d3.js). Since you were able to work around with `.attributes` (or `HTMLElement.prototype.getAttribute`, that's valid. But I don't think we will reinvent the entire framework at this point. Thanks! For a bit more context and some considerations behind A-Frame's API:

1. Scenes often call `setAttribute` and `getAttribute` many times per frame at 90fps. [De]serialization would add memory overhead likely to cause problems, which in-and-of-itself could be a major obstacle to using JS libraries with A-Frame. 😕
2. While we try to do what we can to support JS Frameworks, the vanilla developer experience does become noticeably worse with plain strings. Consider:

```html
<a-entity material="src: foo/diffuse.png;
                    normalMap: foo/normal.png;
                    aoMap: foo/ao.png"></a-entity>
````

```js
var material = el.getAttribute('material');
```

Practically we'd need to reflect the data to `el.property.foo` as you suggest, and this would be a pretty major breaking change for third-party A-Frame components. I assume we'd want to use ES5 getters/setters for that as well, and I'm curious what implications that has for performance... I'd love to see a proof-of-concept along these lines, but it seems like more of a rewrite than we can justify while working toward a stable 1.0.0 release. We wanted to provide a familiar API for web developers (including us), and in many cases, libraries happen to work (e.g., Preact, jQuery, d3.js, etc). The custom `<a-entity>` is documented with its custom behaviors, A-Frame doesn't break standard DOM elements. If developers needs a string form, there are several ways to retrieve that, although it'd have to be parsed again to be of any use.  A-Frame is meant for building VR experiences, meaning our three.js renderer must run at >=90FPS. Renderers like you describe are not able to run fast enough for VR, and are not supported by A-Frame.

If you want to do this type of high-quality rendering on the web, you will probably want to use [three.js](https://threejs.org/) directly, instead of A-Frame, along with one of the third-party pathtracing renderers. See thread here: https://twitter.com/alteredq/status/932729847301967873. 

It's possible that someone could create pathtracing extensions for A-Frame using those renderers, but that's probably a significant amount of work.  **Description:**

The `raycaster-intersection` event should only emitted when there are **new** intersections. Else most likely it would emit every frame which would not be very useful.

 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3250 You can use a tick function and check el.components.raycaster.intersectedEls  Does not support radius. Use a cylinder instead. there is also an `<a-tube/>` primitive in aframe-extras if that helps: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/primitives#usage or aframe meshline as long as i'm here 😅 https://github.com/andreasplesch/aframe-meshline-component  @jason90929 Can you share a link to aworking example with `0.5.0` and the broken one with `0.7.1`? look-controls is overriding the rotation. Use wrapper entity instead.

Would not tie camera rotation to Vue, that's big overhead for something that needs to update rapidly. Will close as this is more Vue side than what A-Frame can do.  Chrome 63 should have shipped. @meatwallace @kyriakosproto Can you confirm if this issue is gone? Cool, thanks!  The default fonts do not include special symbols.

Is that disabled for minified builds?

this particular error could be caught at preload step but many errors would not. It never reaches that point due to `<a-assets>` timeout. @joshmarinacci that sounds like the problem, but can you post the specific errors you're seeing in the console and/or Network tab? The exact fix is to add a console.log here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-assets.js#L126 Could you post a demo, and/or get a screenshot of the Network tab in your browser's developer tools after refreshing the page?

Can you post the rest of the HTML from your scene? I'm on MacOS, so perhaps something is different about file permissions but I'd be surprised to see that 304 in your network tab. Perhaps also disable caching at the top of the Network tab.  @joeloliveira7 Can you share a working example that reproduces the problem? I'm seeing the same thing on master I've been working with (3b6d48a6) and also the latest master (c2f08cf0)

On 0.7.0, the text in the far background is occluded by the nearer objects

 Interesting, anyone fancy doing a bisect? Without trying this might be the culprit: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/c1403a27c6ad465ff337c9399365e0da67903112 Earlier I tried setting both to `false` with no effect, but maybe that doesn't work either (maybe needs an update flag, dunno). They both default to `true` already with/without the properties, so it'd be weird. Possibly related:

Text placed on a child of an entity with transparency is always rendered behind the entity, even when the Z position is significantly closer to the camera. Occurs on master but not on v0.7.0

Glitch above updated to show this behavior as well: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/lewd-ferryboat?path=index.html:17:84 Ok with c1403a2 reverted, I can toggle `material.depthTest` from the console and the behavior changes appropriately. 

The problem is that `text.updateBaseMaterial` is not called with the complete `text.data` but [with a subset](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/c1403a27c6ad465ff337c9399365e0da67903112/src/components/text.js#L172) that [never contains](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/c1403a27c6ad465ff337c9399365e0da67903112/src/components/text.js#L157-L164) `text.data.depthTest`/`text.data.depthWrite`

Just need to update the declaration of `shaderData` and it should work as intended.   @ugoel I recommend adding your images to `a-assets` https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/core/asset-management-system.html That. And also, three.js merged my patch for batching duplicate requests, so once we update three.js, it won't be any issue.  @artemistint the link isn't working for me, could you share the original DAE model? Note that GitHub lets you drag-and-drop ZIP files into comments. @artemistint I'm not sure why the COLLADA file isn't getting transparency applied correctly. That may be an underlying issue in THREE.COLLADALoader, but when I load the DAE file in Blender I don't see transparency there either. I don't know enough about COLLADA to say if the file is correct or not.

I'd recommend trying glTF instead. You can convert the file using Blender, and apply an alpha mask there. I used a PBR cycles node like this:

^Note that AlphaCutoff must be `0`.

  Can you just check in your click event handler if the plane is visible and then do nothing? Hard to understand the exact problem in the original paragraph. Code would be helpful.

I assume this is the problem `the click and mouseenter event are trigered (even though they are not visible).`

Raycasters still hit non-visible objects. You can do `material="visible: false"` or use the raycaster's `objects` property to try to exclude it. Hope that helps, this also seems like a support question not a bug so you can head to Stack Overflow if you have more problems.  Thanks! Closed in favor of the simpler https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3306  People can do like `git clone --depth 20 git@github.com:aframevr/aframe` if they don't want to pull in old files. Don't think, then, it's necessary to rewrite the history.  @vincentfretin yes it was with my S6 + samsung internet. I don't have my device here but I'll let you know once I'll test it again. Is non A-Frame webvr content working for you? Does the Oculus Browser work? I believe there was a recent regression on the Internet Browser these days There’s an open issue that it’s probably related:

https://github.com/SamsungInternet/support/issues/19

@marchill Thanks for investigating this. Can you check if the issue above is the root cause?  @mre30 Do the `webvr-polyfill` examples work for you? http://googlevr.github.io/webvr-polyfill/examples/basic/  It is a known regression on the Oculus Browser and Samsung Internet. More info here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2844#issuecomment-340829968  @Aadjou Does the `webvr-polyfill` examples work for you? http://googlevr.github.io/webvr-polyfill/examples/basic/ This has to be fixed on the webvr polyfill side https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill It is not an A-Frame specific bug. I leave the issue opened as a reference until the polyfill gets a fixed and we can update the dependency As a temporary workaround try to set the display of your Galaxy S8 / S7 to the maximum resolution. As far as I know those devices come configured by default at a lower resolution they are capable of confusing the polyfill. Instructions on how to do it:

https://www.tomsguide.com/us/samsung-galaxy-s8-guide,review-4330-8.html @nicolomessina does the workaround above help?  Sweet! Found a few issues just now:

- Clicking the window causes video to pause (in case of mouse drag).
- First time loading, I got a DOM timing issue that `play()` call was interrupted by a `pause()` call.
- Sometimes WebGL errors when the video not yet loaded and gets passed to WebGL and we have a texture with no image.  This is expected behavior, the motion of the device / head takes precedence. I would not recommend rotating the camera and let the user have control of it. If you need to rotate you can create a parent entity and change the rotation there. As a heads up, it's not easy to compose rotations and get predictable results. Another option is desabling look-controls `cameraEl.setAttribute('look-controls', 'enabled', false);` and then you have full control of the camera. Answered:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36677671/aframe-set-camera-position-at-runtime  From docs on the [`light` component and system](https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/components/light.html), you're looking for:

```html
<a-scene light="defaultLightsEnabled: false">
  <!-- ... -->
</a-scene>
``` Hm I see. I would have expected this to work...

```js
var scene = document.createElement("a-scene");
scene.setAttribute('light', 'defaultLightsEnabled:false');
scene.setAttribute('data-foo', 'bar');
document.body.appendChild(scene);
```

... but it does not. Only the `data-foo` attribute remains after initialization.  Thanks, I'd focus on placing this within the documentation (FAQ, material page, videosphere page, future video guide) and move away from expecting the `examples/` directory to be the official place. Perhaps an HTML comment in the existing videosphere page, but we keep the `examples/` directory mainly for testing core features.

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#add-glitch-examples-to-documentation The site sidebar link can be changed to your Glitch There is some confusion here. What we should do is:

Add the example to the **documentation** as noted here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#add-glitch-examples-to-documentation

The examples don't need to be touched as we don't want to use them for developer reference as much as documentation and Glitches. I was talking about the A-Frame homepage sidebar, we can update the link to the source code.

 Okay to change the link in `a-videosphere` and https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/7309eca64660e6c7e494afdf7c031fd4e7b23b1a is not the homepage (http://aframe.io/). If we can keep threads concise, it'd be easier to not miss things.  What three.js does is just simply copy the frame from the video. So if there's a black screen, it's from the browser. I think what you can do to workaround is find out when the video is just about to end, and then reset it manually to the beginning.

Something like: 

`if (video.currentTime >= TIME_WHERE_VIDEO_ALMOST_ENDS) { video.currentTime = 0; }`  Can you add a working example that reproduces the problem? Sorry, I meant... Can you share a link to a working example that can be easily run? A glitch or a page hosted on gh-pages will do. This should automatically be handled on A-Frame master build: https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/3035117/dist/aframe-master.min.js  Thanks! We recommend replacing the content of a single scene instead of having multiple in the same page if you want to swap content. Do you want to render multiple scenes simultaneously? It’s already problematic to get good performance on a single scene. These are also API breaking changes for components that access systems. In general, tests should not be skipped to accomodate new functionality. Either the tests have to change if they don’t check the right things anymore or the PR has to be modified to not break pre existing functionality. While this fix may improve things for multiple scenes, I think we shouldn't go down that route for now as it will make things more complex. For support of multiple scenes, more things have to happen (e.g., three.js does not even support multiple scenes with WebGL renderer). See that #916 is closed.  @javismiles It seems you're using https://github.com/nikolaiwarner/aframe-chromakey-material. Open an issue there will be also useful. You will have to share a working example and also some information about the video.

I don't see anything exotic in the shaders of the chroma key material. https://github.com/nikolaiwarner/aframe-chromakey-material/blob/master/index.js You mentioned that iOS was working right? Is the issue exclusive to Android?  The `loaded` event fires when the file loads over the network not when your model renders You’re probably attaching an event handler after the model has loaded and the event has already fired If you're specifically waiting on this model to load, the best option is waiting for a `model-loaded` event on the entity itself (not the asset item). Other problem here – the `.glb` asset is coming into the loader as a string, when it should be an ArrayBuffer. This can be fixed with:

```html
<a-asset-item response-type="arraybuffer" src="my_model.glb"></a-asset-item>
```

See https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2649. Offhand I can't think of a way to have that happen automatically (there is no file extension in Glitch, for starters) but maybe we could mention it in the `gltf-model` docs.  I would keep the current format so the log message remains consistent unless there's clear value on changing the date format. Thanks. I'm also European and I have never had trouble with the current format. It might not be the case for the general population. I have no data on either direction just personal evidence. Just curious, Is not the problem the same for humans if you see the date and don't know whether it is ISO8601? `05-10-2017`  and  `2017-05-10` are equally ambiguous to me if you do not know about data formats and most humans don't. Putting the year after or before the `month-day` does not change much in practice. In computer world I personally always assume that month goes first. 

The log is also a message for humans (developers more precisely) and not for machines to parse. In this case keeping consistency might be more valuable that potential benefit of the change. Thanks!  Thank you It's only an issue when it's used at the wrong time.  **Description:**

Similarly, if I keep my mouse hovering over console during scene load and enter the scene, it will fire a mouseleave event.

  https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/introduction/faq.html#why-does-my-video-not-play-on-mobile  Does the webvr-polyfill example work for you? https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/tree/master/examples @cloud4every1 the `webvr-polyfill` is the one doing all the work in browsers that don't have a WebVR implementation. If the polyfill example work on your device they should work on A-Frame. @cloud4every1 we were using the polyfill but we bumped the version we use. I would bet that it's a regression in the polyfill. You can try older versions of the polyfill by changing the package.json and running `npm install` and see if it fixes the issue: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/package.json#L46 @cloud4every1 yes, please open an issue on the polyfill or open a PR if you know how to fix it. Thanks! @siva3378 Can you describe the problem you have? What device are you using? What browser an version? Can you provide an example to reproduce? @siva3378 is not any of the examples
working for you? https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/boilerplate/hello-world/

You can host your example on glitch if you prefer: https://glitch.com/~aframe

 @siva3378 The behavior is correct. As mentioned in the docs `look-controls` rotates the entity that is applied on: the camera in your case. You can apply it to your `a-box`. It will work in 2D mode but not in VR because the head tracking will be applied to it. `look-controls` is designed to be used with a camera. 
```html
<a-scene>
  <a-entity position="0 0 5">
    <a-entity camera></a-entity>
   </a-entity>
   <a-box look-controls position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9" shadow></a-box>
   <a-sky color="#ECECEC"></a-sky>
</a-scene>
```   @fernandojsg ? @dmarcos it works! :)  They're not to be used together. One is for 6DoF, one is for 3DoF, both prescribing models. If you want a line from the hand, set `cursor` ([these properties](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/v0.7.0/src/components/laser-controls.js#L67) and `raycaster="showLine: true"` (see laser-controls code for reference). Or copy/paste laser-controls to change the model to the hand.  Setting another property does not remove other properties. Use the clobber flag if you want to wipe other properties, https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/core/entity.html#setattribute-componentname-value-propertyvalue-clobber, or do `removeAttribute(componentName, property)`  I think we should remove the `mergeTo` property, it works better if done manually versus declaratively (and it seems stale). I'd recommend merging manually in an A-Frame component what you need. I'm good with eliminating `mergeTo`. It is confusing even for me that I implemented it 😄  We've removed `mergeTo` in favor of doing it manually in three.js (e.g., within a component) when needed. Instanced geometries is an alternative way to achieve the same draw call reductions. Quick resources on merging geometries in three.js:

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36450612/how-to-merge-two-buffergeometries-in-one-buffergeometry-in-three-js
- https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Geometry

We can provide more resources as we develop/evolve examples and code. I made a geometry merge component: https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/geometry-merger#aframe-geometry-merger-component  First, thanks for the polyfill! Supporting templates is not a priority at the moment (there's a [template component](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/template/) that plugs in better into A-Frame's ECS framework). 

If we could upgrade to v1 for free without any bugs, that'd be cool. It would be difficult/risky since [A-Frame does some patching to it](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-register-element.js), and that would need to be revisited. But no plans at the moment unless there's an free/easy path. Thanks! Not immediate plans to migrate to V1. I have not personally seen much work using templates in the A-Frame community  but it might be because they don't work 😄 I have not seen the need for them in my own work either. Any other benefits of migrating to V1? I don't question the value of templates what I meant is that in the context of VR experiences I have not seen much demand / need. 

The reason we moved to a fork is https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element/pull/55 
I would be happy to drop the fork but we would have to test thoroughly. It has served us well, bug free for more than a year now. if it ain't broke, don't fix it 😄 Thanks to you for that.

I would like to eventually move to V1, not sure if it's a priority at the moment. What are the timelines for V1 implementation in all the browsers? When can we expect V0 to be dropped? We'd need to spend time investigating and trying. We're not jumping at it since what we have works, and there's risk in having A-Frame run in some browsers with their native implementations (possibly with quirks) and some browsers on a polyfill, and then there's mass testing across every browser needed.

I hope you understand it's not that we don't want to do it, it's just that we're focusing on other things that yield much larger performance improvements (DRE is not very huge on the flame charts) with less effort and risk. You can imagine for 90fps VR, Custom Elements are not our bottleneck. Simply a matter of priority.

But in case you're interested in volunteering/contributing in testing A-Frame with CEv1 for, that'd be cool! We can let you know what the DRE monkeypatch does and that we'd need to be able to wrap/override setAttribute/getAttribute. There are not particular fixes we need from V1 just porting the logic we have. We have our own wrappers around the V0 API as @ngokevin pointed out: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-register-element.js

We want to eventually move to V1, it’s just a matter of fitting it in the current priorities. What we have now works for the time being but will keep a close eye on the browser support and possible bugs. Thanks for the feedback and the polyfill. It has helped us greatly. 
 @WebReflection Sweet! Thanks! The polyfill does sound promising, but at least for myself I have bigger priorities (I'm sure you don't have much time either). But I'll leave it open for anyone that wants to try/investigate. Thanks for the heads up. We will look into it after the 0.8.0 release in December.  Thanks! `VREffect` / `VRControls` will be gone in the next A-Frame version (see https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3152). I recommend starting making a WebXRManager similar to the WebVRManager that replaces VREffect / VRControls (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/renderers/webvr/WebVRManager.js). WebXR is still highly experimental so I would keep it as a separate `aframe-xr.js` library that bundles both the WebXRManager, the [webxr-polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webxr-polyfill) and associated components. At load, the library would swap WebVRManager with the WebXRManager in the renderer: `sceneEl.renderer.vr = new WebXRManager()` and register the relevant components for ar scenarios.  Agreed with not tunneling down into that deep of an experimental level, and three.js has moved away from Effect/Controls, so this direction won't be viable regardless. We can discuss in an issue next time so we don't waste your efforts (unless you were planning on doing this anyways). Thanks!  Thanks. Is it awkward since while videos can be loaded, the `a-assets` doesn't match the support? It also doesn't seem like just a simpler `.src` replace, that seemed fine to me since it wouldn't add anything. But need to do query selectors and walk through the `source`s when we consider a video element. And later for audio as well.

For multi-asset support, I might consider this which sets the `src` based on an available list of `srcs`. This normalizes the API so each asset is an element in a-assets with a `src` attribute, and the rest of the codebase doesn't need to do checks. Importantly, this also lets us reliably preload files through FileLoader since that's what `THREE.AudioLoader` will use, not audio elements.

```html
<a-asset-item id="aSound" srcs="a.wav, a.mp3, a.ogg"></a-asset-item>
``` Yeah, it's awkward to officially "support" it since it doesn't play with `<a-assets>` as expected, and they can't preload well so that weakens the point in using `<a-assets> ` at all. `<a-asset-item>` supporting multiple would fit better with A-Frame and it enables efficient audio preloading. Wouldn't really be a component, but a feature to `<a-asset-item>` which is open for expansion.

Streaming, yeah, we wouldn't use `<a-assets>` at all since `<a-assets>` is there purely for preloading. Still think it's a better fit in a component. I wonder how that plays well with uploading to the GPU, does it have to decode and upload each frame? Yeah, for large videos or streaming videos, often prefer to use inline URLs (either in material or other components) versus `<a-assets>`, only used for preloading files you want to preload. Hopefully, network fetching does not affect rendering too much? We can document grabbing a handle to the video element if three.js creates it (I believe `el.getObject3D('mesh').material.map.image`). Ah, right. Still can get the video handle that way above. The disconnect may or may not be small. It's another edge case to consider and document. Not comfortable supporting `<source>` in `<a-assets>` when we can't preload, yet that's the purpose of `<a-assets>`. 

I'm thinking again, is there a common need to support multiple video formats? A-Frame is a future-facing project, most people will just use one of the formats that are supported in all modern browsers, versus going through the work of converting to multiple formats. For the people that somehow need it, it'd still be possible to do with a bit of JS. I haven't come across projects that have attempted or asked for multiple formats (@cvan seemed to list A-Blast and Puzzle Rain, but they just use one format). my memory was wrong - it was [A Saturday Night](https://github.com/aframevr/a-saturday-night/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ogg&type=) Sound is a slightly different problem. `<source>` would be less effective there as three.js AudioLoader does not even use the `<audio>` element, but rather the FileLoader. Unprescribing `<audio>` and prescribing something like `<a-asset-item srcs>` would be effective there.

For video, I don't know if A-Frame should bend for Chromium. I'd prioritize mainline and VR-supported browsers.
 Is it possible to remove all the query selector logic? For hashing, just use the `video.src` provided as is. Then the PR is neutral and video `<source>` works (for now) at no cost. Just to make the PR a pure `getAttribute('src') -> .src` change? Then a warning in `<a-assets>` for videos with sources maybe. In A-Frame, I guess they'd always have IDs? So I'm understanding the fix more, is just to get past A-Frame warnings/checks/hashing so we can pass the video to three.js uninterrupted. Then the fix is mostly making the `hash` functions not mess it up (don't think they're too important anyways for video). Chromium is used by the official Oculus Browser and Samsung Internet Browser. Those are browsers that A-Frame should handle as first-class citizens, yes?  @cvan Yes we should support those. Even though Chromium does not ship with proprietary codecs, Oculus Browser and Samsung Internet both support H.264 and MP4 as far as I know, they're not just vanilla Chromium. The only affected one would be Chromium WebVR experimental builds. `needschanges` to remove the querySelector logic, use IDs for the hash. Let's make sure the approach is alright before going full into nits/comments/typos, just to reduce noise. Thanks! That one took a lot of energy 😅 Agreed, thanks for helping with this. In the future, would you like me to mark reviews as approved but with Comments?

Beyond my admittedly noisy comments here, the important line I wanted to double check on was this: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3176#discussion_r145609663

Doesn’t regress anything to my knowledge, but I think the loading of the videos are being timed out as a result. Am uncaught Promise, but assets and scene still load. So ok 👌🏽!

Thanks for this - I appreciate it, both of you.  The preloading abilities `<source>` video will be limited (it's not great to preload large videos anyways). The PR will enable at least the use of `<source>` without weird warnings (by passing an ID or the video element directly thru setAttribute).  Yeah, perhaps it might time out if you use `<source>`. Could be a separate fix to skip media elements that don't have a `src` attribute defined directly.  See https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-assets.js#L138 and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#Attributes

`preload="true"` should be changed to `preload="auto"` (or `preload="metadata"` or `preload="none"`) in all the `<video>`s in the [Examples](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/master/examples).

Example URL where `preload="true"` is used on a `<video>`: https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/test/videosphere/

  **Description:**

The [`calculateVideoCacheHash` helper function](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/27d984f2/src/systems/material.js#L250-L278) doesn't take into account videos with `<source>`s (instead of a defined `src` attribute on the parent `<video>` element).

- A-Frame Version: `0.7.0`/`master`
- Platform / Device: All / Any
- Relevant Code Snippet: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/27d984f2/src/systems/material.js#L250-L278
 Digging a bit deeper, I found that [`AFRAME.systems.material.prototype.loadTexture` also checks the `'src'` attribute](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/444fc12/src/systems/material.js#L60-L62) of a `<video>` element, throwing a Console warning.

I assume this can be fixed by fixing the `calculateVideoCacheHash` method to use `<video>.src` instead of `<video>.getAttribute('src')`. And then just checking for [`src.src`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/444fc12/src/systems/material.js#L60) here before throwing a warning. 

There are two cases I can think of where the wrong video could be used from a [cache hit](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/444fc12/src/systems/material.js#L134).

Obviously, the following is very anti-best practice for loading, but a developer could inadvertently do this when preloading `<video>`s without `id`s defined:

```html
<a-assets>
  <video><source src="video1.mp4"></source></video>
  <video><source src="video2.mp4"></source></video>
</a-assets>
<a-sky src="video1.mp4"></a-sky>
```

The other case, which is also uncommon: A developer could have more than one `<video>` element, defined in the scene's `<a-assets>`, mistakenly sharing the same `id` attribute values:

```html
<a-assets>
  <video id="video">
    <source src="video1.mp4"></source>
  </video>
  <video id="video">
    <source src="video2.mp4"></source>
  </video>
</a-assets>
<a-sky src="#video"></a-sky>
```
 In `a-assets.js`, I found a few more instances of `getAttribute('src')` calls that need to be adjusted:

- https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-assets.js#L45
- https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-assets.js#L81
- https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-assets.js#L103
- https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-assets.js#L162
- https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-assets.js#L205
 On a related note (though it could be handled in a separate issue), should also change [this line in `mediaElementLoaded`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/68e6c26/src/core/a-assets.js#L138):

```js
  if (!el.hasAttribute('autoplay') && el.getAttribute('preload') !== 'auto') {
```

to this:

```js
  if (!el.autoplay && el.preload !== 'auto') {
``` I wouldn't support source, prescribe to use a format supported by the modern VR browsers. As seen from many areas we would have to touch, I don't think it's worth the maintainance cost. This is not some legacy way of defining videos. This is the best practice for modern browsers. I filed this not for some “backwards compatibility” issue - not at all. There is real value in supporting `<source>`. Serving different codecs is not just an edge case. /cc @machenmusik @domcccurdy There's a tradeoff for what's ideal and what's practical to maintain. "Best practices" become different when it comes to WebVR. Is there a large common use case for needing different codecs in VR? I don't think it is difficult to serve a format that is supported by the VR-supported browsers versus converting a video to multiple ones. If we support this, any time A-Frame code touches video, we then need to consider not breaking this.

We can continue discuss, but let's leave this closed unless the project maintainers decide otherwise. It's more of a matter of deciding priorities and maintenance cost for the project versus what's ideal in a vacuum.  Can we find examples of WebVR needing / using different codecs? I would defer this until we find specific use cases. Just thought of that this seems possible to handle in a component / external code as well. Things that are at least possible without A-Frame intervention are generally less priority. For anyone running across this. Something like...

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('multivideo', {
  schema: {
    urls: {type: 'array'}
  },

  init: function () {
    var v = document.createElement('video');
    // 1. Loop over the URLs.
    // 2. Check if the video can play the type with `v.canPlayType`
    // 3. Keep looping until a video is playable.
    // 4. Set the material src to that video.
  }
});

// Alternatively, do this as a content script to get preloading working.
// Even possible to register a custom element for `<a-assets>` to handle this automatically.
``` An example today is of A-Blast and Puzzle Rain requiring OGG audio files in the Oculus Browser, Samsung Internet, and Chromium. And in other browsers, MP3 files are used. This is currently hardcoded in JavaScript, causing the incorrect assets to all be loaded initially in `<a-assets>` and then the correct ones fetched from the JS calls within the application logic.

Another use case is streaming video. Right now, @machenmusik has a PR for HLS. And typically you’d define one `<source>` for HLS, one for MPEG-DASH, and fall back to x264. Browsers already handle this feature detection based on the mime-type and codec passed in `<source type>`. I can't find uses of MP3 in A-Blast or Puzzle Rain (which is not A-Frame so there's no a-assets). They use OGG. Either way, it can be worked around in any case. Similarly for streaming video should be handled outside A-Frame IMO.  Because of how `<a-assets>` and the material `src` loading work, you can't do this:

```html
<video id="video" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source src="video.mp4"></source>
</video>
```

No matter where you put it on the page, you won't be able to have A-Frame use a `<video>` with a `<source>` specified. It just doesn't load, because of the aforementioned places that check explicitly for `<video>.getAttribute('src')`.

Any third-party component you write won't fix this, without a bunch of monkeypatching. And, even then, I'm not sure it'll work because of the loading order of the systems and components.

The caching and preloading are just additional issues that also prevent loading and possible cache hits for the wrong `<video>` elements.

Sorry if that wasn't clear. Thanks for asking.
 I think it's simpler to prescribe not using a video player framework, it adds a lot more uncertainty. It's entirely possible to build a component or code that selects and sets a suitable video out of a list of video URLs. Not using `<source>` specifically, but that's OK. > Not using `<source>` specifically, but that's OK.

Why create a new DSL and deviate from how media sources are loaded in the `<video>` (and `<audio>`) elements natively supported in all browsers?

In my earlier comments, I found the spots that need adjustment, and there is a clear solution of just searching, replacing, and adding tests.

What's unreasonable about this request?

How are developers going to know that this doesn't work? Respond on Stack Overflow/Slack with a link to a different custom component and interface they have to learn (with its own caveats that don't 1:1 match up with browsers' native `<video>`)? Pointing developers to this now-closed issue? Add a new item in the FAQ? How sustainable is that approach?
 A-Frame doesn't carry everything over from the 2D Web. As mentioned, there is long-term maintenance cost in code that is already complex. It's also awkward since it won't support the inline URL style, which is why a third-party component is preferred. It's not unreasonable, but neither are the maintenance concerns. Any third-party component that interfaces with the video element will then need to account for `<source>`. Documentation and online resources will continue to guide developers. 

> IMO, that's a little like prescribing not using frameworks atop WebGL. Simpler, but perhaps less useful.

"why frameworks at all?" sort of becomes [reductio ad absurdium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum). The point of the simplicity was of using one framework versus two different frameworks. Ah, well if it's just swapping getAttribute calls to `.src` calls, I think it's fine. Is that all we need? If so, I overestimated the effort given the amount of content in the proposal.  The PLY model is not a material — to load it you would need to use the `ply-model` component from [aframe-extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/loaders). Any components attached to a mixin are reused (not just material and geometry).

However, that mixins are just a convenience feature — there's no performance benefit from reusing a model in this way. Yup, use the `ply-model` component instead and should work.  thanks for filing this. I noticed the exact same behaviour. looks like a recent regression. will fix soon - thank you! see the discussions here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3160#issuecomment-337542073

I'll wait to hear from @NellWaliczek and @olga-microsoft on this.

p.s. thanks for the videos - they're very helpful! 👍 

 This is not a `0.7.0` regression. The problem was already present in `0.6.0` and is due to the polyfill not returning to mono mode after exiting VR yep, you're right. `0.7.0` was just what I was testing with. (I didn't bisect it back to see when it first regressed.)

on `0.6.0`:

  Thanks! Docs fixed with #3167. This was a performance optimization added in #2950. It'll be part of the release notes once it's released.  Added input-mapping system: https://github.com/fernandojsg/aframe-input-mapping-component Not sure if it's the best idea to start the PR until we'll solve the issues we're discussing in my repo and then push all the changes, or merge it and evolve it here, moving the discussion to this repo too.
/cc @ngokevin @dmarcos thoughts? @fernandojsg I think we can deal with the issues in further iterations of the mapping. The current design is useful and easy to understand / use. I commented on https://github.com/fernandojsg/aframe-input-mapping-component/issues/3 that it is the only one that could change the current design, the others are refinements. We had discussed that problem before and settled on organizing the mappings per controller instead of per action for the reasons described in the issue: Organizing mappings per controller is closer to how users and developers reason about mappings. I grab a controller and I imagine how the interaction will feel and how the different actions map to the buttons. @trevorfsmith: since you’ve been assessing and preparing for tackling universal XR/MR input fragmentation, I wanted to get your insight on this - if you haven’t already take a look. thanks for taking a look :smile: I believe we could still handle these global states as presenting or not with the states implemented currently and the app could swap between these mapping states as the app change itself to another state. Maybe we should let the component/system API bake before we place in the core. We've been quick to put components into core before (object `pool`) that haven't gotten a lot of run. I'll use it in one of my projects and can provide feedback/PRs.  @ngokevin yep I agree with you. I'll keep improving it on my repo and testing it with the rest of the demos and once it get mature we could decide how to include it here The `input-mapping` component is still under heavy development. It is a bit premature to pull into core. I'm closing this for now and we will reconsider for `0.9.0`. Better let it mature as a 3rd party component for now.   https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/a840dd6cde6ff2410e96dbce2f10228d84a6cd8c  It creates a new geometry since they default to Buffer geometries which can't easily be updated in-place. Geometries are cached + reused though. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/geometries/sphere.js#L18   What is exactly your use case? Can you describe a specific scenario? You can always track internally in your component if a property has been ever set regardless of the default value.  For the callback use case I would emit an event from your component `rollchanged` that other entities can subscribe via `addEventListener`

For the carousel you can have a `selector` type property that references the selected entity of your carrousel A-Frame component properties are designed to express data not logic. There are other mechanisms for that: component methods, event / listeners Can you describe a use case? Also keep in mind that you can create your own property types by defining parser and serializers for them. You may want to try going down that path and see how it goes. For 3xN matrices that's likely best anyway. See: https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/core/component.html#custom-property-type

An example where I defined custom property types (although I did it differently than the documented way) here: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/feat-state-machine/src/state-machine/transition.js#L17-L23 ... in this case my property type was explicitly designed to represent logic, like `position.x > 100`, for better or worse. 😇 if you want to define a single value for the component, rather than multiple properties, you'd need to use your custom property type with a [single-property schema](https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/core/component.html#single-property-schema).  **Description:**

1. Load an A-Frame example that is using `0.7.0`, such as the [`Shopping` example](https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/shopping/).
2. Click the "Enter VR" button.
3. Resize/maximize the browser window.
4. Notice that the canvas is not resized to the new dimensions of the browser window.

- **A-Frame Version:** `0.7.0`

I see this was introduced in PR #3031. I see [this comment](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3031#issuecomment-331105971), which was then handled in PR #3080.

Perhaps I'm missing something, but this doesn't fix the mobile cases.

> Is that really the expected behavior?  Shouldn't the canvas stay the correct size for the VR headset's resolution?

Totally reasonable concern, yeah.

Here's the common scenario where it looks really bad (on desktop):

1. Open an Edge/Firefox browser window
2. Launch an [A-Frame site](https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/anime-UI/)
3. Click the `Enter VR` button
4. Maximise the browser window
5. And you see a gaping white space

> Is that really the expected behavior?  Shouldn't the canvas stay the correct size for the VR headset's resolution?

On a Google Daydream or Samsung Gear VR, when you rotate the screen (as A-Frame's on-screen instructions tell you to), that triggers a canvas resize, which technically is increasing the resolution. If I return my phone to portrait mode, I'd expect the canvas to look like how it upon exiting VR as it did prior to entering VR.

On desktop, this is just an inconvenience and looks very much like a bug. But in the mobile scenario I described above, it jarbles up the screen. (I can provide a screenshot in a follow-up comment.)
 As for screenshots I just promised, even better are these videos from @Pterko in #3166:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk7ihgJwFQg

Let me know if you or @olga-microsoft have ideas on a solution that could benefit both our scenarios without too much compromise. @NellWaliczek what are your thoughts on this, per my two comments above? @olga-microsoft you are right and your code is correct. The canvas should not be resized while presenting. The problem was an incorrectly `style.width` and `style.height` applied that were overriding the `width: 100%` and `height: 100%` applied by `a-canvas` style. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3184 will fix the issue.  Hi @nedol — I've tested quite a lot of glTF files, it's certainly possible to do this.

Can you share your model, and ideally a demo showing the problem? Also note that A-Frame 0.7.0 supports glTF 2.0. If you have an older glTF 1.0 file, you need to use `gltf-model-legacy` from A-Frame Extras.

You may also want to check out our [troubleshooting section](https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/introduction/models.html#troubleshooting), and test your model with an [online viewer](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/). I don't know where to find the glTF model in that demo. It's better to test with minimal scenes, so that you can narrow down where the problem is coming from. Can you make a simpler demo to verify everything is working?

```html
<a-scene>
  <a-entity position="0 0 -4" gltf-model="my-model.gltf"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

Also make sure you're checking the JS console for errors, which would be important clues, as mentioned in the 3d model troubleshooting docs. Could you post both the file and its `.bin`? You can drag-and-drop .ZIP attachments into GitHub comments directly.

EDIT: and texture files, if any. That second file looks correct to me in [this viewer](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/) – no visible transparency.

The earlier file definitely is missing a `.bin`.

If the models appear correctly in viewers like https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/ and http://sandbox.babylonjs.com/ then something about your particular scene is introducing transparency. You'll need to reproduce the problem in a simple demo for us to help you. More information about playing animation in A-Frame here: https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/introduction/models.html#animating-models  I think the goals (if we do this) would be —

1. Bring the `registerShader` API closer to what component+ShaderMaterial can do.
2. Let developers use `material` on models, not just primitive shapes.

(1) is part of the discussion in #3151 and elsewhere of course.

(2) is definitely a common request, although I'm not sure how many people requesting it are familiar with UV wrapping. Applying an arbitrary material to an arbitrary model doesn't "just work", so practically what are the use cases for this?

Another concern, with (2), is that users may expect using `material="ambientOcclusionMap: foo.jpg"` would apply an AO map to their model's existing material. Merging materials seems hard in general, so I'm guessing we don't want to go that route? Using `material` would entirely override any materials already in the model?

> ...and to optionally traverse the model and its children, or apply recursively to the object hierarchy. (Though we should consider whether to traverse into child A-frame entities then)

I'd lean toward always traversing the model, and never the child entities. I think we could accomplish that by checking `object.el` while traversing, and not going further if it's defined.

***

Overall I'm undecided about this... My original concern, and reason for bringing this up, was about `getOrCreateObject3D` causing problems. But that can be avoided in other ways. We can continue the higher-level discussion about shaders first: this doesn't need to block #3154.  I haven't had the chance to do a thorough read-through yet, but assuming someone has reviewed for any errors then +1 from me for merging and not waiting on the other discussions. We have an example of custom shaders already. Do we want to point to it in the docs? https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/test/shaders/ Thanks, will work on merging this soon.  Tested on:

- [x] Desktop no headset
- [x] Vive
- [x] Oculus
- [x] Windows Mixed Reality
- [x] Daydream
- [x] GearVR
- [x] Cardboard (Android)
- [x] Cardboard (iOS)

Moving THREE dependency to the dev branch temporarly until r88 release.
 Note the work in progress label @vincentfretin Thanks for testing. I believe it now should work on GearVR as expected and also Daydream. @vincentfretin what example are you running? r? I moved all the userHeight logic from `camera` to `look-controls`. It always felt weird to have the idea of user associated to the camera. All the comments have been addressed been watching this and testing locally. nice work! 👍

which Windows Mixed Reality headsets and which Android phones for Gear VR + Cardboard did you test with?

though it's deprecated, just out of curiosity, have you tested on desktop Chromium?
 WebVR is already available on desktop Canary. If there’s any problem with the old Chromium builds I would encourage users to move to Canary. 

It should not make any difference what Window MR headset it is tested on. I only have an Acer available.

For GearVR all devices should be equivalent besides performance capabilities. My testing device is a Galaxy S6 A couple of more style-related nits to address from before and then r+wc @vincentfretin Thank you 🙏   Yeah, please add. Thanks! Thanks for these docs (#3154)! They are indeed better.

For reference this is what i've done in the past for shaders: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aframe-displacement-shader?path=client/index.js:1:0 (although i should use `object3dset` and not `model-loaded` there...).

I kind of lean toward the component+shader approach. Between missing `tick()`, missing uniform types, and no support for custom models, it feels very hard to recommend `registerShader` to new users for me. Previous proposal going that route in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2047, the API is half-baked and more to maintain. We can add that example to the Glitch sidebar, would be helpful. ^BTW the glitch example has a leftover `time` reference where the noise should be updated.

> I am still leaning toward partitioning shader functionality into shader, and material functionality into the material component rather than continually requiring one-off replacements

Could you explain this more? You mean keeping a `registerShader` API that is used through the `material` component, I think? > Re: time reference - first line in vertex shader main computes time from time1000, so I think it still works?

In your demo the model just [scales with constant noise](https://aframe-displacement-registershader.glitch.me/), whereas [in the original noise is updated with time](https://aframe-displacement-shader.glitch.me/). I assumed you were trying to reproduce mine with less code, yes?  Can we open a PR on the polyfill repo? Good! I prefer to wait for googlevr/webvr-polyfill#286 to land and just bump the `webvr-polyfill`. Cleaner and less work. Pointing dependencies to private forks should be just a last resort Thanks! 🏅   What is the use case for adding / removing scenes? It will be probably better to empty a scene and repopulate. Asset manager is just for blocking the scene on first load, it does not have any benefit after that. You can use inline URLs and have the same effect. But emptying/modifying the scene is the way to go, and we won't much support this use cases of attaching/reattaching scene. If you have any specific places where A-Frame can free memory, feel free to file an issue for that. Thanks! one quick comment i'll pull from #3137 - we should probably call WebGLRenderer.dispose() when a scene detaches  Actually the default camera generated by A-Frame has a user height of 1.6, but using the camera component itself has a default user height of 0. Perhaps we can reword to make it clear. `Height offset to add to the camera when *not* in VR mode so the camera is not in the ground. The default camera that A-Frame injects or the `<a-camera>` primitive has this set to 1.6 (meters, to represent average eye level.). Note the default camera component alone defaults this to 0.`  This experimentation can also happen as a 3rd party component. Yeah, it's pretty specific and fairly complex, I'd encourage a separate component. Thanks!  **Description:** Improve the cleanup of `laser-controls` on removal and allow an option to not load controller models. I'm suggesting this to improve my `progressive-controls` component, which uses `laser-controls` for pointing mode. I have an issue where the raycaster from laser-controls cannot be disabled for touch mode because it is added back on event triggers even if laser-controls is removed. I have also had a feature request for the model property from a user.

**Changes proposed:**

- When `laser-controls` is removed, also remove registered event listeners
- To accomplish the above, move helper functions from within `init` into component methods
- Add a `model` schema property that propagates to controller components
 I just found #2981 in which @ngokevin advises against adding the model property. Sorry I didn't search issues before sending this. Shall I strip out the commits related to the model property and just keep the `remove` cleanup? What is the use case for hiding the controller model? Looking back at the conversation, people should be able to do:

`<a-entity laser-controls daydream-controls="model: false">`

to disable. That should work, but there were some reports of it not. @dmarcos: I think it is because they want to load their own model instead of the controllers, like the guns in A-Blast. @omgitsraven @evhan55 Can you comment on use cases for which you wanted `model: false` on `laser-controls` / `progressive-controls`?

@ngokevin: yeah, but that gets a lot more verbose when we're talking about setting it for all the controllers loaded by `laser-controls` re: a-blast For something complex as guns, you'd want to use your own controller component. There's no need for laser/raycaster there. All it is is setting your own model.

re:verbose It's not too bad really, to just set the components. It'd take like 15 seconds. Alternatively, copy and paste the `laser-controls` component, all it does is set other components. It's very easy. I'm in favor of not adding more API or emphasizing components that can be done easily manually, to have multiple ways to do the same thing. We could have an article on on how to make custom components using `a-blast` as a case study. I opened https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-site/issues/469 What I'm really invested in here is the improved removal cleanup, so I'm
going to strip out the `model` related commits and force push an update
with just the cleanup

 It's already in the docs https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/introduction/interactions-and-controllers.html#creating-custom-controllers I think these changes make laser-controls try to do too much, which was an almost reference out-of-the-box implementation that all it does is set other components. It's pretty much a config with no logic. If people need anything deeper than that, I'd start with a copy of laser-controls as a base and modify. If people need to do things such as disable the laser or remove models, that can be done with `setAttribute` calls. So I'd vote to close. I reverted the dependency, so I no longer have any stake in this.   @calrk Did your function above resolve the memory leaks for your project?

A-Frame uses [`THREE.Cache`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/Cache), so it's expected that caching will stick around until `THREE.Cache.clear()` is called. But otherwise we're not intentionally retaining things. Makes sense, thanks. I don't think we want to have that function run automatically when an element is removed, because uploading textures to the GPU is expensive. For example, the user might just detaching it and moving it to another parent, and we don't want to force a texture to upload again.

Brainstorming ways to let users do this themselves:

- Create `entity.dispose()` method, that traverses `entity.object3D.children...` and disposes any textures and geometry that aren't in use elsewhere (can we detect that?)
- Create `dispose-on-detach` component that users can attach to entities, so that the entity will automatically dispose of textures when detached. The GLTFRegistry cache is only retained while the model loads, so it shouldn't be related to this issue.

> I thought that it was using THREE.Cache but maybe that is just the a-asset-item that gets cached, not the actual loaded geometries/materials? Correct me if I'm wrong...

The A-Frame asset system will cache whatever files it refers directly to. So if you have a `.glb` with textures and payload inside it, that's caching everything. If you have a `.gltf` with external payload and textures, most things are not using THREE.Cache. There is [WebGLRenderer.dispose()](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/renderers/WebGLRenderer) ... for cases where you want to clear the scene entirely, we should probably be using that in a `AScene.detachedCallback`. Would welcome PRs if someone has a use case and can test that.

> I think the dispose-on-detach is good but not an obvious solution for people to use, would an attribute on the a-gltf-model make more sense?

I'd rather not do anything specific to a single format, because we'll just have to re-implement it for other formats. I'm (more) ok with non-obvious solutions, because there are likely to be non-obvious pitfalls to using it:

1. Tracking references to textures, materials, etc. could be hard. Unless we solve that, disposing has the potential to 'break' other things in the scene.
2. Uploading textures to the GPU can easily take 500ms for a 10mb model, that that's a huge number of dropped frames in a running VR scene. So, dispose-by-default might be risky if you're just trying to move the model from parentA to parentB.

I think I like the `entity.dispose()` method more than making a component (and we could always make a component that applies it for you). The component API has a `remove` method that is invoked when an entity is detached from the DOM. Should not each component clean after itself when removed? If the `remove` method disposed of textures, then moving a child from one parent to another would re-upload textures to the GPU, and almost certainly drop frames. Hard to automatically guess what to do. ☹️ 

Could wait a few frames then check if entity is still detached?  I think it's the most asked question. See https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/introduction/faq.html#why-does-my-video-not-play-on-mobile, supporting inline video on iOS is a PITA. See also: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2976

And, there are changes incoming that might cause similar effects on Chrome 64: https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/15/16311310/google-chrome-autoplay-videos-january

That is, autoplay is disallowed unless the user has interacted somehow. I haven't been able to find out if this interaction will work the same way it does on iOS, e.g. video must be played during the event callback.

short version, if you want to autoplay video the safest option is to have a "Start Experience" button before the user enters VR, and begin the video then.

EDIT: ah reading your comments more closely, autoplay is not the only headache yeah. 😕 > you think the problem is related to autoplay rather than that shader error?

could be a lot of things sadly I don't think there is anything actionable here besides continued awareness of the restrictions and policies. Send a PR to the FAQ/docs if there's anything to add.  Thanks!  Common questions we should probably cover somewhere:

1. The `material` component doesn't work on loaded models, except for OBJ models that do not already have an MTL (material) file.
2. It's usually better to texture in DCC software (e.g. Blender). (Link to tutorial?)
3. If you do need to texture or re-color something on-the-fly, use three.js APIs like this:

```js
el.addEventListener('model-loaded', function(event) {
  event.details.model.traverse(function(object) {
    if (object.isMesh) {
      object.material.foo = bar;
    }
  });
});
```

For documentation on THREE.Material and its subclasses, see: https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/Material  Can you provide an example? If you'd like to submit a PR, you can `.trim()` the values at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/extras/primitives/primitives.js#L92  **Description:**

Currently, the raycaster seems to emit an event + object per tick per intersected entity, which is quite a bit. Even if the intersected entity was already intersecting on the last tick. So imagine you are just hovering over anything without moving, they'll get continuously pounded with events. I think we need only emit these events on the intersection start.


```js
    // Emit intersected on intersected entity per intersected entity.
    for (i = 0; i < intersections.length; i++) {
      // TODO: Check previousIntersectedEls to see if this is a new intersection.
      intersections[i].object.el.emit('raycaster-intersected', {
        el: el,
        intersection: intersections[i]
      });
    }
```

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 Hmm, I forgot about that. Perhaps a property to always keep emitting in case you need that...? Even then you might not need it for every object. Theoretically, it'd be most efficient to look up the intersection data yourself which is not too hard. Maybe a subscribe method to put your entity on a list to get a callback for intersection updates? Could be done like so, perhaps not worth maintaining an API for what can be done with a bit of JS?

```js
groundEl.addEventListener('raycaster-intersected', el => {
  this.intersectingRaycaster = evt.detail.el;
});

groundEl.addEventListener('raycaster-intersected-cleared', () => {
  this.intersectingRaycaster = null;
});

...

tick: () => {
  if (!this.intersectingRaycaster) {  return; }
  var intersectionIndex = this.intersectingRaycaster.components.raycaster.intersectedEls.indexOf(this.el);
  var intersection = this.intersectedRaycaster.components.raycaster.intersections[intersectionIndex];
}
``` Nah, I don't discourage that. I do lookups like that often; it's simpler than asynchronous message passing. Members/methods are fine to be public API, depends how it's documented.  ticks can be throttled too.

I'm OK with just linking to this issue to the reference code above in the CHANGELOG. Upgrading your dependency is a deliberate step and comes with upgrade steps, so yeah, we can provide helpful instructions on upgrading, but not need to go as far as publishing a component. We can have a `breaking changes` section on the changelog for people to consider when updgrading Yeah, we've always had it, **Major Changes** + **Deprecations** Deprecation = `something that is gone` 
Major Changes can include `outstanding` new features besides `breaking changes`
I was thinking more like a list you can just go down to know where your existing content might break I just called it Major before since in semver, major changes are breaking changes but we can add a subcategory.

@machenmusik I'm OK just having people do it manually versus maintaining something new. Where there's a will, there's a way. Sounds good. done You can define two raycasters, one for plane, one for everything else, with separate intervals. The intersection set should only change if a `raycaster-intersected` or `raycaster-intersection-cleared` event fires. You can then iterate over `el.components.raycaster.intersections` directly to find the remaining intersections. Or if you specifically care about the plane, call `el.components.raycaster.getIntersection(planeEl)` to see if it is intersected. @machenmusik I'm not sure what you mean by "symmetrical", but yes, I'm not opposed to changing the events. But I do think use of the programmatic API will be necessary for certain use cases, and that's OK — `raycaster` should stick to something that won't add too much overhead. TBH I think the `cursor` component itself would be a little simpler if it accessed the raycaster component programmatically. 😅 The current event API is only firing when the list of intersections changes, right? Except the occasional case where two objects lose intersection at the exact same time? Just have to listen for both events. 

Seems like a case where numbers or a motivating example would be best. If there's a measurable improvement to be made, an option is fine with me. But the current API is new enough that I feel like we should wait a bit. If there was an option to disable that event and look up intersection data manually, I would use it. Since there is garbage created on every new intersection for `raycaster-intersected`.  Thanks!  **Description:**

Rather than emit an event + object on the raycaster entity on each cleared intersection, emit one with no event detail, and event handlers can look it up themselves, but this event is rarely used.

**Changes proposed:**
- `raycaster.clearedIntersectedEls` member.
- Emit `raycaster-intersection-cleared` only once per tick.
 What's the advantage of not including `clearedIntersectedEls` in the details of the `raycaster-intersection-cleared` event?

The disadvantage is other components would have to directly access the `raycaster` component instance object to learn the details, something I thought was discouraged Component members can be part of the public API, it's not discouraged to expose properties/methods. Not including would just save creating an object on each tick for garbage collection purposes. Is it able to fix? Oh, never mind, I guess you can maybe pass the array without creating an object. @wmurphyrd I opened https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3128 to pass the cleared elements as a detail of the event. I think versions are allowed to have some small breaking changes, especially in 0.x.x, if there's some gains, as long as things can easily adapt. It'd only break things directly using the raycaster events emitted from the raycasting entity, which I thought was not used often. The contract only applies within versions, but yeah, I wish it didn't break things.  **Description:**

**Changes proposed:**
- Cache event detail object.
- Emit one raycaster-intersection event per tick for all intersected entities.
 @vincentfretin Is it too hard for `super-hands` to accommodate to the new API? Yeah, didn't see super-hands coming. I can try making a small PR. Updated to use @dmarcos' cached event pattern. Updated. This has been done as part of another one of my PRs https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3250  I think if you clone the vector, you can get it to run the `update` call. Can you try changing to `lineData.end = lineEndVec3.clone().copy(this.unitLineEndVec3).multiplyScalar(length);`? And then PR with the `break` fix? Thanks for investigating!

I think regressions from doing garbage collection optimizations. Ideally we don't clone the vector, perhaps a more proper way to get the update to run while not cloning is two have two vectors for updating the line, and alternate between them.
 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3127  It's not supported in all browsers so we will stick with the polyfill. Things will break with a straight switch to v1, and behavior will be inconsistent supporting both. Good luck. We monkey-patch the way document-register-element works a bit so we can have a hierarchy of classes that pretty much call `super()` on each other for various methods. I think there were a few other patches to fix bugs in the polyfill.  - A-Frame Version: v0.7.0
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:

Open https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/boilerplate/hello-world/, and select the sphere element in Dev Tools. Then:

```js
$0.setAttribute('position', {y: 2});
$0.flushToDOM();
```

Sphere's position changes from `0 1.25 -5` to `0 2 0`. As of A-Frame 0.5.0 this behaved correctly, leaving .x and .z alone; I didn't check 0.6.0.

Issue filed here from comments from @MichaelHazani and others in Slack. Perhaps turn them into multi prop components? That would also allow for `.setAttribute('position', 'x', 10)` to not have to instantiate a JS object. Hm I'm not opposed to that change, but do you know why it's broken with single-prop components now when it worked in 0.5.0?

I'm assuming this applies to `position` and `rotation` components, and user-defined components too (like my `velocity` and `quaternion`). Not sure. Before it probably worked by coincidence, but component code got refactored or changed, and now does not work. But making it multi-prop would make things easier, before if I wanted to update position, I'd have to getAttribute + change + clone (because getAttribute returns the `data` object) + setAttribute with another object.  Position, rotation, scale are really `faux` multiproperty components. They are single property components of the `vec3` type (that has multiple attributes). We could make it a multiple property with a custom parser that would still allow for the form: 
```el.setAttribute('position', '0 0 0');``` You could still pass in a Vector3 if we move it to multi-prop. A better way to update position now is `el.object3D.position.y = 2`. It will still be reflected in the A-Frame level. @ngokevin that's #3245 right? If we're fairly confident it will be a longterm feature, would be great to have some documentation of what to expect... is `object3D.position` the underlying storage for the `position` component? So `object3D.position.x = 20` should not force any copying? It looks like `getAttribute('position')` returns a `THREE.Vector3` now? But `rotation` is still an `Object`, since we need to convert from radians to degrees?

This feels like the right direction i think, just trying to make the API changes explicit.. seems possible this could break some components. Docs will be added during the pre-release preparation, yeah. The explicit change is modifications to underlying object3D position/rotation/scale will be reflected at the A-Frame level through `.getAttribute` without any explicit syncing phase. It's a top highlight for me for 0.8.0 for ergonomics and likely performance. `object3D.position.y +=2;` - shipped and docced  Thanks!

 If you check the code, see that we still call getGamepads. The only thing I'm throttling is rebuilding the controller list. It's different from what we did before. #2984 was to fix the Chrome issue with `navigator.getGamepads` not getting called, this avenue was not approached. I can't imagine a couple hundred milliseconds affecting applications in controller detection, it will be hardly noticeable. Works on FF. Need to test on Chrome/Daydream/GearVR. @vincentfretin thanks for looking into it! Do you see any performance difference in the controller motion with and without the patch? Worked fine on Chromium/Rift. Is that enough? Anyone want to try to Daydream? I tried this on Gear VR: Oculus Browser and Samsung Internet on a Samsung Galaxy S8. compared to `master`, the controller doesn't seem worse. I can't perceive perf improvements, if there are any.

@ngokevin: which examples are you testing with? [Laser Controls](http://localhost:9000/examples/test/laser-controls/), [Tracked Controls](http://localhost:9000/examples/showcase/tracked-controls/)? Thanks. Either, anything with hands. Perf improvements are memory-leak/garbage related:

 @dmarcos r? @machemusik Have you had the chance to test it a bit? Do you remember the platforms where we had problems with low framerate controllers updates? @dmarcos This was tested on Chromium/Rift which was one of the platforms. The Gamepad call is called every tick, it's just A-Frame's controller list rebuild is throttled.  The proper solution for this is probably moving the logic to the restore pose of the camera component: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/camera.js#L99 All right. I think we should then move the logic to save / restore the camera pose / position from the `camera` to `look-controls` as well as the `userHeight` property.   Do this to fix tests: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3149/files#diff-f9aac19c37c38417114cd801ed8016c4R12 Fixed the tests.

@dmarcos this fix make sense? We can refactor later. VRControls / VREffect will be soon gone. See https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3152 I leave it open as a reference and a reminder to port the logic. Nothing to do here. After the removal of VREffect / VRControls this PR is not applicable anymore.  **Description:**

#2958 

The original intention was to add something similar to pseudo CSS selectors. But:

1. State mixins are a scattered / roundabout way of applying DOM data based on an event. The same can be accomplished more simply with events. I use [event-set](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/event-set) and it's easy.
2. State mixins can be slow. Any time a state is added, the entity force refreshes all of its components despite data not having changed. This caused some unexpectedness for me when components were trying to get "updated" with the same data.
3. `.addState`/`.removeState`/`.is` can be done with classes or data attributes while being visible from the DOM.
4. Usage is low. The appearances outside A-Frame are mostly when people copied code from the original `tracked-controls` example. a-blast/a-painter/a-saturday-night does not use states.
5. Less maintenance. The cursor component had lots of states and had to be maintained alongside the events which accomplished the same thing.

**Changes proposed:**
- Remove state mixins auto-appliers.
- Deprecate states.
 The `tracked-controls` examples also uses this features It's easy to port. I can port the tracked-controls example while removing lines of code. Don't think because a couple places uses this prevents us from cleaning up API.

```js
      <a-assets>
        <a-mixin id="cube"
                 geometry="primitive: box; height: 0.30; width: 0.30; depth: 0.30"
                 material="color: #EF2D5E;"
                 event-set__hit="material.color: #F2E646"
                 event-set__grab="material.color: #F2E646"></a-mixin>
      </a-assets>
```

And then delete all the state-related JS code.

See:

- [A-Blast](https://github.com/aframevr/a-blast/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=addState&type=)
- [A-Painter](https://github.com/aframevr/a-painter/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=addState&type=)
- [A-Saturday Night](https://github.com/aframevr/a-saturday-night/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=mixin&type=) Would even propose to remove the state API overall in general since data attributes or classes can do the same thing. I still want to give the API a chance. I think it is useful, similar to CSS pseudo selectors. The state API is used in the A-Frame code itself for instance by the cursor and when entering vr. I've seen people relying on it. It can be implemented too with data attributes but it means more coupling with the DOM and not as terse and elegant as doing `el.is('alive')` These APIs have resulted in almost 0 maintenance so far. Every time a state is added (e.g., the cursor component), even if I'm using mixins at all, the mixin state updates will do a mass component update (`.updateComponents`), which is a large waste of perf. I just ran into a bug just now because it was running a mass `.updateComponents` even when no relevant data has changed any time state was added/removed, I had no mixins, and no event listeners.

People haven't been "relying" on it as much as it was used in tracked-controls examples and we shipped it, and then the code was copied and pasted around. I wouldn't say because it was useful. A-Frame is inherently DOM so coupling is not a concern, and even so I'd rather see this done outside the core repo if it's an experiment. I've ported all the instances in A-Frame to not use states.

I'm not sold on the CSS psuedo selector idea. It's a scattered/roundabout way of updating component data. We have JS code that adds state, we have to add a mixin in `<a-assets>`, and then another mixin based on that mixin name with a suffix, and then apply the mixins on the entity. It's much less magical and more straightforward to write a component (or a helper component). super-hands does not rely on states that heavily. The codebase has states because a lot of the code was based/copied on the tracked-controls collider and cursor. Actual usage of the states is low in the codebase. > Every time a state is added (e.g., the cursor component), even if I'm using mixins at all, the mixin state updates will do a mass component update (.updateComponents), which is a large waste of perf. I just ran into a bug just now because it was running a mass .updateComponents even when no relevant data has changed any time state was added/removed, I had no mixins, and no event listeners.

I'm not 100% following here... why were states triggering component updates? Just to explore options, couldn't we keep the State API but not use it this way in Mixins? I.e., still have methods for `addState`, `removeState`, and `is`, which fire events, but not tie mixins into that? Or does that not leave enough proven uses for states, if Mixins don't use them?

I was using states while working on a [state machine API](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/feat-state-machine/src/state-machine), which seemed to be working nicely, but I suppose I could just as easily have made a `state` component.

 Yeah. I found the state API useful specially to develop UIs. We're providing pretty high level UI components like `hand-controls` and `laser-controls` that emit events and also modify the state of the entities. Event driven architectures are sometimes confusing and is useful to have a way to explicitly query the state of an entity. The state API is handy and very low footprint. My vote to keep it. Here's the footprint, consider you use states instead of events, which run frequently:

1. [`addState`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-entity.js#L822) calls [`mapStateMixins`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-entity.js#L836)
2. [`mapStateMixins`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-entity.js#L137) registers a new mixin for every mixin the entity has, and then it runs [`this.updateComponents`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-entity.js#L150) which does a mass component update.
3. [`registerMixin`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-node.js#L150) as a side-effect also creates a Mutation Observer for each mixin the entity has.
4. An event is emitted.

The similar happens on `removeState`. So if everything is running on the state API rather than events as we often use now, these run on any thing that happens in the application, even if the entity is not even listening to these states. By providing both states and events, there's redundancy on how to handle things, and I think events are fine for handling these.

The way states are used today, are pretty much for events. In `tracked-controls`, all it is used for is "color this when the cube is hit, color this when the cube is unhit", it doesn't use the `.is()`. The `laser-controls` examples don't use it either, nor the painter/blast/saturday. If we want to query whether something has happened, it should be up to the application on how to keep the state. Just testing on one very simple constrained event in `tracked-controls` example:

## With States (Before)

Changing the color of a cube on mouseenter takes **8ms**. Bottleneck on `updateProperties` calls from which is from state mixins mass component update + new mixins. `buildData` shows up high on the call tree and memory allocator.

<img width="838" alt="screen shot 2017-10-12 at 9 53 39 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/674727/31516447-e4543d6c-af98-11e7-904c-8e0e7bba579f.png">

## Removed States (After)

Changing the color of a cube on mouseenter takes **6ms**. No large `updateProperties` call. `buildData` does not show up on the call tree and memory allocator. And simpler user-facing API IMO with `event-set`.

<img width="1249" alt="screen shot 2017-10-12 at 9 58 28 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/674727/31516510-1617cd0a-af99-11e7-903e-6b9835692577.png">

But the case for deprecating states entirely is less clear. It is kind of nice being able to just write `el.is('cursor-hovered')` without needing to have been listening to that element from the beginning. What if my component was created after the hovering began? It's not widely used, but it is a minimal API, so not much maintenance benefit to removing that. More specifically, I'm still hopeful states will be helpful for managing transitions between animations, NPCs, and little things like that. I've been planning to do more to test that, but have been blocked by (1) poor support for FBX/COLLADA animation, and (2) lack of a way to export multiple animations from glTF. I'm not as hardly opposed to keeping states, but I'm not quite comfortable either. I like not having special ways to do things that can already be done easily (e.g., data attributes, data sets, classes, a variable in a component, a variable in system). It also signals to developers "this is the way to do states". It's not quite how I'm handling state, and I don't think we've built enough applications to decide it's the best way. At least painter/blast/saturdaynight are not using them. > I don't think we've built enough applications to decide it's the best way. At least painter/blast/saturdaynight are not using them.

I agree we haven't researched enough to decide what the best way is now. But, we might as well keep the status quo (i.e. not delete an API that has been around a while) until we have something to recommend. Is there anything in painter/blast/saturdaynight that we'd suggest users imitate?  > It also signals to developers "this is the way to do states".

Pretty weak signal, given that it's used so rarely. 😉 I don't think it hurts anything to keep this API around until we can make a more definitive suggestion on how to do states. Yeah, it's definitely easier to keep the state API in. But I do see though like if you leave it in, there are components like `super-hands` that start to use it, and people copy/paste, and then it spreads. Then if you ever want to change it, it becomes harder down the road. But I guess we can do something when we get there. If we keep states, are we OK with removing it from like `cursor.js`? Or wonder if we can agree about the state mixins?

In the PR, I replaced the `.is('vr-mode')`with data attributes, but that was just showing what it would look like if we removed completely. They still feel a bit redundant. The addState/removeState does the same thing as events (e.g., `addState('hovered'); removeState('hovered');` vs `emit('hover'); emit('unhover')`, except that it keeps track of a boolean. I don't think keeping track of a boolean is necessary to introduce an API largely similar to events.

Several ways to do the same in a separate component without prescribing components to both emit state changes and events. The cursor component is an example of redundancy between them: for every event, it also has to maintain state stuff. For them to be useful, you'd need most components to implement states. These examples, the states are only maintained on demand:

```html
<a-entity state__hovered="on: mouseenter; off: mouseenter">
<!-- el.getAttribute('state__hovered'); -->
```

Looking to at least remove the state mixins though. For performance (measured above), and also I'm experiencing weirdness where because the cursor component uses states, when I hover, the entity force-refreshes all of its components, and I get odd behaviors of entities jittering around. > Looking to at least remove the state mixins though.

Again, certainly, +1 for removing state mixins. 

>  I don't think keeping track of a boolean is necessary to introduce an API largely similar to events.

The question is whether now is the right time to delete an API we've already introduced. I do not think we should, until we have docs and examples to point to a replacement way of doing things and determine that it's better (or at least not worse) than what we're currently doing. The `state` component you show looks OK, but would need some thought about how to use it programmatically. `el.components.state.is('foo')`? Is that `state` component going to be in Core?  I don't think this all needs to be one PR. Was the state mixin feature ever documented? I remember staring at the tracked controls example source dumbfounded about how the color changed until I found state mixins code in core. 

I've already been working towards deprecating the only real dependency on state in super hands (i.e. the interface with sphere-collider), so I won't miss it. 

I did push state mixins as the easiest way to customize reactions in super hands. Would it be possible to pull `event-set` into core when dropping state mixins? It's nice to have a non-JS option for newcomers to add basic interactivity without adding another dependency `event-set` is opening a can of worms by introducing logic into the DOM a la angular. I think it should remain as a 3rd party component. I can always bundle it in super-hands I can split it. It's less risky to keep it but clarity is nice, and if you plan on deprecating something, better to do it early before it spreads via copy/paste. Just wanted to discuss while it's up.

The programmatic is described in the examples: a `.getAttribute` call (`el.getAttribute('state__foo')`), no extra API, and follows the same as the rest of A-Frame. No need to depend on the emitting component to implement states, components just emit as usual.

Would not put it in core as I haven't seen much usage. Most instances of set/removeState are from copy/pasting tracked-controls example code. I don't think it's a problem transitioning that small audience of the API since they maintain states but do not use them in applications. Deprecating an API is fine since upgrading is a deliberate step, and we just add migration notes/tips in the changelog.

I'll open a PR for the state mixins though. > ```
> <a-entity state__hovered="on: mouseenter; off: mouseenter">
> <!-- el.getAttribute('state__hovered'); -->
> ```

This syntax doesn't work — the component still needs to be present while it's waiting for the event to fire, and presumably after it turns off.

Not to say we can't make a `state` component workable.. just needs some thought. Having this API spread only to eventually move it to a third-party component would be no worse, IMO, than having the community components all handle state in slightly different ways, so that there's no consistent API. I wouldn't introduce event-set in core, but FWIW, I've had no issues with event-set being hard to follow for toggling simple things. Comparing to Angular is extreme where it was messy due to the two-way data bindings that propagated changes throughout the application all in DOM. The way event-set is used, I wouldn't call logic as much as CSS pseudo-selectors are.

> This syntax doesn't work — the component still needs to be present while it's waiting for the event to fire, and presumably after it turns off.

I think that's a lot easier to control than having to depend on the component implement states. Some will, some won't. At least events are dependable on being available. States will always be handled in slightly separate ways, there are too many different ways to keep track of a boolean.

Do you see any errors in console? Do any of the webvr-polyfill examples work. For example this one: https://webvr.info/samples/03-vr-presentation.html?polyfill=1 This triggered an old memory. A friend once told me that Edge Mobile DeviceMotion API apparently returns the `rotationRate` in degrees instead of radians. We have to add an `isEdgeMobile` clause to the following if statement in the polyfill to account for that:

https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/blob/032684215904eadec83f3e8ca7e82fd69cdd993f/src/sensor-fusion/fusion-pose-sensor.js#L152 

That's why probably the `webvr-polyfill` examples orientation jumps around @olga-microsoft Probably. The decision should be made by the [polyfill](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill) maintainers.  /cc @frederic-schwarz very nice example!  I suggest opening an issue on the [super-hands](https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component) and determine there whether it's an A-Frame or a `super-hands` bug. I don't know much on how `super-hands` is implemented. I encourage using the Slack channel as well since people that use `super-hands` hang out there. In the meantime you can still use `0.6.1` if you don't need any of the features in `0.7.0` using `hand-controls` and `laser-controls` and `super-hands` all together looks iffy to me. I'm pretty sure you'd want to just choose one of those three. Could be some sort of race condition there and 0.7.0 just changed the loadout order.

Note that if something else is already loading a model (like `hand-controls`) then `laser-controls` might as well be `cursor` and `raycaster="showLine: true"`.  Thanks, I have made a PR which will index the docs once it's merged https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/pull/225  Thank you!  Thank you!  Congrats on your first PR! The fix will ship in A-Frame `0.8.0` in Nov/Dec timeframe. You can always play with master by pointing to https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/dist/aframe-master.js Just FYI, @dmarcos is right, but if you don't want all the other changes that will happen in master, it is safer to use your specific commit rather than latest master.

I would pass a querySelector for the raycaster to interact with the links like in the [example](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/examples/test/laser-controls/index.html#L53). Something like this:  `<a-entity laser-controls="hand: right" raycaster="objects: [link]; far: 100;"></a-entity>` Make sure that the distance of the raycaster is enough to reach out the objects you want to interact with. Please reopen if the [link traversal example](https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/link-traversal/ ) is not working for you. If it does then it's something specific to your application and better to discuss it on Slack or Stack Overflow. Very possibly same issue as #2980.  Hi @zzylovecode — the [3D Models → Troubleshooting](https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/introduction/models.html#troubleshooting) section in the docs is the best general advice we can offer if your model isn't working as expected.

If you've gone through all of those steps and still aren't getting anywhere, then we would need to see a demo and the source model to help.  `mode` is a vague name. I would keep the `whiteSpace` property name and make sure that value is mapped to the `mode` attribute of `three-bmfont-text`  This is cool, but swapping the environment causes hangs in the scene, right? I mean the performance is not really good, we can't really recommend slow scenes. Perhaps do something less intensive on the clicks. For example, changing some text, or making something a different color, popping up elements  I believe this is the same issue as #2980: the raycaster's cache must be cleared after models load. We're considering ways to do this automatically, but you can add a component in the meantime:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('raycaster-refresh', {
  init: function () {
    var sceneEl = this.el.sceneEl;
    sceneEl.addEventListener('object3dset', function () {
      var raycasterEl = sceneEl.querySelector('[raycaster]');
      raycasterEl.components.raycaster.refreshObjects();
    });
  }
});
```

```html

`<a-scene screenshot="width: 200; height: 200">`  To kick the tires. You can use one of the Google WebAR experimental apps: [WebAROnARCore](https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARCore) or [WebAROnARKit](https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARKit) and @chenzlabs AR component https://github.com/chenzlabs/aframe-ar I'm closing this because this is not a bug o feature request but a question more suited to StackOverflow  This solves a lot of issues with controllers connecting / disconnecting and the cases where the camera starts on the floor or unexpected position. We should have done this a loooooong time ago 😄 @olga-microsoft this improves a lot the behavior of the `windows motion controllers` in Edge. r+wc suite.only  `windows-motion-controllers` hides the whole entity if the expected controllers are not present. This will also make any other controllers (Vive, Oculus...) invisible. I replaced the change in visibility of the controllers entity with the visiblity of just the windows motion controllers model if there's one already loaded. I tested more thoroughly the windows motion controllers in Edge and I find inconsistencies: I ofthen see just one controller when starting Edge and switching it on/off does not help. Also switching off and back on when the controllers are properly tracked does not seem to work. Not sure yet if the problem is Edge or A-Frame but Vive + Firefox seem to work more reliably when it comes to detect and track the controllers. Are you experiencing the same problems on Edge? @leweaver @olga-microsoft 
  Good catch. Just fixed it on https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/47875a0eb6b05f54acbcc1bb2c135be4b75fc33e  Thank you!   Perhaps makes more sense for the use case of media streamed audio over multiuser to handle it within a separate component. Don't feel comfortable have the sound component handle both buffered audio as well as streams. Multiuser setups will have their own custom components for several things. I think this should be a component. That's what A-Frame is set up to do. Anyone can create components that do one thing and do it well. Supporting more things in the core sets a dangerous precedent to support even more things in the core. I think the sound component already does too much since it supports pooling (should have been a separate `sound-pool` component).

We might find as well that the Positional Audio default with three.js does not work well for multiuser, and we'd later be forced to continue to add more features and such to maintain it proper. I see there's already custom stuff happening in https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe/issues/11

So I recommend a component + Glitch, and we'd be happy to feature it in the documentation for people to remix. Next time I'll try to make the decision to close earlier so efforts aren't wasted. Thanks for understanding. Not sure whether that property type should pass through audio. The current three.js audio helpers do an XHR directly to the URL, they do not touch the audio element. It's better to pass a string. You also don't need to use `<a-assets>` for media streams because `<a-assets>` is for preloading only, and streams can't be preloaded. You can always use a string type or selector type and handle how you need. Right now, the sound component does not use the raw audio element so it doesn't make sense to change the behavior.  Closing for reasons in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3042

This can be done more simply in a separate component. The primary reason for this feature was for multiuser, and I'm sure that these changes will not be the only changes needed for that in the future. In the `networked-aframe` issue, some people mentioned there are more things to be done. So faster to do separately. Thanks!  I've noted it more simpler and more appropriate places:

Note A-Frame mentions to be mostly tool agnostic, but does not mean compatible with all Web. Mutation observers are also not a common API web developers will use or be aware of. Good point, didn't see that. I'd add that to the FAQ and to the debug component...and then perhaps a Caveats section in the JS section linking to the FAQ. Would you mind adding that? Don't think we need a whole paragraph and code section though; mutation observers and attribute selectors on positions are not very common operations. Ok, yeah I thought MutationObservers were too narrow a topic for the FAQ, but something like `el.querySelector('[position=0 2 0]')` does maybe broaden the scope enough to include. That's fine with me. I do think we want to keep the code part light (ideally inline, if any) since these are not examples that people should imitate.  https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/1d92dbb3d0680cec3c1218c718bb44c639ab9f5c  (Using latest master.)
@dmarcos @leweaver @olga-microsoft can you confirm? Thanks @NellWaliczek - that rationale makes sense.  Let me know how/whether folks not on the browser call can participate... Will give the alternative strategy a try. No luck with the workaround, as history.pushState() will not actually effect transition between two pages on same domain for example; using history.pushState() then history.go(0) appears to both fail to transition to the newly pushed location, and also to destabilize Edge. @machenmusik `history.pushState()` is not a drop-in replacement for page navigation; developers would need to use it alongside JS code for changing the DOM when the URL changes. The browser does not technically request a new page: this is most commonly combined with Single Page Application routers in React/Angular/Vue. In A-Frame, I think I think the History API is a good choice if you're using one of those frameworks already. If not, @ngokevin's state component might be easier to work with. @donmccurdy yes, understood that `history.pushState()` is not a drop-in replacement, but really for a single page application there is no need to do it this way at all; there appears to be no workaround at present for anything except single-page applications. > there appears to be no workaround at present for anything except single-page applications.

Right, just meant to clarify that. The only way to stay in VR is to stay within a single page. History API just provides a way to persist state in the URL, for users who want to do that, as it can accomplish some but not all of the goals of traditional page navigation.  Nice! Thank you!  Thanks for the details! 

I can [reproduce the problem in three.js too](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/#model=https://s3.amazonaws.com/bug-figures/v2-locrotscale-cube-embedded-buffers.gltf), so it's not specific to A-Frame. Might be THREE.GLTFLoader, or might be the exporter... will try to figure out what's going on and report back.

Also, could you include the `.blend` file?  One observation, if the interpolation mode in Blender is changed to "linear", the animation plays normally. There seems to be some issue in THREE.GLTFLoader with playing cubicspline animation.

[cube_linear.zip](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/files/1290245/cube_linear.zip)
 I think THREE.GLTFLoader is not interpreting cubic spline output values [according to the spec](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/specification/2.0/README.md#appendix-c-spline-interpolation).

The output data looks like this for the `scale` channel, where each keyframe is a 9-float set.

```
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.0448137521743774, 1.0448137521743774, 1.0448137521743774, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.0448137521743774, 1.0448137521743774, 1.0448137521743774, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.0448137521743774, 1.0448137521743774, 1.0448137521743774, 0, 0, 0 ]
```

Based on the error being thrown, three.js has interpreted this to give scales of `0 0 0`, which creates a degenerate matrix. There may be some conversion necessary, within GLTFLoader, to format the keyframes in the way that three.js expects.

@takahirox I noticed https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/10032; is this something you are familiar with from working with MMD? Filed https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/12233, as this issue is really in GLTFLoader, and closing the issue here.  Thanks! Opinion without supporting data and based on personal experience. When you end up reading a Readme file in a github repo, you are likely to have an idea of what the project is about and want to kick the tires as fast as you can. I prefer to see clear and concise instructions to get started first. The organization you're proposing is more appropriate for a project website instead of the README file of the source code. @ngokevin what do you think? Sorry I just realized that it's not a PR against the README file. I still favor having onboarding instructions first. @ngokevin has probably more to say thanks for opening this PR. I do agree with @dmarcos' recommendation about keeping the section placement as is. although it make hierarchically flow better with this change, presenting this information above is likely better for onboarding developers quicker with useful sample code.
 This was done on purpose to keep the quick started information above the fold versus paragraphs on exposition. Thanks though.

Need to enable CORS for your asset  Thank you!  There are some details in the documentation for the [`debug` component](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/components/debug.html). In short, the DOM is not actually modified when calling `setAttribute`. MutationObserver can be relied upon to tell you when a component is added/removed, but not when its data has changed unless the `debug` component is in use (which isn't recommended it production, for performance reasons). @delapuente can you confirm that `MutationObservers` is working if you use the debug component? Thanks for filing, there are events to help you detect when's component is changed initialized or removed https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/core/entity.html#events_componentchanged You can poll if you need more frequent updates.

https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/components/debug.html It's commom in game development to favor polling over event driven programming. It makes things more explicit and gives control to the developer on when to obtain the most up to date information when needed. In A-Frame we want to make things easy in a way the encourages good practices that lead to good performance. @delapuente could I suggest putting this note about MutationObserver in the *JavaScript, Events, and DOM APIs* documentation instead of the FAQ? I agree it is unexpected behavior to web developers, but it is not very frequently asked about. Thanks!  As you mentioned `THREE` is bundled with `A-Frame`. No enough context in this issue to investigate what is going on. You will need to share an example of what you're trying to accomplish. Make sure that there's no code trying to use `THREE` before `A-Frame` loads Try to run `THREE` examples and make sure webgl is working on node webkit on Windows on your particular hardware Yeah, not enough information. It should work, but Stack Overflow would be a place to ask provided more information.  I think this is the proper solution for https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3019 but I have not tested yet on headset. I can do a pass tomorrow on Oculus / Vive and Microsoft Mixed Reality headsets. @leweaver Can you also verify on your side that this fixes the problem?
 Tried this on Oculus / Firefox 55 and it fixes the issue. @olga-microsoft Thanks for testing this. I made a couple of changes to consider the cases you mentioned. Now when disconnecting the headseat VR mode disengages automatically. Please, let me know if this covers every case now. @olga-microsoft I might need some help here. What browsers / headsets are you testing on? It is working as expected for me on Firefox / Oculus:

1. I start Firefox with the headset connected.
2. Click on the Googles to enter VR (VR mode engages and head tracking works as expected).
3. I unplug the cables (I tried the USB and HDMI independently and both at the same time) VR mode exits, the googles icon renders again and I can move the camera with mouse and WASD keys.
4. I click on the googles icon and the browser goes on fullscreen mode.

Do you see any errors in console? @olga-microsoft I see. `vrdisplayconnect` / `vrdisplaydisconnect` don't fire reliably with Firefox + Vive. It's a known bug (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397397). Do you have an Oculus to try on? 

On Edge + Win Mixed Reality. Can you try the following example (https://webvr.info/samples/00-hello-webvr.html) and see if you get the proper messages for `vrdisplayconnect` / `vrdisplaydisconnect` when plugging / unplugging the headset? (The screenshots below are taken on Firefox + Oculus)

It seems you're seeing the render loop crashing and does not recover. Could it be that when the headset is unplugged in the middle of the render loop there's a last call to `submitFrame` that does not finish properly? The `vrdisplaydisconnect` would be dispatched after that call.  It looks there's a time discrepancy between Firefox and Edge somewhere. When unplugging the headset on Edge the vrDisplay.requestAnimationFrame is cancelled implicitly and the callback never invoked stopping A-Frame rendering loop. In Firefox somehow the callback of the ongoing requestAnimationFrame is invoked one last time after the headset is unplugged so the render loop has a chance to seamlessly switch to window.requestAnimationFrame. I'm not sure what is the expected behavior. It's not something we define in the spec (https://w3c.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/#dom-vrdisplay-requestanimationframe) I pushed a change to restart the render loop when disconnecting the headset that you can try. @olga-microsoft let me know if that solves the issue on Edge. I still have to improve the approach since we don't want to end up with multiple render loops on Firefox Thanks! I'm now calling `cancelRequestAnimationFrame` on the handler for `vrdisplaydisconnect`. I also works on Firefox 55 / Vive  Thanks!  Someone pointed out in Slack that the default `<a-sky/>` element already exceeds the faces limit:

![screen shot 2017-09-04 at 8 53 20 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1848368/30095138-7b329192-9285-11e7-83ef-4742209d81a7.png)

Maybe the sphere resolution should be lowered, maybe not, but regardless I think the stats threshold seems too low. Seems like the limit should be at least `maxVertices / 3`? Is there some validity to it? Ideally even though it's a bit more work and we should add more support, people would use cubemaps to get it down to 6 faces? I don't think there's any ~validity~ consistency to it — if 12000 vertices is OK, then 12000 / 3 faces should be OK too. Could someone point me to where this limit is defined? Digging around and can't seem to find it. The faces limit is really not consistent with the vertex limit here. Also — perhaps the `stats` component should include a link to our performance best practices doc, where we'd explain what `Calls` means etc.?  I think the exclamation is intentional to emphasize. @ngokevin ?  As I mentioned in PR #3010 Mozilla’s high-level goal is to continue its official support, leadership, and involvement, as it has since A-Frame’s creation by our staff. We’d be open to making the following contributions explicit:

- Continued role as A-Frame mark holder and defender
- Administration and security of all of the A-Frame sites and services
- Supporting the employment of at least one full time staff member in a peer/maintainer role on A-Frame

There are several ways to formalize this support that we would be open to and willing to have our Legal team help draft. One example to start the discussion would be the Thunderbird model, which is now an independent project but has an explicit commitment from Mozilla to continue a particular level of staffing, funding, and involvement:
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Thunderbird
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/New_Release_and_Governance_Model

Additionally, it is Mozilla's goal to ensure others can continue to meaningfully contribute and help lead A-Frame's continued development, which has always been a part of what makes Mozilla projects successful.

Since the question has come up in the past, a completely hands-off approach like the one Mozilla used in the most recent governance model for the Rust project doesn't fit as well for A-Frame. That project required a higher level of independence in order to assure potential contributors and users that the Rust language would not transition from a systems programming language into a browser-specific programming language. Mozilla does not expect that model would be used with any projects in the future, excluding those in which we no longer expect to invest.
 Cool, sounds good to emphasize Mozilla's support in the governance as long as contributors can continue to drive the project and community. Over its years of effort, A-Frame has thrived best organically, in a community-driven, hands-off, and transparent approach. I hope that continues to remain the case. It does feel awkward to have a community-oriented project's governance drafted by a legal team, and I don't wish to change the way A-Frame currently runs to match a different project like Thunderbird (which has a different scope and structure). But if necessary, Mozilla's legal team can draft a proposal that aligns with both Mozilla's interests as well as the broader community's. Thanks! Hello, is there any update to this? Sorry for the delay! I was out last week but am continuing to push this forward internally. As a quick update, I'm working with the folks who are looking to formalize Mozilla's involvement in projects that look like this - including Servo and several others. If there's a rapid timeline you'd like to close this down in, I can work to get something for A-Frame in place more quickly, but I believe that half of the A-Frame core team is on PTO and off the grid the next two weeks anyway :-)

Is there something you needed addressed sooner? Happy to work with your timelines if there's some deadline you're trying to meet, but I'm also sensitive not to rush this kind of work and leave time for some back-and-forth.

 No problem, I was just looking for any form of update or response. We should expedite this soon, past a month becomes worrisome to hold on important issues. Yup, I'll get Diego working with our internal folks on Open Innovation who are working in the governance space in the next week or two. Thanks!  **Description:**

A-Frame is experiencing bad performance on desktop Firefox / Vive.

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1394561

`- Make sure you are disabling the normal 2d display's requestAnimationFrame callback when the VR presentation has started`

Tip from @kearwood to disable the window's requestAnimationFrame in VR mode. There is some flux with three.js's removal of VREffect, but it would still be up to A-Frame to handle this switching as it has its own RAF.

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 I don't think we're using `window.requestAnimationFrame` in VR mode. We use the VREffect `requestAnimationFrame` (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/scene/a-scene.js#L643) that drives the component ticks as well. VREffect switches to `window.requestAnimationFrame` or `vrDisplay.requestAnimationFrame` depending if we're in VR mode or not: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/vendor/VREffect.js#L184 Yes, sorry, this does not seem to be the culprit. We will need to investigate more to see why A-Frame is suffering latency when the WebVR samples are OK.  Am I correct to assume that this is happening in Edge?  A-Frame is focused on VR use cases and an OrtographicCamera does not make sense on a stereo / vr context.  Can you share what is your use case exactly? FWIW you can do this with a little hackery:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('ortho', {
  init: function () {
    var sceneEl = this.el.sceneEl;
    sceneEl.addEventListener('render-target-loaded', () => {
      this.originalCamera = sceneEl.camera;
      this.cameraParent = sceneEl.camera.parent;
      this.orthoCamera = new THREE.OrthographicCamera(-1, 1, 1, -1);
      this.cameraParent.add(this.orthoCamera);
      sceneEl.camera = this.orthoCamera;
    });
  },
  remove: function () {
    this.cameraParent.remove(this.orthoCamera);
    sceneEl.camera = this.originalCamera;
  }
});
```

```html
<a-scene ortho>
  <!-- ... -->
</a-scene>
```

But as @dmarcos says, A-Frame is not meant to be a general 3D library (as three.js is), it is focused on VR (and/or AR,XR,MR...), so ortho is probably not a case we can guarantee support or documentation for. Yeah, you'll need to write your own controls components possibly to work with ortho and manually replace the camera as Don suggested.  @promontis An orthographic camera and all its implications would be very hard to maintain. You can always build your own component as suggested above that you can ship with your editor. Is that an option for you?  Thanks!  Nice - I had actually done a version relying on `tracked-controls` changes from #2583 which are similar to those you made here, but I didn't have actual controller models.  Wonder if it makes sense to merge them FYI, working implementation on top of #2583 is here:
https://github.com/chenzlabs/aframe/tree/support-spatial-controller I missed one important thing. We should incorporate the `windows mixed reality controlers` into `laser-controls` too which are the A-Frame cross device universal controls (3DOF and 6DOF). It should be pretty straight forward. Just add the controls to the list: 

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/laser-controls.js#L18

And provide the appropriate event mapping and offset for the raycaster (so it's casted from the proper position of the controller):

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/laser-controls.js#L46

 Thanks for the patience. This is a big patch with a lot to discuss.  We're pretty close though Yes please, add the commit to this PR Hi folks, where are we on this one?  Going back to the original description of changes, it seems as though the priority order is this...

> Changes proposed:

> Windows Motion Controller support

This we definitely want ASAP, for the currently publicized handed controllers at least. I think that only a small subset of this PR is needed for that.

> Consolidation of tracked-controls duplicated logic to a single utility function

I think much of this PR is for this consolidation actually.  Do we need it?  We have been talking about refactoring, this could be first step.

> Added error callback on glTF-model component

Nice to have.

 This is pretty close! I think some rethinking refactoring is due to the controllers API after 0.7.0 release. The remaining changes If I have not missed anything are:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3013/files#r137131772
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3013/files#r136705108
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3013/files#r136705073
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3013/files#r137129564 @leweaver Is there anything that can be done at the model / materials level? Adding a light  to the controller is a possibility but maybe too prescriptive and confusing when authors want to have control of the visual appearance of the scene. If nothing can be done at the material level we maybe consider add a light property to the `windows-motion-controls` component that it's `false` by default. This way devs that want to turn the lights on can opt into it. I believe this is the last pending change? https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3013/files#r137319556 Thanks! 🥇 No need to include the built files. @leweaver Will you open a separate PR to point the models URL whenever we merge them on the `assets` repo? Thank you!  Thanks!  **Description:**

As commonly requested, this PR outlines the governance with added moderators: 

Project Maintainers: @dmarcos @donmccurdy @ngokevin
Moderators: @AdaRoseEdwards @Utopiah 

For clarity/efficiency and to enforce the explicit governance, we propose to have only maintainers keep admin/write permissions to the @aframevr organization and its repositories (unless provided otherwise such as with @fernandojsg and the Inspector).

The Code of Conduct has been updated to adapt to A-Frame's community, previously copied from Rust. The Code of Conduct has been tweaked and streamlined for A-Frame with some less redundancy. It looks good to me lgtm! Thanks for kicking off the formal discussion of governance, Kevin! As we discussed in the past, this is an issue that has been informal since the project’s inception and I’m excited to see something codified as the project grows and matures.

At a high level, I think A-Frame’s governance ideally ought to take into account existing members and organizations, as well as Mozilla's historical role as the steward. This would also allow Mozilla to continue to invest in protecting and growing the A-Frame brand, services and web properties, and development. 

I’d like to propose having a conversation about governance goals and guidelines in a new GH issue, as ultimately the governance for A-Frame ought to be more comprehensive rather than a few paragraphs in the top-level repo.

I will open a new issue shortly to kick this off.
 Status update for y'all! While the proposal has been accepted by community and members, still waiting on a response from Mozilla executive/legal people that have decided to open a separate issue. Hope to hear back from them soon. Unfortunately, there hasn't been much updates on this, I am going to close this for now and move to the issue.  In case of any future Glitches (more are welcome!), we can remix this base Glitch to maintain some consistency/formatting: https://glitch.com/~aframe

Working on merging them now Thanks! I think for UI, we should have componentized solutions versus JS in a script tag running animations (we prescribe JS code within components). Also some with more visual polish (e.g., demonstrating https://github.com/etiennepinchon/aframe-material with controllers).  I think a light example should have a way to quick be able to see different light types because this is all people will see:

<img width="1064" alt="screen shot 2017-08-28 at 4 53 35 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/674727/29798373-7d777618-8c11-11e7-8c71-f3c9d85ab634.png">

I'd add in-VR buttons to swap the light types or even spawn lights. That would mean a pretty much reworked example so I'll close this for now. Thanks!  thanks for the contributions. these are nice 👍 Like https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3006, these require some work to format and make consistent. If @afvc is free, or whenever I have a bit of free time, we can get around to it.  What does attach to a-scene mean? Im not sure it provides any extra information. We've said where to put JS code and where not to put it.  Thanks! Your original issue, I made stuff bolder and more clear hopefully if other people run into the same thing, and I've added additional examples. I'll remove the `after the scene` part to recommend not putting code in raw script tags outside components at all.  Thanks, but we do not recommend this way. The very first section `Where to Place JavaScript Code for A-Frame` notes where to place code for JavaScript, always within components. Within a component, so that we don't have to wait to load at all:

https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/javascript-events-dom-apis.html#where-to-place-javascript-code-for-a-frame

> Before we go over the different ways to use JavaScript and DOM APIs, we recommend encapsulating your JavaScript code within A-Frame components. Components modularize code, make logic and behavior visible from HTML, and ensure that code is executed at the correct time (e.g., after the scene and entities have attached and initialized). As the most basic example, to register a console.log component.

The examples on the right hand sidebar also provide remixable examples to do so (all the other examples in the School follow this prescription as well https://aframe.io/aframe-school/#/9 ):

https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aframe-school-js?path=solution3.html

Also covered in https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/core/scene.html#running-content-scripts-on-the-scene

> The recommended way is to write a component, and attach it to the scene element. The scene and its children will be initialized before this component. The first section says explicit where to put JS code for A-Frame and numerous examples on the right hand side. The code in the original issue did not follow which was the issue, nowhere recommends using DOMContentLoaded in a script tag before the scene. Thanks though!  i You have to wait for the scene to load:
````javascript
document.querySelector('a-scene').addEventListener('loaded', function() { 
// your stuff goes here 
});
```` https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/javascript-events-dom-apis.html


https://aframe.io/aframe-school/#/9/3  Thanks! Pretty close! A small couple of tweaks and we're ready to go. Nice! Thank you! Welcome as a contributor!   `a-assets` is not an entity hence it does not take components. There's probably a different way to do what you're trying to achieve. I'm closing this since it's not a bug. You're welcome to open a StackOverflow question or swing by the Slack channels if you need help.  per @dmarcos:
I merged by mistake and reverted. Sorry for that. Can you please reopen? #2985 has landed so we need to rebase

(Rebase forthcoming.)

 rebase needed to remove the commit that has already landed rebase done - are you in a position to sanity check? I tried quickly but it does not seem to work for me. I did not have the controller though (I hacked the link traversal demo with a gaze based cursor). Tomorrow I'll try with the proper controller again Works for me with this test page as example

https://s.codepen.io/machenmusik/debug/XaVMWJ/mVAbGERyxabk

Once you enter VR, it reloads in 5 seconds.  So if you end up out of VR, you know it is not working. I'm trying the link traversal example with your branch and the controller and I get dropped of vr. Does `examples/showcase/link-traversal` work for you? for me, it is working for simpler scenes, but not for ones with big assets to download -- I suspect it runs into the timeout issue in those cases looks like the setTimeout from prior PR is still needed for the VREffect to be available in the heavier cases. @dmarcos can you confirm latest PR version works for you? @dmarcos any progress on a more robust solution?  (Where this.effect will definitely exist while preserving user gesture?) @machenmusik out of curiosity, which example(s) are you testing with this? just https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/link-traversal/, yeah? This will be handled in un upcoming PR implementing a loading screen @machenmusik thanks for the conversation at OC4 @machenmusik that CodePen URL gave me a 403. just posting this in case anyone else's reading: https://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/XaVMWJ/
 no sweat! I was just testing WebVR flows in Oculus Browser. and I know you were working on this, so wanted to check.

thanks for working on this. before I do a deeper dive, are there any known issues you know of for A-Frame + Gear VR? I ask because the new Oculus headsets are coming soon, and I want to make sure A-Frame and three.js are prepared.

thanks again for all your PRs and keeping your finger on the pulse :+1:  Cool, also feel free to create a Glitch instead so we can link it to the sidebar of that documentation page.

e.g.,

```
examples:
  - title: Adding Visual Feedback
     src: https://glitch.com/~absulit-cursor-feedback
```  This should work:

Let us know if you have more details.  Question, when you say Chrome on S8 and VR, are you using Daydream?  Or did you mean one of Samsung Internet or Oculus Browser?  Hi @ZTFtrue — the examples in the three.js repo are using glTF 2.0. A-Frame's `gltf-model` component currently supports only glTF 1.0. The next version of A-Frame will have glTF2.0, or you can use the [gltf-model-next component from aframe-extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/loaders) in the meantime.  Try using the animation component https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation which solves these problems by not having to do a createElement/setAttribute/appendChild just to add an animation  Thanks!  A-Frame 0.6.1 does not support glTF 2.0. It's a 0.7.0 feature. In the meantime, you can use the `gltf-model-next` component from A-Frame extras: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/loaders  Do you still want tracking from daydream controls? If so this should work:

```html
<a-entity laser-controls="hand: left" daydream-controls="model: false"></a-entity>
```

Or just a floating laser that you can use however you want?

```html
<a-entity cursor="fuse: false" raycaster="showLine: true"></a-entity>
```

... but overriding `model:false` for all the different controller types manually is sort of a pain, so I'd be OK with surfacing a `model` property on `laser-controls` too. > ... but overriding model:false for all the different controller types manually is sort of a pain

Exactly... If we want to have easy to use laser-controls, we should add values that should cascade downward For edge and custom cases, I'd copy and paste the laser-controls component and do what you need rather than adding more API. laser-controls is an out of the box implementation and the code is very simple, it sets other components. If you need to create your own controls, you can modify it or add anothe component that overrides daydream-controls I'll check it out when I can, we should make that case work. it may be just changing the setAttribute to 3-argument form so it does not replace existing properties? laser-controls does not touch the model property. setAttribute does not replace non-specified properties without the clobber flag.  Thanks for the example case!

Found the problem: We typically think of the `raycaster.refreshObjects()` as needing to be called after the DOM changes, but actually `raycaster.objects` is caching the list of `Object3D`s associated with each entity, not the entity itself. So its cache needs to be cleared not just when the DOM changes, but when a model is added to an entity.

In this case, the [stub mesh created by the `material` component](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/material.js#L155) is what got cached. If I manually call `el.components.raycaster.refreshObjects()` after the model loads, everything works. That stub mesh has bitten me before (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2464) — I wonder if we could do without it?

I'd like to find a more intuitive way to keep the raycaster up to date, but it's a tradeoff on performance and ergonomics... Here's the [relevant raycaster code](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/raycaster.js#L122-L141). We could listen for `object3dset` on the scene, with a debounce? Another approach, can raycaster attach listener for model loaded event to entities of interest? We could have raycaster listen for `object3dset` on a opt-in flag?

Or provide harder documentation and Glitch examples how to manually refresh the raycaster as you need in docs. That'd be the most performant approach. It would be pretty messy to remove/add event listeners on every object attach/detach and refresh on possibly non-relevant object3dsets. Perhaps a component `raycaster-refresh="raycasterEl: [raycaster]"`.  I like the refresh component approach, fits the paradigm

-- 
Sent from my Android device with K-9 Mail. Please excuse my brevity. I think we should switch back to caching the list of elements, rather than the Object3Ds they contain. Then at least we're back in a position when it's only DOM changes we need to worry about, rather than changes to the underlying three.js scene graph e.g. `object3dset`. The cost of iterating the list of children on each raycast seems low; THREE.Raycaster is going to be doing that anyway.

An automatic way to refresh the raycaster would be good too, but becomes easier if we only have to worry about DOM events. I think it could even be opt-out rather than opt-in at that point, since ~~you only need to check new elements to see if they match `raycaster.objects`~~ well, or if they have classes/components added that would affect matched selectors. So maybe clean maybe not. Proposed fix: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3070

I opted into more aggressive refreshing by default, but limited the refreshes to once per raycast. Is it feasible to provide #3070 in the form of a component, that could become raycaster dependency or system post 0.7.0, or does it require surgery to existing raycaster and thus core PR? My preference would be to patch the raycaster. The current behavior is catching users by surprise, and I think we can make the default raycaster more friendly without materially affecting performance.

But if we decide that isn't the direction we want, and that the raycaster shouldn't watch the kinds of DOM changes it watches in #3070, then yes I'll make a separate component to do the refresh. My only thought was that it might be good to refactor so the refresh policy was separable from the actual raycasting, so the default could be aggressive #3070 but other use cases could replace or entirely disable (e.g. for static scenes) Ok yeah. An option to turn off automatic refreshing and (manually) manage it elsewhere would be worth adding to that PR. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3070  This blocks knuckles support. I found a rigged hand model from one of the Knuckles public demos but it's on FBX format. https://github.com/zulubo/knuckles/tree/master/InteractionPlugin/KnucklesFingerTracker_v5-6/Assets/Knuckles/ModelsI The model imports to Blender, including a skeleton, but I don't see pose data with it... That might be part of the `.fbx.meta` file included, but how do we use that?

We should be able to just create poses for the hand, but I'm not too sure how this works, or what poses are needed for Knuckles. :/ 

![screen shot 2017-08-16 at 8 00 30 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1848368/29394656-9a19c5f0-82c0-11e7-863f-872be2408c31.png)
 Thanks for looking at this. Knuckles does not have poses but finger tracking. Each finger is a button with a value from 0 (finger contacted) to 1 (fully extended). We should be able to control each finger independently Thanks! I need to spend more time exploring Blender's secrets 😆  Nice. Also try https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation if you have issues with the current animation, I will later propose to swap it out with this.  Do we have, or should we add, an example of video without using autoplay for maximum mobile support? Maybe something with a *Begin Experience* entry button.

Some discussion in the #ar room in Slack — it seems our [360º video](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/videosphere/) example is not working on any mobile device — it loads on my Nexus 5X (first frame Chrome, extremely slow framerate in Firefox), and nothing in iOS (any browser). Is adding a play button to the existing example enough? Sounds good to me. 🙂

EDIT: maybe on the test video rather than the 360º video in the showcase Create a Glitch, we can link to it from the docs with the new Examples sidebar listing within documentation.  Careful testing this, as I think there may be namespace collision with tracked controls touch events Cardboard buttons have been working with `mousedown`. `mousedown` should also register with touch. You weren't seeing it emitting?   Thank you! 🥇   There's already a flag called `hmdEnabled`. Can we reuse it? I really appreciate the PR. The code looks great and it even comes with tests 🥇 Our responsive approach considers magic window mode as the base line for mobile devices. A-Frame provides a set of sensible defaults out of the box that we think are useful for a majority of use cases. For custom functionality we recommend creating components using the core ones as a base as you did. Incorporating flags for a lot of particular cases will force us to test and maintain a lot of permutations making very difficult to maintain quality as we move forward. I'm going to close this PR but I'll keep it in mind if we see more demand for this feature. I'll try to write an FAQ and something in the docs about customizing look-controls for non-VR purposes. We've gotten many non-prompted PRs on `look-controls` in the past, and we usually repeat the same things. It's unfortunate to have to turn away work. But thanks though!  A-Frame VR-to-VR link traversals fail at present with Oculus Browser.

See Slack discussion at https://aframevr.slack.com/archives/C0GG937RN/p1502489851298903

See #2966 for a workaround PR.  Freeing resources of the previous page on navigation should be task of the browser. Not sure what A-Frame can do. @vincentfretin thanks for investigating. it is really helpful 🙏  My understanding - the pose data returned and leveraged for controllers is in line with the handle -- this is true across vive, touch, gearvr, and daydream to my understanding. 

The Touch controllers are currently unique in their pistol-style positioning of ideal selection beam for things like `laser-controls`... one could argue that for this use case, components like `laser-controls` would be the right place to apply this.  @dmarcos @ngokevin thoughts? Yeah, intentional given the style of controller.

If you want to override it, you can use the origin/direction properties of the raycaster. https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/components/raycaster.html#properties_direction

You can pretty much copy/paste the laser-controls and modify those config values: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/v0.6.0/src/components/laser-controls.js

Or wait for `controllerconnected` for an Oculus Touch and set the origin/direction yourself once a Touch controller detected I will take a look Reproduced with current Firefox.  I am pretty sure this has not always been the case.  Can someone also test with Chromium (my rig has Nvidia driver conflict issues there) to confirm whether this is browser specific behavior? Current hypothesis - either Oculus or Firefox changed the orientation reported for touch controller to reflect pistol-grip offset, where previously it was being returned as in line with handle (for which the Touch model was previously designed and verified) hey, so did anyone figure out who changed what?
looks like it was still working correctly when we were working on laser-controls...
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2678#issuecomment-302583370 Confirmed that this does impact experimental Chromium with Rift 1.17 software at least. If we merge #2583 then we may be able to use tracked-controls rotation from oculus-touch-controls to fix it
https://github.com/chenzlabs/aframe/blob/4e3fb0a938432bd10b91f7d9df5effdbf588ba86/src/components/tracked-controls.js#L28 Sounds like @dmarcos prefer an alternative he is working on to #2583, so what is the preferred avenue to solve this issue then?  Commit a new rotated version of model to assets and remove the adjustment in laser-controls? @dmarcos ^^ ?  Normally, we recommend just copying/customizing the look-controls if people need special behaviors. There are many permutations and edge cases of controls that people have come up with, but supporting all of the at once is pretty hard. Since now we have so many switches, it becomes harder to maintain.

Perhaps we might one day get something like Don's universal-controls in aframe-extras, but A-Frame is sort of VR-focused so doesn't cater as much to the many possible mobile use cases. The look-controls is meant to be a default implementation where A-Frame is VR-focused, meaning mobile uses HMD. I wouldn't try to add more and more things on top of look-controls to accommodate every use case. For cases such as this, it's not too difficult to copy/modify look-controls. We get a lot of PRs adding these types of switches to look-controls, I will try to add a FAQ/documentation on how to modify/customize look-controls in the future.

Thanks, let me know if you have other concerns. Well, will rethink this since it's a harmless switch. @dmarcos, opinions on having look-controls support full non-VR for mobile? I'd lean on not. I'm ok with this switch in isolation. The broader question is why are we taking this when we rejected similar PRs in the past? My worry is not this feature in particular, it's reasonable and the code is well written. My concern as we discussed is piling tons of small switches that grow the number of posible configurations and code paths we have to maintain. I feel that it's already hard enough to provide good support for the current broad range of devices for the VR use case. As a general approach I would wait to see more demand before taking up on the long term maintainance cost. I want to feel confident we can deliver good quality without going insane 🙂 Mostly a balance between maintenance vs. value. This one doesn't cause for much maintenance, but possibly some value. I could see how people might want to disable the polyfill but keep the touch controls on mobile, or want to provide some UI to let user decide interaction. Hard to measure demand on these types of things, but the WebVR community does love its "responsiveness". Thin line. It may be a question of providing access to internals so it is simple to make an external component that does look-controls except for some small thing... asking devs to recreate entirely just to throw a flag (e.g. laser-controls) is another example with a different response.  There, the maintenance is basically zero, the utility is potentially significant, and the code is written in such a way as to be impractical to work around (e.g., as we support more controllers and laser-controls is updated, variants have to update in lockstep as there is no reuse / inheritance possible) The maintenance isn't zero. We have arrays of flags and need to work together, and we're continually adding more flags or getting PRs for more flags for non-VR purposes. It's less resistance to copy-and-paste (remix, not *recreate*) and tweak. Components should be small, simple, tweakable rather than large complexes.

`laser-controls` workflow and customization doesn't have any issues with it. It's a very small and simple component that sets other components. Need to add more controllers? Just attach them. That other PR about the `model` flag is an unrelated issue with why the line does not show up when the `model` is set to `false`, not to do with needing any flags. Would it make sense to just disable the mobile orientation-based movement when hmdEnabled is false? I wouldn't handle fixed pitch, at that point, you can customize manually the look-controls for you own needs. @jaydansand it’s a deliberate design decision not a bug. It is very dissorienting changing the pitch with your finger since you quickly lose the sense of up / down and it’s difficult to recover from it without reloading the page > Copying look controls means buying into constantly merging and updating.

I don't think it's much trouble in practice. I've been maintaining an alternate version [here](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/controls) and haven't had to touch the HMD/orientation code in 11 months. @jaydansand the way to opt out is to implement your own component as you succesfuly did.  @jaydandsand we want to keep the core components focused and with functionality that serves the majority of cases. By keeping components simple we prevent a combinatory explosion of flags permutations that is very hard to maintain over time. Simplicity also allows developers like you to adapt the code to particular scenarios we don’t cover. I’m going to close this for now and revisit in the future if there’s more demand Having `hmdEnabled=false` also apply to mobile devices seems reasonable to me; +1 on that.  > since the camera is also in that position by default

The camera default position should be 1.6 meters up, no? If you use the default camera or `<a-camera>`. Yeah, and in VR mode (with positional tracking), it would be at the real-world head height, so greater than 0. Anything we should note given that? It's not really anything specific with planes, but just placing stuff at the same position as the camera in general.

Perhaps a quick comment at https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html#placing-our-box-in-front-of-the-camera like "In general, note that if we add an entity at the same position as the camera, we won't see it from the default viewpoint". But we can leave that for another PR, thanks!  I would not hardcode version numbers in the examples or reference specific bugs. The info will go quickly out of date and it will be hard to remember to update it A bug in an example is the same as any other bug in the code base. The fix will ship in the next A-Frame version in a few weeks. You opened a good issue already to keep track of it. Any ideas on how we could fix it https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2961?  There's also the aframe-site repo which might be a more appropriate place: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-site The issue might be also relevant here, the aframe-site repo does not have the same visibility. Can use this as a general call about blog post, doc materials, examples people think are not currently covered? We can file independent issues from this conversation so anybody can jump and help. Good entry points for participation. It's something we've tried before. It's hard to follow completely through and write something well since an article is a huge commitment and technical writing is difficult. But yeah, would be great to hear about any holes.

But I can say that simple examples on Glitch are most sorely needed, people have requested that. For each documentation page, we will link to relevant examples on Glitch that people can play with. Just add the Glitch links to the documentation metadata, and I'll get them visible on the website.

```
title: Cursor
examples:
  - name: Clicking
  - url: https://glitch.com/~aframe-clicking
---
```

My call to action would be to create simple Glitch examples for each documentation page to link to. Code speaks louder than words, so please share them! I'll be working on them soon myself. @wmurphyrd It doesn't really matter the accounts because the Glitches can get remixed by anyone. We create examples, a contributor can remix them to add a small change and update the URL, and if we need to modify we can re-remix it. Cool. Going to close as you've gotten a couple of suggestions as desired. Will leave the aframe GitHub issues for core issues or actionable items by core team or community versus a call out. Note the A-Frame blog itself has a high standard for curation of content. Helpful content should be added as now Glitches or additions to the documentation. @afvc those look great! it would be great if you could get them into glitches and add them or send them to the docs! I suggest more frictionless ways to gauge community needs. One is to be present within the community; Slack and StackOverflow are a wealth of indicators on what knowledge is needed. You can even ask for ideas there. I've also indicated the need for more forkable examples. Another good source of blog content are case studies on innovations and real projects (i.e., new components, VR UI) that you personally work on (versus writing about a topic in a vacuum). Those are good places to start versus a soapbox-y issue GitHub that might not attract attention. Thanks for being interested in it.  Can you add code or ask on Stackoverflow? Which example? Most likely you need to position it in front of the camera position="0 0 -4" or use side="double"  Lots of questions in Slack about audio support on mobile, whether there is a workaround for playing without user gesture, etc. We should have a note, either in the FAQ or the `sound` component docs, explaining current state-of-affairs on this.

Personally, I'm not actually sure of the fully story myself. I think that audio without a gesture is completely impossible on iOS (although you can use an audio sprite started when the scene loads with a gesture). Is that also true on Mobile Chrome? Or can the gesture requirement somehow be worked around there?

/cc @dirkk0 + #1463 @dirkk0  thanks! Do you know if mobile Chrome in Android is a different story? I'm seeing some [information suggesting gestures are also required](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=178297) there, but I haven't tried this. Thanks! Opened #2974. Not sure about the WAV issue; maybe another issue for that?  **Description:**

During component data building, we're often cloning objects for `oldData` and `attrValue`. We could use object pooling to reduce allocations. We should need only two objects per component: the old data and the current data, but currently creating a new object (or more) on each update.

We can look at existing performant object pool implementations to reuse (some use arrays, some use linked lists).
  Radius is a valid property. Is it not working for you? https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/primitives/a-sphere.html#attributes_radius Yeah, radius should work fine. Let us know if there's anything else.

  This will be a bit more involved, but I think we want to cache the bounds (e.g., in `this.canvasBounds`, and then on window `resize` event in a throttled handler (`utils.throttle`), we want recalculate those bounds. Close, I meant just `utils.throttle` the handler, not `throttleTick`. In case someone is dragging to resize the window, many resize events would fire. OK, I see. We want to use `debounce` instead. We need to add a utility function for that. In `utils/index.js` next to `throttle`, we can add:

```js
module.exports.debounce = function (func, wait, immediate) {
	var timeout;
	return function() {
		var context = this, args = arguments;
		var later = function() {
			timeout = null;
			if (!immediate) func.apply(context, args);
		};
		var callNow = immediate && !timeout;
		clearTimeout(timeout);
		timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
		if (callNow) func.apply(context, args);
	};
};
```

And use `utils.debounce` instead. Thanks! Thanks!  Thanks! PR appreciated to use canvas size isntead in `cursor.js`. Wonder if `getBoundingClientRect` is performant to be called on every tick though. Fixed using debounced window.resize handler + canvas bounding rect. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2942  Thanks! A small change and ready to go. Thanks!  Do you have a [codepen](https://codepen.io/) or a [glitch](https://glitch.com/) illustrating the problem? What does `getColor(item.status)` return? What about if you do `color: 'green'` Does it work? Yeah. We should maybe expose it as a component property  We prescribe always putting JS into components, even a `main` component. This allows code to be executed at the proper time, when things are loaded and ready.

https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/core/scene.html#running-content-scripts-on-the-scene

https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/javascript-events-dom-apis.html#where-to-place-javascript-code-for-a-frame

Listening to the `loaded` event outside of a component is expected otherwise if flying loose outside a component. The code there is a bit more complex. Asynchronous operations with components running in non-deterministic order. Wiring is more necessary in those cases. Either:

- If a component A creates an element that component B needs, I'd have component A communicate an event when it's ready so component B knows when to run. 
- Or component A can `setAttribute` that `selector` property of component B when it's created.  It's not quite correct, I would not use `throttle` when `throttleTick` should be used. Throttling `tick` shouldn't be explained in the `throttle` section. I don't think `throttle` needs to an example, `throttleTick` could have one though.  Have you tried on Android? Thanks! 🥇   It is the same thing, and unfortunately there is no perfect solution right now. Transparency and order-independent rendering are very difficult to get right. We would need things like https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/4814 to be solved.

But with luck you might find that `material="alphaTest: 0.5"` helps here, as mentioned in #666. Going to close this to merge the threads. Can't guarantee it would work in your case, but yeah:

```js
var el = document.querySelector('#my-model');
el.addEventListener('model-loaded', function (e) {
  e.detail.model.traverse(function (node) {
    if ( node.isMesh ) node.material.alphaTest = 0.5;
  });
});
```  **Description:**

I'd like to be able to update an array property type using the same array without having the clone the object myself to get past the component deepEqual check.

```js
// test component
schema: {
  foo: {type: 'array'}
}
```

```js
var foo = el.getAttribute('test').foo;
foo.push(50);
el.setAttribute('test', 'foo', foo);
```

Currently I need to do:

```js
var foo = el.getAttribute('test').foo;
foo.push(50);
el.setAttribute('test', 'foo', AFRAME.utils.clone(foo));
```

Possible solutions:

```js
// Skip equals check flag or force update flag.
el.setAttribute('test', 'foo', foo, true)
``` 

```js
// Options object for setAttribute
el.setAttribute('test', {foo: foo}, {forceUpdate: true, clobber: false});
``` 

- Clone the object/array when setting `oldData`, but this doesn't sound great for perf.

  Nice, thanks! I'm far from my headsets this week. I will do a sanity check as soon as I can next week and will merge. /cc @caseyyee @jsantell while your logic is probably more appropriate on Daydream (because you disable panning using the finger) I think the result should be identical (both logic old and new use native HMD orientation given by hmdEuler). Do you see any difference in your Daydream device when entering proper VR mode (webvr in Chrome Daydream is hidden behind origin trials....) ? this seems pretty close. @jsantell: friendly ping?  Which platform/browser? Sure it's not on the event iself? https://w3c.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/#interface-vrdisplayevent thanks!  1. Need a geometry on the text.
2. `onclick` is not supported. Use event listeners. https://aframe.io/aframe-school/#/9/4

https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/components/text.html#limitations  The laser controls isn't meant for gaze-based. Making an app responsive to support both controllers + gaze would be up to the application. If anyone has an example to show this off, create a Glitch, and we can add to the docs.  Thanks!   See aframe-React readme. Components mean different things  Is not that misleading? The controller is 3DOF and there wont't be 1:1 matching between the hands and the controller. It might be ok for some interactions. Not sure if the offset should be part of the schema since you could achieve the same effect by nesting the controllers inside an entitiy Is not that misleading? The controller is 3DOF and there wont't be 1:1 matching between the hands and the controller. It might be ok for some interactions. Not sure if the offset should be part of the schema since you could achieve the same effect by nesting the controllers inside an entitiy There should be an arm model in place for both gearvr-controls and daydream-controls, unless you have disabled it.  Are you proposing a different arm model?  Or is the arm model not doing the right thing for your use case so you were proposing a different strategy? Yeah. The arm model should be the one applying the offset  Fixes #2721.
 The glTF loader will only duplicate the UVs if there is no second UV set, so yes— you can create a custom second set of UVs in your software instead. The second UVs can only be used for AO/lightmap, though.  i'd just remove the `--save` piece and leave everything else  👍  thanks for the pr! I don't think this should be part of the main repo since it's a for a third party packaging tool for a fairly niche store. This would belong best perhaps as a tutorial since people would have to modify the metadata anyways. Closing for now, but we can keep the conversation going  Thanks!   Thanks!  First thing is that in VR you should not animate the camera and let the user have control of it. This won't work well in a headset.
In the case of the nested camera composing rotations is not a trivial business in 3D. The result you're getting is expected.
I don't think this is an issue on the A-Frame side. Let's leave the discussion to the SO question.   **Description:**

There's been a regression since A-Frame v0.6 (was also present in master since before the release of 0.6) which prevents the aframe-particle-system component from working when there is fog set on the scene. Details are logged here as an issue on that project: https://github.com/IdeaSpaceVR/aframe-particle-system-component/issues/26

It causes a WebGL error to be thrown:
```
THREE.WebGLProgram: shader error:  0 gl.VALIDATE_STATUS false gl.getProgramInfoLog Varyings with the same name but different type, or statically used varyings in fragment shader are not declared in vertex shader: fogDepth   
```
```
three.js:21505 WebGL: INVALID_OPERATION: useProgram: program not valid
```

- A-Frame Version: 0.6.1
- Platform / Device: Chrome / Desktop
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: https://codepen.io/maxakohler/pen/gRgZZP
 The problem is the [SPE dependency](https://github.com/squarefeet/ShaderParticleEngine) of [aframe-particle-system-component](https://github.com/IdeaSpaceVR/aframe-particle-system-component/) that it's not compatible with THREE > r83. Since `r84` (A-Frame 0.5.0 used r83) there's a varying `fogDepth` declared in the [fog_pars_vertex](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/10497/files#diff-e02b3101630f5ea2d12b18a6439d615a) chunk that [SPE](https://github.com/squarefeet/ShaderParticleEngine) has to [include](https://github.com/IdeaSpaceVR/aframe-particle-system-component/blob/master/lib/SPE.js#L900) when composing the vertex shader.  This is the THREE PR that introduced the change for reference: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/10497 Yes, you can use 0.5.0 or update https://github.com/IdeaSpaceVR/aframe-particle-system-component/ to make it compatible with THREE > r83  Can you add this to the docs as well, thanks!  @donmccurdy we should revert the tween.js bump. Fortunately, @dmarcos did not bump his deps before he built the release so this only happens locally does the CI not do `npm install`? The older version of tween.js is deprecated; if the API change is trivial maybe we should just fix it. It's deprecated, but it doesn't really hurt to keep the version we had previously and not add extra work / unexpectedness.

We have to manually build dists during release so the CI builds didn't make in Everything is (still) working for me locally. 😕 Tests pass, `npm start` works, demos work, all on a clean installation of aframe. I'm currently at `@tweenjs/tween.js@16.10.0`. npm 4.6.1, node v6.9.5. Is it possible there was a bad patch release of tweenjs somewhere around the time we published? Or perhaps related to https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/issues/358? Good to hear! Thanks for checking again! I'll go ahead an close the issue and will reopen if necessary.  thanks!  So we just need to add `alphaTest` to the `material` component, similar to `depthTest` which is already there?  Sounds like a good idea to me, +1. Already there
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/material.js#L23 Oh nice, so #2516 would have just gone stable with v0.6... in that case let's add docs and call it good.  Yeah, that URL should be a relative one  I'd look for a component-based API https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation rather than adjust across A-Frame to account for `<a-animation>` API.

If you need to encapsulate entities, the template component is another option.  We've deprecated a-animation. Try https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation and file issues, and component will be merged in in the future.

In these cases, might need additional JS to control iterations of the animation.  > Are there any changes that need to be done for aframe to import Blocks?

Some Blocks will contain ngons (faces with >4 sides). The three.js OBJLoader can't render these, and whether it really should be fixed to do so, I'm not sure. The workaround is to triangulate the mesh in Blender, or perhaps some easier tool. We could, at minimum, document how to do this.

> It would be great to have a component that takes the URL of a folder with the decompressed contents of the zip exported by blocks and places that in the scene.

Mr. Doob has [added support in the three.js editor](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/commit/6cfda9b71b3456ff095233a70785fa30a7080526) (not core three.js) for loading Blocks directly from the .ZIP. We could consider doing the same in A-Frame, although IMO it's the sort of feature that would be nice for testing but bad for published code. Support for ngons landed. Also https://archilogic-com.github.io/aframe-gblock/  You will need to convert a font set that has arabic characters. https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/components/text.html#custom-fonts  Thank you! 👏  We have a cursor example (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/examples/test/cursor/index.html). Do we add some text there to illustrate how to do it? I think the `a-plane` labeled with text in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/examples/test/text/scenarios.html would work with cursor, right?  If so, maybe we can point at something like that as example. Yeah, IMO the core text component should be thought of more as a specific type of material / decoration and so to be interacted with, the entity needs a geometry (e.g. plane or box) that defines its area / volume for interaction...?  We're trying to deemphasize primitives since they are just aliases over an entity + components and introduce a lot of quirks and inconsistencies.   @Akshaylyer12 Sure! Open a PR when you have something ready. This is an issue that is already filed on the aframe-site. Unfortunately, we cannot hand-hold through the entire process. If you are unable to find it, I recommend to get acquainted with the codebase more and come back to it later.  That particular boilerplate is not updated to the latest A-Frame Version (0.6.0). I opened an issue on its repo to upgrade: https://github.com/aframevr/360-image-gallery-boilerplate/issues/8 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector would also be a better place to file. Currently working on Inspector a bit now. Thanks!  `materialtextureloaded`  I can't reproduce this with Nightly + Vive  Please use StackOverFlow or the Slack channel for questions. Issues are just for bugs or feature requests.  Could you share an OBJ created from SketchUp in this way?

Might also be worth testing your model somewhere like https://clara.io/ or [FBX Review](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fbx/fbx-review) to see if the problem is isolated to A-Frame or related to the model. Sorry this probably isn't the answer you want, but Sketchup's exports seem to be very unreliable. There's a problem in the model, causing `<a-obj-model/>` to crash and causing Clara.io to fail to parse colors. I can fix that manually in Maya LT (here is a corrected file: [first.zip](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/files/1147476/first.zip)) but in the future you may have better luck with tools like MagicaVoxel or https://www.tinkercad.com/, or by learning more advanced tools like Blender.


 @kschzt Thanks for checking. Have you tried if the problem still reproduces with `master` that uses a newer version of THREE?  * It adds a mouse cursor mode to the `cursor` component similar to https://github.com/mayognaise/aframe-mouse-cursor-component
* It modifies the `raycaster` component to accommodate the mouse cursor use case
* It makes the link traversal example usable on desktop
* It adds link traversal example to the index.html 

[Demo](http://swimminglessonsformodernlife.com/aframe/examples/showcase/link-traversal/mountains.html)
 I replaced `mode` with `rayOrigin` with two options `entity` / `mouse` So not going to try the idea of having a cursor work with both simultaneously? It needs more thought and probably not a priority right now.  @stephanedemotte can you open an issue?  Re parenting is tricky to achieve. Can you have two cameras and switch between them? This is a dup of https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2425  I believe those arrows should only show up in mobile @ngokevin ? Yeah, we can just hide these for desktop The repo is on https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-site but the arrows work for me now Never mind, they only don't work on the Logo example, but I moved the issue  Thinking further, why do we need a `.reload()` feature? I'm sort of in favor of removing this altogether because it will get messy trying to maintain the feature and address all edge cases of resetting a scene to a clean slate. I'm fine with deprecating. I checked with @fernandojsg and we don't use it in the inspector. @rockwalrus how did you hit the issue? what's your use case? @rockwalrus Firefox Nightly now implements the `vrdisplayactivate` that it's fired on reload and the scene should reenter VR automatically so you would not need  to call `reload`. Anything that prevents you from demoing on Firefox Nightly? I think it's fine to reload the page and enter VR programmatically (this can be done on mobile when using the polyfill). Everything done in this current PR could be done without being in the core as well. Multiple embedded scenes is not supported at the moment and it's not something I think we will do in the short / mid term. There are a lot of performance implications and we have to first focus on get good overall performance on a single scene :) 

You said that your scenes don't have much state stored on them. It will be more performant to reset the component properties to the original values rather than recreating the whole scene (specially on mobile) as `reload does`

 @rockwalrus you could add a class to all your dynamic entities `<a-scene class="myElement">` and select them all with `document.querySelectorAll('.myElement')` and remove them. Still more performant that reloading the scene, specially if you care about cardboard / mobile In your case I would create a `reset` component for the scene that restores the state and removes all the dynamic entities.  To determine if `reload` is worth keeping I prefer to analyze the use cases that need the feature. In the case described above (restoring the initial state of a scene) reloading the whole scene is not the ideal more performant way to proceed and it should be solved differently. Your use case to reload a page is already covered by the WebVR API since reloading a page and remaining in VR is a considered scenario. Your problem is with devices where there's no WebVR implementation (Cardboard like devices). Are you using a cardboard with a button? You could hook enter VR to a press on the button after reload to be able to enter VR (fullscreen on polyfilled devices) 
 OK, I would close, look into deprecating `.reload()`, and leave as application-level / third-party code.  @Marchhill Can you try with master? Does the webvr-polyfill demo have the same problem? http://googlevr.github.io/webvr-polyfill/examples/basic/ What does double vision look like? is there a difference in DPDB and maybe the specific model of phone has wrong/missing entry? @clavis-magna Does this happen also with the `webvr-polyfill` example? http://googlevr.github.io/webvr-polyfill/examples/basic/  Thanks. `pivot` was previously something someone wanted to reduce the amount of entity nesting for animations. We created some examples using it (e.g., the A-Frame logo). We don't really want it in the core, but are keeping it for those examples still around,  You have to set `material="side: double"` https://jsfiddle.net/q2d2nxdo/  **Description:**

**Changes proposed:**

 We also need to change the default values to `1`.  Use a wrapper entity or temporarily set look-controls to disabled. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36677671/aframe-set-camera-position-at-runtime  dupe and fixed. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2841  You'll want to use `<img>`, not `<a-asset-item>`  Hmm, calling `enterVR` or `exitVR` twice should not doing anything since they have early checks to see if you are already in VR.

Do you have the WebVR Emulator installed? I think this issue is only if you have the WebVR Emulator extension enabled, which may cause weird things. The WebVR Emulator may not be as useful for A-Frame since wasd-controls and mouse-drag controls provide the same sort of emulation.

If I don't have it installed, Mac/Chrome enters full screen normally. Windows/FF Nightly enters VR with correct height. I reproduced with the Emulator installed and uninstalling it helped.  The GearVR Controller has a handedness that is set when you pair it using the Oculus app.  (I believe the default is right hand.)  If you configured your controller to be left handed, then the GearVR Controller is exposed with left handedness, and so I would expect the behavior you are seeing.  Can you confirm whether that is the case? @gabrielperales can you confirm behavior with both Samsung Internet (in GearVR) and Oculus Browser?  I am wondering if this is a discrepancy in behavior between the two, or another issue specific to your use case, given that @clofts613 confirmed the expected behavior above. The Oculus browser is included in Oculus Home. You have to open it with the button that says Internet in the bottom bar @gabrielperales there is the Samsung Internet GearVR app, which I think you are using, and also a browser more integrated into Oculus Home https://m.vrheads.com/how-use-oculus-browser-gear-vr There seems to be a regression where gamepad extensions are disabled: https://forums.oculus.com/developer/discussion/comment/564429/#Comment_564429 There's a regression on the Oculus Browser 4.0 where gamepad extensions are disabled by default. It will be fixed in the 4.1 release in late november. This is a workaround in the meantime (taken from the forum thread linked above):
- Open a new tab, start typing 'chr' (w/o quotes)
- Once you see 'chrome://chrome-urls' as a hint - click on it.
- Click on 'chrome://flags' link
- Search for 'Gamepad Extensions', it is located somewhere close to 3/4 of the page.
- Change its state from 'Default' to 'Enabled'.   
- Relaunch the Browser (you'll see a button at the bottom of the page).
 Excellent news. Thanks @mkeblx   I think the 'rain' and 'ocean' components are good examples of this, and the goal for this issue would be to gather even more ideas. No need to distinguish categories of procedural-ness. :)

Similar to #2408, maybe a nice thing would be a component that can grab a random child from a model, rather than loading the entire model. So I could load a glTF file with 5 trees, and have 100 trees randomly drawn from the model, scaled, and scattered around the scene. (or does the environment component sort of already do this?) > Any kind of geometry reconstruction from images as a component.

Maybe getting a bit ahead of ourselves now, how about scoping to: "generating non-deterministic content in a scene". Computing content from scanned point clouds, photo clouds, and ML is a whole field of study on its own. 😉

+1 to this — could make our own little infinite space sim  What about signed distance field primitives a la shader toy? Has anybody experimented with them in WebVR?

http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm @joshmarinacci Have you read the component documentation? https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/core/component.html
How can we improve it? This issue is a brainstorming exercise to collect ideas for anybody to implement. I think what's missing from the components documentation (which might not make sense there anyway) would  be information about how to manipulate underlying three.js geometry. For example, I wrote the `<a-ocean/>` component while referencing [this tutorial](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/). 

That might be a common enough problem to be worth writing up somewhere. I've definitely pointed people to that code several times. But I think we'd also want to be clear that it's only recommended for dynamic stuff, and that if you want a model of an airplane (like in that tutorial) you should probably be using one of the modeling tools we list instead. This is more in three.js's wheelhouse than A-Frame's domain. A-Frame's domain is more of the structure that houses three.js code. There are pages on how to interface with three.js within A-Frame, how to write a component, and modifying geometries is for advanced developers that know three.js. How to write a component that modifies three.js geometries becomes a specific example.

But yeah, it'd be helpful for someone to create these specific Glitch examples, e.g., of a component modifying a geometry. Then we add it to the documentation sidebar under the Table of Contents to get live forkable examples.

    title: Modifying three.js Geometry Component
``` A friend of mine ( @rlamana ) had actually started porting [the example](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/) that @donmccurdy pointed out to A-Frame. I've been begging him to finish it up. Ramoooon pretty please! :kissing_smiling_eyes: :kissing_smiling_eyes: :kissing_smiling_eyes: :kissing_smiling_eyes:  @rlamana cool! Do you mind setting up `master` as the default github pages source and putting the link on the repo, so I believe it could be much easier for people to try it Nothing actionable for A-Frame core here, continue to build procedural components and projects, and disperse them into the community. environment is pretty well adopted  Probably we should replace this line of `getForColorComponent ()` in `src/core/a-animation.js`

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/af3f89049d10b9037895b9059e5aa430c6f1bf81/src/core/a-animation.js#L465

```javascript
from = new THREE.Color(dataFrom);
```

with

```javascript
if (dataFrom === undefined) {
  from = new THREE.Color(el.getAttribute(attribute));
} else {
  from = new THREE.Color(dataFrom);
}
```

?

If this looks ok, I'll make PR.
  This was fixed at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/16e18f66f33d6615db44311b40e965fd3f25e0ff ... will have 0.6.1 out with bug fixes soon.

https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/538439e/dist/aframe-master.min.js  …te on component initialization (fix #2829)

The following call to `getAttribute` returns the data object of the component (this happens due to one of the perf optimization to reduce unnecessary object copies) that gets modified and then passed to the `setAttribute` method. 
````javascript
var position = el.getAttribute('position');
position += 1;
el.setAttribute('position', position);
````
the oldData object was constructed before building the data object resulting in the oldData to actually contain the current data. The condition that checks if the component should be updated (oldData !== data) was failing because the objects were identical.

Two fundamental changes in this PR:
1. The oldData object is built after the data object is constructed to contain the actual previous data.
2. The update method receives undefined on first call when the component initializes. The core components have been modified to comply. 
 Can we avoid making oldData undefined on the first call? It's extra work to check and opens up for potential for lots of bugs in components (e.g., not accounting it could be both undefined or an object). Can we separate the internal old data versus the public one? Old Data being undefined it what makes sense to me? What do you pass to update on first call, when the component has been just initialized? Empty data makes just as much sense. And it's backwards incompatible and puts less type checking effort and less potential bugs for component authors.

What do we return where?  What about components that don't have an object as schema data type like visible for instance? If the default is false people might do things like `if (oldData) {...}` undefined works better for single-prop schemas. I think that was the current behavior. Ok, I'll revert back to passing `{}` on multi prop schemas and `undefined` on single property Can also update the PR description for future reference. yeah  Are you on `0.6.0` or `0.5.0`? Thanks!  Can you provide a link to an example that reproduces the issue?  A fix for `setAttribute` has landed on master (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2840). I cannot reproduce this bug on the text example.  Please let us know if you are still affected and can provide an example to reproduce @vrimaginar are you trying with the master branch? IiRC, the support for auto width and height is on text component, not geometry component... That's an error in the documentation. Geometry does not have auto height and width properties. I tested on the [text example](https://a-frobot.github.io/aframe/examples/test/text/) and it works fine to me (see the fucsia plane in the middle) by doing:
```javascript
el.setAttribute('geometry', 'primitive: plane; height: 1; width: .5')
```
![test](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1o2s3N3d1M2s0b293j0M/Image%202017-07-17%20at%204.20.01%20PM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=4ef42a89e08bc241f872ecc16ec4e51f&v=83ed0c9e) I'm surprised that was working at all. `auto` is not a valid value for the geometry `width` and `height` it will be parsed as an integer resulting in a `NaN`. The `text` component does not check anywhere for `auto` values either. I think the text component should have a `backgroundEnabled` property and manage its own geometry instead of relying on user doing any sort of manual configuration. @machenmusik any ideas? The mystical processing of `auto` is here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/text.js#L270

'auto' was more memorable and descriptive than `0`

I think the problem here is that adding the geometry component is not triggering layout update.  But if you do anything that causes the text component to recompute, the geometry component values are then set.

Apologies that my prior comment was not clearer. @dmarcos the text component does manage its own internal geometry, but does not include background (nor padding/margin); one issue that would arise with deprecating the magic geometry handling and replacing with a fixed background plane is that you don't always want a plane as background. `auto` ends up being a `NaN` when it is parsed as a `Number`. I would constraint the background to a plane handled within the component and for other kinds of geometry as a background the user can handle that externally. I don't think resizing automatically a random geometry is going to end up producing the results you expect.  Yeah I think there were issues with explicit zero being mistaken to mean default (which is nonzero)

I am on the fence w.r.t. background, IMO without padding / margin the background may not be so helpful since it may look wrong; not sure change in behavior is worth breaking backward compatibility... The change will ship on 0.8.0. I'm not concerned about backwards compatibility.  I think is better to evolve the API and ensure good ergonomics rather than being worried about backward compatibility. At the of the day we're still in 0.X.Y versions. The original idea was to be able to use text to label a plane or box or anything that had a width and height.  But that was rather early on, I don't think I realized that model loaders like obj and glTF were not considered geometry, so maybe that hasn't ended up being as useful as hoped. What about adding a `backgroundEnabled` flag and the components sets the plane geometry internally? maybe call the new flag `backgroundPlane` and have it forcibly `setAttribute('geometry', {primitive: plane; width: __, height: __})` -- and if false (default), continue existing behavior for backward compatibility? or it could be `background: plane` (so in theory you could also use box or other primitive) I would start with just a plane and make it work really well. Expanding to any geometry is too much ground to cover. I would probably not use the geometry component but create a custom geometry internally with THREE  Thanks!  A-Frame already has a Wakelock mechanism when entering VR mode that works as expected for me on any of the aframe.io examples (https://aframe.io/examples/) and on a Samsung Galaxy S6. NoSleep.js is not working on the glitch example because it is not initialized by user action (NoSleep.js uses a video element playback mechanism), as the NoSleep.js demo (http://richtr.github.io/NoSleep.js/example/) does when the button is clicked. As mentioned above you can initalize NoSleep.js by putting a button or splash screen in your demo that user has to click. I don't think any action has to be taken on the A-Frame side, this is a general problem of integration of NoSleep.js with Chrome for Android.  is submitting the PR against the docs branch intentional? We don't do fix uplifts to older versions of aframe. We recommend people to update to the latest version instead (now 0.6.0) Do you think this PR is still necessary? 0.6.0 fixes this, and the docs branch is just for cherry-picking documentation fixes.  This PR is made against the docs branch. It should be against master We will be releasing 0.6.1 later this week. If this PR is submitted against master the fix will shipped with it. We then have to recommend people to upgrade. Fixing on 0.4.0 and 0.5.0 won't help much since we would have to cut a 0.4.1 and 0.5.1 releases that devs would have to upgrade as well. We just do bug fix releases of the latest public version. 0.6.0 at the moment Yeah, should be against the doc branch, but we don't cherry-pick fixes to older versions. Newer versions exist to improve older ones.  add HLS example, converted from https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1846#issuecomment-309201624
 tested using native HLS support in Edge browser, using local server run as `npm start` The example is a bit buried. Wouldn it be better to add it to the existing videosphere example? We could add a button on screen to switch to the hls one. What do you think? I thought about something like that but was unsure since many browsers do not support native HLS. We could make the existing example the default one and a button on the corner to switch to the HLS one @dmarcos you mean like the latest commit?  CSS styling welcome... @machenmusik: I have a device (for just this purpose!)

I’ll test it tomorrow and get back to you.

thanks for taking this on :) This seems like a pretty narrow use case (iOS + video + streaming + HLS). This seems like it could be done fairly easily outside of A-Frame without A-Frame supporting it specifically? why limit A-Frame’s video capabilities? and, if A-Frame decides to explicitly not support these video use cases, provide a working solution for integration with A-Frame. if A-Frame doesn’t just work out of the box, potential big names will just move on to a different WebVR framework that does. Similar to what happened with Shopify VR prototyping with A-Frame but [ended up settling on PlayCanvas](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/building-a-vr-shopping-experience). Because there's a maintenance cost, complexity, and it can be accomplished outside A-Frame. I believe A-Frame is successful with adoption in the WebVR space, I don't think it hinges on iOS streaming video support. 2) Sure, the extra shaders, special checks for Mac, switching shaders depending on a combo of file type and platform, needing to communicate between different parts of code base for whether a texture needs a flip or correction, and additional logic branching in code I already have a hard time following (texture and material utils). Then on top of that the browsers are always changing, and different browser versions. Then compared against the demand.

Perhaps, there's no way to apply the quirk through the base material component, but it should be possible if you wanted iOS HLS to have a component that does everything start to finish. There's a high bar for core features, we've excluded much more popular features from the core. @cvan There’s a thousand things A-Frame could do and we have to prioritize and factor in complexity and maintainance cost. If there’s a strong market signal that indicates that `iOS + video + streaming + HLS` is important we can consider it. Said that even if we try to cover as much ground as we can we won’t get 100% adoption since taste and personal preferences also play a role in decisions. Shopify does not provide much detail in the blog post about why they favored Playcanvas over A-Frame. I would love to know more but it does not seem to be video related. If you have more info please feel free to open any issues with the functionality you think is missing. @dmarcos Fair points, thanks. As @machenmusik points out in [his comment above](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2830#issuecomment-337408140), iOS is not the only consumer of HLS. Microsoft Edge (Windows Mixed Reality) and Safari use HLS.

You did great work to quickly get `0.7.0` shipped to have A-Frame support Windows Mixed Reality-capable headsets as first-class citizens.

Supporting video on these platforms is just the right thing to do.

`Why won't my video play in A-Frame?` is one of the most frequently asked questions. I think any Pull Request that improves the quality of video playback is a Pull Request that deserves to be considered to be merged upstream. Especially if others are helping to review (and maintenance provided in the support of issues filed, tests written, and follow-up PRs), this is how an open-source project can function to satisfy desires of those that are not the core, active project maintainers.

Just based on the public signals, Apple is participating in the WebVR spec. It wouldn't be a leap in imagination to assume that Safari on desktop will eventually support WebVR.

If video is not considered not an A-Frame priority (roadmap or not), @machenmusik should have been consulted back when he opened this PR on June 30.

I would think that having the popular video sites be able to use A-Frame would rank pretty high on the priority list. If you take a look at the sub-Reddits for every popular mobile VR headset, the same questions keep coming up: `How can I upload my videos to play in VR?` or `How do I play 360° videos on the VR browser?`

There are clear signals from users, developers, and the A-Frame community (GitHub, Slack, Twitter, Reddit) that they want first-class video support.

Costs of developer burden vs. longevity of A-Frame.

A-Frame ought to bite the bullet and handle all the quirks and browser inconsistencies, and support native APIs already supported in 2D, on behalf of the developers.

The answer shouldn't be `video isn't as important as X, sorry`. It should be `sure, thanks for the patch; let's make sure this works; developers, try this out; and respond to the feedback`. No one's against supporting video, but the PR is more about iOS + HLS quirks. General video issues have been difficulty in addressing continually changing browser quirks. If you are interested in pitching in, a Glitch demonstrating video playback on iOS would be valuable for the docs. I understand the concerns, but the longevity of A-Frame being threatened is a fairly extreme case to make. Apologies for the delay in reviewing the PR, lots of things happen at once, specifically 0.6.0 was released exactly on June 30th, so this got lost in the mix. I'd support it in a component. It'd probably take you 20-30 minutes to publish, and the code path much, much easier to maintain. I'd keep the material component simple; I myself just make my own material component when it doesn't support something I need, much quicker than trying to bake/test it into core. If you need to update it, does not need to go through us. It'd be more discoverable as well as a component.

Regards to PR, I'd vote to close and then remove the quirk-hacking, and throw up a component.  What do we need from the PR to have a working HLS example? We can't have an `hls-video` component that does everything start-to-finish with a Glitch that we can publish to the docs? I was proposing not only the quirk handling, but entire feature and handling altogether. You can create your own texture in the component as well, no need for A-Frame to flip/specify texture properties. I'm also leaning to keep this as a separate component and let it evolve independently. There seems to be too many quirks and edge cases on a device and browser basis. Video streaming in general seems a bit of a moving target. If we feel there's a good paved way we can recommend I would reconsider to put it in the core. 

Some additional info to consider when gauging demand of video in WebVR based on personal observation:
1. For people starting without 3D graphics knowledge, video or panos seem the path of least resistance to start kicking the tyres and learn A-Frame. More often than not, the end goal of people doing video is not shipping video in production. Many of those questions we see about "How do I render Youtube, or this and that video?" come from people on a first exposure to WebVR / A-Frame and quickly move to other kind of experiences. A basic support of video for learners might be enough in the core. With this I'm not saying there is low demand for video content but something to consider is that the perception might be higher than the actual demand.
2. About KRPano. It is a specialized product that supports a wide range of 360 image and video formats. It also comes along with tools to prepare assets. They provide an end to end workflow. I imagine a whole new separate project focused on 360 video / panos. A-Frame core should not aim at covering so much ground.

 Video is supported in-core minimally. Will detect if a video is passed and use VideoTexture if so. Any workarounds or additional needs supported outside core. HLS is especially even more of a niche demand. If KRPano offers something good in those regards, that's great. We'll continue to listen to opinions, but I don't think we can assuage anyone that disagrees fundamentally how we guide A-Frame's direction.

I hope this decision is understandable to some capacity since these conversations have taken too much time. Here's moving forward:

- Closing the PR.
- Removing any special HLS shaders and hooks and such.
- Recommend anyone interested to create a component/Glitch to handle these needs. Have the component act outside the A-Frame material codepath. We can feature in the docs, there's no difference to interested developers where it lives. Measure how well it goes, then we re-evaluate in the future.

It should be extremely easy to release a component and/or Glitch. This is foundational to A-Frame's philosophy: permissionless innovation and extensibility. If anyone is passionate about helping with video, publish a component/Glitch/guide that will help people today; no one has stepped up there. It is a much more efficient path than trying to maintain in material component's dizzying code path. The [prescribed way to add examples](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#add-glitch-examples-to-documentation) is to create a Glitch and link from the documentation. That way people can remix it/try it out instantly, and the code is more copyable since the `dist` is not a relative path to a Browserify build.

Hosting on the repo means we'd have to maintain it, any little changes need to get reviewed/tested, and indicates a level of quality of support which I can't guarantee.  and https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163866#c17 is the WebKit bug to follow We can leave the examples folder as is for now, perhaps for testing core features and components, but start to move towards Glitches for examples and demonstrations.  Most likely because of the changes of skipping type check if reusing the same object, thanks will check it out. @ip can you add a test case? thanks! I found the problem. For single property components like `position` or `scale`. The component oldData is not a copy of data but a reference. When doing things like:
````javascript
var position = el.getAtttribute('position');
position.y += 1;
el.setAttribute('position', position);
````
Both data and oldData are modified. the `update` method of the component is never called because no changes in the component are observed since  `oldData === data`. PR coming If you call `setAttribute` multiple times with the same object (as you do in your example), the object is considered trusted and we disable certain checks on it (type checking and comparison with oldData values). Your second call to `setAttribute` is going to through a different path that ends up triggering the change you were expecting on first call (because we don't compare against oldData) We should probably restore the comparison with oldData regardless if the same object is passed multiple times to `setAttribute` (thinking about it)  This has been fixed on aframe master branch in github   @autonome Do you know if the fix ever landed on the polyfill? We can pull the fix in for `0.6.1` next week  Hi @7dir — Nice! Would you like to add your component to [awesome-aframe](https://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe)? I don't think there's anything actionable on this issue.  You can play with the segments property and see if you can find a lower value that feels good. PRs are welcome :) https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/extras/primitives/primitives/a-cursor.js#L12  Thanks! Almost ready to go. There's a broken test to fix I've updated to fix tests, added tests for selectors that were not accounted for, fixed the regex. thanks much  Thanks!  Seemed to be causing backward compatibility issues with animated cursors Gonna need to grep the examples and tests @ngokevin did you want to finish this one off?  I won't be able to get back to it for a while  Can you post example code which this PR might address? Will help clarify the case, thanks! I would add a test with the case that this PR fixes added the tests  Nice catch  This does seem to be a bug, really weird. I can reproduce on master + Firefox too. And using the text component vs. primitive as well.

Here's a Glitch: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/cherry-driver Fixed  Can you try `material="visible: false"`? I believe three.js changed to look at the material visible property rather than object3d visibility.  I think instead we should just revert it back to `cursor-fusing` in the code. Not worth breaking the few examples with animated cursors. Also the PR should be opened against master branch.  @vrimaginar Do you want to open a PR? Thanks! I think @cvan called that out as a backward incompatibility in laser-controls PR... Yes, I think the question is whether to accept the incompatibility and change docs to match the new name(s), or change back to backward compatible names and leave the docs. I believe that the change made as part of laser-controls PR was to the raycaster event names, so not only impacting laser-controls. I might just change it back. The states aren't used often in public API and thought it was ok but forgot about the cursor animation docs Changed back  I'm curious what would happen if you decomposed the primitive to entity + components. A-Frame has a fairly strict child-to-parent/inside-out load order. All children have to be loaded (meaning node is attached, components are initialized), then the entity initializes all components, then emits that it is loaded. So it's hard to think that it'd be due to the A-Frame core, maybe it's because of primitives, or maybe another issue, but I'd love to know more. Where is locomotor-auto-config defined?  To clarify the use case, are you interested in events from the gamepad, getting current state of the buttons, or position/rotation? Or some combination of those?

It looks like even within `tracked-controls`, there is no reference to which hand it is. We'd need to look at the `<device>-controls` component for that, which is inconvenient. 

One solution would be to include `hand: 'left' | 'right'` in the `controllerconnected` event. Actually, the current vive-tracker PR may have some changes one is looking for here... especially regarding hand Not all tracked controllers have the concept of handness so we include that on the vendor specific controls live `oculus-touch-controls` or `vive-controls` @AndresCuervo Can you share a bit more of your use case so we can recommend a solution? A code snippet / markup will help IMO, seems like there are a few different topics this brings up:
(1) exposing hapticActuators for more convenient use
(2) declarative markup to respond to the events controllers generate
(3) stylistic difference between attaching event listeners ad-hoc that dispatch functions, and making components that contain the functions and are attached to the same entity What controllers are you supporting? I recommend using the higher level controls that will give you the button mappings. if you use `vive-controls`, `daydream-controls`, `oculus-touch-controls`... you can listen to events like `triggerdown` , `touchpaddown` ... the handle to the entity will be passed to the handler. Look at `hand-controls` as an example https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/hand-controls.js IMO Declarative ways to attach handlers ends up being more confusing than helpful when applications get complicated since you have logic scattered between HTML and JS and it's unclear what is the scope and where those handlers live. I agree that an haptics API is a different conversation Is there anything actionable in this issue? I feel the requested functionality (besides haptics) is already provided by our vendor specific controls. As a general rule devs won't be interacting often with `tracked-controls` unless you want to integrate a controller that does not have built in support > if you use vive-controls, daydream-controls, oculus-touch-controls... you can listen to events like triggerdown , touchpaddown ... the handle to the entity will be passed to the handler. Look at hand-controls as an example 

This works; I think the OP also wants to know which hand the entity is associated with, and the entity doesn't give an easy way to identify that without iterating over `vive-controls`, `daydream-controls`, `oculus-touch-controls`... but that is not hard to work around, by attaching `id="left"` to the entity yourself.

But the tl;dr here is, if users want behavior attached to a specific hand, it's best to put that behavior in a component on that hand, rather than writing outside event listeners and trying to work backwards to get the Gamepad and hand references.

Other than maybe continuing the haptics conversation somewhere, I don't think changes are needed here then. @donmccurdy agree although doc and example changes may still be relevant Re: declarative handling turning into obfuscation - yeah, often times the handling is placed in a component that is attached to the same entity (and sometimes the dependencies feature of components is used to ensure the right components are attached)  init should br called since the geometry is recreated when the properties change. For advanced, more optimized geometry I would recommend creating a separate component instead of relying on extending the built in primitives  Thanks! I recommend a custom component for now, the `registerGeometry` I think we should even make internal API just for the geometry component.  thanks!  Did this already at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/0f3ff992ae71819e0048f4f04fc36083688a1a10 but hmm builds are erroring. Maybe we have to lock it down without the `^`? OK, I see, can you rebase? Thanks!  Thanks, but it was correct before. Multiple `<a-light>`s. `<a-lights>` is not valid. I wanted to make it plural without having to say `with <a-light> elements`  This should work, we should find out why it isn't.

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/audio/PositionalAudio.js#L82 Thanks, we can take a look for a real solution. I'll test it out now.  Hi @kazandzhiro —

See issues https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1475 and https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2758. For various reasons, we're not able to offer much support for IE11. Specifically in this case, the dependency on TypedArray.prototype.slice goes past A-Frame into some of our three.js dependencies.

That said, I thought this feature was in IE11. Does adding this meta tag in `<head/>` give a different result?

```html
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> 
```

You may also be able to add a [TypedArray polyfill](https://github.com/substack/typedarray) to your page. But generally speaking, we very much recommend using an evergreen browser (Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Chrome, or Safari) with A-Frame.  Hi @vrimaginar — it looks like the model is hitting some sort of GPU limit on your other devices. I don't have enough info to guess what exactly it is, but tl;dr my advice would be to reduce the complexity of your model. 85MB is quite a lot for a mobile device to deal with. In Blender, you can simplify the model with tools like the [Decimate Modifier](https://docs.blender.org/manual/es/dev/modeling/modifiers/generate/decimate.html).

Targeting <15MB is likely to give better results, and more like 1–2 MB if you intend for yours to view your presentation on their cellular connections. Hm. Hard to guess whether it is the model itself, then. I'd be curious if you can remove things from the scene (remove one sky sphere at a time?) and if it starts to work at some point. Try using this build https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/8d60730/dist/aframe-master.min.js where textures get auto disposed when not in use. What may be happening is you are switching between the spheres and the textures in memory accumulate. Also helps is rather than 15 skyspheres, have one at a time and swap out the image  It restarts randomly, while interacting with the scene, in 2D mode, in VR mode? I can't reproduce on my iPhone 7 Plus with https://aframe.io/examples/hello-metaverse/.
@CallumMitchellRV Do you think we can close this? Is it still a problem for you?
 @CallumMitchellRV Can you try with master branch and see if it still reproduces? @CallumMitchellRV thanks for filing this issue. sorry that it's fallen through the cracks. what are your screen-lock settings on your iPhone? the stock, default settings?
 Cool @moyashipan. Thanks for verifying  A PR to fix this landend last night: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2751

Can you make sure you're using the very latest master? The issue is different and mentions that pr Can someone try #2707 and see if it is the old Carmel auto-enter attempt?  Added  Thanks!  @hardiksurana caching is handled through A-Frame's asset management system: https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/core/asset-management-system.html

If you're using inline URLs instead of `<a-assets/>`, you may be circumventing the caching. If you are already using the asset system, could you:

1. Test on the `master` branch of A-frame — we've already fixed some bugs in this area.
2. Add a Codepen or JSFiddle example.

Thanks!

> EDIT: Oops, just saw you mentioned `a-assets` in the title. Anyway, the two suggestions would be the right next steps I think. I think the extra requests were fixed here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2472

So, that fix is in the `master` branch, not 0.5.0, and will be released with A-Frame 0.6.0.

A-Frame doesn't give you direct access to the response status codes, but there should be only one request anyway after these fixes. Hope that helps! I believe the 304 are just browser cache hits? You can check `THREE.Cache` to see if it has been fetched or not  Thanks! Do you want to try opening a pull request to fix it? We can help if you don't know how to Here are the steps for updating our docs, if you're interested, @kkruups — https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#update-documentation Fixed #2777  **Description:**

This is because in [`0.5.0`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/v0.5.0) the [`package.json`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/v0.5.0/package.json#L43) points to [`dmarcos/webvr-polyfill#a02a8089b`](https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill/commit/a02a8089b).

Even though the [`dmarcos/webvr-poylfill`](https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill) moved to [`aframevr/webvr-polyfill`](https://github.com/aframevr/webvr-polyfill), GitHub keeps the old remote URLs around (and just adds deprecation notices). But `npm` does not.

@dmarcos: can you delete https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill and re-fork [`aframevr/webvr-poylyfill`](https://github.com/aframevr/webvr-polyfill/fork)?

(this may require you to delete your original fork from https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill, because GitHub doesn't allow forks of forks.)
 I reforked the polyfill on my account: https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill/

The hash https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill/commit/a02a8089b exists now show npm should fetch it as expected. Just tried and it seems to work. Please reopen if the problem persists
 @dmarcos: Thanks! I see that the commit resolves on GitHub, but I cleared my npm cache and it still won't install properly. I tried `npm cache clean`, `rm -rf ~/.npm`, `npm cache verify`,

<img width="1145" alt="screen shot 2017-06-13 at 6 42 29 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/203725/27111887-26faedf4-5068-11e7-86d5-b7f4f0da7a39.png">

Ideas?
 That screenshot does not seem related to the polyfill. Try deleting your `node_modules` directory and run `npm install` again? Below the result in my windows box:

![install](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/2j402d3h2Q450q270N1p/Image%202017-06-13%20at%206.50.39%20PM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=402ef9a4b6ed079d2b4c220eb45be353&v=d217e0dd).  It says `Command failed: /usr/local/bin/git checkout a02a8089b`.

The commit in question is https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill/commit/a02a8089b. So, it seems to still be the `webvr-polyfill` dependency it's fatal-erring on. I'll try on another machine and clearing my cache too. I just hope others aren't encountering the same problem of trying to install `npm install aframe` once and it not being fixed now.
 Someone else is observing the issue. Additional info: npm `3.10.X` works but more recent versions `5.X.Y` fail. Fails for me on a Windows machine I haven't used in a while. npm 2.15.11. We can cut 0.5.1 on npm, perhaps pointing to a fork on my username to be safe. A workaround to this issue for anyone running into this today until we fix is `npm install aframevr/aframe@0.5.0`. Same issue here. Installation fails with npm 5.X, so I've reverted to npm 4.X. Currently fixing...the commit is on GitHub but no longer on the Git tree. Solution is to publish a fork of the polyfill to npm with the same changes and re-tag v0.5.1. I don't think we need a new tag anymore. I believe I solved the mystery. When I reforked the polyfill in my account the commit showed up on github (https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill/commit/a02a8089b) but just realized that it does not exist in git. Github must have some sort of cache that in same cases is not consistent with the git data base itself. I had the missing commit on a local clone of my old fork that I have pushed again to github. I believe that everything should be fine now without having to republish, re tag.  @clark @DKvistgaard can you confirm if everything is working now? You should not need any changes on your side. It should just work 👏💃 @natesena could you give npm and node.js versions? `npm -v` / `node -v` @natesena What version are you trying to install? I see a reference to your cache in the command out put you pasted. Clearing your cache with `npm cache clean` and reinstalling `npm install aframe` might solve the problem. Let us know.  If you are trying to use the recently added core daydream controller support, the component name is `daydream-controls` if I recall correctly - not `daydream-controller` Does using WebVR API in Chrome on Daydream still need either origin trial token or explicit WebVR feature flag enable?  If so, and you haven't done either, then I would expect requestPresent to fail due to browser denying permission. So wait, if you turn OFF WebVR support (and then are presumably using polyfill not Daydream mode) then I don't think the controller will work.  My understanding is that you have to be in Daydream mode (WebVR enabled) for the controller to do its job. @intensr @caseyyee: this appears to be a dupe of issue #2677. we should close one of the bugs and  address this issue. A little testing of my own...

After a host of updates to Pixel phone and controller (all now on latest), and using Chrome beta (webvr enabled so no origin trial token dependency) with controller example codepen:
 https://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/YQGrWQ
Once you enter VR and click the track pad, since for security the Gamepad API will not provide controller data until the controller is used, the controller is visible (although it required re-home position) and clicks work. @cvan we probably want to work issues with official phone and controller firmware first, then come back to see if that fixes this one.  On Pixel with Chrome beta and latest aframe master, I don't see any issues @intensr the Axon 7 is an official Daydream device, but from original post I understood you were not using the production firmware ("yes its flashed") which I think would be the important Axon variant to support (complicated by the fact that AFAIK no one on current A-Frame team has one).  Using my Pixel that just updated itself and controller to 7.1.2, and Chrome beta with the WebVR flag thrown to work around the codepen-has-no-origin-trial-token issue, the Codepen I mentioned worked as expected with Daydream controller.  edit: there seems to be other issues here at play.

I'll post testing summary for just controller issue into 2677

@cvan I think we can continue to address the enter VR issues here for this device. @intensr if the page you are using is insecure or lacks origin trial token (which is true for Codepen) I think the WebVR flag must be manually enabled, and you need to touch button on the controller after entering VR for it to appear  @intensr sorry if this is obvious but just to make sure w.r.t. the WebVR enable flag you have done  https://webvr.rocks/chromium steps 4 and 5 with your Chrome In Chrome release channel one has to enable the GamepadExtensions in chrome://flags (besides WebVR) in order for the Daydream controller to show up. In Canary this is not necessary. In both cases, Chrome + GampeadExtensions and Canary the controller shows up consistently on https://webvr.info/samples/XX-vr-controllers.html, https://threejs.org/examples/#webvr_daydream and also aframe laser-controls from master when run locally on my machine https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/master/examples/test/laser-controls

@intensr Please use Chrome with WebVR and GamepadExtensions enabled on chrome://flags or Canary. The example included in master should work. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/master/examples/test/laser-controls

Please reopen if it does not. I'm running into the same issue here. Daydream controller works on the webvr.info and threejs.org examples but not on the aframe examples.
Adding the controller to the hello-world example, I got the following state
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/782511/31865332-c5fa284a-b76d-11e7-8af0-f411426cd096.png)
 It looks like some async problem maybe? As If I'm adding breakpoints that slow down the initialization sometimes it works and the controller appears Is that master or 0.7.1? Both Something must have changed on the chrome side @dmarcos could you reproduce it too? I don’t have a daydream around today Go home get one! Everything is on fire! @machenmusik on the first link doesn't work but on the second one yep Git bisecting it right now... :\ It's some kind of async issue, as after getting an absurd bisect commit, I went through your two codepen examples and I reload them several times and I got both of them working and not working.
 I spent hours testing daydream for 0.7.0 and the laser controls example was working rock solid. I’m almost certain that something must have changed on the chrome side Testing on Canary: https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/test/laser-controls/ works fine for me FYI `hand-controls` does not support 3DOF anymore. `laser-controls` is the recommended responsive input.  @dmarcos yep I'm not using `hand-controls` I'm testing always against `laser-controls` and I'm still getting random failures :\ I'll post if I find something Reproducing the issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvODqJ9l_Yc  **Description:**

Barebones stats component, all it does is show one number: FPS.

```html
<a-scene stats>  <!-- 2D stats. --> 
  <a-entity stats position="0 0 -4" text="color: red"></a-entity>  <!-- Rendered stats. -->
</a-scene>
```

Most of the implementation:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('stats', {
  tick: function (t, dt) {
    this.el.setAttribute('text', 'value', 1000 / dt);
  }
});
```

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 hmm, was wondering whether potentially having to re-render glyphs every tick was going to be a performance killer, versus something like the FPS counter on https://webvr.info/samples/02-stereo-rendering.html That seems like a canvas to texture render? I don't think updating a number has a big performance impact, the log component example I did was thrashing five different logging consoles with lots of text and it seemed fine. https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/fps-counter#aframe-fps-counter-component  Thanks!  Ok, so it looks like the `#audiosource` element is no help at all here — presumably the three.js audio system is making its own copy of the sound, in order to do positional audio or something.

Instead, you need to use the element with the sound component attached to it, and then dig into the API a fair bit:

```js
var soundComponent = entity.components.sound;
// NOTE: If the audio file hasn't finished loading, `.source` will be null.
var audioSource = soundComponent.pool.children[0].source;
var audioContext = audioSource.context;
console.log('currentTime: %f', audioContext.currentTime);
```

Here's a demo: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aframe-sound-demo

Clearly this isn't the most discoverable, and it's liable to break if there are multiple sounds in the pool... maybe we should expose a `getContext()` method on the `sound` component, for users to get at this programmatically?  What phone?  Confirmed I also have this issue on Firefox Android 7.0 on a Galaxy S7 Edge with A-Frame 0.5. In A-Frame 0.6 / 0.6.1 it's fine.  Don't think it's appropriate to mention in the context of this page. This guide is several steps into A-Frame and we shouldn't try to protect developers from JS here. Thanks though!  I think the image looks fine, img doesn't need a closing tag and your image is served straight from raw.git which isn't a cdn  Oh, I see. Oh, I see! Sorry. That looks great. If you drag your image into any GitHub issue / pull request comment box, it will upload to CDN. Thanks! Nice image editing work  Hi @zubairq, see previous discussion of this here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1475

A-Frame supports Microsoft Edge, but not IE11. There are both feature and performance issues that make supporting IE11 unrealistic for us. If you're going for a simpler (non-VR) 360º pano experience, you may want to consider [VR View](https://developers.google.com/vr/concepts/vrview-web). For VR content, you will need a newer browser. Yeah I'd use Microsoft edge. Ie11 would be hard to support well. Very minimum we'd need to include a custom event polyfill just for ie @sim3083 do you see any errors in the JavaScript console? @sim3083  Can you run your example with a non minified version to see where it fails? @sim3083 Thanks. Can you click on those errors and see the A-Frame line that it is actually failing? This is because an inconsistency of IE11 CustomEvent implementation where you cannot call `new CustomEvent`. From `CanIuse`:

```
While a window.CustomEvent object exists, it cannot be called as a constructor. Instead of new CustomEvent(...), you must use e = document.createEvent('CustomEvent') and then e.initCustomEvent(...)
```
https://caniuse.com/#feat=customevent It also seems that IE 11 webgl implementation is missing some stuff. Proper custom elements and WebGL are minimum requirements for A-Frame. Is anything preventing you from upgrading from IE11? The `CustomEvent` issue could be special cased for IE 11. I don’t see any solution for the missing WebGL methods and extensions. Unfortuantely A-Frame won’t be able to support IE 11 @zubairq Some of it might work if you don't hit any THREE path that uses any of the WebGL missing extensions or methods. @sim3083 Do you see the same WebSocket error in other browsers besides IE11? @sim3083 The WebSockets error is something particular to your network configuration. The other one is due to the incomplete IE 11 WebGL implementation.  Is there a way we can downgrade Sinon and its peers back? Sinon 2.x has a lot of deprecations that we don't have much time to handle or learn the new API.  This PR has regressed VR mode on desktop. Neither Oculus nor Vive enter VR anymore. Delaying the initialization of VRControls introduce timing issues. Note that VRControls is also asynchronous and we have to somehow handle that asynchrony. The timing was right and the extra delay that this PR introduces affects the initialization timing. This PR is not critical for 0.6.0. I'm going to revert and we revisit later in a follow up PR. @kellyselden feel free to reopen. Make sure that Vive / Oculus enter VR mode.   Perhaps try checking if it's a node environment and not initializing it if so?  Thanks! Maybe would be good to add `Requiring A-Frame in Node` section at like https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/core/globals.html  Thanks, currently looking at it. Having trouble getting Firefox to play sounds at all. I had an issue with a certain sound where I had to re-encode it with ffmpeg just for Firefox. Does it work for you if you try other sounds? Same issue here. I get the following error when adding `preload=auto` to the `<audio>` element where I'm also using `autoplay: true` on the `sound` component that plays the preloaded sound in the scene:

```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to execute 'decodeAudioData' on 'BaseAudioContext': parameter 1 is not of type 'ArrayBuffer'.
```

This is with using `ogg` encoded audio files. It's also worth noting that manually calling `sound.playSound()` after the render loop begins produces the same error. @johnshaughnessy Should we store the file and not the element in the cache? I cannot remember why we store the element. I will have to dig into it. @ngokevin Do you remember the rational?  Sweet! Thanks!  We use `document.createElement` everywhere. It doesn't matter for Node because we don't expect it to be executing any runtime code, right?  We use github issues for bugs and feature requests. For questions please use stackoverflow:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aframe

or our slack channels:

https://aframe.io/community/#slack
 For posterity: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44450241/recording-vr-motion-video  Just a small nit and this is ready to go

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2748/files#r121260759 Great! Thanks for sticking with it. Not many people get their hands dirty with these parts of the code. Thank you very much!  Does this affect Node usage? Or is this for removing those couple lines in the tests?  In discussions over Slack about the need of adding a flag so some components `tick` / `tock` methods have a higher priority made me think. We now have `dependencies`  and `schema` that turn into reserved words. The approach won't scale if we want to keep adding things like the flag mentioned before. We might want to consider consolidating all the fields in a single `config` object:
````javascript
AFRAME.registerComponent('my-component', {
 config: {
   dependencies: { ... }, 
   schema: { ... },
   priorityTick: true
 }, 
 init: function () { ... },
 update: function () {...},
 tick: function () { ... }
});
````
 We can still take the old form and provide a warning message in console for a couple of versions before deprecating. @donmccurdy @ngokevin what do you think? Offhand, I like the idea of having a `config` property, but I'm not sure dependencies and schema should be in it. They feel less like configuration, or at least schema does. Can we think of other properties that make sense? Some ideas:

- `system` name for components that are part of a multi-component system
- `multiple` could be moved into config. really it's not the component configuration as much as the specification though, right?  when I think of configuration, I think of configuration of an instance of the component (which for public properties is `data`) sidebar - I don't think a Boolean `priorityTick` will suffice if we have enough complexity to require prioritization @wizgrav w.r.t. `priorityTick` -- if we're talking pre/post-processing, presumably those need ordered chains / graphs, and a Boolean can't represent any but the most trivial ordering - use a number at minimum, at which point you probably want to call it `tickPriority` - or maybe I misunderstand the use case @wizgrav there you need to be able to specify ordering of systems right?  e.g. this system needs to go after system X...  Note that there is indeed a screenshot facility in A-Frame, is it not yet accommodated correctly? It sounds okay, but I don't think the prototype is much polluted at the moment, and it's not much work for developers to avoid reserved properties. It does sound like work to migrate the component ecosystem however. The whole component definition is sort of like a config in itself as well. But as we add more properties it will harder to avoid the collisions. We have components already that add all sort of stuff like `mapping` , `axisLabels` or their own private methods. maybe when/if we get around to deprecating primitives, this will be more palatable / necessary.
another option, of course, is to keep namespace flat but use a prefix to avoid collisions Prefixes hurt my eyes. No please (the traditional thing is to do something like underscore as prefix, not some further camelCase, but I agree that is somewhat less desirable) It might be pre-emptive as that hasn't been an issue, and even as we add more properties, it's easy to avoid collisions. Also unlikely to hit those collisions as well. Just validate the component prototype and throw errors. A component is likely to try todefine config as the other names. Perhaps if we can batch it with other breaking changes in the future. yeah I think `config` is maybe not the best choice, but something like `meta`, `spec` / `specification`, `properties`, `definition` would be much less likely to clash (and much more obvious a problem if it happened) 

or something more readable like `is` or `has` It's hard to come up with a useful word that means "everything about the component that isn't a method". I was suggesting omitting at least `schema` from the `config`, because it feels conceptually different from primitive configuration values anyway (and something like `tickPriority` does really feel like configuration). I don't think finding a more ambiguous word is helpful — if there are meaningful ways to group properties let's do if; if not, I don't think this is a pressing issue yet. 

For reference, here are Polymer's top-level properties: https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/api/#function-Polymer.Class although it's not arguably better than just a `config` object namespace (which is what I'd suggest, in line with what most folks are as well) – just for the sake of evaluating other options, what about accepting a third argument for the config object?

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('my-component', {
 init: function () { ... },
 update: function () {...},
 tick: function () { ... }
}, {
  dependencies: { ... },
  schema: { ... }
});
```

if there are three arguments, use this format. if there are only two arguments, go with what @dmarcos said and continue to allow that format to work and print a `console` deprecation warning, keeping things backwards compatible until the release of the first A-Frame major version (`1.0.0`).

 Sorry this was finished   Thank you!  Thanks! This PR does not look right. Can you make sure you branch of an up to date master branch? Only the commits you are adding should appear in the diff  Yeah, duping with that. I'll put an update in that issue.  **Description:**

Previous attempt at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2726

There was previously logic at the Entity level for updates to merge the existing properties into the new data set. That logic was removed since more data-building logic now lives in the component. But there was no logic to merge the existing properties when it came to the cached `attrValue`.

In the future, I think it might be nice to rename that to `rawData`.

**Changes proposed:**
- When updating `this.attrValue`, merge in the previous data if not clobbering.
 Good stuff!  Yeah, perhaps, want to try to remove it?  You should submit a PR from the latest master and only including the commit or commits with the proposed changes.

Again, Kumaresh. Please ask on Stack Overflow, provide code to show that you tried, and show what you tried.  This was filed a couple days ago. Closed with solution at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2708 It's expensive. Better to call the refresh method on demand rather than hacking in mutation observers and running selector refreshes 90 times per second. If you really want to do it, you can create a component that force refreshes the raycaster on your desired interval.  When the ` gearvr-controls` component is used and tested on actual hardware, the controller model rotates around a point in space outside the models geometry. I haven't tested with another model yet to determine if it's an issue with the GearVR controller model itself or if it's an a-frame bug or polyfill issue.

Since the Gear VR Controller is 3DOF, its positional information is approximated using a simplistic arm model, which you can see at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/tracked-controls.js.  By specific request during PR discussion, the parameters of the arm model were removed from the component schema, so unfortunately it is not as easy as one would like to tweak or turn off. @HAZARDU5 so I believe the behavior you are describing is the correct functionality of the arm model for 3DOF and not a bug.  Are you making a request to make the arm model parameters accessible (or capability to turn off the arm model) ?  If so, we should probably change the issue title. Yeah I guess so - could we expose the arm model parameters? @dmarcos thoughts re: exposing controls for 3DOF arm model?  goes back to prior PR discussions a bit, I know you and @ngokevin preferred keeping private, but unless they will be maintained as part of core, may be better to open up or perhaps componentize Customizing the arm model could be useful in instances where you want the controller's gyro sensors to directly control an object in a scene and have the controller rotate around a point at 0,0,0 inside the model. E.g. I use the laser pointer to take a model toy off a shelf then it switches to a zoomed in view of the model that follows the camera and allows the toy to follow the rotation of the controller 1:1. Or for another example, the user can rotate the controller to tilt a labyrinth style maze where a ball, affected by physics, must be guided to the end of the maze. It'd be great to be able to do this without having to do some serious hacks to correct for the arm model offsets during transformations.  Hi @richardanaya — Do you have a particular workflow in mind, for bringing PBR materials in from Substance Designer? We could certainly add support for `material.roughnessMap` and `material.metalnessMap`, but I'm not sure that specifying 3-4 textures in your HTML is the ideal workflow. Also note that the `material` component doesn't necessarily work with external models; it's most often used with primitives like cubes and spheres.

If the final goal is to be able to import a model coming from Blender/C4D/Maya along with textures created in Substance Suite, I think the best option would be to export into a single format that already supports PBR. The current version of `gltf-model` does not yet, but when the glTF 2.0 spec is ready you will be able to use that. Here are some examples: https://github.com/cx20/gltf-test/tree/2.0#pbr-models

Specifically, from Substance Painter, you would export textures with the Unreal Engine 4 Occlusion-Roughness-Metallic preset, using OpenGL (not DirectX) settings.  @richardanaya Is there any easy to use tool out there to create those roughness / metalness maps without being a skilled artist? I would like to play with one and see if I can get something pretty. I guess there's also value on reuse maps created by real skilled artist like yourself right? It would be nice, and we're already currently supporting some of the other types of maps. But they don't get much usage, there's not much of an audience. For someone that is new enough to be relying on basic shapes, but is knowledgable enough to know about or how to use roughness or metalness maps.

> Having roughnessMap and metalnessMap could allow seamless PBR textures for less skilled artists.

So I say this is sort of an assumption that people would pick it up versus using like glTF. Something we *could* do, but whether we *should*? I haven't seen much demand. I wanted it before, but Don convinced me they're more advanced features that people would rather just create your own three.js material or use loaders. Thoughts? > I agree that building with primitives is a good start as a gateway to working with Blender and more sophisticated modelling tools.... Some things that are missing from aframe that are useful in SL are things like path cut, hollow, twist, and shear.

I do understand the challenge of getting started with 3D modeling software, but A-Frame is not intended to be a gateway to Blender. Declarative HTML is great for composing a scene, and adding interactivity, but polygon-based modeling is a whole different ballgame.. Better to have realtime interactivity for that, not an edit/refresh cycle. Even three.js doesn't attempt to support that, and there are libraries built on top of three.js to handle simple things like boolean operations. I would be happy to discuss this further in another thread, if someone would like to open one... my opinion at present is that tools like MagicaVoxel, Paint3D, or Tilt Brush are better stepping stones to 3D modeling.

Someone could _use_ A-Frame to build something like A-Painter, except for 3D geometry, and that would be awesome. Or, similarly, a tool that lets you drag-and-drop a model and some textures, and have it baked into a `glTF`. But those should be layers on top of A-Frame, not built in.

> I wanted it before, but Don convinced me they're more advanced features that people would rather just create your own three.js material or use loaders. Thoughts?

I'd be OK with adding `roughnessMap` and `metalnessMap` as described here... There are other maps on the `material` component, so it doesn't really introduce any new code paths or new concepts for users to understand. But I do still think (in reference to the earlier issue we discussed) that exposing settings on the textures themselves (e.g. `material.metalnessMap.wrapS`) is pretty advanced and doesn't make much sense with primitives.

These two proposed maps are no less common than `ambientOcclusionMap`. They're probably more common, actually? So my vote would be to go ahead and include them, even though they won't be used heavily. Substance B2M looks like it could give some interesting results with these maps.
 Hmm I'm having second thoughts. To add some context from #2721, apparently `ambientOcclusionMap` never worked to begin with, and was never reported as a bug.

> Even though i'm artist who's capable of using blender3d and exporting fancy models with fancy maps, a more simpler VR artist may only know how to use primitives and seamless repeatable textures. Having roughnessMap and metalnessMap could allow seamless PBR textures for less skilled artists to create powerful materials on simple objects.

@richardanaya could you give a concrete example of what a new artist might do with "powerful materials on simple objects"? Ideally including a seamless PBR texture we can try out? I'm not opposed to supporting this, but having a hard time convincing myself that people would use it. Thanks for the detailed response — Concretely though, what sort of a scene could I make with this technique? Can you provide a seamless texture that looks OK on primitive shapes?

For example, something like this:

```html
<a-box material="src: ...;
                 normalMap: ...;
                 metalnessMap: ...;
                 roughnessMap: ...;"></a-box>
```

I can't think of a real scene where you would want this level of detail on boxes and spheres, without also caring about UVs.

With (4) you are referring to artists who can model, and we need to clarify that the `material` component does not work well at all with arbitrary models. Only boxes, spheres, and the other primitive shapes. So we're talking about users who have paid Allegorithmic subscriptions, but who can't make a cube in Blender, assign textures to it, and export? This seems like a rare creature. 🙃  @CarlBateman The case you're describing is adding maps to a 3D model, and the `material` component can't modify 3D models at all, except for OBJs that don't have a material already. So even if we added metal/rough texture support, it wouldn't solve that problem for you. The `material` component is typically used for adding materials to primitive objects, and metal/rough maps on cubes and spheres is just not a very common need.

> My 3D artist works with Maya which, apparently, can't export shiny, and converting to glTF is not an option (their preferred format is fbx, which is proving to be a nightmare).

Why is converting not an option? I understand that client requirements can be tricky and out of your control, but this is similar to saying "my artist works in Photoshop and exporting to .JPG is not an option, so we must embed .PSD files in our website." If tools like [FBX2glTF](https://github.com/facebookincubator/FBX2glTF) are just not working for your models that's a valid issue of course.

EDIT: For the case of shiny materials, Maya's Stingray PBS materials can be converted to glTF metal/rough using FBX2glTF. The author of the converter is quite responsive to bugs, if that's not working for you.

> In time, glTF will likely be widely supported, but unfortunately that's not the case now. Shouldn't A-Frame try to support existing formats and properties as well as possible to minimise friction with the limited tools we have available to us?

In my opinion, the cost of supporting FBX is astronomical. THREE.FBXLoader has been around for years and is still unreliable, despite having extremely capable people maintaining it. I'd much rather invest in tools for converting FBX to web-friendly formats, using Autodesk's SDKs. I secretly want to default A-Frame to `lambert` or `phong`. `MeshStandardMaterial` is overkill and no one ever uses its features, and it's not really meant to be configured by hand (more as an export material). Switch to `lambert` for improved performance across the board and developers that need standard just create a simple component. > Yes, fbx is a nightmare, but that's what I was given initially. Now, we're using obj.

Ok, yeah OBJ has limited features but is reliable enough. That's a valid situation for the metal/rough params with `material`, I expect we will be supporting OBJ indefinitely.

FWIW I just did a quick test with Maya LT, FBX2glTF, and a Stingray PBS material — worked surprisingly smoothly:

> Is it THAT easy to write a component for MeshStandardMaterial?

If the default were changed, you'd be able to opt back into standard with `material="shader: standard; src: ...;"`. No new component needed. >  Is it THAT easy to write a component for MeshStandardMaterial?

Yeah. You would want to do it anyways since the current standard material doesn't support every parameter, which you'd need to make it seem actually PBR. If you're not using env maps or all the params, then PBR is pointless. Don't have to make it agnostic either:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('my-crate-material', {
  dependencies: ['geometry'],

  init: function () {
    this.el.getObject3D('mesh').material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
      // Add your parameters.
    });
  }
});
```

When I build apps, I often don't use the default materials. I optimize it so my app only has a few materials with spritemapped textures. Something like this:

<img width="711" alt="screen shot 2017-12-16 at 5 14 23 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1848368/34075735-ade17d52-e284-11e7-9f06-0261d69aaf8b.png">

Haven't got a shiny metal around but I think the key thing there is to include an environment map as @ngokevin said. Can't include `envMap` with OBJ or glTF inside the file, so it would need to be added in JS. Test with https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/ to get a preview that includes envMap automatically.

Substance Painter can also export glTF these days, that might be a viable way to stitch your OBJ files and PBR textures together into a glTF. I proposed phong to become the default because the vast majority of developers do not use PBR features. Phong becoming default doesn't stop anyone from using standard, it's a few lines of code to whip up a material component that does what you need. It's in your best interest given the current standard is half-baked anyways. That's the foundation of A-Frame is you don't need permission to add a feature you need.
 
We try to be constructive and offer solutions. We don't consider only two types of users. In fact the opposite. We interface with thousands of developers and have examined hundreds of applications and are aware of general needs. Phong looks worse. Many people expressed in the past how pleasent looks a-frame by default. All modern engines and pipelines are moving to PBR. Better to get aligned with the rest of the industry sooner than later. For better or worse I don't think Phong would improve performance in a meaningful way, it's not that different from MeshStandardMaterial really. Lambert or unlit would, but they're less appropriate as defaults.

The recommendation of glTF has clear technical reasons, beyond "flavor of the month" status. OBJ and COLLADA do not support PBR at all. FBX technically does, but that isn't well defined, and is unreliable as a runtime format in ways that I never expect to see fixed.

I would be OK with reopening #2722 for the purpose of adding metal/rough to OBJ files via the `material` component, which might make some beginner-friendly workflows a bit easier. This would also allow metal/rough use on primitives although I don't recommend doing that in practice.  Refreshing the objects involved query selector and processing through the objects. If you want to refresh the raycaster for corner cases such as these, you can call el.components.raycaster.refreshObjects on demand I think the raycaster filters out objects with material.visible = false by default  Thanks for filing. I'd rather this be maintained outside since it benefits a smaller number of users but adds more maintenance to the project. A-Frame's API is also primarily through the DOM and already has a type system with component schemas so the benefit seems minimal. > A-Frame's API is also primarily through the DOM and already has a type system with component schemas so the benefit seems minimal.

I think the point is less that A-Frame's API especially needs a type system, and more that A-Frame users may want to use TypeScript in their own applications (for whatever reason), and doing so is extremely painful if your dependencies do not have correct typings. For example, the BabylonJS ecosystem is TS, and it would be nice to accommodate those users coming from that background.

For the question of whether those typings should be in A-Frame's repo or not:

1) If typings were in the repo, how are they served? Is there an entry in `package.json` like `"typings": "typings.d.ts"` or something? Or are they bundled into the build explicitly?
2) By adding typings to the repo, do we get any advantage for maintaining them? Specifically, could typings be generated from our JSDoc automatically?

If the `.d.ts` file will have to be updated by hand regardless, then I think it would be better to maintain it outside of this repo — none of us are using TS here, and it's likely to go stale. If we can automate the typings here in a way that wouldn't be possible in another repo, I'm open to that. I'm in favor to keep it separate as well, keep an eye on adoption and reevaluate in the future. I don't know much about TypeScript but for those that want to develop their own components, is there space for a`ts-aframe-boilerplate`? That bundles the `t.ds` for you with your components? Is there anything actionable in this issue? Can we close / archive? Thanks for giving a Typescript perspective using a-frame.  Going to close for now. Thanks!  Thanks. I made a Glitch https://glitch.com/~abrasive-orchid for this I don't get issues with 1000 `<a-plane>`s on my laptop or desktop. Can you check the Glitch and see if you reproduce or see what needs to be changed?  **Description:**

Wait for `controllerconnected` event and check the `evt.detail.name` matches `vive-controls` or `oculus-touch-controls`.

I think we can wait until `controllerconnected` to start the XHR for the hand-model OBJ/MTL. I would strongly suggest that in the data schema there should be an array of strings that are component names to both attach initially and respond to upon controller connected, that defaults to whatever you like (here, vive-controls and oculus-touch-controls) @jselmani good catch! yes, this should be fixed in 0.7.0  Thanks!

I would like to discard that it's not a problem with the particular GPU / drivers that your phone has. @AngelFQC what about no WebVR exampless? Can you click trough all of them and see if there's any crashes? I would like to see if the are any WebGL incompatibilites with your phone regardless of WebVR.  Chromium is actively being looked at https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/pull/267 and we're actively testing browsers... thanks for being patient. @stevel4857 Can you provide browser / links to demos you're trying? aframe.io works for me on Vive and Oculus / Windows 10 / Nightly. This issue is about Firefox for Android. Are you also testing on it? @stevel4857 you may be having the nvidia driver issue I had - roll back to 378.92 I'm on 381.78 drivers and everything works for me (GTX 1080 / Windows 10 / Vive / Nightly)   I think GLTF2Loader will be ready for A-Frame v0.7.0, but I'm not sure COLLADA2GLTF and the Blender exporter will be updated to glTF2.0 quickly enough. We may not want to bump `gltf-model` until the workflows are stabilized. There is also a tool for upgrading glTF1.0 assets to glTF2.0, so if that's reliable then maybe we don't have to wait on other stuff. We could also have both `gltf-model` and `gltf2-model`, but since three.js is planning to drop GLTFLoader eventually, I think that makes less sense.

For now, I have a `gltf-model-next` component in aframe-extras. glTF 2.0 has been released!
https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-gltf-2.0-specification Yay!

I think my vote would be:

- Plan to upgrade to three.js r85 for A-Frame 0.7.0.
- Update `gltf-model` from GLTFLoader to GLTF2Loader then, without renaming the component.

Waiting for 0.7.0 also buys some time for the tooling, since COLLADA2GLTF updates haven't been merged yet.
 And one more thing.
Make sure to use the latest Blender glTF exporter version.
Recently it's fixed a skinning bug. Quick recap of my thoughts on timing here:

1. THREE.GLTF2Loader is stable already, available in three.js r85 and r86.
2. If we swap GLTF2Loader for GLTFLoader under the hood in `gltf-model`, that will be a breaking change. glTF1.0 models will no longer be compatible. Is that OK? Shall I just create a `gltf-model-legacy` component in aframe-extras, similar to the `gltf-model-next` component I'm maintaining now?
3. glTF blender exporter supports glTF 2.0, COLLADA2GLTF does not yet. I'm hopeful that COLLADA2GLTF can be ready by the time a-frame 0.7.0 would be released.
4. Does upgrading to r85 or r86 mean we need to migrate from VREffect to ArrayCamera (or something)?

tl;dr my vote is to add glTF2.0 in A-Frame 0.7.0, IFF there is not some blocking issue related to VREffect deprecation in new versions of three.js.
 I forget which version of three.js removes the VREffect, but just doing a straight upgrade to GLTF2 for 0.7.0 and having a legacy one somewhere sounds good to me. re ArrayCamera was introduced in r85 but is still not ready for production as, for example, we don't have frustum culling working properly, hopefully that would be solved on r87.
+1 for upgrading to gltf2 and leave v1 as legacy. So if we upgrade to r86 now, we can continue using VREffect as usual? @donmccurdy I think so.  If `renderer.vrEnabled === false` everything should behave as it does now. I think so too, but we need to do some testing because the `WebVRManager` was introduced on the renderer itself and many things rely on that, like setting the viewport, calling rAF, so I don't know if it could have side effects if using vreffect  fixed  Support questions should go to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aframe and please provide more information

cc @machenmusik @cvan for a look-see. Cool, will also check it out. I wonder if the Gamepad ID changed. Does `navigator.getGamepads()` return anything when presenting? If it does what is the `id` of the gamepad returned? We're expecting `Daydream Controller`. Has that changed in Chrome / Canary?  The webvr.info examples don't filter by id but take whatever first gameapd they encountered. If I have to bet Chrome just changed the `id` string and we just have to update it here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/daydream-controls.js#L10

Only seems to work on the webvr.info/samples site. @caseyyee is that an `origin-trials` side effect? Maybe you have to go and enable webvr on `chrome://flags/`? Yeah, don't know.  I've also been using https to make sure that's a non issue as well. OK interesting.  If I let it sit for a while, it will start to work.  Not sure why there is a delay.  Definetly some kind of weird inconsistency.    > OK interesting. If I let it sit for a while, it will start to work. Not sure why there is a delay. Definetly some kind of weird inconsistency.

Order does matter. I'm not sure how things are staggered, but this is the explicit order: query for `VRDisplay`s (or `VRDisplay`events), and then query for `Gamepad`s:

```js
let gamepad = null;
navigator.getVRDisplays().then(displays => {
  let gamepad = navigator.getGamepads()[0];
});
window.addEventListener('vrdisplaypresentchange', () => {
  gamepad = navigator.getGamepads()[0];
});
```

Let me know if that works. If truly required, this explicit order is a little troubling, since it is perfectly reasonable for an experience to provide gamepad functionality outside VR, as well as inside  > If truly required, this explicit order is a little troubling, since it is perfectly reasonable for an experience to provide gamepad functionality outside VR, as well as inside 

I 100% agree. I'd look at these spec issues: w3c/webvr#184 and w3c/webvr#30 (and its follow-up issue: w3c/webvr#194). Feel free to chime in as well; developer ergonomics are important to address in these specs before these APIs' implementations ship to users.
 Should try to fix for 0.6.0 yes?  If the timing issue is indeed the culprit, then do we need to ensure that getVRDisplays has returned before we allow the tracked-controls system to actually call getGamepads?  If so, is there any reliable way to tell whether that has been done (e.g. scene property) ? See latest comments from me on #2769, am not seeing errors mentioned Hey there, as an extra data point.

Here's my tests and what I saw with the Pixel XL this morning:

https://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/YQGrWQ
https://iridescent-team.glitch.me/
https://threejs.org/examples/?q=day#webvr_daydream

For all examples:

Does't work with standard Chrome. No controller at all.
Controller only works after interacting or letting it sit for some time (consistent with testing per Issue 2677) before becoming active with both Canary and Beta. > Does't work with standard Chrome. No controller at all.

do you have an origin trials tag on any of those that would enable native WebVR via Daydream?
Codepen is a no.  Frankly, mine are probably expired and I need to update them.
Glitch is probably a no.
Not sure about three.js...

Do you have the flag thrown manually on Canary and Beta?
If you manually set the flag on standard Chrome, does it suddenly start behaving the same?
 anyone able to answer questions above in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2677#issuecomment-303395005?
 > Controller only works after interacting or letting it sit for some time (consistent with testing per Issue 2677) before becoming active with both Canary and Beta.

I thought that interacting was supposed to be required, for security/privacy purposes.  The fact that "letting it sit for some time" works surprises me, maybe that's the race condition mentioned above
 @dmarcos should this be closed like https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2769#issuecomment-308577969 ? Closing this because for the reasons explained here:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2769#issuecomment-308577969 (not closed yet?)  Thanks and congrats for the first contribution!   `text="align: center"`

Also https://github.com/mayognaise/aframe-html-shader/pull/12 is an option for rendering HTML/CSS as a texture. Slightly expensive to compute, but perhaps cheaper than pulling in and rendering glyphs? I suppose `text.padding` wouldn't be too bad. The text auto width was intended to size the text width to the geometry, not the geometry to the text width - you can't automatically size both height and width, you need to pick something as a FRAME of reference.  Is it a more common case to want arbitrary width based upon fixed height, rather than arbitrary height (including line wrap) based upon fixed width?  If so, perhaps we should add some switches for that (whether it's padding, or something else)  There are a failing tests we have look at  I believe this should be filed against the inspector not aframe. @fernandojsg Moved to https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector/issues/475  The camera doesn't handle any of that logic. `active` just refers to the user's camera, but a camera can be inactive but still controlled. You can `.removeAttribute('look-controls')` temporarily.  Can you point to an example that reproduces the issue? Thanks @darioodiaz can you provide more information on the specific model of phone that exhibits the problem?  my suspicion is that it does not support a OpenGLES extension the default font's text shader is using.  Can you also try one or more of the non-default stock fonts like kelsonsans? of specific interest: `GL_OES_standard_derivatives` Any errors on console like in the lines of `extension XXX not supported`? If there is a good way to determine whether the shader should use highp or mediump this might be straightforward to fix, but I don't have anything to test it with  yes, there is actually a PR to aframe polyfill to fix this already, but perhaps it hasn't been merged into the version you are using.  @dmarcos do you recall where this stands? looks like this isn't merged / used yet
https://github.com/aframevr/webvr-polyfill/pull/4

the specific change is
https://github.com/chenzlabs/webvr-polyfill/commit/87130ae1ffb8d5c33fe78dc10ea4a0da279eb173

which should be built into
`chenzlabs/webvr-polyfill#avoid-touchstart-collision`


 so the odd part is that it had fixed it at least at one point, but clearly it won't now.  would you like to submit your change as separate PR, and I can close that one? LOL I closed googlevr/webvr-polyfill#229 in favor of yours, but I left mine in aframevr/webvr-polyfill for now just in case you didn't base yours on the commit at which aframevr and googlevr diverged (and thus you might run into the problem I did with dragging in other changes unintentionally) @gordonbrander if you can submit that to aframevr as well, and it doesn't drag in a bunch of other changes from googlevr, let me know and I will close mine @gordonbrander just rebase yours on this commit and you'll be all set

https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/commit/4787fe5546e33bb82b9a3981245f39d9e1e136ba ok, closing my aframevr polyfill PR as well so you can do yours, thanks welcome aboard @gordonbrander ! The issue stems from how `tracked-controls` handles events.  daydream-controller doesn't use `tracked-controls` but instead runs its own copy of that functionality.  @dmarcos @ngokevin perhaps we should change the internal event names to avoid collision, at the risk of breaking some existing usage? @machenmusik what collision are you talking about? I cannot tell by the previous conversation. IIRC `tracked-controls` emits events named `touchstart` and `touchend` that clash with the actual mobile events, and mobile Chrome does not appear to allow CustomEvent to set the `touched` array which lies outside event detail. Seems like fixed in polyfill.  thanks for the interest. if you're referring to HLS video streaming (which iOS uses), see PR #2597. if you're referring to just normal video streaming, browsers handle that fine as is. if you're referring to DASH video support? that can be easily supported in WebGL/three.js, but nobody has written a third-party A-Frame component for it yet, but one could be easily written to support DASH video streaming.

 what needs to be done is to get what you want playing as a video element, then you can reference that video element by selector for A-Frame to use it.

Thanks,
Don  That distortion in the poles is an artifact of the consumer cameras used to capture 360 panoramas. Usually 2 fish-eye lenses on opposite sides that capture 180 degrees. The only way to fix that is using multi camera rigs that minimize distortion across the whole sphere. (e.g https://shop.gopro.com/virtualreality/omni---all-inclusive/MHDHX-006.html). There's nothing we can do on the aframe side. which versions/commits do we see this problem with?  0.5.0?  latest master? Can you share a link to a working demo that reproduces the problem? The distortion at the poles is a common effect of equirectangular projected 360 images. There's less information per pixel. You can see how any 360 photo on flicker you display also presents the same issues:

https://www.flickr.com/groups/360degrees/pool/ I see what you mean about distortion

but I don't recall this happening in prior versions, wondering if it is dimensions distortion (effectively clipping the picture which is bad for equirect) or insufficient sphere tesselation

it is certainly possible to deal with entirely in shader (compute texture coordinates based on observed long/lat regardless of shape) which is probably along the lines of Pannellum suggestion above.

will try to find some time to take a closer look
 so far, looks like the default geometry settings for sphere used by a-sky have insufficient detail and exhibit visible distortion... increasing detail mitigates

http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/PmQLyR @starwaver can you confirm that increasing detail of playback surface fixes for you? (see codepen)

@dmarcos should we consider increasing default detail? @starwaver do you have a CORS-friendly URL of an example image to do in a codepen? @starwaver so it turns out that for your codepen, the problem is this: whereas videos automatically set the non-power of two flag, apparently images don't, and so you get distortion from the resampling the browser does.  the magic missing piece is `material="npot:true"`

http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/wdmjQb

so there are two pieces to this: 
(1) default geometry for a-sky and a-videosphere are not high enough to avoid easily visible distortion at poles -- fix is to increase segmentsWidth and/or segmentsHeight
(2) support for non-power-of-two textures is only enabled by default for video, so other asset types may experience distortion due to resampling

@dmarcos @ngokevin @cvan can one of you please reopen this issue? and would you agree that the stock values in core should probably be adjusted to compensate?
 @machenmusik I'm ok with increasing the sphere segments. 
People should be submitting power of two textures. Not sure if that should be enabled. yes most distortion for images is npot / resampling / mipmap, i think -- there are more fidelity gains to be had by slightly more detailed sphere, but rapidly diminishing tradeoffs beyond 64 segments, IMO thanks @cvan for reopening!
@dmarcos unless one of you gets to it first, I will do a PR that enables npot by default for images, and maybe bumps up segments for default spheres (will need to do a little testing to see what works best) > People should be submitting power of two textures.

The reality is that requiring power of two almost never really works in practice, as very very few devices have native power of two capture resolutions, and the quality loss from resampling is demonstrably worse than mipmap / interpolation compromises... thus this issue exists :-) @bryik yup, now I remember why I did a PR for that parameter! ;-) I think what is happening is that `npot:true` also disables mipmap (which is another potential source of resampling which ends up looking like distortion at poles) looks MUCH better now, I think we can close this? 
http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/ZKoWLe
http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/pPVyNE (@starwaver now we can see the underlying stitch errors from your camera rig that @dmarcos meant originally)  @shaunmnemonic Please reoopen if you can reproduce on master   so unless i misunderstand, this will attempt to fix a mobile issue with autoplay by forcing play on first click, but without really understanding that the video should be playing so may actually start videos that should remain paused? also the fix does not appear to be constrained to apply only to mobile / cases known to require it... is that safe? btw, after I get this one out of the way, I have one final PR: a patch (client-side only too) that fixes the cross-origin video playback issues on iOS (e.g., for videos hosted on CDN) 🎉 @machenmusik: I know you've been dabbling in that realm quite a bit.

tested on Android and iOS, and all appears good should probably test on rift/vive with a video that shouldn't autoplay to ensure do no harm.
maybe fire an event or two so "tap to play" ux can be displayed/dismissed? apologies that I am not currently in a position to test on iOS (had borrowed a device but returned it) > maybe fire an event or two so "tap to play" ux can be displayed/dismissed?

I'm just handling `autoplay`, yeah. I don't want to add video controls for non-autoplay video; that would make too many assumptions about the content IMO. and, FWIW, desktop already doesn't have video controls/toggles. [this component](https://github.com/oscarmarinmiro/aframe-video-controls) I think is a good place to start (until browsers start shipping with their own consistent video 360° controls). right, I didn't mean actually implementing any UX for it in core, just the events that would be needed to do so (since otherwise it's kinda cryptic, and if you actually have to present UX without the events in core, you have to do yourself anyway, negating the benefits in moving handling into core).  I basically do this now at higher level (when you call play, set a timeout to check if it actually did anything, if not present some ux and attach self-removing handler) @machenmusik Thanks, that I agree with. I had a long response, but it got lost in my tabs. Basically it was to the effect of this:

Chrome for Android and Safari on iOS & desktop have the same initial requirements now: `<video autoplay>` with an audio source or `videoEl.muted === false` require an initial user-gesture requirement for playback.

That's my only intention of addressing in this PR (and in a follow-up PR: the [infamous CORS Safari bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135379)).

<hr>

The [`aframe-video-controls` A-Frame component](https://github.com/oscarmarinmiro/aframe-video-controls) is a good place to prototype what "controls" look like, beyond the obvious `<video autoplay>` case to handle.

FWIW, Samsung's got built-in 360° video controls (built proprietarily to start, to get something out the door). It looks like the next browser likely to ship 360° video controls (but this time as a "standards-compliant solution") is the Oculus Browser/WebVR team (in coordination with React VR); there will be no manual touch user-gesture requirement (`vrdisplayactivate` will just be triggered). And, I'm not aware of Google's status of adding support in Chrome, but it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine Google's working on 360° video controls now or in the near future. Lastly, I think I can speak for the folks at Mozilla when I say Firefox and Servo would like to add in-chrome  360° video controls, but it's currently not on our list of prioritized bugs (as of now).

Thanks for the feedback. Hope that answers some questions too. @dmarcos given my comment above, this look good to you? @cvan per conversation, does this emit an event when installing the tap/click to play handler?  standard html video events can be used to detect play, but maybe not installing the handler > @cvan per conversation, does this emit an event when installing the tap/click to play handler? standard html video events can be used to detect play, but maybe not installing the handler

not _installing_, but upon playing, yes. do you think there ought to be an event? and, if so, should it be emitted on the `<video>` element in `<a-assets>` _and_ fired on the `<a-entity>`? (if a video URL is provided instead of a `src` to `<video>`, A-Frame creates its own `<video>` behind the scene, so the event wouldn't be incredibly useful in that case.)

I can add an event. what are the use cases you're thinking for that? (besides just good measure?) The use case is literally to present some UX (say, head locked a-text "Tap/click to play") when the code added in this PR determines that it is required.  That UX should only be visible when said click handler is required to be installed (which my usual code at this point does isMobile() to help filter out, IIRC).  

If you're not going to constrain this behavior to mobile (or specific UA behavior as you detailed in comments) I do wonder if some testing/experimentation is needed in case non-mobile cases have a sufficient delay before playing that it looks like the not-going-to-play mobile case (e.g. if the video takes a long time to buffer initially). > The use case is literally to present some UX (say, head locked a-text "Tap/click to play") when the code added in this PR determines that it is required.

I was thinking more to handle this with a poster 360° image/skybox (à la `<video poster="example.png" src="example.mp4"></video>`): #1271

I'd like to get video playback to work first before adding a UI, as any defaults – even if they're necessary – can prove to be quite intrusive for users. IMO, it's best to start with no controls but get playback working out of the box, and then add controls shortly thereafter. It's harder to remove a UI (and it could complicate users' experiences if the UI changes a lot, `<video>` 360° controls get standardised, etc.) than it is to add a UI.

In my follow-up PR for iOS, I do sniffing for Safari (for the WebKit CORS bug). This is a good point you bring up. At the very least, I think it'd probably make sense for me to sniff for Safari _or_ Chrome for Android; that would get `autoplay` video playback working for the majority of the use cases.

And with a `poster` image (#1271), as soon as a user clicks anywhere on the page (including clicking the `Enter VR` button), a 360° video would play. It's really great 👍

Thanks for the feedback; this helped a ton. I really appreciate it.
 re: poster, sometimes the ux that should be displayed for click-to-play is a property of the page/site and not the video, so maybe less tied to the poster that would normally be attached to the video.

I agree that we don't need to include ux here, but as we are modifying the usual event handling to do something smarter for click-to-play, I do think we should emit a click-to-play event on the A-Frame entity, or the scene as an alternative, as the A-Frame event handling markup doesn't understand the video element really.  Then authors can do whatever event handling for their UX with typical A-Frame semantics. I just tried this on an iphone 7 Plus and I cannot get the video to play. I loaded the `tests\videoshpere` example and video does not play when tapping on VR mode. Can anyone get the video to play? > I just tried this on an iphone 7 Plus and I cannot get the video to play.

if you copy a video file from the Uploadcare URLs and move them to the `examples/` directory, you can see it working.

if you use Safari on macOS to Remotely Debug your iPhone, you'll see the Console is littered with CORS errors. that's the "infamous CORS bug" I referred to in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2657#issuecomment-300490769 and https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2657#issuecomment-300164119

I have a branch locally, the second PR of these mobile video issues, which addresses that - using a workaround trick with Blobs.

<hr>

we could have an `.mp4` video sample checked in to `examples/` directory of this repo. as long as we aren't adding more than one, I think we should be fine re: the repo size. (plus, it'd make it easier for folks doing offline development, if they forgot to download the videos first.)

so if you download https://ucarecdn.com/fadab25d-0b3a-45f7-8ef5-85318e92a261/city.mp4 and save it to `examples/boilerplate/360-video/city.mp4` and update the video path in `examples/boilerplate/360-video/index.html` to point `city.mp4`, you should see it all working.

let me know if you're still having issues or have questions. thanks 👍 
 the CORS "fix" is unlikely to work with HLS video, so if it is going to be introduced into core can we please either verify HLS survives it, or place appropriate video type guards? > the CORS "fix" is unlikely to work with HLS video, so if it is going to be introduced into core can we please either verify HLS survives it, or place appropriate video type guards?

yep, I'll test it with HLS and let you know - thanks 👍 
 I expected logic to detect whether `autoplay` is specified to determine whether to start playing the video or not on that gesture. How does that work?

And perhaps easier to test if you include that follow up PR here to see if we can get it working on iOS.  @cvan I think this is not too far from being mergable.

@machenmusik: which videos are you testing with? so I can test large videos and real-world HLS/DASH examples?
 @cvan given the potential CORS issues with content, am wondering whether we should convert the iPhone friendly version of stock MP4 into HLS (MP2TS) so that an A-Frame demo showing iOS HLS would actually work right... which would also be the source you need to test here

I think the original three.js ticket for iOS HLS had some streams, I remember seeing an example in there with an ultralight but don't recall the specific name (much less the URL) @machenmusik do you have a URL of a video example?
 @cvan let me try to quickly make HLS from @Utopiah's https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1846#issuecomment-309201624 ...
see https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2830 @machenmusik as you know, video policies need to be handled quite uniquely such that user activation is respected properly based on the audio/video media being played (or autoplayed). I still maintain that this should be handled properly out of the box in A-Frame core, not as a third-party component.

if I address the outstanding review comments, is there any chance that this would be merged? I ask based on the feedback on related PRs and issues concerning video playback (not only for Safari on desktop and iOS, but also for Android - both for Randall's new GeckoViewVR APK, existing Chrome-based browsers).

Provide out-of-the-box way for attaching laser cursor to controllers, mapping the events, creating a line.

https://github.com/bryik/aframe-controller-cursor-component

Possible API brainstorm:

```
<a-camera>
  <a-entity cursor></a-entity>
</a-camera>

<a-entity hand-controls="right" cursor"></a-entity>
```

The `cursor` component can perhaps detect when it's attached to a controller or not (`tracked-controls`), or whether its parent has a camera. cc @bryik  so what i do personally is have a separate `controller-cursor` component that listens for the new controllerconnected event and disables the camera gaze cursor when it takes over (and it uses configurable events like trigger/touchpad/thumbstick for emulating mouse down/up events).  not sure it helps to completely merge into same component since controls may need different adjustments? Merging because all of the event names, raycaster code, state is the same. The main thing different for controller is mapping to detect click and option to show a line mesh. if the assumption is that there should only be one active cursor that should jump from camera (gaze) to controller (button press), I understand what you mean (to avoid multiple raycasts etc.) but if the plan is to allow multiple simultaneous, not sure there will be as much benefit.  direct mouse click is something else really.  maybe just need to allow cursor to respond to controller button events, and create a laser-pointer alternative to the typical ring representation (e.g. you should be able to use laser pointer with gaze if you like) Perhaps make it less magic and explicit with presets:

````
<a-camera>
  <a-entity cursor="type: gaze"></a-entity>
</a-camera>

<a-entity hand-controls="right" cursor="type: controller"></a-entity>
````

Based on type, A-Frame can handle listening for VR mode, whether to laser/reticle (or even project). cc @caseyyee, who's been thinking and working with responsive controller components @ngokevin seems like we're really talking about presets...
```
<a-entity cursor="fuse: true; fuseTimeout: 500"
            position="0 0 -1"
            geometry="primitive: ring; radiusInner: 0.02; radiusOuter: 0.03"
            material="color: black; shader: flat">
```

gaze is preset for `fuse:true` and maybe timeout
controller is preset for laser pointer geometry and/or default material, but really we might want preset for ring, cross, dot, etc. as well

would it be better for `gaze-cursor` and `controller-cursor` to exist and simply assign properties to `cursor` dependency as a way to share the code? I might do that. The awkward thing I need to resolve is that our current crop of 3dof controllers primarily have `trackpaddown` for clicking, and 6dof controllers have `triggerdown` for clicking. I wish I could set the cursor to just listen to both events, but there's a event collision: 6dof controllers have their own `trackpaddown` events. 

I could do cursor -> gaze-cursor | controller-cursor. gaze-cursor sets fuse, controller-cursor renders a laser. Though a `preset` property might just be as simple while avoiding API surface / abstraction hell.

presets:

| presetName | properties | usage |
| ---------------| ----------- | ------- |
| gaze             | `fuse: true; upEvents: ; downEvents: ;` | under camera |
| controllerTrigger              | `laser: true;  downEvents: triggerdown; upEvents: triggerup` | 6dof controllers
| controllerTrackpad              | `laser: true; downEvents: trackpaddown; upEvents: trackpadup` | 3dof controllers | What about `gaze-controls` and `laser-controls` as analog of `hand-controls` ? `-controls` have meant controllers or code to handle pose. The cursor stuff is more of an attachment onto the controllers for interactivity. I see `laser-controls` pretty similar to `hand-controls`. They all use `daydream-controls`, `vive-controls`... under the hood? gaze-controls they have also tracking associated to it but it's the headset / camera. The `-controls` family of components handles effecting the position/rotation of entities and the family of tracked-controls/daydream-controls/gearvr-controls/vive-controls/oculus-touch-controls/hand-controls follow a pattern and build on top of each other. 

The cursor components don't necessarily depend on any of those. They just attach interactivity/state on top of events that may come. So I wouldn't want to conflate them. I also don't think we need entirely separate components configure a single component; that's what properties are for, to configure. It can sometimes be hard to follow the abstractions otherwise.

Here's the API I am thinking:

```
<a-camera>
  <a-entity cursor="preset: gaze"></a-entity>  <!-- Gaze is the default. -->
</a-camera>

<a-entity daydream-controls gearvr-controls cursor="preset: trackpadController"></a-entity>

<a-entity hand-controls cursor="preset: triggerController"></a-entity>
``` I think that at least `laser-controls` should do more than just interactivity / state. It will position the laser on the correct position based on the controller available and will map the buttons to emit `click` events on other entities? I don't think it's much different than `hand-controls`
````javascript
<a-entity laser-controls></a-entity>
````
That gives you a consistent laser regardless of the specific hardware or number of DOF. I could get on board with that. That way would be to make the `cursor` component smarter and do controller (or lack of controller) detection) and automatically set everything. If I had my own custom controller, I could configure the position/rotation of the controller. The slight downside is increased complexity in the component to make things more magic (controller detection and auto-configuration); if it were developer-configured, it'd be simpler, less need for manual testing.

I think `-controls` naming though should be reserved for components controlling an entity. While it would be coupled to `-controls` code, the laser wouldn't be controlling anything. Well... `laser-controls` would control the entity the same as `hand-controls`, `daydream-controls`, `vive-controls` do. The `laser-controls` I had in mind is pretty similar to `hand-controls` but in this case the model is just a line (+ the default controller model for each platform) and it scales across 3DOF and 6DOF. `laser-controls` can make use of another component `cursor="type: laser, position: 0 0 0"` that can be reused by custom controls OK.

We'll have `laser-controls` which sets all the proper configurations for each controls we support. If someone does a custom controller, they can configure the `cursor`/`raycaster` component. Maybe the `cursor` can handle drawing the line based on the `raycaster`'s far/origin/direction. 

Maybe `cursor` can default to `gaze` configuration so we don't have to create another component.

We can also document/share code that will toggle the cursor/controller cursors depending on controllers available if devs want to set both and have everything handled for the "responsive" case. Thinking about this API.

## laser-controls

Works with 3DoF and 6DoF.

Configures `cursor.downEvents`, `cursor.upEvents`, `raycaster.origin`, `raycaster.direction` based on which controller is active.

Configure `cursor` or `raycaster` components for further customization.

No properties.

## cursor

Laser's length is configured via `raycaster.far`.

Laser's position/rotation is configured via `raycaster.origin` and `raycaster.direction`

`laserAlwaysShow` if off only shows laser when interacting with objects configured by `raycaster.objects`

| property |
| ---------- |
| fuse        |
| fuseTimeout |
| downEvents |
| upEvents |
| laserAlwaysShow |
| laserColor   |
| laserEnabled |
| laserRadius |

## raycaster

| property |
| --------- |
| far |
| interval |
|  near |
| objects |
| recursive |
| origin |
| direction |

## extra: responsive-controls-toggler

Perhaps provided via documentation or examples

`<a-scene responsive-controls>`

Creates gaze-controls under camera and laser-controls. Toggles between either way depending on whether controls are active

## usage

```
<a-camera>
  <a-entity cursor></a-entity>
</a-camera>

<a-entity laser-controls></a-entity>
``` If I understand correctly, this is the chain of components injecting other components:

![img_5228](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1848368/26184174/1697af28-3b38-11e7-88f2-ac19378253bb.JPG)

I'm a bit concerned that the existing `-controls` components expose nearly-similar APIs without actually sharing any code... if I want to use a custom model, I'm left doing this:

```
<a-entity vive-controls="model:false"
          oculus-touch-controls="model:false"
          gearvr-controls="model:false"
          daydream-controls="model:false"
```

That's a bit out of scope for this question of having a laser, so I don't think we need to address it here, but it does make me wish this laser implementation could not add onto that dependency stack.

What if we just called it, say, a `laser-cursor` component, which depends on `cursor`, but that does not automatically add all the other controls? Presumably it would have an `origin` and `direction` that can be customized by the user and passed on to the raycaster. In terms of getting the `origin` and `direction` automatically from the currently-active controls, that sounds like a job for a System and not for a direct dependency between the components IMO.

No opinion on the `responsive-controls-toggler` proposal for now, since that depends so much on the previous thoughts.

 What I typically do these days is in a codepen here:
http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/gWdgMy

You can see a set of components - `controller-cursor` (translate controller events to down/up/click), `controller-model-if-present` (think `hand-controls` abstraction of which controller, but using the native controller model instead of the low-poly hands), `controller-with-cursor-if-present` (which includes `controller-model-if-present` and ray representation, as well as disabling gaze cursor when controller connected)

Thoughts welcome @machenmusik very nice! That looks quite helpful.

Your `controller-cursor` matches my suggestion on `laser-cursor` I think, in the sense that it isn't responsible for adding controls itself. Although I hadn't thought of the need to manually call `onMouseDown()` on the cursor. I'm not fan of components with conditionals in their name. they define logic which is the opposite of declarative I see from the point of view of the user. The same as `hand-controls` I want a single component `laser-controls` that gives me a nice laser interface with the model of the platform I'm using so I just care about hooking up the events to my application logic. I'm sure we can have something that will work out of the box for 90% of the cases. <img width="602" alt="screen shot 2017-05-17 at 8 55 20 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/674727/26185974/2e9bcb08-3b43-11e7-9ac5-b385b2e58a87.png">

I had the same concerns about the towering abstraction stack, but I think of `laser-controls` as a convenience layer. The `responsive-controls-toggler` isn't really a proposal for inclusion. Just something we can provide or link to from documentation in case people want to know how.

For custom controls with laser, I see the story as:

```html
<a-entity custom-controls="model: customModel.gltf" cursor="laserEnabled: true" raycaster="direction: 0 -0.10 -1">
```

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('custom-controls', {
init: function () {
  // Whatever controls you want to support.
  setAttribute('vive-controls', {model: false});
  setAttribute('oculus-touch-controls', {model: false});
}
});
``` The current implementation of `hand-controls` is pretty simple and I would use it as a starting point for `laser-controls` What @ngokevin says :) As a convenience layer, I would find `laser-controls` most helpful if it did not BOTH provide behaviors and inject other controls. This comes back to bite users who want to have custom controls, because they now have to re-implement the laser to get that. And it pre-supposes that all future `<device>-controls` components will be part of A-Frame core.

If the idea (from `cursor="laserEnabled: true"`) is that the actual laser-related logic would go into the `cursor` component, and `laser-controls` is just some syntactic sugar with no behavior of its own, then I have fewer concerns. But why not just make it a primitive, then? The actual laser logic would be in `cursor/raycaster`. The extra behavior needed is to automatically line up the laser appropriate to the controller models + map which button event triggers down/up, depending on which controller is connected. @dmarcos I was not proposing to add names with if-present to core, I just use that to distinguish that they are expected to do nothing until the controller connects - my pet peeve with hand-controls is that they default to visible even if no controllers are present, so you end up with a pair of hand models permanently stuck at origin `laser-controls` would also position the origin of the raycaster depending on the model. Components that are sintatic sugar are ok to me. A different topic: primitives is something we want to deprecate due to
side effects when combined with mixins and confusion when a component is both set on the entity and the primitive (you might have several attributes in the entity that refer to the same thing). As a layer of abstraction they introduce more noise than value over the entity / component model.  @ngokevin you can definitely add the controller-cursor behavior into cursor, although then you need to know if it is a controller-cursor or a gaze-cursor, not sure that is worth trying to jam into same component as opposed to having them separate.  However, IMO there should be a way to (1) provide custom appearance for ray/line (2) have the ray/line stop at intersection as opposed to tunneling straight through to the full length of the ray/line (and maybe place some intersection graphic) -- really this starts to be like teleport controls (straight laser vs. parabolic, and hit target appearance) @dmarcos Let's not start a different topic in this issue.

@machenmusik Yeah, that's doable. Not much logic needed to differentiate gaze vs controller. You can just attach both types of events and they won't interfere. The laser can be customized through various properties, or really, you can disable the laser and provide your own mesh. And stopping the laser or projecting on the intersection point can be done later too. > The actual laser logic would be in cursor/raycaster. 

Ok cool. That, or as @dmarcos said in Slack, if `laser-controls` uses `laser-cursor` for the laser behavior, that is similarly fine.

The point on primitives makes sense.

If possible, it would be preferable for `laser-controls` to not have specific knowledge of each `<device>-controls` component model for determining offsets, but to get that through some component or system API. Let's not plan on every `<device>-controls` being in core. @ngokevin  w.r.t. Laser customization of appearance - at some point you realize that the entity with controllers and model is related to but distinct from the ray/line indicating the laser with its own position and orientation offsets, they can't be the same entity... If the idea is to force people to make their own mesh, it is complicated by the need to understand the underlying object hierarchy to do it right... As an example, maybe I want the ray to be thin and lower opacity until it is intersecting with something at which point it starts pulsing and appearing to be more solid... which along the lines of cursor could be done as animation if things were structured properly Maybe laser-pointer should just be the ray/line, and cursor can auto-switch if it sees controller connected event, which should never happen if attached to camera to be a gaze cursor? Brainstorming here:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('laser-cursor', {
  dependencies: ['cursor'],
  schema: {
    origin: { type: 'vec3' },
    direction: { type: 'vec3' },
  },
  init: function () {
    var el = this.el;
    var data = this.data;
    el.addEventListener('controllerconnected', (e) {
      if (!data.origin) { el.setAttribute('laser-cursor', 'origin', e.detail.defaultOrigin); }
      if (!data.direction) { el.setAttribute('laser-cursor', 'direction', e.detail.defaultDirection); }
    });
  },
  // ...
});
```

I don't think I have a good sense of how to allow users full control over the line... seems like they will need to re-implement at least one component there. Ideally we can limit that case to only re-implementing a single component. I don't think we need a separate `laser-cursor` component. Potential confusion vs. cursor or laser-controls, and not much meat to separate from cursor.

Possible ways to configure a line, just provide your own mesh. You can still offset it with `mesh.position` or `mesh.rotation`.

```
<a-entity cursor="laserEnabled: false" line="radius: 0.1; color: blue; opacity: 0.8"
               event-set="_event: mouseover; line.color: green; line.opacity: 1">
</a-entity>
```

Alternatively, the default laser mesh is accessible through something like `getObject3D('cursorlaser')`.
 Cursor/raycaster need to be dormant if no controller at all right?  (Else you have stuck raycaster permanently firing from origin) Good point. `laser-controls` could attach the cursor only once a controller is connected. The big nuisance I see at the moment is having to repeatedly specify the objects property for raycaster - once for gaze and then twice more (once for each controller)

Maybe we need one objects pool and multiple raycaster instances that reference it Not just twice? One for gaze-based and one for controller-based? I don't think it's much work to define twice, but that's also where mixins can come in. 

Different raycasters could want to intersect different objects. it's not just defining,  you have to gather the list of THREE objects multiple times which is wasteful.

if you can't share raycasters, and you want to be able to select things with either hand, then you need three.  if you implement the ping-pong between controllers based on which one was used last -- which is sometimes good and sometimes incredibly annoying -- then you need two so did you guys want to start prototyping the changes in a different branch (feel free to grab whatever you like from the codepen if it is useful), we can see how it feels to use and whether it makes our apps easier to write, and once happy can PR and merge? That's why I wanted to have some toggler-type component somewhere so there's not duplicate raycasters. But the three.js object querying is not as expensive/frequent as the actual intersection tests.

Yeah, I'm working on it at the moment. Diego needs a cursor for his link traversal demo. > laser-controls could attach the cursor only once a controller is connected.

once you start down that path, you realize there is a whole bunch of stuff you really only want once a controller (with the correct hand property) is connected.

> Yeah, I'm working on it at the moment. Diego needs a cursor for his link traversal demo.

ok, feel free to steal liberally from codepen if helpful.  it felt really good / convenient to be able to just say
`<a-entity controller-with-cursor-if-present="right"></a-entity>` -- naming issues aside -- and I'd encourage efforts to simplify the number of -controls currently required to specify as discussed above. Thanks, I'll check it out. I'm not as opposed to having a general utility toggler components like that (A-Blast has a component that toggles the controllers off if not VR), but for now, I think I'll just code in the one event listener into the component. > I don't think we need a separate laser-cursor component. 

That's fair. Even if it's `laser-controls`, the goal should be to let users add their own `<device>-controls` component without re-implementing the whole stack. To summarize, in case this is blocking anyone, I think we are agreed on adding optional laser functionality to the `cursor` component? I assume that is the bulk of the work, here. 

Dummy examples of using the `laser-controls` convenience wrapper would be helpful to understand that API. Working on it at the moment. There's not so much laser functionality, more like laser appearance, which is just creating a line. Doesn't look like there's actually much code to change, perhaps the hardest part is being able to offset the raycaster, which isn't too bad.  Great! In case it's helpful, new PR on three.js: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/11349 It'd be interesting to see something like `aframe-crawling-cursor` implemented at the point of intersection. This would make it easier to target geometry in 3D space as the size of the laser pointer dot would change depending on the distance from the camera: https://github.com/jujunjun110/aframe-crawling-cursor That's currently in the PR https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2678 Great - I'll take a look and will give it a test!  Components are supposed to solve this. Bundles of JS that can be consumed via HTML.

But you can try clearing texture cache `AFRAME.systems.material.textureCache`. They resolve promises which you can call `Texture.dispose()`. But yeah, iOS has 10MB limit per tab or something.  If you want to include an asset at runtime, just set the URL directly `<a-image src="texture.png">`. But yes, your way should work as well, but a roundabout way of doing it.

(Note Stack Overflow is the best place to ask questions.)  Dupe https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2642  @ngokevin is this the typical case of differences between component and primitive behaviors (and perhaps encouragement to use components for more complex cases) ?  In `src/components/look-controls.js`, the code should check to see if `this.data.enabled` before adding the class on the document body for the cursor. Help wanted! https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2642  I'm not sure I understand the problem. What do you mean by using your entities twice. Can you come up with a simpler fully functional example? @kurai021 I would try cloning the element before re-attaching it. In jQuery: 

```js
$el = $el.remove().clone();
```

Hopefully that solves it, but in either case a simple example would be helpful. :)

You should be able to set a `material` component alongside `obj-model` component.

Workaround is to wait for `model-loaded` event, grab the mesh, and change the materials manually. It's difficult to expose every material property that could be used to post-process a model as a common API. If you need to override an MTL, I would make a component:

```
AFRAME.registerComponent('my-material-override', {
  init: function () {
    var el;
    el.addEventListener('model-loaded', function () {
      var material = el.getObject3D('mesh').material;
      // modify material.
    });
  }
});

<a-entity obj-model="obj: obj.obj; mtl: mtl.mtl" my-material-override></a-entity>
```  Most of the examples are on GitHub too under MIT, including the one in the READMEs. I'll try to make sure to include LICENSES on Glitches too.  **Description:**

Pointer Lock is an easier way to look around on desktop than mouse-drag. Mouse-drag also has problems that it triggers clicks on time users move. We could add Pointer Lock to the default control scheme if:

1. User is on desktop
2. User does not have a headset detected
3. User enters fullscreen mode

It seems like Pointer Lock doesn't prompt permissions on Firefox and Chrome anymore too when I try Pointer Lock example on MDN with user gesture. So it's not intrusive, use the VR Button click as the user gesture.

We maintain the mouse-drag for now when not fullscreen.  A slightly tangential topic: Should we also consider a screen based raycaster when we're not in fullscreen?  (like react-vr)
Another question: Do people use the fullscreen mode? I personally either go to VR or use it in non fullscreen. I see fullscreen useful for probably the embedded case if the preview is very small. I don't like that screen-based raycasting conflicts with using the mouse to look around. `aframe-mouse-cursor-component` is available for those that want it. If you have a scene you can't look around or move and interact with mouse raycasting, it's almost the same as a 2D webpage?

If I were to engage in a site on plain desktop, I think I'd use full screen if it offered me Pointer Lock. Also makes it easier if people want to build traditional 3D sites (WASD + Mouse + wall collisions). What are the cases against just having Pointer Lock always? It used to be we didn't like the Permissions prompt, but if we use the User Gesture, the user has intended to interact with A-Frame and no permission will pop up. Multiple A-Frame scenes are not supported. Even so, would Pointer Lock be intrusive? Needing to hit ESC to disengage and continue on. Pointer lock is only engaged if you click a scene, so that's not possible The best component to look at is A-Frame Extra's Universal Controls. +1 from me for including pointerlock with `look-controls`, at least as an option.

Side note: I've needed a [small hack](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/controls/mouse-controls.js#L123-L134) to disable pointerlock when in inspector mode. Probably want to do the same for `look-controls`. I think the `.pause()` handler would handle that if Inspector is opened Yeah, I'm in favor of a Pointer Lock on by default. I shared some A-Frame stuff to people on desktop and the click-drag is not usable. For default desktop mode, I'd favor Pointer Lock/a-cursor versus Click-Drag/mouse-cursor (they conflict anyways).

There's no permissions hanger anymore since it's activated on click. Try: https://webvr.donmccurdy.com/checkpoints/  This question doesn't have enough information. You can ask on Stack Overflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aframe with detailed information to get help.  What's our proposed solution?  Not much to do. Videos in general are high CPU usage, more so as a texture. Up to the browser to optimize it.

Not much to do for mobile, they aren't super equipped to handle VR, and we'll using the WebVR polyfill so it's not a true optimized implementation.  thanks!  I've just noticed that the `text` component `opacity` parameter is not working as expected:
When the opacity goes below a certain value (`~0.4`) the text abruptly disappears.

I've tried both in my original repo and on @bryik and it's working as expected so it should be something introduced in the custom sdf function (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/shaders/sdf.js)
@machenmusik do you mind taking a look at it or explain the changes you did on the `sdf.js` as I remember you commented something to improve rendering but I don't remember correctly. 
Maybe we could have both versions? the original sdf.js and the current one with another name as a modified version as fadein/out opacity is a very common feature that we should support correctly. @machenmusik sure
 
Steps to reproduce:
- https://aframe.io/aframe-inspector/example
- Add a new empty entity
- Add `text` component
- Set `value` to `TEXT`, leaving the rest of the parameters as default (shader is `sdf` by default)
- Modify the `opacity`

I've tried on Windows10 with Firefox 55.0a1 and Chromium 56.0.2910.0 and both seems to be broken @machenmusik I just saw your PR, but I'm having the problem on `sdf` that it's the default currently Ouch, I didn't know that, we should do something as right now it's misleading to see `sdf` but it's using `msdf`.
I'll give it a try later and let you know, thanks!  Thanks!  **Description:**

`THREE.BlendCharacter` has been removed from Three.js r85.

So maybe we need to rewrite our `blend-character-model.js` in reference to  [Three.js webgl_animation_skinning_blending example](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/webgl_animation_skinning_blending.html) or make our `THREE.BlendCharacter`.

 Related thread in Three.js https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/11152 We can still pull it from the examples directory through Node, right? I'm not sure Node well but is it possible to pull it from Three.js r84 example even if we bump Three.js into r85?

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/r85/examples/js
(`THREE.BlendCharacter` has been removed from Three.js r85 example)

Even if we can, it's no longer maintained by Three.js so it wouldn't work with the latest Three.js someday. Can we convert the model to glTF? > Can we convert the model to glTF?

Probably yes. If so, the animations can work similarly. Is upgrading to three.js r85 planned for 0.6.0, or waiting until next release? I think it could wait, perhaps while post-processing support improves. I'd like to bump Three.js to the latest revision right after 0.6.0 release, before Three.js supports VR + Post-Processing. (Maybe we can't do that for 0.6.0 due to the last minute for the release)

Because I want to update `GLTF2Loader` as soon as possible, and I think it still takes time til Three.js's post-processing support.

BTW I don't think I followed the discussion above. Would we convert the model to glTF and remove `blend-character-model.js`? Yeha, we can do that. Ideally, we could get rid of blend-character-model, even buy in on an animation mixer component. > I'd like to bump Three.js to the latest revision right after 0.6.0 release, before Three.js supports VR + Post-Processing. (Maybe we can't do that for 0.6.0 due to the last minute for the release)

+1

> Because I want to update GLTF2Loader as soon as possible

Let's start a new issue to discuss how/when we want to make this transition. Opened #2693.

> Ideally, we could get rid of blend-character-model, even buy in on an animation mixer component.

+1 for moving `blend-character-model` out of core if we can. Adding `animation-mixer` to core is fine by me, although we don't really need it for just hand controls. OK, got it.
Let's close this issue when we remove `blend-character-model`. Note: Seems like `VRControls` and `VREffect` will be removed from Three.js in r86, r87, or later.
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/11301

Update: They'll stay for a r86 Do we know an ETA on r86? Perhaps soon? I'm asking Ricardo now.

Update: probably tomorrow Let's start working on this once we release 0.6.1 Are there source files for `oculus-hands/v2/leftHand.json` and `oculus-hands/v2/rightHand.json`? I'd like to try converting them to glTF, but don't know of any way to import three.js JSON files back into Blender. 

/cc @feiss  It looks like [most are geometry-only](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/js/exporters) except MMD; I can give that a try though. Not seeing any real conversion options without the original models, so just going with #2876. Fixed by https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2876  @machenmusik, @caseyyee, or @mkeblx (!) – someone who has a functional Oculus Browser device: can you take a looksie?

(I'm waiting on a new Samsung Gear VR viewer)
 thanks, @mkeblx. I'll debug it once I get my new Samsung Gear VR; if you (or someone else) can get to it before then, sweet! I wonder if the old code to auto-enter VR (by necessity) for Carmel Developer Preview is trying and failing with Oculus Browser.  But previously for me pages were loading in 2D with enter-VR button visible just fine with Oculus Browser.  Did this just change recently? Can we test with 0.4.0? On the assumption that most will be using Oculus browser now, maybe we should remove auto-enter-vr from default scene components, and those that need can add manually? @dmarcos if you like that approach I can do quick PR @weddingdj thanks for investigating! Is that with current master? `auto-enter` vr was disabled recently. Entering VR itself works fine though right? requestPresent is failing. Is this the Oculus Browser or the Samsung one? `requestPresent` is clearly failing saying that it requires user gesture. I don't understand how it's entering VR. Is it the polyfill taking over? @dmarcos I don't think you merged #2707, was auto-enter disabled some other way? Perhaps auto enter is attempted and fails in such a way that messes up subsequent exit after manually entering.  Try with #2707 included maybe? I would look into the `exitVR` button of `a-scene`: 

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/scene/a-scene.js#L229

Is `exitVRSuccess` ever called? @weddingdj just curious. do you use a remote console or something to see the logs on GearVR? That'd be helpful! I will be around to test it in an hour. Yeah, I just tried myself. I guess it means Oculus Browser may not be firing `onvrdisplaydeactivate` as the WebVR API says it should. Asking them now in the PR. Or here. Does Oculus Browser implement `onvrdisplaydeactivate`, or is there another agnostic way to detect exit VR so A-Frame can handle it. Thanks, I'll use that. Thx Justin  **Description:**

The System code is currently really simplified and doesn't have the same code as the components. The complete fix is to make Systems extend Components. I would take a simple hack for now though.

 Will confirm first. Looking at code, might not be the case. But still emitting twice. Updated with a Glitch. Really puzzled. I put a console.log in A-Frame, and it seems it only emits once. tracked-controls and hand-controls don't emit that. vive-controls seem disabled since there are none present. But when I add an event listener, the handler runs twice.  We have a `template` component! Or you can use [aframe-react](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react) or any other Web solutions (Vue.js, template libs, view layers).

https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/template/  For some reason the a-frame inspector has a breaking error while trying to hide the loader. This causes it to be unresponsive when launched.

See below:

```

I suspect that a broken version of the inspector JS has been pushed to the CDN as this is loaded independently of the a-frame JS file. The example URL was working earlier today and hasn't been touched since.
 After further investigation it seems that it was partially caused by the bootstrap modal dialog box css that was running on the page. When using the current master branch of a-frame and disabling the dialog box html the inspector works as expected. Would it be possible to change the css class applied by the inspector to something other than `modal`? e.g. `inspector-modal`? This would help prevent collisions with other CSS that may be on the page, especially since it's embedded in a `style` element, making it difficult to remove / adjust in certain cases where there are collisions. It's a issue already filed on the inspector but we still didn't address it :/ https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector/issues/129 feel free if you believe you could help there! (I assume this is the same issue, but correct me if I'm wrong.) Loading the Inspector from Docs doesn't work https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/guides/:

 Inline example/inspector has been removed from docs since.

Moving to https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector/issues/129  So with PR the video at least plays but flipped and with wrong color? :)  Is that better than the video not playing at all? Can we add add a custom shader that it's set automatically when playing on iOS? > due to CORS issues with Mobile Safari, in order to test this, your HTML page must be in the same exact domain as the IDevice-compatible video content (m3u8 manifests and ts / aac files), Subdomains will not work at present.

can you point me to a sample video you're using as a test case?
 @machenmusik nice work on supporting this 👍 if you can point me to some test case URLs, I'll try this out on my end.
 i think i used hls urls from the prior threejs tickets on the topic

maybe should just convert the aframe 360 video from MP4 to iPhone-safe HLS? > maybe should just convert the aframe 360 video from MP4 to iPhone-safe HLS?

how about including both as `<source>`s? if including both as `<source>` works, that's fine although it complicates the example since you can't do with inline `src` in `a-videosphere` for example -- I was just trying to say that if we want HLS source, should probably make a version of the recently-iDevice-friendly MP4 example that is HLS format awesome, thanks for making the updates 👍 btw, is there a simple test or two you can add? See [my comment](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2663#issuecomment-300538257) in issue #2663. If @machenmusik has other insights, would be glad to know and discuss. Thanks, everyone 👍  @machenmusik I want to merge this but I would like to see it working first. Do you have any example I can try? so per discussion with @dmarcos, it seems that recent changes may have broken this somehow.., may need to do a little more investigation before merging this one :-/ found the problem :-) Thanks!  This is an issue with `aframevr/aframe-site` repo, I will check it out. Thanks! It's a backend/Node issue. Fixed! Had a minify step that was overriding some of our link processing steps.  Thanks for the request. This kind of features are better supplied by 3rd party components (https://aframe.io/aframe-registry/(. We want to keep the core small with the functionality that most of the applications need.   That (scale, rotation, position/translation) is the correct order for A-Frame. [Additions to the docs are welcome](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#update-documentation), perhaps on the pages for the `scale`, `rotation`, and `position` components?  Thanks you!  Fixed by #2587   What happens if the gyro is reenabled? I think probably the orientation would have to be reset so it plays well with mouse panning. I would leave this out of the default set and recommend tweaking your own controls (taking look-controls and removing the VRControls bits). I propose to close ^ Yeah! The more toggles we have in the core components the more combinations we have to keep track of and QA. It's not hard for someone to copy and customize the controls.  Would be keen to see this as we've got a few demos we'd like to try building utilizing the Vive trackers. @kfarr can correct me if I am wrong but at present there seems to be one functional and one test issue. 

The functional issue is that the observed position (with the default orientation correction) appears to have a small Z offset when compared to collocated entities and the SteamVR mode, which may be a combination of the rotation and the natural pivot position of the tracker model.

The test issue is that somehow only the node.js tests fail with a rather cryptic message.

But the PR should otherwise be functional for experimentation with Nightly. @machenmusik just wanted to check because I didn't see any labels, do you need a review on this? @cvan it's marked as Work in Progress ([WIP]) in the title of the PR yeah, just wanted to see if he needed a hand
 @cvan I think it's actually good except the weird failing node test (and maybe if we want to fix the default pose z-offset, but said to not be a big deal) @cvan test now passes, so removing [WIP] from title... what more did we want to do this one before merging?  maybe a good example or two (which is where the Z-offset from what SteamVR shows is annoying, since otherwise we just need the most basic usage for that) in looking more closely at the Z-offset:

go to this codepen:
https://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/XRJmWB

if you look at the dummy tracker and marker, 
```
<!-- nothing wrong with the model, this looks right -->
  <a-entity position="0 1 -1" obj-model="obj:https://cdn.aframe.io/controllers/vive/vr_tracker-vive.obj; mtl:https://cdn.aframe.io/controllers/vive/vr_tracker-vive.mtl">
   <a-entity tracker-marker="?"></a-entity>
  </a-entity>
```
the model is aligned correctly with the center of the marker and rays
(no position from vive-tracker and tracked-controls at all)

if you look at the first real tracker (labeled 0),
which gets its pose from vive-tracker,
and then bring over the vive wand and touch the marker's center as a sanity check,
you can see that the entity itself has inherited the right pose 
(as shown by the marker and rays, agreeing with SteamVR)

but the tracker model doesn't appear in the same place as either the marker or rays (or SteamVR) -- that's the Z offset issue.

if you have a second tracker and look at the marker labeled 1,
you can see that the Z-offset issue is the same even without the rotation correction
(which is needed to make things match SteamVR, BTW)

thoughts / suggestions? I have to spend time looking so it won't make it for 0.6.0 No problems there.  If the Nightly bug with wrong gamepad id is gone, I may be able to (squash and) simplify changes to make less invasive?  Which might have better chance of merge regardless of when.  Or did we want tracked-controls to understand how to filter by hand anyway, and those changes should remain? duh.  i just realized that the Z offset is probably whatever adjustments were being made with old vive controller model.  pushed change to PR, but can't check actual outcome -- can anyone check https://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/XRJmWB to see if offset is gone?  @kfarr @dmarcos? if the offset is gone, maybe we can land in 0.6.0 after all (well, from a functional standpoint anyway, still maybe no time for @dmarcos @ngokevin to look) confirmed, offset is gone (internally; some very slight difference from SteamVR). @cvan I think we can remove the work-in-progress label now (I would but I can't) (I may end up doing a simpler version that does not handle the aforementioned Nightly quirk, which may simplify things and avoid some conflicts with latest master from other merged changes.) Ok so revised to better fit against latest master.  Any issues?  @kfarr is this better now w.r.t. the mystery Z offset we used to encounter? (May need to rebase and fix a bit after current round of optimizations in master) Rebased, and starkly basic but fully functional example added and tested against Firefox release 55 (64-bit). @ngokevin why am I getting this test failure? seems that a recent commit may have poisoned the well...
```
[error]: docs/introduction/index.md
    Link definition does not exist: [Mozilla][mozilla]
``` I think this one is in good shape now, if we feel comfortable enough merging, then can use `rotation` to address #2965 at least temporarily the vive-tracker controller object hand property is undefined (which makes
sense because the tracker has no handedness)

 @machenmusik: do you mean @dmarcos’ PR #3152? is this blocked on @dmarcos’ work? if so, is there a branch we can test against? excited to try this out - thank you Yeah, @dmarcos has a patch. We'll have him to make a WIP PR so it's visible. I've seen his PR work with spectator camera before so at least it's not imaginary.  Yeah I had a PR. I will share it short after the VREffect / VRControls PR lands. Thanks for the patience.    Thanks! Can you remove the changes from the dist directory?  Sounds good!  Thanks for looking into this. A-Frame already injects these `<meta>` tags for Safari/WebKit for iOS.

If you load your phone in landscape mode, the "pseudo-fullscreen mode" won't trigger. But, if you turn your phone back to portrait mode and then back to landscape mode, the "pseduo-fullscreen mode" _will_ trigger. I looked in the [`webvr-polyfill`](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill), but I don't think it's caused by something there.

I've done a lot of researched, asked a lot of people, and – as far as I can tell – it's just how iOS behaviour works (unless you're in a pinned ). I've looked for a lot of workarounds (this week I checked and spent quite some time too).

Is this behaviour above what I'm describing, the same thing you're experiencing, @rambambulli @derhuebiii?

Videos, screencasts, images would help too - just to make sure we're seeing the same issues. Thanks for your help! > Yes, that's correct, didn't realize that before. If this workaround would be implemented a "pop-up"/modal like we get when entering the VR mode in portrait mode that a turn to portrait and back helps would also help for that problem. Of course not optimal, but the best we might get currently with iOS...

Though not ideal, this is a good idea - thanks for the suggestion. (FYI, we also have #1239, which is somewhat related.) I'll repurpose this issue to address that. I'll grab this one; if you want to contribute a PR too, I can help review it. (Don't feel blocked on me, if you need this fixed, is what I'm saying.) Thanks for your help again 👍   Should we allow this? Can we prescribe that assets should have IDs because they are unique? If you have more than one of the class, then it's ambiguous which asset. Yes, I think assets should be identified uniquely by id. I would say that `id=1` is a bad id and also ill formed. ids must begin with a letter:
https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-id  This issue has no information. np  Most looks good, do you think it'd be better to center the triangle by default? Thanks! We can add docs, just a section in the `geometry.md` file works fine Thanks for the wait. I've updated the PR to not have to recreate the quaternion and vectors on each instance. Waiting for tests to pass then will merge!  Thanks for filing! I think it's due to https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2464 (dupe). obj-model sets a dependency on `material` component to make sure it's initialized before the obj-model...*in case it's set*. If it's not set, then it'll throw that useless warning which we should fix.

  Just writing up some API ideas here. 

***

Developers try to use `<a-animation/>` to transition between states (do X after Y), and of course it doesn't (and shouldn't) do any of that. In Unity that would be managed by a [state machine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StateMachineBasics.html), for which we currently have no construct.

But state machines are naturally declarative. They can be cyclical graphs, which the DOM can't, but let's try:

```html
<a-scene>
  <a-entity gltf-model="..."
            state-machine="#npc-state;"
            animation-mixer="clips: none;"
            proximity-emitter__far="filter: #player; distance: 20; event: far;"
            proximity-emitter__near="filter: #player; distance: 1; event: near;"
            path-finding="target: none;"
            attack-ability="target: none;"></a-entity>

  <a-state-machine id="npc-state">
      <a-state name="idle"
               default
               enter-set="property: animation-mixer.clips; value: idle_*;"
               transition__walk="on: farstart; state: walk;"
               transition__dead="on: healthchange; where: health <= 0; state: dead;"
      </a-state>
      <a-state name="walk"
               enter-set__1="property: animation-mixer.clips; value: walk_*;"
               enter-set__2="property: path-finding.target; value: event.target;"
               exit-set="property: path-finding.target; value: none;"
               transition__idle="on: farstop; state: idle;"
               transition__attack="on: nearstart; state: attack;"
               transition__walk="on: nearstop; state: walk;"
               transition__dead="on: healthchange; where: health <= 0; state: dead;"
      </a-state>
      <a-state name="attack"
               enter-set__1="property: animation-mixer.clips; value: attack_*;"
               enter-set__2="property: attack-ability.target; value: event.target;"
               exit-set="property: attack-ability.target; value: none;"
               transition__walk="on: nearstop; state: walk;"
               transition__dead="on: healthchange; where: health <= 0; state: dead;"
      </a-state>
      <a-state name="dead"
               set-value="property: animation-mixer.clips; value: dead_*;"
      </a-state>
  </a-state-machine>

</a-scene>
```

The syntax above represents the following graph:

![img_5060](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1848368/24890795/b2a3c994-1e26-11e7-990e-9ef9f6d5c743.JPG)

A very similar pattern would apply to conversational bots, quest progress, puzzle rooms, and more. So I think this solves a generalizable problem.

Concerns here:

1. Triggering on events alone is maybe not enough. See things like `health <= 20`. I think that syntax would be helpful, but parsing it might be a chore.
2. Verbose. We could split out separate lists of `<a-state/>`s and a list `<a-transition/>`s, such that transition to `dead` wouldn't have to be repeated, and states could just list their transitions as `transitions="towalk, toattack, todead"`, but is that harder to read?
3. Every transition is triggered by an event, and that event needs to contain parameters for the next state. E.g. `target` for the walk and attack states. That feels like a weird coupling, maybe? 
4. Perhaps all of the `enter-set` / `exit-set` stuff should not be in the state machine at all. The state machine only handles transitions, and logic for behavior in each state lives in components attached directly to the entity:

```html
<a-entity attack-ability="on: attackstatestart;
                          off: attackstateend;" ...></a-entity> I have a blog post going out tmr about state machines and state management and game state in aframe that's relevant. We can have a look and compare ideas [Did some prototyping](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/commit/1b42ab4033f8e963b0eccea127882139a4839ba0). There's one show-stopper in the syntax above, which is that the state machine is a sibling of the entity it's assigned to, as though multiple entities were going to *share* that state machine. That doesn't work at all, because the state machine code needs to know which thing it's operating on, having multiple entities is complicated, and yeah. So with some revision:

```html
 <a-entity gltf-model="..."
           state-machine="#npc-state;"
           animation-mixer="clips: none;"
           proximity-emitter__far="filter: #player; distance: 20; event: far;"
           proximity-emitter__near="filter: #player; distance: 1; event: near;"
           path-finding="target: none;"
           attack-ability="target: none;"
           state-machine="initial: idle">
      <a-state name="idle"
               start-set="property: animation-mixer.clips; value: idle_*;"
               transition__walk="on: farstart; state: walk;"
               transition__dead="on: healthchange; where: health <= 0; state: dead;"
      </a-state>

**tl;dr** it will be good to test more alternatives and compare. I quite like this. Per-entity state seems like a necessity, actually.

But — as you point out in the article — the web has done really well with application-wide state, too. We certainly need some form of application/scene-wide state. This approach isn't incompatible with that. It just means for a given entity the application only knows what state it's in, not the internals of which components do what in that state. So each entity declares its own reducer, I think? Redux still confuses me... Redux takes time to grasp which is why I have sort of have a more consumable form in the second approach of the article without all the jargon. 

Entity-specific state can still be contained within the single global store, and we could select or bind with its corresponding piece (subtree) in the global store. In web apps you often have lists of fetched objects in state that get binded or assigned to respective pieces of the DOM 

I like that the general approach contrasts with finite states where each entity is in a single discrete state at a time. In the Redux-y approach, app state is a single tree of data, and any change to that tree represents an entirely new state. So rather than represent entities as separate states, we modify data about the entity and the application can react how it needs.  More flexible since we don't try to pigeonhole all the possibilities of states into single strings.

Perhaps I can refine the article to clear up my ideas with diagrams > Entity-specific state can still be contained within the single global store, and we could select or bind with its corresponding piece (subtree) in the global store. In web apps you often have lists of fetched objects in state that get binded or assigned to respective pieces of the DOM.

I agree with that, yes, a global store is helpful. But I'm not sure how an entity or component would bind to its subtree without some sort of subtree-specific syntax, e.g. what I've written above. 

> ...we don't try to pigeonhole all the possibilities of states into single strings.

I should clarify here, the state machine is very much *not* meant represent the entire state of the entity, because state won't be that discrete. For example, in addition to `idle | walk | attack | dead` states, an entity might have `inventory: manaPotion; health: 5/10; mana: 8/10;`. Those stats wouldn't be in the state machine, but do affect what the entity does when it's in, say, `attack` state.

So whether or not there is a state machine for animation, sound, and behavior modes, there is still a separate need for overall state *management* like you are proposing. My syntax is just declaratively adding a reducer to the Redux store, bound to a subtree.

The one point I don't see in the article is that IMO entity-level state is important. You may have animations and sounds associated with each state, but the `animation-mixer` and `sound` components shouldn't know about that, and shouldn't have `currentSound: run; currentAnimation: run` as separate global state entries. State should say the entity `isRunning`, and components can handle that accordingly. Posted on Slack:

> Kevin: I see states like idle/follow/attack could be boolean indicators that are pieces of the overall entity’s entire state (idle: false, follow: false, attack: true, health: 50} rather than discrete. and the entity can react anytime any piece of that changes

...

> But I'm not sure how an entity or component would bind to its subtree without some sort of subtree-specific syntax, e.g. what I've written above.

A separate "smart" component could help bind to a subtree, yeah with syntax. Could be declarative like `state.entities.0`. Or just a more ad-hoc component that reaches into the tree.

> The one point I don't see in the article is that IMO entity-level state is important. 

Entity-level state could be stored as a piece of the tree. At least in Redux, it'd be common to have specific reducers to manage individual entities or types of entities which would effectively give it its own state, but just still contained within the global store. If the state is trivial, then yeah we could use an approach like existing entity state API.

As you said, what we have in mind might be complementary, so looking forward to seeing your experiments! Will close as not actionable.

Continue to come up with good stuff, but this'll all happen outside core for a while.  After checking the spec I don't think we need any of the guards in this PR since if a Gamepad is pose capable the pose attribute should always be available.  I think it means that the `pose` attribute is always present if the hardware is `capable` of providing poses (not all gamepads provide poses) regardless of the state of the controller. If pose is not defined for a tracked gamepas in any of the browsers we should file a bug against.  Thanks for filing! It's still not well supported, and since we override lots of Custom Element stuff, I imagine it being a large effort that would introduce bugs. Once it solidifies and is widely available, we could consider switching from polyfill.

<img width="1253" alt="screen shot 2017-04-07 at 12 39 15 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/674727/24816861/4ead8748-1b8f-11e7-9614-ad611596b265.png">

There's also https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/567 so I'll dupe with that.
 I understand. It's something we'll look at once there's wide support of V1. But switching from polyfill to polyfill will likely introduce bugs due to how closely A-Frame relies and overrides the current one. A-Frame doesn't use vanilla registerElement behavior.  Hand selection is automatic as per: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/cb1399eeb3df1f94d7216371d3794e0770791832#diff-a772568948cd05296a498a049c2b78adR87

So there is no need to specify a hand. I think already introducing daydream-controls into hand-controls is causing issues on how things should actually be or makes us consider cases that shouldn't happen (e.g., hand-controls doesn't make sense for Daydream). What if we removed `daydream-controls` from `hand-controls`, it would clear up the issues with this PR? I think I would remove `daydream-controls` from `hand-controls` since it implements an interaction model that does not translate well to 3DOF. I would create a separate example (laser pointer kind of interaction technique) to illustrate 3DOF controllers +1 on removing from hand-controls.

I do understand why you would want to try to include it into hand-controls, but I think the controls are sufficiently different in 3dof that it can't really be made to work.

As far as hand filtering.  I will refer to comments made in slack:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1560884/24818389/2e33574e-1b95-11e7-827d-99f6af5968e1.png)
 As far is this PR goes.  We'll open changes to remove hand-controls as a separate PR, and use this one to address the daydream-controls hand filtering changes. r+ from me OK, just talked this through with @machenmusik:

Make default "either" and if that's the value, don't use the hand as filter criteria.

Will add to this PR code changes (not just docs).

 @machenmusik r? Let me clarify my intent as I found the existing behaviour a bit confusing in use and I don't think I have been entirely clear on what the issues are:

1.  Default handedness breaks for left handed users:
```html
<a-entity daydream-controls></a-entity>
```
This on it's own defaults to the `DEFAULT_HANDEDNESS` which is set to `right`.   This causes an issue when you use the `daydream-controls` as a _left_ handed user (and configured as _left_ handed user from daydream).  `isControllerPresent` doesn't find the controller in this case, and the controller just seems broken/non-functional.

The expectation is that the daydream-controls would correctly map the `controller.hand` and apply the correct arm model to the appropriate hand my daydream is configured to.

2. Specifying both hands is confusing (solution to problem 1):
```html
<a-entity daydream-controls="hand: left">
<a-entity daydream-controls="hand: right">
```
But this causes confusion to anyone using the controls since daydream, is of course a single controller.

This can also be confusing to handle at a application level if you need to configure content to one hand or another (since the reach is different for left and right hands).

The solution:

By specifying just the `daydream-controls`, it should default to the `controller.hand` property to set handedness.  This will make it work for both left and right handed users without specifying two elements.

We should also expose the hand through the component that is in use, so that applications can adjust accordingly based on hand.

Also, a little more thinking and comments in this PR, I agree that letting applications select a arm model using the API is not important since that can be done from the daydream settings.

 made consistent with https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2545 Thanks everybody!  I've updated with https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/7ee9444539b4c7cb9a4fcd2771cfba76219d2dd2, but would like help adding links to examples (@donmccurdy know any good ones for custom materials using components?). This would be very nice to have. I haven't seen any good/simple examples, but can certainly throw a few together. 🙂 If you could, thanks! Glitches welcome :) @scottmsinger what do you mean by wrapping a three.js shader? MeshStandardMaterial is already a default A-Frame material. Do you mean injecting your own GLSL code into one of the default three.js shaders? Or using one of the existing MeshFooMaterial classes and turning it into an A-Frame component, without actually writing any shader code? Adding arbitrary GLSL to three.js's shaders is quite complicated, afaik. They're not simple shaders, because they have to account for lighting, shadows, skinning, morph targets... Anyway here's an example:

Credit: https://www.clicktorelease.com/blog/vertex-displacement-noise-3d-webgl-glsl-three-js/

But maybe an example that doesn't depend on any GLSL utility functions would be best. @donmccurdy Thanks, you're awesome! Want to add those links to the material docs?  Here's a second example, where the shader code is much simpler, but includes a component that takes a `color` property as well as the `time` uniform.

PR shortly.  Yeah, fuse events are synthetic so they do not count as an explicit user gesture. An alternative to using fuse is to use the Cardboard button as a click/tap event (`canvas.addEventListener('click', ...)`). Otherwise, it's a bad limitation of iOS/mobile browsers.  Thanks, I've patched the warning to log the entity. You can try it with https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/14c9b5b/dist/aframe-master.min.js  This is a design decision. If we enable touch rotation in the vertical direction you quickly lose the sense of what's up and down when paired with the gyro orientation No, panning on the vertical axis is not implemented You could take look-controls as a starting point and implement your own component with vertical panning. It should not be too difficult. We focus on VR and our curent control schema assumes at least a device capable of magic window mode (gyro available)  **Description:**

I had a game state component where I wanted to just store a plain JavaScript object in the game state, via the schema. Don't need any of the HTML parsing pieces, but we could have that too.

```
schema: {
  foo: {type: 'object'}
}

// ... setAttribute('component', 'foo', {bar: 10})
```

Possible HTML form just in case, but won't be used often:

```<a-entity component="foo: {bar: 10};>```

 Closed, see https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2565  I tried the model below in your scene and it renders fine:

https://cdn.aframe.io/test-models/models/brainstem/BrainStem.gltf

There is probably something wrong with your models.  Hi @pieper – this issue has been fixed in three.js, but the won't be released until r85. See: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/9073

The problem specifically affects custom shaders in the glTF file. If your model is using standard three.js materials (i.e. glTF's KHR_materials_common extension) then you'll be fine. When converting with COLLADA2GLTF, that means adding the `-k` flag.  It uses the [DeviceMotion API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceMotionEvent)

https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/blob/master/src/sensor-fusion/fusion-pose-sensor.js#L220

You would have to expose the Arduino sensors through the browser using the Device Motion API (that probably requires modiyfing the  source code of the browser) or you can run a local server that passes the info to the page through WebSockets. I recommend using [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aframe) for questions. The issues are for bugs and feature requests.  Thanks!  Thanks for filing! There's a PR open right now.  This contains https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2567 
Can we remove it from this one? Thanks everybody! Controller collection complete. Cross platform achievement unlocked!  **Description:**

One image was causing three requests:

1. `<img>`  in `<a-assets>`.
2. Again if `crossorigin` wasn't set and A-Frame set it for you + re-requested.
3. three.js TextureLoader

**Changes proposed:**
- Pass `<img>` element through all the way down to the Texture creation process so that three.js TextureLoader doesn't get called. All the way down, we handle string (inline URLs) vs. element (`<a-assets>`).
- Store `<img>` element in THREE.Cache if we use `<a-assets>` so three.js doesn't ever re-fetch.
- Start enforcing `crossorigin` on images because else A-Frame will have to make a second request with the `crossorigin` flag set if it's not set.
- Set `crossOrigin` on the TextureLoader just in case, we had some reports of it not working for inline URLs
- [x] tests
  Thanks!  Thanks. We've deprecated a-animation anyways. Try https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation and file issues, and component will be merged in in the future.  Hi @oveddan — there's some (admittedly light) documentation on the [registerShader API](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/material.html#example-1), but you'll probably get more out of [this example](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/bbc2f0325cdd3c4bd95a69ce4ce9705b0e6a041d/examples/showcase/tracked-controls/shaders/skyGradient.js).

One thing that is lacking from the current implementation is a `tick()` method to update your uniforms. If you need uniforms other than the defaults provided by three.js, you may have a better time using a normal custom component with THREE.ShaderMaterial, as I've done in [this example](https://github.com/donmccurdy/webvr-experiments/blob/master/1-portal/components/transient-material.js).

More documentation is certainly welcome! But part of the reason we don't have it is because there's not a well-established best practice in A-Frame yet. Yeah, I think it's mostly because the API is half-cooked, and I'd prefer the component route for now. Adding documentation / disclaimers / links for that very welcome though.  thanks!  Thanks!  We can't test the 3DOF GearVR until it's released, and it's code baggage until then. Would make PR quick to test/review. The 0DOF trackpad style of interaction will start to lose relevance and in the long-term completely disappear, I'd leave it as a community feature. We're shipping sooner than that. 3 weeks is forever, and then there's the time to wait in line for the controllers and wait for shipment. Cool, thanks. GearVR's not too urgent, the controllers will take time to roll out amongst the GearVR + WebVR developer community and consumers as well. @machenmusik the controller motions are pretty laggy/slow to update.  Is the pose data coming through slow, or is this something else?  Also noticed this with the `aframe-daydream-controller` component.

Also regarding handedness.  Shouldn't this be exposed in the controller API?   The component should set that up for you. This is pretty close! :) Thanks for the patience @machenmusik I don't think it's the model.  Though I will experiment by taking it out to see if that helps to improve performance.   I'll whip up a a-frame example that works with the controller since the existing motion controls one doesn't work for 3dof. @machenmusik update:   definetly not the model.  removing it doesn't seem to help performance.  I should also mention that in-headset, the performance is good and it seems to be just the controller that laggy/slow.
 Could it be the browser not sending the pose frequent enough? OK, so some further testing.  It seems like the pose updates are just not very frequent.  I see this also in three.js examples as well.  So it's not something specific to the work here.

After some more testing, I definetly see some lag in native daydream apps as well, so it's definetly possible that it's a limitation with the controller itself.   It could be that they are doing some kind of interpolation with the pose that makes it less noticeable.

Edit:  Guess what I'm saying is that the perf issues are not something that should hold this patch back.  It seems that there is more of a general problem here to solve with the controller. Thanks! I'm going to merge this but I think we need a better example to illustrate the capabilities of a 3DOF a controller. Woo, thanks @mchen! When you have time, can you throw in some unit tests too?  Thanks!  **Description:**



Advantages:

- Single-property components are inflexible in that you cannot add a new property to the schema without having it be a breaking change. I was looking at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2297, and I couldn't add a new prop without a breaking change.
- Less confusing having to guess if a component is single-property or multi-property, for example, is it `hand-controls="hand: left"` or `hand-controls="left"` (some controllers are single-prop, some are multi)? Is it `gltf-model="src: #model"` or `gltf-model="#model"` (some loaders are single-prop, some are multi). It's been inconsistent so I've seen people make mistakes including myself
- Less documentation about schemas in the component API (https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/core/component.html#single-property-schema is a bit awkward to explain)
- Reduced API surface/branching in the component API (e.g., if you do this, then it's single prop, if you specify this, it's multi prop)
- Can delete a lot of code where we check isSingleProp in a lot of places in the core component code

If we do this, then we'd need to introduce a `default` property for cases such as position, rotation, scale that designates if the component value is used in single-prop mode:

```
schema: {
  position: {type: 'vec3', default: true}
}
```

 I agree with @machenmusik better use another property name to avoid confusion when using `default` How compatible is it to delete "a lot of code where we check isSingleProp" while maintaining cases like `position` and `rotation`? That sounds good if it's feasible; in any case I like the idea of having *fewer* single-property components. Models and controls probably need to be forward-compatible with adding properties. And if we do the last part of the proposal, do we need `el.getAttribute('position').position` to access that vector, or is the value still replacing the `data` object itself? I hadn't thought about `getAttribute`...I think it's better instead we recommend being more careful with using single-prop when more properties in the future can be added and when it makes sense.  Thanks. There are ways to do triangles currently (using the existing geometry and reducing the segments), but I guess a triangle would look like passing three vertices. Fixed!  I moved the webvr-polyfill fork to the aframevr org and rebase on top of the later master

In case you want to point to one locally.
 Yeah, but not exposed in the schema. I don't think we need anything magic, just a way to configure. Export the base URL? I'm just thinking simple: expose schema property where you provide a full URL or path. Don't have to think about what strings are added together and such. It's not too bad, you just make the URL constants into a schema property default. Users don't have to define if they don't need, but in the case they do (e.g., work offline), they can. Yeah if you want to override the model you can disable the default one and use your own model on your own higher level component specific to your application as the `hand-controls` component does or the `paint-controls` on a-painter. Most likely you will want to add logic to manage button highlights and animations Pattern at the moment is to set all *-controls to `model: false` and set model manually. We usually have an application-specific `controller` component  #2502  Thanks!  It's a design of A-Frame for better perf

https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/introduction/faq.html#why-is-the-html-dom-not-updating-in-a-frame
https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/components/debug.html#component-to-dom-serialization  Our event names don't have uppercase. Can we keep them lower cased? we could do `abuttonchanged` I'm a bit lost with all these PRs. What does this one includes?  I've tried this PR with Vive and Oculus touch and I observed a couple of problems:
1. The analog buttons (triggers in Vive an Oculus) return duplicated touchstart / touchend events on a single press.
2. The tracked controllers example only shows one hand with Vive while it works with both hands on Oculus What is exactly the problem with `gamepadconnected` / `gamepaddisconnected` ? I want to know how to report it as a bug for Firefox. Thanks!  Yeah. I can add a unit test too.  Yes, we could maybe have `el.addMixin()` / `el.removeMixin()`?  Is DK2 still supported by recent Oculus runtimes? In Firefox Nightly i see AFRAME.utils.checkHeadsetConnected() return `true` with a DK2 connected and using the following demo https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/anime-UI/.
Please reopen if this is still an issue.  Try https://github.com/ryanbetts/aframe-daydream-controller-component  I didn't include any extra information as it can be accessed directly by the target +1 for using gamepad ID rather than a new string. And if a new string is needed, we should be consistent on `-controls` or `-controller` here. I needed this feature to detect when a gamepad is connected and determine (without need to redo most of the work done already by the core components) if it's an oculus or a vive controller. 
In my particular case I needed to rotate the geometry of the gun to fit the controllers orientation differences. So I needed an event as the model could be loaded before the gamepad was already loaded.
I used `-controls` and `-controllers` to match the current components `vive-controls` and `oculus-touch-controllers`. I agree that we should define a consistent name for both, so probably we should start changin the name of these components? And even using singular instead of plural in their names?
I decided to send just the minimum amount of info because I could find the rest of info by looking at the target's componet, but f you feel that the ID could be useful too for sure we could include.
I'm open to any other proposal that could works for the same purposes.



 @fernandojsg would the example that @machenmusik points out in the codepen work for you? the @machenmusik proposal probably could works in most of the cases but I feel we're adding some extra steps that are not really necessary: adding a new component `which-controller-present` (should it be included in the core, or should we link from the aframe registry?), include that component in all the `tracked-controls` entities you want to check.
I feel it's the same if we'll create a `is-model-loaded` component and will emit a event when a `json-model` is loaded, and we should include it on every model we've loaded.
Maybe users could have also strange behaviour if this component is initialized after the tracked-controls is ready so it won't catch the events.
Probably a mix between the two approach could be to include that code inside the `tracked-controls` to remove my proposal code in each controls and emit these events directly from the tracked-controls. 
 I've updated my PR with the component code of @machenmusik included directly on the `tracked-controls` . So we don't need that extra component and it's cleaner also as we don't need to remember to include that component. What do you think? Let's make `tracked-controls` properties `id`, `prefixId` and `controller` multi valuated to avoid collisions so the controller detection moves down from `oculus-touch-controls`, `vive-controls` to `tracked-controls`. We can then emit an event in `updateGamepad` when one of the controllers we're looking for is detected (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/tracked-controls.js#L77) I was trying to solve duplicated code and emitting the event in one sweep. There's an easy way to emit the higher level event by passing the component to `isControllPresent` or mixing the function int the component (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/utils/tracked-controls.js#L34) My main concern with moving the logic from `vive/oculus-controls` to `tracked-controls` is that it could grow up a lot as more controllers appears isn't it? Or maybe we could refactor after a while with something like `registerController` to specify the name and how it should detect it :)

So to follow with the PR with @dmarcos proposal, we should move `checkIfControllerPresent` and `injectTrackedControls` from the  `vive/oculus-controls` to `tracked-controls` right? and the rest code should remain on each component. And so the `trackedcontrollerconnected` event will be emitted in the `injectTrackedControls` on  `tracked-controls` similar as I did on the same function but on each component. Let's do something easier. The `isControllPresent` signature will receive the component and it will manage the `controllerPresent` flag. The event wil be emitted only when the controller shows up passing the component name in the detail. We have to make `oculus-touch-controls` use `isControllerPresent` again I've modified the `isControllerPresent` to accept a `component` parameter instead a `sceneEl`. And this function will emit the event if present.
I've modified (just while we're discussing this PR, nothing definitely) the trackedcontrols example to add a listener for these events on each hand and log them. But it just keep printing forever.
Time to sleep here, but if someone have any idea, it's more than welcome ;) I've refactored the code and moved all the inject and add/remove eventlistener to a new function in `utils/tracked-controls` `checkControllerPresentAndSetup` (Any suggestion for a better name maybe?) and it's working as expected.

The test are still not passing, as in `checkControllerPresentAndSetup` I'm calling `isControllerPresent` that we were mocked previously as they were included on the component itself, but now I'm calling it directly from the utils module and I can't think on an easy way to mock it so we could return true or false so it could inject correctly the listener and the component. Any idea?
 @machenmusik thanks! I've used your implementation and it's working as expected 👍  Thank you! That's x2 bonus points for a PR that removes more code than adds.  I've a question, Do we need to call `addControllersUpdateListener` on `play` even if the controller is not present? @machenmusik ok thanks, I've just keep them by now to keep the consistency between all the controllers components, we could address that later if needed.

@dmarcos fixed the issue with the `remove/add listeners` on `play/pause` Thanks! @machenmusik I used false as I saw that we're initializing `controllerPresent = false` in all the `init` for each controller's component and that's why I used that value as default.  Can you file this on the Inspector? IMO, the Export feature is hard to make right  Thanks!  Thanks for filing. I wonder if it's an issue with the `collidable` entity not being initialized in time the raycaster does its `querySelector`, even though the raycaster should be listening for attached entities. What happens if you swap the order, or remove the `objects` check? Ah, right. Setting `dependencies: ['raycaster']` will initialize raycaster on the entity. Thus you were having a dummy raycaster not emitting events?  Thanks! I didn't think about this before, but there's no way to tell if the parser should be run in general on a default value. We don't know if the default value supplied is pre-parsed or parsed. The PR works for `vec2`/`vec3`, but that's a bit too ad-hoc.

Perhaps the proper solution is to enforce the default values be already parsed, and not allow, for example, strings to be passed as default values for `vec3`s? It's guaranteed to affect more than just `vec2` and `vec3`. I think proper solution is to enforce post-parsed default values in schemas. We can have a `validateSchema` method that performs several checks when a component is registered and throws some warnings / errors in console if things do comply like having 
````javascript
v: {type: 'vec2', default: 'ohYeah'}
```` Sorry, after reading the original issue more, I think it's OK to normalize some default values where we can. It's not often we access `schema.propertyName.default` manually anyways.

  Note we currently have a couple of cherry-picked commits we need to pull in. Currently using a fork `dmarcos/webvr-polyfill#a02a8089b` @HalfdanJ thanks @HalfdanJ what bug fixes are missing? #2700  Sounds good to me. Labeled if anyone wants to grab it.  Tested. Thanks!  I guess the advantage of having them as function is that the logic to determine if the environment isGearVR, isOS, isNode does not run unless is required. These are always run though since we call them from index.js and a-scene.js. The disadvantage is that we are calling them multiple times. Can rebase this now Thanks! Love the test code deletions.  What kind of markup is that? Are you using any library? I see things being rendered. I'm not sure what you're expecting to see. Can you be more specific or provide a simpler example? `%cA-Frame:warn %cPut the A-Frame <script> tag in the <head> of the HTML *before* the scene to ensure everything for A-Frame is properly registered before they are used from HTML.%c +0ms`

Put the A-Frame script above the scene.  - A-Frame Version: 0.5.0

I'm having recurring problems stemming from the `userHeight` offset in `camera`.

1. It defaults to `0`, except if you don't include a camera in your scene, in which case it defaults to `1.6`. This is likely confusing for new users.
2. One of the less-awful locomotion mechanisms for mobile users is something like `checkpoint-controls`. I would like to do one of the following:

```html
<a-entity universal-controls="movementControls: checkpoint"
          checkpoint-controls="mode: teleport">
  <a-entity camera="userHeight: 1.6"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

^This breaks, because the camera's offset is inside the entity being rotated. Looking down moves the camera closer to the ground.

***

```html
<a-entity camera 
          position="0 1.6 0"
          universal-controls="movementControls: checkpoint"
          checkpoint-controls="mode: animate">
</a-entity>
```

^This mostly works with mobile, but breaks with roomscale devices, and all of the checkpoints need to include this 1.6 offset as their `y` values.

***

```html
<a-entity camera="userHeight: 1.6"
          universal-controls="movementControls: checkpoint"
          checkpoint-controls="mode: animate">
</a-entity>
```

This looks better, but fails in all the same ways as the last example – the camera is going to directly modify the position of the entity (which ideally a camera would not do...) and now the checkpoints need to somehow be device-aware and include or exclude the offset appropriately.

***

Getting into the longer discussion of #2265, but I wanted to give a concrete example of the difficulty. I'd like to be able to give people a default that more-or-less works with both mobile and roomscale, but it's not obvious how to do that without hardcoding userHeight in a lot of places. I'm not sure. I think that these methods...

```
camera.removeHeightOffset()
camera.saveCameraPose()
camera.restoreCameraPose()
```

... would ideally be in `look-controls`, not `camera`. In that case I could implement my own component that handles the height offset without worrying about a camera that mutates itself. yeah. probably look-controls is a better place for that logic look-controls is used for more than just cameras, which is why i think carving off the mutating portion into a separate component may be safer... to me, look-controls should only apply the orientation, and if there is some auto user height offset logic, that should be a separate component that can be used for that purpose (e.g. if someone wanted geometry or text to auto adjust to eye level) Fixed by https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3327  @ngokevin what do you think of the `pre` scripts? I kind of prefer to see everything explicitly defined in the command. Those pre things are kind of magical and easy to miss when trying to understand how things work I agree, I'd rather see it explicitly because they're easy to miss. Thanks though!  Thanks!  Thanks!  Thanks!  I think we'll pass on this since most editors require a specific EditorConfig plugin for this to work, not quite agnostic enough. If there's a more general way to tell editors to follow the linting rules, we can check that out.   Use `raycaster.objects` property to filter what you want to intersect. If you no longer want to intersect, then remove the entity from the selector group, and refresh the raycaster manually (`el.components.raycaster.refreshObjects()`).  In other parts of the code base we have checks `isXXX`. I prefer to keep function name consistency over grammatical correctness  Name consistency is about developer ergonomics. Thinking about it is actually even gramatically correct. `isCoordinate` actually means the variable is of the type `coordinate` I would just change `isCoordinate` to `isCoordinates` since the function is to determine if a the passed string contains coordinates Thanks!  Thanks!  Thanks!  I'm looking how we can cache `<img>` elements so that it's downloaded once and stored in the three.js Cache. But a workaround is to use `<a-asset-item>` instead of `<img>` for images. Fix under review https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2544 Try to set `crossorigin="anonymous"` on the images Works for me: https://glitch.com/~aframe-2472

P.S., there's not much point in adding to a-assets dynamically. That's for preloading and blocking. You can set the material src inline without creating an `<img>` I've updated it to be more correct. https://aframe-2472.glitch.me/

The problem is setting an image with `<img>` before its loaded. The original Glitch/GitHub issue was trying to dynamically append an `<img>` to `<a-assets>` so I was trying to work within those parameters. If you are using `<img>`, we must wait for it to fully load first, which `<a-assets>` does.

If you want to set dynamically, set inline URL on the src and texture loader will load the image first before setting.
  **Description:** 
Currently we use `requestAnimationFrame`'s timestamp as the time to be used on `scene.render`, to update the `TWEEN` and the scene itself.
The following code (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/vendor/VREffect.js#L186-L194) is used to detect which `requestAnimationFrame` we should call, if we've one HMD connected it will call the `vrDisplay`'s one. 

```javascript
this.requestAnimationFrame = function( f ) {
		if ( vrDisplay !== undefined ) {
			return vrDisplay.requestAnimationFrame( f );
		} else {
			return window.requestAnimationFrame( f );
		}
	};
```

The problem is that even if you have a HMD connected, it takes a while to init it so for a few frames it will call `window.requestAnimationFrame` and after that `vrDisplay.requestAnimationFrame`.
`window.requestAnimationFrame` will returns the timestamp since the page was **loaded**, but 
`vrDisplay.requestAnimationFrame` on firefox nightly returns the timestamp relative to the **first load of the browser** not the current page (@kearwood could correct me if I'm wrong here).
So that generates that jump in the timestamp that we see in nightly:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/782511/23706478/a1d26b20-040e-11e7-8f67-8fb3b09a871b.png)
We can see that:
- 0 is generated by https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/scene/a-scene.js#L392
- Then we have 3 frames with 3xxx generated by the `windows.RAF`
- Finally `vrDisplay.RAF` jumps in and sends the, much higher, timestamp as I had the browser opened for a while.

So we have two problems:
- The jumps between these values generates incorrect deltas and can generate weird issues (Like the one we've seen in TWEEN: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2175)
- The timestamp is typically used to control the timeline of the experience, and we're using an incorrect value for that.

So my proposal is to use `THREE.Clock` or `DATE / performance.now` directly on the render loop to be consistent across browsers and independent from the `RAF` being used.  Can you pull request that to WebVR polyfill? Thanks!  https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/debug.html#component-to-dom-serialization  should work. scripts need to be defined before a-scene.

 Looks good, thanks!  I don't think it should be renamed. It's a spread pattern in the code base to have isXXX to check for the type of a value. In this particular case I would even say that it's gramatically correct since it should be read as "is the string passed of the type coordinates?" maybe adding an s at the end would be enough `isCoordinates`  @caseyyee ping here for your experiences  You can manually refresh the raycaster with `el.components.raycaster.refreshObjects()`. Can you re-post this answer to StackOverflow? Thanks!  I don't understand why `emulated` is for and why it's needed. If I cannot understand it quickly by reading the docs myself that I wrote the original controls :) I bet there will be a lot of other people that will be confused.  Some times it plays but it does not play the animation in reverse. Sometimes they get stuck in a pose. Probable causes: Models update, three.js update (maybe the animation API has changed)...
 On Firefox Nightly, the first animation always plays smoothly. But then subsequent animations are instant / snap / don't interpolate smoothly.

Another issue I have is the poses get stuck until I manually push the trigger back to its resting state. I feel after you release the trigger, the button value isn't completely at `0`. But at a value close to 0. We need to introduce a threshold.

The models are also a bit too bright. They look flat-shaded. Maybe we can make the material less shiny / reflective / darker? RE: Threshold. I meant for the Vive trigger. When I released, it wasn't all the way released, like it'd be 0.01mm off from the full resting state, so I had to pull it up to trigger a triggerup. Yeah, maybe...just a tiny threshold for what button value determines an event vs. 0 and 1. Firefox will handle the setting of the threshold now. I'm looking at this now. Here's a recording for tracked-controls example if you want to reproduce.

  We can force enable WebVR through the browser config on mobile to test, right?  I've added docs and made the quick update. Thanks!  I updated the docs some more because I forgot to do that when we changed the clobber logic for setAttribute, and did some style nits to the tests. Thanks!  Np, we originally did what you did, add a check, but if it's manifesting again we need to see what's really up Duping https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2521, will write a test to investigate  The camera component restores the camera pose when exiting VR. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/camera.js#L163
What about handling it there? @RSpace thanks for testing. I need to spend some time understanding the problem a bit better to see what is the best solution. Thanks!  Thanks!  It's helpful to be able to entities to different parents.   Currently, to do this, you need to:

1) flush entity to DOM (to preserve your entity state).
2) copy the entity.
3) add copy to new parent entity element.
4) remove the existing entity.

```js
var entity = document.querySelector('#myelement');
var newParent = document.querySelector('#mynewparent');
entity.flushToDom();
var copy = entity.cloneNode();
newParent.appendChild(copy);
entity.parentNode.removeChild(entity);
```

To do this in three.js, it's a simple matter of changing the `object3d.parent`.   DOM `parentNode` and `parentElement` are read only properties, so you cannot re-write to a new parent.  Not sure if this applies any differently to custom element/web component.

It would be nice to just:
```js
entity.parent = newParent;
```

Also welcome any suggestions for any alternative way of doing this that I may have missed.


 @caseyyee what are the use cases for reparenting you have in mind? There are `Entity.add` and `Entity.addToParent`, but then they wouldn't be represented in the DOM. Maybe those methods should check if the DOM node is not attached, and attach if so.

Use case I can immediately think of is grabbing an object and putting it in a hand's local coordinate space. Yes, grabbing and object would be a prime example of why you would want to do this.

The add method would work, but I figure you would want to keep the DOM tree faithful to the THREE scene structure.   
 We might want to wrap the methods `insertBefore` / `insertAfter` for entities I guess the quick&dirty way could works but it will recreate all the components from the cloned entity.
Ideally the three.js object could be just moved using `.parent = blabla` but the DOM moved without reinitliazing the whole stuf, but I'm not sure how to do that.
I agree that a very common use will be grabbing objects and doing just `.parent = blabla` it's the way you do typically in unity for example, as it's easy and performant. Trying to re-parent now to grab something. API Options:

- `.setParent(parentEl)`
- Moving a child to another parent: `.parentNode = anotherEl` (this could internally use `.setParent()`)
- Having a parent adopt a child: Wrap `.appendChild` to see if it's already attached, then re-parent. (this could internally use `.setParent()`)

Implementation options:

What component data do we want to keep? Do you keep local transforms? Just take original component data? Runtime data?

I might just keep it simpler and do @caseyyee's flushToDOM and copy over. Then up to application to do any processing of data. First, a simpler solution to re-parent. Doesn't take much work so I don't think we need an API. Although we can document it.

```js
entity.flushToDom();
newParent.appendChild(entity);
```

Second, @dmarcos came up with a much better idea for temporary grabbing. Move the three.js `Object3D` as a child of the hand's `Object3D`, and leave the DOM as is. When you ungrab, you can resync the DOM if wanted. I'm gonna try that out. Example code for grabbing / ungrabbing by re-parenting the Object3D:

Grab:

```js
 // World to local transform so position and rotation do not change when moved.
handEl.object3D.updateMatrixWorld();
worldToLocal = new THREE.Matrix4().getInverse(handEl.object3D.matrixWorld);
object3D.applyMatrix(worldToLocal);
```

Ungrab:

```js
// Get world transforms.
position = activePrimitiveObject3D.getWorldPosition();
rotation = activePrimitiveObject3D.getWorldRotation();

// Move object back to original parent.
sceneEl.object3D.add(object3D);

// Sync world transforms back to entity.
el.setAttribute('position', position);
el.setAttribute('rotation', {
  x: THREE.Math.radToDeg(rotation.x),
  y: THREE.Math.radToDeg(rotation.y),
  z: THREE.Math.radToDeg(rotation.z)
});
```
 I agree with @machenmusik.

There are many general cases where you want the change reflected into the DOM and not just changed on Object3D.

Maybe a more relatable example:
```html
<a-bag></a-bag>
<a-car></a-car>
```
Now put the bag into the car and drive it around:
``` html
<a-car>
  <a-bag></a-bag>
</a-car>
```

So to answer @ngokevin earlier questions:

* `setParent(newParent)` seems to fit better in terms of consistency with other API that we already have.  I feel `appendChild()` is slightly less clear.
* Ideally we keep all components and state.   I know this is harder to achieve and for now, `flushToDom()` would probably do the trick for now.
* I wouldn't make any local/global coordinate.  Though as an option would be super nice ie:
`entity.setParent(newParent, { convertToLocal: true })`

A high effort, but maybe worthwhile  idea would be to separate the DOM tree from three.js scene graph.  Doing this, would make reparenting non-destructive and give us flexibility and performance in other areas as well.  Anyways, more pie in the sky than anything else. Yeah, a nice to have. But working around or doing it manually is fairly easy. If we wanted to add DOM syncing or account for controller offsets, we could at the application-level. 

And yeah, an A-Frame implementation should separate DOM from three.js somehow. For reference, the current mode of simulating "grabbing" or re-parenting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd-Qc9TuHZ0

Umm off top of my head, I think it's like: have a dummy object under the parent. Invert the entity's world matrix/transforms. Apply dummy object's matrixWorld transforms to entity. Or something similar. If I get around to this again, I'll post code.  How difficult to split the `emulated` changes from the `axismove` additions? I don't understand at first sight what the emulated property does. If I don't get it quickly that I wrote the original controls many other people will get confused too. `emulated` won't be used often, almost purely for motion capture replaying. Where you want to force controller event listeners to be added despite no controllers being present. Currently, we add controller event listeners regardless which causes events to be double-emitted. @dmarcos Any thoughts? Issue is when we made controls always add event listeners, controller events would double emit for hand-controls since both Oculus + Vive event handlers are attached. The proposal is an `emulated` property which controls when we force event listeners to be added. Let us know if you have other proposals (e.g., naming `forceEventListeners`, `forcePresent`), but the use case is for emulating + motion capture. It's more easy to review if things are in isolation, so we'll try not to clump non-cohesive changes together in one PR. @dmarcos still needs to take a look and understand, but the tl;dr is that we forced event listeners to be added regardless of Gamepad present in order for motion capture, but that causes doubly-emitted events (vive + oculus controls). The proposed `emulated` property will only add *all* event listeners if specifically enabled. Would you mind breaking out the `axismove` changes to another PR?  After discussing in Slack, it seems we'll revert https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2314 for another solution, so we don't need `emulated`. Thanks!  I think it's fine to not move that complexity into A-Frame. The complexity is the result of trying to have an Export feature that tries to turn runtime code into source code, which is messy.  Thanks for answering. Yes, DOM methods can be used as normal. It's up front on the introduction page: https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/introduction/#javascript (`We can use traditional JavaScript DOM APIs to manipulate A-Frame scenes to add logic, behavior, and functionality`).

Questions should also be asked on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aframe  Does this block #2378?

I think the caching is a moot point for now, GLTFLoader has a cache built in. In terms of preloading, agree, but it's the same situation as other loaders (OBJ and COLLADA won't pre-load their textures, either) except that glTF file can optionally have larger `.bin` resources. If someone wants to combine everything (geometry, shaders, textures, ...) into a single `.glb` file they can do that, and the COLLADA->GLTF converter supports it. So don't think this should be too critical, or least not enough to justify a special case for glTF.

If it is something we want to solve robustly, maybe we want a general model case for assets?

```html
<a-asset-item type="model" gltf-model="url(...)"></a-asset-item>
```

And if the type is `model`, the asset waits for a `model-loaded` event rather than a particular file URL. This should work for all model types, including their textures, and the `*-model` components theoretically wouldn't need to change (although `el.setObject3D()` might break...). Let's try to look into this with 0.7.0. As it is now, the `.gltf` will be cached but multiple requests get made for `.bin` files referenced by this. Probably this should be fixed at the three.js level, not here, but I'm not sure. What about inferring from the file extension and we keep the `src` API? That pre-parsing is feasible for glTF... I'm less excited about doing it for other formats like COLLADA and OBJ. Would we be comfortable only doing this for glTF? If not, and we want it to work for other types of models, I think we need some system by which `<a-asset-item/>` can actually invoke the appropriate loader, like:

```html
<a-asset-item gltf-model="foo.gltf"/>
``` > Seems to me that, assuming it's possible, the use of .glb (single file) should be encouraged if folks want to be able to preload as a generic single file?

Great point. It's not possible to convert a glTF->glb directly yet, but that should be supported soon-ish. Maybe we just recommend `.glb` wherever possible. Even for a `.glb`, the asset management system isn't behaving the way i'd like:

```html
<a-scene environment>
      <a-assets>
        <a-asset-item id="castle" src="../assets/castle/Castle.glb"></a-asset-item>
      </a-assets>
      <a-entity position="0 0 0"
                scale="3 3 3"
                gltf-model="#castle">
      </a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

In this example the scene starts presenting with just the environment visible, and the castle flickers in a second later. Because GLTFLoader parses asynchronously, presumably. I'm inclined to say we don't NEED to solve secondary dependencies of `<a-asset-item/>` `.gltf` files yet, but we should have a better story for loading a `.glb` ideally. Waiting until a `.glb` has parsed would probably fix the first case anyway. There are now multiple tools (https://sbtron.github.io/makeglb/, https://glb-packer.glitch.me/) for packing glTF files and their dependencies into GLB archives, so I don't think we should do anything special for `.gltf` here.

As mentioned above, it would be ideal if there were some way to ensure a `.glb` (or other model) can hold the asset system until it _parses_, not just until the content is downloaded, because parsing may not complete for several frames. Renaming the issue accordingly.  Constants are supposed to be internal to core. I would not like to expose them unless there's a good reason to. @kellyselden What's exactly your use case? Can you be more specific on what *keeping your app in sycn with upstream changes* mean? @kellyselden You can access the default value before initialization like this: `AFRAME.components.camera.schema.userHeight.default` Can you use `cameraEl.getAttribute('camera').userHeight` to get the value? Sorry for the circles. I think given there's no good way to grab the value, we make constants public, but be careful about what we place in the constants folder. We can have a constants index.js that exposes public things. If something needs to be private, then constants live within their own modules or directly require constant files. 0 is the default for the camera component, but 1.6 is the default for the default camera.  @xgqfrms-GitHub welcome! Yes, it is a custom element based on [newer web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Custom_Elements). Much of A-Frame's syntax involves using elements like `<a-entity />` or attributes like `<a-entity foo bar />` to create relationships between [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) objects. For example, `<a-scene />` is closely related to [THREE.Scene](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=scene#Reference/Scenes/Scene).

The [FAQ](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/introduction/faq.html) and [Slack](https://aframe.io/community/#slack) are good options for learning more.  Thanks! Almost done! @machenmusik yes I know that there's a few incosistencies but I always push in reviews to use the past participle as event names. The DOM event names are totally inconsistent Yeah! I don't like the harcoded relationship axis0 / axis1 to `trackpad` either. We should use the mapping object somehow. @machenmusik @cmvanp I'm merging this patch but feel free to come up with an improvement @cmvanb Thanks and congrats for your first patch!    We now do a warning https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2511 if the default value doesn't match the type rather than trying to force parse. Thanks Damon!  Unfortunately, that would increase the size of the JS. It's easier for now to document and read it externally on the READMEs, which the Inspector can one day consume if we enforce and curate the format for the README. Auto-generated documentation usually adds more maintenance work while producing less friendly docs.  A very convenient scenario for handling 3d scenes could be having **all** the objects in the scene saved in just one 3d file (obj, json, gltf,...) with the objects inside the scene properly named. So there would be just one file to load, just one `<a-asset-item>`, simplifying also all file handling and workflow. 

For this to work, we would need a way of assigning the objects from the scene to individual entities. Something like this could be nice:

```xml
<a-assets>
  <a-asset-item id="room" src="room.gltf"></a-asset-item>
</a-assets>

<a-entity model-object="from:#room; obj:chair"></a-entity>
<a-entity model-object="from:#room; obj:table"></a-entity>
```

Is there anything like this available already?

 +1, there was a similar question on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42074856/aframe-clone-object3d-within-entity/42076326?noredirect=1#comment71360013_42076326

Probably an external/registry component for starters? Should be a property of the obj-model, gltf-model... or agnostic to those? Agnostic I think, not aware of any format-specific needs. Yeah, once the model is loaded and in a THREEJS object, we can extract any object in an agnostic fashion.

@donmccurdy yeah, something like that component. Do you think it is such an edge case that should not be in core? I'm happy either way. Maybe I'm not familiar enough with modeling workflows to know if bundling assets into a single file is common/useful.
 We should differentiate the uses where you want to clone the object or just use a reference to it Could this be a good feature for `0.8.0`?. Once a model is loaded there's a lot manual work to do to manipulate the model (change textures, access sub models, animate...) and A-Frame is not making it easier to deal with them. There's an opportunity for us to provide a convenient API to manipulate models after they are loaded (obj, collada or gltf). @feiss idea was that any component can define an `onModelLoaded` method that gets called whenever a model loads on the entity. a `model` object is passed as an argument that contains an convenient API for manipulation either declarative like the one originally proposed (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2408#issue-208426083) or imperative like:
  - model[name] to access sub objects.
  - model.setLambertMaterial(selectorObj, lambertProperties) > Once a model is loaded there's a lot manual work to do to manipulate the model (change textures, access sub models, animate...)

Could we collect a list of these use cases somewhere, in a bit more detail? I'm not sure I have a good enough handle on them to propose an API. A few comments on these specific items:

- **change textures** — this is definitely something users ask for a lot, but, i think many don't understand how UV wrapping works... if we give them this API, is it just going to be a footgun?
- **access sub models** — +1 for doing something here, although not sure yet whether it belongs in core.
- **animate** — i think this is all set? we could move `animation-mixer` into core if that helps, but note it doesn't work with COLLADALoader.  > I consider accessing sub objects pretty important. It would allow users to pack all (or many) objects in just one scene, so it can be much more convenient both authoring the assets and loading them (with the additional benefit of having only one request). 

+1 on this, I agree. Although, there are at least two use cases, that might require different implementations:

1. After loading a model, unpack all children into new (A-Frame) entities in the scene. User can then use raw JS, (or Blender custom properties?), to apply components to each.
2. Before loading a model, user declares entities that should pull specific things out of that model (for example, the original post in this thread).

If either should be in core, I think it would be (2). I've implemented (1) at times as well, but maybe that is more niche.

> Adding a lightweight abstraction API of threejs tightly coupled to the A-Frame component structure

I'm more nervous about this. The three.js APIs are already a fairly high level abstraction around WebGL. And, I think it's a benefit not a drawback that you wind up writing three.js code (and using three.js docs + stack overflow) when working with A-Frame. Most of those things can be done fairly cleanly with three.js. The `fadeIn`/`fadeOut` methods are an exception, but I think that's a case for considering new imperative animation APIs rather than new abstraction on top of three.js. Good points. The distinction about re-creating the hierarchy is interesting. I've avoided that when trying this in the past (nesting is a problem with physics, which was my use case). But other users might want to preserve their model's structure. I've done https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/gltf-part#aframe-gltf-part-component for my own needs three.js: `mesh.getObjectByName('whatever')` would be awkward if the hierarchies don't match up. So perhaps if you use my part component, and have another component that generates an entity for every single part. And then attach components afterward? I think there will be lots of different use cases for this, probably not possible to have one component that does it all... Seems best to just make components as the need comes up and figure out what works well.  Good catch!  https://github.com/jpchase/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md
 I submitted a token request @RSpace saw [your comment](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2444#issuecomment-297645014) in issue #2444, thanks.

I did some tests, and when the `chrome://flags#enable-webvr` flag is enabled, the A-Frame examples do work for me with mobile Chrome (release channel M56 + M57) and Chrome Canary ("nightly" builds). Let me know if you're seeing something else. Thanks!  Duping with https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2472

I have looked at this issue a couple times, but will fix soon, it's an important bug  Can you provide the web console output using the broken build?  Cool. Yeah, adding `<a-asset-item>` should work.  …of the material the texture is removed (fix #2388)

 @machenmusik @ngokevin alternative to https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2393 @machenmusik what about now? A bit more clear? This code is overly complicated and difficult to understand and maintain. I'm looking for opportunities to improve it.   Thanks!  **This issue opens following discussion:**  
**Would it be useful to have scheduled A-Frame hangouts/meetups for collaborators.**

Take-away from our Skype call and discussion (15th Feb), following questions were raised and best way to stress these is to have open discussion here. We need to determine whether we need or can gain something from such hangouts and what benefits that would bring for A-Frame release life-cycle. Currently A-Frame development discussions take place in [slack](https://aframe.io/community/#slack), under github [issues](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues) and some face-to-face which has so far proven to be fairly productive in general and therefore questions and discussion here are to cover only the extra values what such meetups could bring. We reserved [9:00 am - 10:00 am Wed, Mar 1 2017](http://bit.ly/2l8YagC) to have our first hangout however date and time may change! After all goal of this issue here is also to determine format, schedule, agenda, time for first hangout.

**Questions to be answered**

- **What would be primary objectives for such hangouts**
take-away proposals from our session
  - Focus small pre selected subset of targets for upcoming release
  - Having productive and organized discussion about the roadmap
  - Discuss high priority issues
  - Discuss open pull requests
  - Discuss  short term goals of A-Frame e.g next version
  - Discuss long term goals of A-Frame e.g v1.0.0
  - Discuss features/issues to drop from milestone
  - ...

- **How often should we have such hangouts**
proposal was once a month

- **What would be the duration of the session**
proposal was 1 hour

- **What would be the agenda**
Agenda should be fixed here as result of open discussion .
  -  one of the ideas was to pick 5 topics before hangout and assign each topic to different person who leads the subject to be covered within 10 minutes during the session. these 5 topics can be anything specific issue, PR feature etc.

- **What would be the best weekday and time for it**
This is totally open and we should find the week day and time so that it would be possible to join as many interested participants as possible.

**Waiting for your proposals, ideas, suggestions and everything else related to the topic.**

  Can we add unit tests? Both for `setAttribute('material', 'src', '')` and `removeAttribute('material', 'src')`. Thanks!  Pretty sure i've answered this question half a dozen times in slack, but i can't find any permanent FAQ or documentation for it.

Summary of points to cover:

1. Check the console for errors or warnings (CORS, parsing errors, etc.)
2. Open the `.mtl` file and make sure that paths to textures are relative, not absolute.
3. ??? *BEGIN DRAFT*

**Troubleshooting a 3D model**

3D models are created in many different programs, exported to different formats, and often have problems that will show up in some viewers (e.g. A-Frame or THREE.js) but not in the editor that created them (e.g. Blender).

Steps for troubleshooting a 3D model:

1. [Open the JavaScript console](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/77337) and check for any errors.
2. If you see an error related to CORS, the file is not correctly hosted. [Set up a local server](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/introduction/getting-started.html#using-a-local-server) to resolve this, or use a free hosting option like [Neocities](https://neocities.org/).
3. Try opening the model in a good native application, like [FBX Review](http://www.autodesk.com/products/fbx/fbx-review). If the model works in FBX Review but not A-Frame, it's likely that something about the model is not supported by THREE.js loaders. Try converting to a different format, or searching for bug reports on the [THREE.js issue tracker](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues). If an OBJ, COLLADA, or FBX model cannot be opened in FBX Review, the file is probably corrupt.
4. If there are no errors, but you see nothing: The scale of models are often very, very large in comparison to the camera. They might be 1000 times bigger than the user such that the user is inside the model and cannot see it. Try scaling it down scale=".001 .001 .001" and see where it is. The A-Frame Inspector (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>) will help with this.

Format-specific issues:

**OBJ/MTL** — MTL files often have incorrect paths to textures. Open the MTL file in any plaintext editor and look for absolute paths (`C:\\foo\bar\baz.png`) that should be relative (`bar\baz.png`).

**FBX** — THREE.FBXLoader supports only ASCII FBX files, not binary.

*END DRAFT*

Patched together from various SO posts:

- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40433713/why-does-my-obj-mtl-model-material-show-up-as-black
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38740086/why-is-my-model-not-loading-with-a-frame
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42149435/a-frame-obj-mtl-why-i-do-not-see-anything Sounds good. We need a standalone guide for `Adding Models` which this would fit in well. After I filed this issue, we have added a troubleshooting section to the docs: https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/introduction/models.html#troubleshooting

So it's not in the FAQ, but the content is there. I think this can be closed. But we could also add a link to this content from the *Why does my asset (e.g., image, video, model) not load?* section maybe.  Copied from Slack:

^There is no actual `cursor` component there, but regardless we should implement the `remove()` function. Just detaching the entire element should work in the case above. @codechikbhoka thanks. do you want to open a PR? i can grab this unless someone has started sure  Hi @lennerd — A key distinction between A-Frame and React is that A-Frame doesn't require use of a bundler — most of our users are probably loading A-Frame as a `<script src="..."/>` from CDN, and are often unfamiliar with more advanced JS tooling. My vote would be to avoid introducing separate production and development builds, because for many users just opening the JS console is an "AHA" moment. If there were a fork, development should be the default in our documentation.

Omitting unused portions of `package.json` sounds very reasonable. Perhaps we could consider moving from Browserify to Webpack or Rollup (I believe the latter two support tree-shaking?).

As a baseline of discussion, v0.5.0 weighs in at:

- 1,100kb minified.
- 283kb gzipped.

Of that, THREE.js is responsible for about half:

- 504kb minified.
- 128kb gzipped. Sounds good. Experimenting with the build seems like the right first step, especially if we can compare sizes of the resulting binaries. Webpack is more popular ofc, but Three.js recently switched to Rollup so I'm curious what that's like.

(And will need to defer to @ngokevin or @dmarcos for final say) We'd have to narrow down exactly what we'd be able to shave off, if anything, if we moved to Webpack. In A-Frame, schemas primarily define **parsing**, not validation, and even then the code is extremely thin for that.

As Don said, React is a different ecosystem where you're pretty much mandated to use build tools. Even though you could theoretically do it, no one uses React without build tools. I'd be interested in seeing the build size comparisons, and I do prefer Webpack, but I don't think you save much size besides the tiny overhead for each module. 125kb savings sounds promising so far! Took a look through the minified code and have a couple more ideas. Haven't verified much of this, but it looks like:

- [ ] package.json, 3.3kb
- [ ] 2 videos, 6kb and 3kb (one is used for wakelock, maybe?)
- [ ] 3 implementations of `isMobile` total size 7kb
- [ ] 4 SVGs, mostly small but the largest is 52kb.
  - the 52kb one is definitely worth looking into..

Other things we're already considering deprecating and moving into separate repos:

- [ ] THREE.ColladaLoader (??kb)
- [ ] tween.js (6kb) + `<a-animation/>` code (??kb)
 One thing I would like to comment on this. While reducing the size of the build is important we have to evaluate how much energy is worth investing on it. The size of the assets that the average VR application is going to load will make a-frame build size negligible in comparison. For instance, The vive controller model weights already 1.5 MB from the obj and another 1.X MB from the textures (https://github.com/aframevr/assets/blob/gh-pages/controllers/vive/vr-controller-vive.obj) and that's just a single asset :-) Certainly there's a point of diminishing returns; i'd agree 3-5kb changes are probably not worth conditional logic in normal/minified builds. But if webpack shaves 125kb, that's relevant to mobile users. 50kb of SVG is similarly suspicious. Want to deal with just those two?

To be honest, I think 1.5MB is too much for the vive controllers, too. That's >30,000 tris before you've even added any content to the scene. And it's <600kb after conversion to glTF. 😬 The vive controllers can indeed be optimized. It's an example illustrating that just a couple of assets will make the build size responsible for just a tiny fraction of the loading time. In an asset heavy medium I would not go out of our way to optimize the build size of a-frame. Webpack enforcing workflows and tooling into our users is another cost that has to be factored in. I would look first on cheap ways to improve our build size without replacing the tooling @lennerd Can you provide more info about your particular use case? How big is the a-frame build compared to other assets that your average embed loads? wontfixing as it's hard to go from here, but can look at PRs for smaller, more specific changes if anyone wants to do. considering the size of A-Frame is equivalent to an image, KBs here and there aren't as weighted as they would be on a normal 2D page's expectations IMO  @a-frobot docs-v0.5.0  Looks a lot like this error: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34662574/node-js-getting-error-nodemon-internal-watch-failed-watch-enospc

I don't know if the accepted answer will work on Solus. If that is the problem, perhaps we can exclude some directories (\*cough\* node_modules) from the filesystem watch?

EDIT: Better link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16748737/grunt-watch-error-waiting-fatal-error-watch-enospc @beautifulmind looks like a permissions issue in your case, perhaps this? http://stackoverflow.com/a/16151707/1314762 

(based on the `npm ERR! Error: EACCES: permission denied` line.)

EDIT: Ah, sorry not exactly as written there. You need ownership of the current directory, so:

```
sudo chown -R $(whoami) .
```  We would have to write the exif header in JS. I actually wrote a parser / writer in the past (https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/exif-parser) but It might be overkilling to make it a dependency of aframe core If you want to do it in browser you have to be able to parse and write exif data. You can always download and add the meta data offline (http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)  @Stefie The commit referred by the `package.json` indeed exists https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill/commit/a02a8089b which is the same as https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill/commit/a02a8089 In git you can refer a commit by just a unique prefix
I can't reproduce the issue on my desktop machine. Can you somehow share a link where the error manifests? Cool, thanks! Anyone knows the procedure to update the polyfill hosted on https://storage.googleapis.com/cardboard-dpdb/dpdb.json ? Does any one know who's the point of contact? I don't mind hosting a `github.com/aframevr/dpdb.json` repo that people can submit PRs against. I want to make sure it's not going to be confusing #2700 fixed  Thanks  We've changed to use THREE.Clock to keep track of time to fix Nightly weird timestamps in the requestAnimationFrame to fix this.  **Description:**

1. Add an event listener to a controller (`gripup`) in the `showcase/tracked-controls` example.
2. Add a console.log in the event listener.
3. Open the scene and press the button. 

See the log shows up twice.

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 Probably. Need to poke around to think of the best solution. @dmarcos would know best. Maybe introduce a property to force event listening that will be disabled by default, but enabled by replayers. 

What I don't think will work is trying to detect whether a different controller exists, that might be messy. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2556  3. sounds good to me. [Context for the change in r84](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/10500#issuecomment-270354703).

I also like (3). Should responseType be set automatically, or do we just document that it needs to be done for glTF? 

GLTFLoader has an internal cache, sort of, so disabling THREE.Cache for `gltf-model` only might be a 5th option. > 1. Why does a-asset-item call THREE.Cache.files[src] = responseText;

I have no idea — seems fine to change that, as long as we set `THREE.Cache.enabled = true` somewhere.

> 2. In a-assets.test.js this var XHR_SRC = 'base/src/README.md'; is the path to non-exist file.

I also have no idea. 😑 1. was from https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/5728902d29cc73b12269f41d5417ae92ab63ae77

You can try to remove, I don't quite remember, but I might have been running into issues where it didn't exist in the cache in time the A-Frame code ran.   ```

After a lot of messing about, I discovered that a lot of my issues were due to trying to test in the simulator.

When running on the device I was able to get an app running the latest version of a-frame working with the latest version of react-native, but only by setting up react-native to recompile the android project from source java, pulling from the current master.

I also had to enable hardware acceleration in the Android.Manifest.

Thanks to Chris Chen for the assist

```  Thanks!  thanks!  **Description:**

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2370 Firefox is going to check the string to be consistent with Chrome Using the string to identify controllers cannot be a long term solution. We have to come up with a better way. It might require changes in the Gamepad / WebVR APIs Closing for now as everything works, the prefix seems a bit more flexible. We can reevaluate strings later on.  This looks good to me.  When a system and component are registered with the same name, the schemas are merged. Additionally, an instance of the component is created on the scene (as well as an instance of the system). Is my understanding correct, that systems are intended to support configuration on the scene element?

([JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/donmccurdy/wnL5g1ux/))

```html
<a-scene transmogrifier="systemProp2: false">
  <a-entity transmogrifier></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('transmogrifier', {
  schema: {
    componentProp1: {default: true},
    componentProp2: {default: true}

- A-Frame Version: v0.4.0
- Platform / Device: All Thanks for the detailed issue. There's also https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1945 Scene should discern system vs. component. It is intended/documented to configure the system and not create a component (https://aframe.io/docs/0.4.0/core/systems.html#properties) but clearly a component has been created here :) Yeah, systems actually are configurable on the scene (although updates currently don't work, needs a bit of a refactor). I'm going to keep poking at shadows if someone wants to look at this.

I think we have the scene wrap `initComponent` (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-entity.js#L339) to do a check to return if it's a component and a system is registered. If everything is OK, call initComponent as normal. Yeah, the documentation is out of date on that part. We can add a section about that. Should we say that components that have a system are not applicable to `a-scene`? Yeah. If there's a system, then the scene can't have the component form. There won't be a case where you want both the system and component on the scene because in ECS, the components apply to entities and systems are global like the scene. They might get extra features later on like lifecycle methods to manage subscribed entities. They are global singletons. They get initialized first. But the API itself is mostly the same as a component. I'll take this.  Thanks!  This should be fixed now that we listen to `onvrdisplaypresentchange` event  Filed at aframevr/a-painter#183, should be improved now  Mixins are just for components. You can have a component set whatever you need. The template component also accepts component names that act as data contaners.  the intent was not to make `a-video` a 1:1 mapping of the `video` tag. `a-video` creates a quad with a video texture applied to it. There are no controls and not sure if attributes like `playsinline` make even sense in the context of VR  Nice! Thanks for investigating. I'm going to do some testing on my side Seems the workaround is still needed, despite that issue being closed:

 I actually don't see a difference on my iPhone 6, 10.1.1, even with https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2345 ... perhaps it's more discernable on a Plus. I'll let @dmarcos take a final look, or @giordyb can you post before/after screenshots? It does the trick for me on an iphone 7 Plus:
## Before
![img_3332](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39342/22672380/644ce8cc-ec88-11e6-8990-8f774e602803.PNG)
## After
![img_3331](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39342/22672379/644c7a40-ec88-11e6-816d-9cded0680d13.PNG)  Android throttles or provides high-latency access to the accelerometer/gyroscope sensors. This is probably pronounced as performance drops. If you are using lots of boxes, there are techniques to improve performance:

The performance doc mentions [geometry merging](https://aframe.io/docs/0.4.0/introduction/best-practices.html#performance)

Or use three.js geometry instancing (there are some WIP components by @takahirox to enable this): https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_buffergeometry_instancing.html Unfortunately, we should lower expectations on what non-WebVR enabled devices can provide. With non-WebVR devices, we are literally polyfilling proper WebVR head pose data using Device Motion API. Official WebVR-enabled devices provide data directly and optimized through the WebVR API proper. 

While many Android devices today are OK for tinkering for newcomers to at least play with, many of them will exhibit non-smooth tracking (as seen since you have 60FPS but bad jitters). 

The code relevant is at https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill   **Description:**

Fixes #651.

Migrates [shadows from aframe-extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/shadows), with a few changes to the API. Example includes shadows on the "Hello World" example, but we should probably come up with something more interesting.

Some of the shadow properties are non-default; this has worked better so far (from various bugs filed against extras) but perhaps we want to be consistent with THREE defaults instead? In any case, tweaks to the shadow camera properties are going to be par for the course on any serious scene.

**Changes proposed:**
- Add `shadow` component, which recursively enables cast/receive on child geometry. Note that it is recursive and on by default.
- Add shadow properties to the `light` component, for supported types.
- Add shadow setup to the `light` system. The shadowMap is enabled automatically, and not exposed in schema, but the shadow type can be set with `<a-scene light="shadowMapType: pcfsoft">`.

/cc @fernandojsg @takahirox
 Oops I forgot. Added! > Just curious to know if we can dynamically enable/disable shadow after scene is rendered once?

Programmatically, yes: `sceneEl.systems.light.setShadowMapEnabled(false)`. Systems don't support updates right now, so there's no pure-HTML way. Any tips on tuning the shadows?

**Single Point Light + Torus Knot**

Point light in the center of the knot. Boxy shadow shapes.

**Directional Light + Point Light**

Trying to animate the point light, spinning around the scene. Point light casts odd shape for the cylinder at an odd angle. Do I have to tweak `light.angle`?

 I continued playing around. Got it looking a bit better, but doesn't look as smooth as the [three.js shadow + point light example](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_shadowmap_pointlight), even though I've cloned all the parameters.

I also added some meshes (sphere, box, cylinder), the shadows seem clipped and in a weird spot despite playing the shadow camera top/near/left/right and map width/height
 Re: tuning, I think scene dimensions are very much a contributor to how your camera parameters should be set. Not really sure how to optimize that. I've just pushed a `shadowCameraVisible` option that is helpful for debugging.

Directional lights will perform a fair bit better than point lights, as well. Still playing with the shadows. The camera helper really helps, I saw the camera was totally not where I expected it to be. Should we start adding baseline tests and docs? Tests added. Was trying to get rid of some shadow clipping and debugging why my shadow camera was not lined up with my light, but playing with the shadow parameters from the Inspector doesn't have an effect. Are the updates working? Will save this for 0.5.1 until I get a good handle on it and document the tuning process. Sounds good. I've fixed the updates — there were a couple more hoops to jump through for updating the shadow camera and cameraHelper. Also removed `shadowDarkness`, which isn't supported anymore.

EDIT: But updates to the system configuration will not work, which seems OK for now. Added a first draft of documentation. I'm not attached to the structure really: there's no *Systems* category in the docs, and most of the properties are on the `light` component, so that's where I put most of the documentation. Perhaps a post in the *Guides* section would be more appropriate?

We should probably also link to something explaining light baking, but I'm just learning that process myself. Rebased, and reverted temporary changes to the hello-world example.

Any more to do here? Should an example be part of this PR? Thanks, this is my next priority. I have that example I was doing to copy the threejs example, if you have any cool ones we can add that too We can cherry-pick this example for now: https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe/commit/958fdfc2b2cfe37508951dbc439f88ad81dc4cab

I had *much* better and expected results setting `shadowCameraFov` to 90. With the help of the Inspector. I added an example, changed defaultCameraFov to 90 for better point lights.

Dynamic schemas we could do in a follow up.  We've removed mergeTo in favor of doing it manually in three.js (e.g., within a component) when needed. Instanced geometries is an alternative way to achieve the same draw call reductions. Quick resources on merging geometries in three.js:

I made a geometry merge component: https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/geometry-merger#aframe-geometry-merger-component  Can't you override the styles A-Frame sets with CSS? It's for fullscreen purposes. If you want to allow `embedded` scenes `<a-scene embedded>`  Based on the screenshots and example video, the WebVR emulator ought to emulate both eyes. Clicking the toggle VR button in an A-Frame scene goes fullscreen, instead.

Not sure if that's something about how A-Frame detects the HMD, or if Jaume's examples were using the polyfill instead, but it would certainly be helpful for debugging if the extension were A-Frame compatible. At the very least, I don't think clicking the *VR goggles* icons shoulder enter Fullscreen mode. There were a couple issues filed about adding a separate `Fullscreen` button, tweaking the `Enter VR` button. But, now I see that the tooltip text (even `alt`/`title`) text is now gone (per #1432) - even further misleading folks. Without context, upon loading an A-Frame, it's completely unclear that:

1. If on desktop and mouse-drag controls are enabled, that I can drag my mouse and pan around the scene.
2. I need a VR headset (or a mobile-polyfilled iPhone/Android headset) to interact with the scene.
3. Clicking the icon for the VR googles triggers Fullscreen mode when a browser does not natively support WebVR.

Suggested fixes:

1. A-Frame includes icons, tooltips, and helpful UI hints to indicate the camera controls.
2. A-Frame indicates on the page the system and device requirements to experience "immersive VR."
3. A-Frame exposes additional buttons (or tooltips) based on system/device capabilities.

 A-Frame used to display text in a tooltip upon `:hover` of the "Enter VR" (icon of VR headset). I suggest we add some helpful text or graphic (à la the [Facebook example above](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2347#issuecomment-277435874)). > I use the last version chrome mobile browser，and it works！it seem to some browser does not support the VR presentation any more.

Which other browsers are you referring to? probably should be filed on the emulator, not sure if it's used much considering look-controls/wasd-controls (or orbit-controls) pretty much does the same thing  dupe https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2322  Good catch!  +1 for having something like this in the FAQ.

Similar passage going into # 2333 — [gltf-model.md](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2333/files#diff-65cb6350cb8b140f4af98738e4059465), perhaps we can consolidate and have one guide with more detail. May also want to link to `json-model` / `object-model` if they're going to be mentioned. Sounds good, although the answer might be incomplete (i.e, should mention some things about glTF and the advantages/disadvantages of all). Though it's better for docs to repeat itself because people don't read every page. thanks for the contribution! 👍 per @ngokevin's comment above, could you mention [`glTF`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glTF)? > Sounds good, although the answer might be incomplete (i.e, should mention some things about glTF and the advantages/disadvantages of all).

I would mostly follow after what @donmccurdy wrote at https://aframe.io/docs/master/components/gltf-model.html#why-use-gltf

Also does not mention how to use the JSON loader. My vote would be to go ahead and merge this, and make any tweaks to wording with followup commits. Tweaked a bit. Merged, thanks!  Fixes #2261.

**Description:**

Adds `gltf-model` component and system, based on @xirvr's [aframe-gltf implementation](https://github.com/xirvr/aframe-gltf).

**Changes proposed:**
- Include THREE.GLTFLoader.
- Currently excludes animations, but for Three.js r83+ an implementation might look very much like [`aframe-extras.animation-mixer`](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/loaders/animation-mixer.js).
- ~~Adds example model (which is 11MB, so we can pick another from [gltf-test](https://github.com/cx20/gltf-test) if we prefer).~~
 We can host the sample models at https://github.com/aframevr/assets. Just commit it there, and it'll be available via ```cdn.aframe.io``` Updated. I believe this is caught up now. looks good to me!  great looks totally fantastic  We need to fix the tests Probably just some race condition or timing issue. What did we think about just removing the `recursive` property altogether and being `recursive` by default? I remember something about hard to figure out what element exactly was intersected in a big tree?  @machenmusik did you still want to get this merged? I've forgotten the context here a bit, but as far as I remember: With `raycaster="recursive:false`, the raycaster tests against each entity's root Object3D, and will never detect anything. That's no good; we should either fix that or remove the option.

1. If we can simplify this PR a bit, great. I'll add proposed changes, if we choose to move forward, in separate comments.
2. Removing the `recursive` option would be OK, too. For users who understand the performance profile and scene graph enough to care, setting up a custom component with a THREE.Raycaster is not that difficult. If they're doing that kind of performance tuning, they should probably consider taking the querySelector out of the picture anyway. If we choose to keep the `recursive:false` option around, then I'm happy with this PR after the remaining comments.

But I don't have a strong opinion about whether that option should exist, one way or another. @dmarcos @ngokevin - @donmccurdy and I think this one is done, did we want to merge or close?   Thanks!  Understand the confusion, but this is how THREE.Raycaster works. Parent `THREE.Object`s do not have geometry: if recursive:false is set the children are ignored, so there's nothing for the raycaster to hit. Neither A-Frame nor Three.js will be able to change this behavior, in all likelihood. 

Your workaround is a good one, though, and perhaps a community component (`shallow-raycaster`?) should be created to allow it more conveniently. Ok, looking at this a bit more, here's a simpler [Codepen demo](http://codepen.io/donmccurdy/pen/EZoLRr). With no nesting whatsoever, and `{recursive:false}`, clicks on the box still don't go through because there's a wrapping THREE.Group around the mesh.

So, there is something to be fixed here. Either:

1. We remove the `recursive` property from the raycaster, because it should basically always be true.
2. Or, we try to implement shallow (1-level) raycasting in a way that avoids these wrapping elements. > (is the wrapping that is done always only one level deep?)

For stock geometries, yes. If there's a `collada-model` or something involved, there's also a good chance that the model introduces its own wrappers.  [Here's an example using Mapbox](https://github.com/jesstelford/aframe-map) to render the map, and then using that `<canvas/>` element to create a texture. I also recommend the [A-Frame Slack](https://aframe.io/community/#slack) to see what others are working on. :)  It has an npm specific fix  thanks!  nice!  Are you thinking about sharing your component in the registry? https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-registry We can have it on the Registry. If it proves useful to many scenes, we could include it.  Thanks for filing. I do expect the component to update on each frame, *but* the `componentchanged` event shouldn't fire if the data hasn't actually changed. Marked as `help wanted (easy)` to investigate if we are indeed checking that data has been changed.  thanks!  The CodePen model 404s. I don't think this should be an issue? The collada-model should be waiting until its loaded before it tries to set any mesh for the raycaster to pick up. Maybe we should fix raycaster too?  **Description:**

CodePen's JS tab will append to bottom of body which doesn't work for A-Frame.

 Done!  **Description:**

Introduction should give a quick context on deploying on the Web. It's free, it's instant, no gatekeepers. Contrast that with native app stores that go through lengthy review processes that may end up in rejections. Publishing a VR experience with A-Frame is the exact same as publishing a web page. Note we want to deploy with `https://` due to WebVR SSL restrictions.

1. Publishing with GitHub Pages
2. Publishing with Neocities
3. Additional Guides for Publishing on AWS, Surge, Heroku, etc.

 Sorry, I've got a start on this already at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2639, but please look over and send any improvements once I have it out :) Merging with #2634, guide has been written in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2639  Thanks! The indentation does not follow the convention. Tested + reviewed. Thanks!  Thanks! Not allowing vertical touch is a deliberate decision because it becomes very confusing for de user in combination with device motion. You quickly lose the reference of where is up/down and you can only recover by reloading the page It's difficult to support every single use case. We prefer that the standard implementation remain focused on a default preset. This is better as increased complexity in code will increase maintenance in the long run and slow releases. Components can be built or customized that can be updated or published asynchronously from A-Frame. I think an okay compromise that at least it's possible to achieve what you need via components. I understand there are many use cases, but we try to set the direction of the project towards true WebVR. You can add it to https://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe, publish it and we'll feature it on the blog, or contribute a FAQ entry on how to customize controls. Thanks! The decision to lock finger panning to the `x` axis is what we observed delivers the best experience for the majority of applications when combined with gyro orientation that all tablets and phones have. If you allow for vertical panning the user quickly loses the notion of up / down and it gets disorienting. The good thing about a-frame is that it's very easy to override the defaults if your application does not fit within those design decisions. We cannot cover every single use case on A-Frame core because as @ngokevin said we would not be able to guarantee good quality for all the possible combinations of controls moving forward. We want aframe core to be useful with sane defaults but still contain the complexity of the code base. We've been focusing the efforts on making very easy for anyone to modify and extend the default behavior.  **DO NOT MERGE WITHOUT TESTING ON HARDWARE**

The code can be reviewed but it needs to be tested with hardware to make sure it works. I'm far from my beloved VR headsets now. If someone can test then we can merge. 

This is a requirement from the motion capture components. When reproducing we want the controls to listen to events even if there's no real tracked controls present.


 The capture components won't be part of the core so I prefer them to use the same public API as any others. This change is innocuous for the normal use of the vive/oculus components. We can revisit if it ends up being a problem.  Monkey patching is difficult to understand and debug in case of problems. it should be used very sparsely. If events name collisions is a problem we can revisit. For the moment I lean toward the simplest solution. Tested with hand-controls + vive-controls on Vive.

@mchen RE: your idea. I think just relying on events and event details are simpler than wrapping or stubbing the whole GamePad API. 

r+ from me  Thanks!  I was working on it yesterday to try to really improve caching and asset system. I'll be back Tuesday.  Merging issue with https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2472  I'd would clarify it more in the Getting Started section. If there's a spot that doesn't imply people should use a local server, we should address it there, at the root. Perhaps move Getting Started to be the first guide? I'm not too sure about that. Right now the Introduction section serves as high-level overview and introductory reading. The Guides are more hands on. I think that works for now. It certainly wouldn't hurt if beginners read through Best Practices and FAQ before getting their hands dirty.

To move Getting Started, you move it to the guides/ folder. The metadata at the top of each file determines the order and sections. Do `npm run docs` to get a preview. thanks!  1. If developers want full screen only, and not VR, I would create a fullscreen button that calls requestFullScreen, but I wouldn't put it to A-Frame.
2. Sounds good, if anyone wants to investigate tablet. @tinchoforever can you tell if `AFRAME.utils.device.isMobile()` is returning `true` on your Nexus 9? @tinchoforever What do you get when you do `navigator.userAgent` on console? That's the problem. Your userAgent string does not include the `Mobile` keyword. Apparently not all the Android tablets report the browser as mobile. I found some references to the problem:

https://meta.discourse.org/t/my-android-tablet-was-not-detected-as-a-mobile-device/26734/14

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5341637/how-do-detect-android-tablets-in-general-useragent
 @tinchoforever Can you try if https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2382 fixes your issue? Any error on console?  Try `<a-scene antialias="true">`?

screenshot won't be supporting the mobile case. Take it from a desktop. width/height parameters now work https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2474, `antialias="true"` will help.  What do you mean by `tilt` efect? You say if you move the device it works? Is there any error in console? does ionic expose the device motion APIs? > If you move your finger up and down the video 

`look-controls` does not support vertical panning because it'll throw off the orientation axis. If you want to design for non-VR, you'd need to create your own controls to modify the camera.  Works for me. Might've been a Nightly regression.   That check is in place so that WASD controls won't move when the player is typing into an `<input/>` or `<textarea/>` — say, a chatbox or signup form. Other ideas? How are you using the modal dialog? @chriscar you should have access to the canvas by doing `sceneEl.canvas`. We can maybe create a specific method in `wasd-controls` instead of using the utils one to test the solution @cvan might have some ideas. @chriscar: @dmarcos: @donmccurdy: if the iframe is on the *same origin*, then you should be able to do this:

```js
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
  // Find an iframe already on the page.
  var iframe = document.querySelector('iframe');
  if (iframe) {
    iframe.addEventListener('load', function () {
      try {
        iframe.contentWindow.focus();
      } catch (err) {
        console.warn('Could not focus iframe', err);
      }
    });
    if (iframe.contentWindow) {
      iframe.contentWindow.focus();
    }
  }
});
```

Or, ideally, if you're dynamically creating an `<iframe>` from JS:

```js
// Create an iframe.
var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
iframe.src = 'my_scene.html';
iframe.allowfullscreen = 'true';
iframe.enable = 'vr';  // See https://github.com/w3c/webvr/issues/86
iframe.addEventListener('load', function () {
  try {
    iframe.contentWindow.focus();
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn('Could not focus iframe', err);
  }
});
document.body.appendChild(iframe);
```

Let me know if that solves your problems.

cylinder.setAttribute('color', '#000000');
cylinder.setAttribute('height', `1.5`);

scene.appendChild(cylinder);
cylinder.setAttribute('color', '#000000');
cylinder.setAttribute('height', `1.5`);
cylinder.setAttribute('position', `3 1 0`);

Preferably both would work. Seems like a strange edge case that new users could easily be surprised by; I know the primitive init cycle is a bit troublesome but hopefully we can fix this case.
 Yep, both cases should work Hm I filed based on [this conversation](https://aframevr.slack.com/archives/questions/p1485046322874497).

But I can't reproduce the problem either. There were websockets involved, so probably the elements were added after scene init, but even so I can't reproduce this. I guess she was on 0.3.2  Thanks for filing this. @ngokevin @fernandojsg I'm going to put some thought on this. Any ideas? Maybe some features for the inspector or a-painter? I don't think we have any mentorship spots open at the moment.

RGSOC has closed  You have to specify the properties on the animation component, not bare attributes.

`<a-mixin id="anim-mixin" animation="property: rotation; dur: 500"></a-mixin>`  Does this reproduce with latest master? I remember model file names and stuff getting shuffled around and being temporarily broken. There were several changes in both the model and the `vive-controls` and this does not seem to reproduce anymore. Please reopen if it's still a problem  Possibly simpler to just document how to modify a COLLADA model post-load using the event rather than building it into the component? We'll probably move COLLADA to a community component as we get glTF in. Can you address the linting? I was considering this closely. I will close because:

1. It doesn't scale, we can't cover all the material properties that can be loaded COLLADA, or all the cases where you'd "post-process" a model after loading. 
2. The workflow is expected, the same as in three.js, you load a model, and then write some code to configure as you need. This case, you can use `model-loaded` event.
3. `alphaTest`ing is not something you'd want 100% of the time.
4. COLLADA is on a deprecation path.

If there's any flashing, you can `visible="false"` until you are done with everything.

I did consider banning single-prop components, but instead in the future, we'll be more diligent about using that, and use it for simple cases like pos/rot/sca/visible.

Rotation would be a nice addition here, and solves some common use cases without requiring users to drop in CannonJS. 

Another, somewhat related, idea would be a `snapped-grab` component that does the same thing but snaps object position to some interval and rotation to 45º or 90º after the object is released. Maybe we could just use the super-hands component That'd work too. I think the 'stretch' and 'drag-and-drop' functions are a bit less universal but otherwise it looks good. Adding rotation means also switching from aabb collider to something else. The demo is not the ultimate tutorial of VR object manipulation. I wanted to keep the complexity to a minimum while still being compelling so it can be used as a base for more advanced stuff. I would not use third party components for the core examples. @dmarcos Just switching to `sphere-collider` would do the trick, right? Aside from the nuisance of figuring out relative rotations for nested objects..

**Goal for filing this issue** — it'd be great if there were minimal-as-possible component(s) for positioning and rotating objects with tracked controllers. If that can be done simply enough, we should include it in core. I don't think `super-hands`, or physics-based grabbing, is minimal enough to include in core. 

Linking to registry demos would be orthogonal IMO, I'm not worried about discoverability of these components (they're already very visible, registry will make them more so) but just that there is no bare-minimum component yet (physics is overkill in most cases, and `super-hands` does more than most users need).  Awesome! The source code lives in `src/`, you can find it in `src/core/a-mixin.js`.

Would you be comfortable writing a unit test for that? `tests/core/a-mixin.js` Needs some rebase and clean up of a bunch of comment and test code Polished it up and committed @ https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/22c9ddb166c004d819f0d7c45f6cbb1e21e1fcf5 .

**Description:**

For A-Frame, this is uncharted territory for a lot of us. But let's get a start on it, and build from there.
People with experience include:

- @feiss - [A-Painter Interface](https://github.com/aframevr/a-painter)
- @kfarr - [City Builder Interface](https://github.com/kfarr/aframe-city-builder/)
- @mflux - [dat.GUI VR](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.guiVR)

Throwing up a layout because I don't have much experience, but we can look at the implementations above and explain how they were made.

1. Building Interfaces with HTML
2. Building an Interface Using an Image
3. Building an Interface with 3D Objects
 I'm thinking more 2D interfaces that can be interacted with controllers. True, there's no one way to do VR interfaces, but it's better to have a guide showing a few implementations than nothing at all. That way, at least the community can build off of it. As we converge to more best practices, these guides can always be updated.

For levels, knobs, dials, buttons, I have an issue for "Adding Interactions in VR" guide https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2274 The guide will be targeted towards VR where you have positional tracking and 6DoF controllers. Yeah. The future of VR's lowest common denominator at some point will be positional tracking + 6DOF controllers, so that's what we're aiming for. With all my respect (and at least regarding A-Painter), I wouldn't call our projects as examples of 'best practices', but 'first practices'.. We had a problem or goal, and we solved it in the best way we could using the time we had. But that does not mean that was the **best** way of doing it, or that other UIs should be done that way.. 

I'm talking about the technical implementation of a certain UI. When talking about the conceptual design of VR UIs, I think **nobody** knows the best practices yet, this is a barely explored territory..

What I think @ngokevin wants is to write about the different ways of implementing and drawing UI elements using A-Frame. Something like what he has in the last bullet list of the first post: how to make ui elements using html tags only, using images, 3d objects, even procedural objects...

Teaching people different ways of making a button in A-Frame, not telling about how a button in VR should behave or look like, or how responsive VR UIs should be. Yup, pretty much wanted a "first practices" guide on some existing implementations to get a start, not a Bible. We can speed up experimentation if we provide a foundation using what we know so far rather than leaving it at "no one knows". That'd be great! Yeah, if anyone wants to volunteer a case study, that'd be useful for people. Else at some point, someone or me can read through some of the implementations and regurgitate it. I think both. Some original content with describing a couple implementations that we have so far, with links out for further reading. As we evolve our knowledge and prototype more in VR UI, we add and update content. **@imgntn is now working on this.**

@rapoulson Would love to see a further reading list if it's not too much work. Not sure what would be useful, they'd mostly be for inspiration? Not much content right now describing building room scale interactions for WebVR. Sorry, wrong issue. The comment above was for the Interaction Guide. No one is working on this currently. @kfarr Thanks, will take a look right after this A-Frame release.  <!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->

I want to clear out the mixins component on an entity

[6:08]  
this.el.setAttribute('mixin' , '');

[6:08]  
is throwing an error "'querySelector' on 'Element': 'a-mixin#' is not a valid selector."

[6:09]
any ideas? `removeAttribute('mixin')` doesn't also work.

We should also allow `.removeAttribute('mixin', mixinName)` @BhuvanaMeenakshi Thanks for the interest. Can you open a PR with a test case fixing the issue? https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2291  I think this is a dup https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2008#issuecomment-257905203  Have you tried a-frame 0.4.0? Do the examples on aframe.io work for you? Then there's something wrong with your setup. You have to share your whole document and not only the `a-scene` I don't know much a bout Ionic/Angular.js but it seems this is not an aframe bug (since the aframe examples work for you) but something with your integration. I recommend asking the question on stackoverflow  http://stackoverflow.com/tags/aframe/ or use the a-frame slack (some people use angular.js there) https://aframe.io/community/#slack 

I close this but please reopen if this ends up being an a-frame specific problem.  **Description:**

We need a guide focused around adding interactions, primarily with tracked controllers in Vive and Touch. This guide will make heavy use of community components including: [aframe-physics-system](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system) by @donmccurdy and [aframe-super-hands-component](https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component) by @wmurphyrd

Possible guide outline might look like:

1. Adding Tracked Controllers to the Scene (`hand-controls`, `vive-controls`, `touch-controls`)
2. Listening to Tracked Controller Events 
3. Adding a Cursor to Tracked Controllers (https://github.com/bryik/aframe-vive-cursor-component by @bryik )
4. Grabbing Objects (super-hands)
5. Checking for Collisions and Colliding Objects (super-hands)
6. Scaling Objects (super-hands)
7. Adding Physics to Interactive Objects for Throwing and Hitting (super-hands + physics)

Inspiration: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/virtual-reality/interaction-vr **@imgntn is now working on this.** https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/interactions-and-controllers.html  You're adding an element at runtime which will cause a reflow of the page. I don't think there's anything to be done on the A-Frame side. `<a-scene>` has some CSS rules that come with it, you can override as you need or add styles to your page to prevent it.    Don't think the intro is good to get into code details. There is a JavaScript guide we can mention this though for A-Frame, we usually recommend code to live within components which go before the scene. Thanks though!  Nice! Thanks!  Until they add the `allowvr` attribute to the iframes It's actually CodePen that needs to add that attribute. We just need to say WebVR won't work right now until they add it to their I-Frames. Cardboard will work though. That's great. Some tweaks:

**Note:** VR mode currently won't work until the `allowvr` attribute is added to CodePen's I-Frames.  Help wanted to change that text color to white. (#FAFAFA) @mitchallen would you like to help to tweak the colors?  There's a lot here, so a couple starting points:

1. Let's exclude `kinematic-body` from discussion. It will never support roomscale VR, and that's primarily what we're talking about with tracked controllers.
2. In the `leap-hand` component I took this approach:

```html
// A
<a-entity camera look-controls position="0 1.5 0">
  <a-entity leap-hand="hand: left"></a-entity>
  <a-entity leap-hand="hand: right"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

OTOH, `tracked-controls` assumes the controller is attached directly to the scene. I'm not sure how `teleport-controls` is able to associate the three.

```html
// B
<a-entity camera look-controls></a-entity>
<a-entity teleport-controls tracked-controls="hand: left"></a-entity>
<a-entity teleport-controls tracked-controls="hand: right"></a-entity>
```

Another option, not currently implemented anywhere, would be this:

```html
// C
<a-player>
  <a-entity camera look-controls></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls tracked-controls="hand: left"></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls tracked-controls="hand: right"></a-entity>
</a-player>
```

What are the tradeoffs of (A), (B), and (C)? Is there value in establishing a recommended structure, and do we know enough about what that should be yet? I haven't seen an A-Frame demo with co-presence in roomscale VR yet, will we need a player abstraction to support that? FWIW I was doing some modifications in my latest test with hand controls and teleportation, and I've found the best way to go is to use the same camera rig that is typically used in engines like unity, the C described by @donmccurdy :
```
<a-entity id="camerarig">
  <a-entity camera look-controls></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls tracked-controls="hand: left"></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls tracked-controls="hand: right"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

So you could move the camerarig instead of manually update the position of the camera and the controllers as I'm doing right now with the teleport-controls (I'll update the examples to follow this approach too).
The only concern is that before you had the correct position & orientation values for camera and controllers within the entity, and now you should apply the transform from the camerarig, but it shouldn't be a big deal. In unity it's commonly used `transform.position/scale/rotation` that refers to world instead of local (`transform.localPosition/Rotation/Scale`), but when you edit the `transform` on the inspector windows, you're editing the locals not the globals.
I believe we can't just assume a switch between globals or locals for all the cases but to expose both as unity does and leave that responsability to the component.

My proposal would be to have: `.getAttribute('globalPosition/Rotation/Scale')` and it will be just a read-only component that will returns the computed global values, (we could show them also in the inspector as non-editable values too).

These values will be computed just when required, as we don't want to keep decomposing the world matrix on every tick if we're not going to use them.
With this components like the `teleport` will need to query `globalPosition` of the controllers instead of the current `position` or accessing by code to the `worldposition` with threejs.
 @machenmusik I don't understand what you mean with propagating camera changing to controllers.
You'll have something like:
```
<a-camerarig>
  <a-entity camera></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls></a-entity>
  <a-entity teleport-controls></a-entity>
</a-camerarig>
```
And when you want to apply teleport you move the whole `camerarig` so you'll be moving the camera and the controllers at once. Umm I still don't understand, the `camerarig` will be a direct child of `a-scene` so every time you move it, it will be in global coordinates, and the object inside it (camera and controllers) you don't want to move them outside of the rig globally so they're just moving locally as expected. 
That's the approach I followed for the camera controls implementation I've used here https://twitter.com/fernandojsg/status/836371728976719872 and it's based on how unity's cameraRig works and I can't think right now in any use case where I want to set the global position of any object within the rig instead of moving the rig itself, probably for some edge case but I believe for most common uses it could works. Could you give me some example you're facing right now? camera rig works  <!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->

I'm seeing seemingly hundreds of "components:geometry:warn Geometry merge is only available for `THREE.Geometry` types. Check that both of the merging geometry and the target geometry have `buffer` set to false" errors within this demo, so two things:

1.  We should fix the demo's root issue, obviously
2.  We should consider implementing something like three.js whereby we cut off `console` statements after a given number of executions.

 We've removed mergeTo in favor of doing it manually in three.js (e.g., within a component) when needed. Instanced geometries is an alternative way to achieve the same draw call reductions. Quick resources on merging geometries in three.js:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30245990/how-to-merge-two-geometries-or-meshes-using-three-js-r71

https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Geometry

We can provide more resources as we develop/evolve examples and code.  Discussing how best to maintain `gltf-model` with @xirvr; perhaps either (1) merge it into aframe-extras.loaders, or (2) merge it into core.

Advantages of having `gltf-model` in core:

- glTF is (IMO) the most promising asset format for the web. If we want to see that gain traction, I think we need to be willing to treat it as a default early on (even if the popularity isn't there yet).

Disadvantages:

- Animation should be treated as format-agnostic, using THREE.AnimationMixer. Currently the `animation-mixer` component lives in aframe-extras, and it's not clear that we want more animation-related code moving into core. We could ensure that core/gltf-model exposes its animations in a way that is compatible with aframe-extras/animation-mixer.

Further discussion of animation: https://github.com/xirvr/aframe-gltf/issues/9

***

Proposed syntax for any THREE.AnimationMixer-compatible format, including glTF, with animation:

```html
<a-entity foo-model="src: homestar.foo"
          animation-mixer="clip: run"></a-entity>
```
 Yeah, I'd agree with adding `gltf-model` to core. If we need to pull in a way of animating models, we can do that too. How is the adoption of `gltf` so far? What's the status of exporters from popular tools: Blender, Cinema 4D, 3D Studio, Maya... What's the status of the three.js loader? I know that when we tried to use it for our demos everything looked pretty immature @feiss What do you think? The common argument is that we help drive the adoption. I'm fairly confident about THREE.GLTFLoader. It was fully re-written over the last 6 months, the code is relatively clean, and both @takahirox and I have been contributing to its maintenance. It's close to supporting all of the official glTF sample models — perhaps by THREE.js r84 or r85. 

There are some converters, I'm not sure how well they work. There's not much available for exporters. My vote would be for us (A-Frame, and THREE.js) to go out on a limb a bit to support rendering the format, in the hope that we drive adoption and encourage tooling to catch up. @ngokevin @dmarcos thoughts y/n? glad to put together a PR if we want to see how much is involved, should be comparable to other formats though. Yes, please go ahead.   <!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->

**Description:**

Core component source code currently use `require`s. If someone wants to copy/paste/fork a component to modify it to their needs, they'd have to change the `require`s to point to like `window.AFRAME` for utils.

If we make our components use the `AFRAME` global instead of `require`s, we ensure that our components aren't using any internal hidden API, and that they have same privileges as any other component in the ecosystem. It would also make components easier to copy/paste and they'd be able to work in a pure browser context.


 My vote would be to avoid this, and not determine project structure for the convenience of devs who are new to package managers. It also makes it impossible to preserve private APIs within A-Frame core. Some alternatives:

1. Document (on SO or official docs) "How to customize a component".
2. Write an `angle` utility to create a component by forking an official one.

But I recognize that neither of those is a good solution when then component depends on various utils or helpers.

Do we think this issue applies to many components other than controls (both for camera and tracked controls) ? If not then maybe we revisit some amount of abstraction around the controls api. I could see an option where we take #1248, make that into a new repo like aframevr/aframe-controls, and document how to customize controls for that framework. But #1248 doesn't include a clear story for tracked controls. This would only be for components, which I don't think should have access to private APIs. Using the global would be a way to enforce that, and sort of create separation/less coupling between the components and the core API. 

Yeah, sorry the controls refactor got backlogged. It could be promoted to `aframevr/` org to get it along the way. I don't follow the analogy, but in many projects it is necessary to have private helper methods that are used internally, but not exposed externally. Exposing a public API implies an agreement with developers: that method will not be changed in a backward-incompatible way without appropriate [SemVer](http://semver.org/) version increase, and the more public API surface you have, the harder your public releases become. When that contract is broken, it's hard for third-party developers to keep their packages compatible. Many components in awesome-aframe are already incompatible with 0.4.0... that's fine for now (churn is expected up until 1.0.0) but we'll eventually want to have a fairly stable API.

Everything in `src/utils/*` is exposed as public APIs, and is available to anyone as `AFRAME.utils`. This is a good and appropriate way to expose public utilities. If those are the only utilities needed by components, then that's great. Perhaps A-Frame's core components are fortunate enough to not need additional private helper methods; I don't know of any counter-examples. If we remove all requires from the core components if forces us moving forward to make public any API, utility library or helper function used by more than one component. More API surface, more liability, harder to provide backwards compatibility, slower to change and innovate if we want... It's something we know pretty well at Mozilla with all the internal APIs that add-ons have been able to rely on. Aside: @ngokevin No problem on the PR, I'm not even convinced it should be in core at this point. Separate repo is worth discussing later though.  That's expected. 3D raycaster returns 3D point. If you want mouse click event, you can just listen to click on the window. @ngokevin I think the question/problem was that the intersection data was cached from the first intersection event, and not updated on each frame after that. We fixed that a while back though (by v0.3.2 at least) and I can't reproduce the problem now in v0.3.2 or v0.4.0.

Here's another script I'm using to test it:

```html
<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.4.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
<a-scene>
  <a-box position="0 0 -5"  class="intersectable" material="color: red"></a-box>
          <a-camera>
          <a-entity raycaster="far: 30; objects: .intersectable"
                    cursor
                    geometry="primitive: ring; radiusOuter: 0.015;
                              radiusInner: 0.01; segmentsTheta: 32"
                    material="color: red"
                    position="0 0 -0.75"></a-entity>
        </a-camera>
  </a-scene>
<script>
var box = document.querySelector('a-box');
box.addEventListener('click', (e) => console.log(e.detail.intersection.point))
</script>
```

^Note that the point reported is different depending on where we click the box (as expected).  Please head to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe to ask a question  Thanks!  **Description:**

Is there a better way to to update the global transform than `document.querySelector('a-scene').object3D.updateMatrixWorld()`?

I’m trying to get a entities global position and rotation. (edited)

mchen [2:23 PM]  
isn't it supposed to auto update?

caseyyee [2:25 PM]  
@dmarcos yeah, that’s what I was trying originally.  Not sure why it’s not working.  Will look into it again since it obviously works in the raycaster case.

mangob [2:27 PM]  
joined #general

mchen [2:28 PM]  
so I thought that auto-update is enabled by default (although the raycaster can't assume that it is enabled)

mathemagie [2:31 PM]  
joined #general

caseyyee [2:36 PM]  
@dmarcos @mchen seems to only work if i wrap in a self executing function like in the raycaster example.

[2:36]  
even then, it doesn’t seem like i’m getting the true world coordinates back of my mesh.

mchen [2:36 PM]  
can you just get___World() when you need it?

dmarcos [2:37 PM]  
@caseyyee can you share your code?

caseyyee [2:37 PM]

[2:52]  
@mchen I get the same result when using that approach.   just the local coord.

mchen [2:54 PM]  
you are only doing calculatePosition at init

[2:54]  
did you mean to do it either in tick or update?

caseyyee [2:54 PM]  
Anywhere really.   i just stuck it in init for testing purposes.  can you not expect that to work?

mchen [2:55 PM]  
i don't think the threejs objects are actually up and working until later (see recent messages about when the camera is ready as well)

caseyyee [2:55 PM]  
ok i’ll try some other lifecycle methods to see if it makes a difference.

mchen [2:55 PM]  
i know for a fact that the teleport-controls usage works

caseyyee [2:56 PM]  
sticking it in play works it seems.   doh.

[2:56]  
@dmarcos ^

dmarcos [2:58 PM]  
looking

caseyyee [2:58 PM]  
Might want to make that clearer in the docs somewhere since in some components, the method is used to update scene objects.

dmarcos [2:58 PM]  
@caseyyee oh I know

caseyyee [2:58 PM]  
and I guess by that time, I would have figured that I would be able to extract scene position.

dmarcos [2:58 PM]  
init is called before is actually inserted in the DOM

[2:58]  
I believe

[2:59]  
let me check

[3:01]  
@caseyyee ok i see

[3:02]  
if i do el.parentEl.object3D.updateMatrixWorld()

[3:02]  
it works

[3:02]  
so

[3:02]  
`init` is called

[3:02]  
before the first render loop

[3:03]  
and the matrices have not been yet updated for any entity

caseyyee [3:04 PM]  
interesting.   i didn’t think the renderer needed to be active before you could update the matrices.

dmarcos [3:04 PM]  
@caseyee if you want to do it in the init

[3:04]  
yes you have to call

[3:05]  
`el.sceneEl.object3D.updateMatrixWorld()` (edited)

[3:05]  
that should work

caseyyee [3:05 PM]  
yeah, thats what I was basically doing.    alright, that’ll do for now.

dmarcos [3:05 PM]  
and then you can proceed like you were doing

mchen [3:06 PM]  
maybe that should be called in core before rippling init calls

caseyyee [3:07 PM]  
footgun for sure if not.

mchen [3:08 PM]  
you probably want to update in update method though...

ngokevin [3:13 PM]  
or maybe have the component wait for the renderstart event

mchen [3:14 PM]  
hmm, so now that I am looking a little more closely... 
when init fires, is anything attached yet?

ngokevin [3:14 PM]  
yeah init fires after attach

mchen [3:14 PM]  
so then assuming that scene init fires first, probably easy enough to call inside the a-scene init

ngokevin [3:16 PM]  
but you have to call it after the object3Ds are attached?

[3:16]  
i meant the component inits, not the scene init
  Is it possible to cover this with a test?  That's because of the asynchrony. If there's a pending request when `src` changes we should ignore the resullt. It should be an easy fix  It would be nice to have the browser auto-enter VR when refreshed on changes.  This would make it so that as a developer, you won't have to re-enter VR on every change and simply have the change show up in the headset.

Another alternative might be to have our own sync logic that would hot-reload the a-frame scene to make refreshing and auto-entering VR unnecessary.   Not sure if the work required to do that would be more difficult or not? So Firefox doesn't need user interaction? Will that change? Maybe just add a one-line JS in your app to click the button.

If it's for development purposes, there is a WebVR recording tool coming out that will help with this so you don't even need to enter VR to test.

But it might be possible to do something similar to React hot loading of components. A server can send a message to the scene which component changed. A-Frame can detach, re-register, and reattach the component. But that'll probably be far off I bet. @ngokevin WebVR recording tool doesn't help here.   Just being able to see changes reflected in the headset without having to reach over to click _Enter VR_ is all i'm asking for.     

Enter VR is still being specced, but it looks like user gesture will be required to enter VR for the first time, then any subsequent navigation and refreshes will be allowed to enter VR.

Hot loading sounds like the most ideal solution to me. vrdisplayactivate is implemented and only the first enter requires the gesture.  Thanks, but we want to do this for all entities/nodes, not just cursor/raycaster: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2225

The code to do this is in the ANode.attachedCallback  Thanks! Can we fix the broken tests? Thanks! I can push another commit, but the earlier place is in attachedCallback, and we have a console.warn utility that will provide where the warning is coming from. @ngokevin feel free to revert or open a new PR  @giordyb @sebi-b @rafaelboschini @okwme I'm curious to know what is your use case for the `reload` method? What are you trying to achieve?  thanks!  It's cool to add your CodePen, that Pen is already not 'in house'. Thanks! Thanks!   @karansaulakh Why do you prefer a 0.05 value? I forgot why the default user height for the bare camera component is 0 and not 1.6? Because a camera can be used for anything not just for a human scale avatar. You might want to use the camera on a plane cockpit or on a car driver seat post. The camera should be scale agnostic and other higher level components should introduce the concept of scale, avatar or player The default camera and `<a-camera>` have a 1.6m default, shouldn't the camera component? The camera can be used for anything, but a standing human seems like a reasonable default versus clipping the ground. Adding magic offsets is always confusing. I would probably rename `<a-camera>` to `<a-player>` or `<a-avatar>` or something like this. I prefer to keep the camera component agnostic Ok, will close  Thanks!  Thanks a lot!  What browser are you using?  With Firefox Nightly, there is an issue with the Oculus Touch controllers positions being offset:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1324149   I suspect this is the issue you are seeing since i'm getting the same result.   Works fine with VIVE. @machenmusik Currently Oculus touch controllers in Nightly are only supported through OpenVR -- though that's going to be changing soon so that that the API works directly with Oculus instead.   If you disable openVR, you get headset support, but touch controllers won't work.

@giordyb ah interesting.  Could be something with A-Frame then.  Chromium should be fine. @machenmusik Oculus touch is not functional with Nightly right now because of the issues.   We'll want to wait till it's fixed before using it.  thanks!  I see, I think for now, it's OK to not clone and leave it up to the developer to do (`AFRAME.utils.clone`, pass in a string, or `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())`  Just replied in stack overflow - will follow up with a full answer if that is helpful. :) Going to close this since this is more of a question, not an issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41393812/toggle-the-visibility-of-dom-with-a-frame  You should be appending to the scene rather than the document.body. In the aframe-react bug, is that component mounted under the scene? Also, yeah we should throw a warning for that OK, repurposing the issue for the warning. Will try to investigate the react side later  This is a known browser issue with Chromium and passing wrong timestamps to requestAnimationFrame. You can try using an older Chromium from September or Firefox Nightly  Can you describe your problem more precisely, are your `headers` accept loading this issue can we reproduce that? Perhaps you should post it to stackoverflow instead... 20mb is not too large. The problem is likely something invalid in the model itself, or use of some feature that THREE.OBJLoader doesn't support yet. Usually it's the first. [Here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20objloader) are some examples of others' issues with the OBJ format.

To debug what's going on, you'll want to look at the JS Console and include that output with any bug reports. If that doesn't work, we'll need to see the model, preferably in a live demo, to be able to help.

Meta: I'm not sure if SO will take questions along these lines, since it's just about impossible to differentiate  between questions of the form "my model doesn't work" until you open the black box of the file itself. Maybe we could add a paragraph to [Why does my asset not load](https://aframe.io/docs/0.4.0/introduction/faq.html#why-does-my-asset-e-g-image-video-model-not-load) explaining specifically how to debug a model that isn't rendering.

In the meantime, I'd vote to close this issue until there's a bit more information. @nikolas7892 I'm going to close this issue. Please reopen if you can provide additional info  Should aspect be part of the schema? Is there any case you want to have an aspect ratio other than the viewport? cc @maissani  If the camera aspect ratio won't be different than the viewport (in the embedded case we still use the viewport size) we should then remove `aspectRatio` from the schema and change it internally on the component whenever the viewport size changes. I don't think we should rely on the aspect ratio to create any effects. It will be pretty jarring on VR mode  Thanks!  I'm not sure if I understand the question. Short story: yes, changes in the DOM will affect the render of the scene. Long story: The scene is rendered at the refresh rate of the device is presented to (60fps on a normal display, 90 fps on a Vive or an Oculus Rift). Changes on component properties in the DOM will modify the underlying Three.js Object3Ds and will be picked up by the render loop.   I would not prefer to introduce work around for browser bugs. Specially when those bugs are known and come from experimental builds Chromium experimental builds are not the only ones with native Oculus and Vive support. Firefox Nightly also supports both. Nightly supports Oculus Rift natively but not Touch yet. We're days away from having support for touch. I insist on my preference of not accumulating workarounds in the code base for known bugs in one off experimental builds of a specific browser.    What do you think about recalculating the aspect ratio of the camera whenever the canvas size changes instead of just on camera update?  Instead of resizing the camera [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/scene/a-scene.js#L295) we could emit an event that the camera component listens to and the aspect ratio is then recalculated Why do you need to recalculate the aspect ratio when the zoom or fov change? aspect is not even part of the component schema. The aspect updates should be taken out the `update` function and make them based on canvas resizes, hence the need to introduce a new event on `a-scene` and a new method `updateAspectRatio` in the camera component Is there any case where someone would want an aspect ratio that it's different than the viewport? If not then `aspect` should not be part of the schema and the logic should be out of the `update` method. It's better if all the camera updates are handled by the component instead of `a-scene` modifyng it. I think it's cleaner to move the logic back to the `camera` and trigger it by a `canvasresized` event emitted by the scene @radenui We're pretty close from having something mergable. My proposed changes are the following:
1. Remove `aspect` from the camera schema since I don't see any use case when one would want an aspect ratio other than the screen.
2. Emit a new event from a-scene `canvasresized`
3. The camera component recalculates the aspect ratio automatically (it's not user configurable) based on the canvas resizes. There are some pending changes described here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2216#issuecomment-301549089 @radenui are you still actively working on this? I'm closing this due to inactivity. We will reopen if there's interest  Thanks!  Thanks!  After adding your commit to #2209 close this PR  After adding your commit to #2209 close this PR  I have a feeling that #2210 and #2211 should be here as single PR not individual PR's Thanks!  That's a good point about the delay, @machenmusik.. I think it might confuse people to have a `checkHas6DoFControllers()` method that will always return false when the page loads. Helper method or no, people will need to understand the basics of the Gamepad API.

Maybe best option would be to post (in Stack Overflow or FAQ) an example of how to use the Gamepad API to detect this. Example:

```js
window.addEventListener('gamepadconnected', function (event) {
    if (event.gamepad.pose) {
      // ...
    }
});
```

I'm not 100% sure how to differentiate between 6DOF and 3DOF, but presumably that's `gamepad.pose.hasPosition`. [Gamepad Extensions API](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/extensions.html#dom-gamepadpose).  @machenmusik I can't reproduce this. Could you provide a specific case, and at what point in the scene's lifecycle you're testing for `el.sceneEl`? 

For example, in the `<a-ocean />` primitive, adding an `init()` method to the `ocean` component works as expected, and `this.el.sceneEl` is there. @machenmusik can you provide reproducible code/? Closing unless we have a reproducible test case  This is a modification of @fernandojsg component and there's a PR opened there(https://github.com/fernandojsg/aframe-bmfont-component/pull/1). I'll wait for fernando's review first. Maybe we could move the discussion to my repo PR and once we got that fixed and working update it? Or just the other way but to avoid commenting in both places In fact the component wasnt yet ready to ship it on aframe.
First we need to fix the functionality for example msdf doesnt work yet but its exposed anyway. Then we should refactor and lint the code.
And finally add some cool examples. > Sidebar, it is a nuisance that you can't use the same source between standalone and proposed core... which would make this sort of thing much easier if working components could literally be pulled into core
@machenmusik What does it mean working components? @fernandojsg won't maintain his component anymore and will be now part of the core. The [registry](https://aframe.io/aframe-registry/) paired with the inspector is the way to easily consume / discover components that are not part of the core while separating concerns and liabilities. I want to reduce what gets into core to what we consider is minimal functionality and has to be consistent across a-frame scenes. If functionality keeps growing we won't be able to keep good quality. @ngokevin @fernandojsg Should we pull the trigger and merge this? Can the component name be shortened? `text` might be too prescriptive, what about `bmtext` or `sdftext`? @dmarcos let me have a look at it, I didn't check the last updates for a while, sorry :)
@ngokevin umm as we could have several techniques I wouldn't choose `sdftext`, being a part of the core maybe `text` could be enough? or `text2d` or something non related to the technique used to render it I wouldn't mind `text` too much, we'd document that there are other methods. And it seems cleaner.

I haven't had time to take a look either. Will get around, but if I don't, I can always post-review. Namespace collisions not too much of an issue, Registry components aren't allowed to register names used by core components. I'll just rename mine to text-geometry (or make it part of the geometry component).

I can help with tests in a bit. Thanks! I think `text.text` is fine. You can change, or I can get to it later. Maybe `<a-text content="Hello">` or `<a-text value="Hello">`? Also, we can talk more about future of primitives in Slack later on. Makes sense to me. `text.value`. I can help with tests right after I finish my current set of work. I'll put it up next. OK, helping on tests and clean up now Would be great to have a section in the doc about other possible text implementatons (geometry, DOM-to-canvas). Usages, advantages, disadvantages, links. I've filed https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/10644 to improve the three.js FileLoader so we don't have to do the whole get or create Promise dance. Else I'm gonna work on decoupling that stuff we have now out of the component to make it easier to read and test. Alright! Spent pretty much the entire week looking at this and helping with tests, clean up, docs, and refactors. It looks great. Super thanks @machenmusik! And @fernandojsg @bryik for the long lineage of the text component. :1st_place_medal: 

If we catch anything else, we can address in a smaller follow up PRs.  I'd like to consider https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2047 There's no difference in difficulty between the current Shader API and using ShaderMaterial directly. We are tightly wrapping the API, routing vertexShader + fragmentShader to ShaderMaterial.vertexShader + ShaderMaterial.fragmentShader and mapping the schema to uniforms. It's actually more difficult because you will run into limitations and it's not as documented as three.js's.

It's not a good idea to support two APIs, especially when one is limited and always has to be kept up to date. Using ShaderMaterial is much more solid. You will be able to copy and paste three.js ShaderMaterial examples straight in rather than trying to figure out the relationships to A-Frame, and there is less risk of API regressions. The grunt work of updating uniforms could be handled by a util or just boilerplate. I think I prefer accepting the few additional lines (that could be resolved with utils, it's just updating an object) that comes from A-Frame trying to hide the three.js API. The maintenance of this API doesn't end with adding textures. It might resolve your simple shader, but there are way too many cases out there where you'll just run into a wall (what about `samplerCube`?).

See all of the [uniform types](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Uniforms-types) we'd need to create A-Frame-to-three.js mappings and property types. Every time three.js updates its API, A-Frame will have to answer. I understand it saves a bit of work in some cases, but in others it seems fragile and will cause some frustration. @ngokevin I don't think that API will change that much in three.js. At the end they're matching GLSL types and that's settled. The root issue is more code/API to maintain versus the benefit. If we propose an API that is an alternative to an existing one, it shouldn't have holes. We could pile on more code and features, but that increases maintenance versus just pointing to ShaderMaterial and leaving it at that. Every feature has a long-term cost.

I'm not sure what you mean with the texture mapping. You're using the `map` property type either way. OK. I thought about it. Even if we prescribe ShaderMaterial, the same amount of work is needed to support the schema. It would be nice to hide the three.js uniform types and use A-Frame schema types instead. I'll punt this for now, I hope we have volunteers to fill in the rest of the property types (there is a PR open for Matrix4) and support the rest of the ShaderMaterial properties. 

PS: The `flat` and `standard` materials support simple texture offsets and repeats. We can file an issue for what's missing. There's also #api on Slack if we want to take it there. Related https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2032 ... the texture loading pieces are a bit of a mess With the extension, in the Diff view, you can see all lines that aren't covered. So I'd see a lot of Red next to the lines that were added, meaning a lot of incoming code that's not unit tested.

 Apologies, tests should have been added to these pieces of code previously (I try to fill in tests when I see holes). Nevertheless, it's a good thing to have. But we can worry about reviewing the PR itself first. I'll look at this tomorrow or friday  https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2193  Thanks, we can cherry-pick this onto the docs  Thanks!  Thanks!  @machenmusik Got a version of the `hand-controls` tests working without the `nextTick` calls: https://github.com/dmarcos/aframe/blob/noNextTick/tests/components/hand-controls.test.js Thanks!  needs rebase  @machenmusik doest it ring a bell? I reverted the model from the https://github.com/aframevr/assets this is probably why the problem cannot be reproduced anymore. @noerw can you confirm that everything is working? Please reopen the issue if you can still reproduce the problem.  Nice, thanks!

@ngokevin how would you feel about just naming this `utils.throttle`? That feels more consistent with common libs like `_.throttle`, and the function may also be used for mouse or gamepad events. This is a `debounce` function in my little world. I don't know what it's the most common name. And yes, it should be generic and not specific to tick. I also believe that the tick should never be debounced but the function of interest that the tick calls If you debounce the tick and later change the component you might end up with a strange behaviour and then remember / rediscover that tick was being debounced In this case `updateControllerList` should be the pne debouced and documented on the method @dmarcos To me, `debounce` implies that the function won't be invoked immediately, but only after the invocations pause for at least ___ms. I do think `throttle` is the right name (although perhaps there are uses for both functions).

[_.throttle](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.2#throttle) vs [_.debounce](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.2#debounce) @donmccurdy you're right `throttle` is the correct one Good point about the `time, delta` arguments. One solution would be to use an a-la-carte NPM implementation:

```
utils.throttle = require('lodash.throttle');
```

But, that would add a 3.6 KB to the build. If we don't expect to use the function internally, maybe it's better for developers just to NPM-require the function themselves.

Also seems easy enough to use `Date.now()` instead of relying on those `time, delta` args, and invoking `callback.apply(null, arguments)`. Yes, to throttle back we can use `Date.now()` to keep track when the function was called last. I would not pull 3.6Kb of dependencies for such small piece of functionality. We can implement a simple generic throttle in our utils based on `Date.now()` Throttling the tick changes its behavior and will suprise devs in the future since it's not obvious that is behaving differently. I would just throttle those methods that need to be throttled (`updateControllerList ` in this case) down and let tick behave the way is expected. We can do:
````javascript
/**
 * This method is throttled down....
**/
updateControllerList: utils.throttle(function updateControllerList() { ... }, 100);
```` Thinking about it more, a more generic throttle would be easier to use for devs rather than a custom tickThrottle. It gives devs more control on what exactly to throttle. In that case:

```
init: function () {
  this.throttledUpdateControllersList = throttle(this.updateControllersList, 50);
},

updateControllersList: function () {},

tick: function () {
  this.throttledUpdateControllersList();
}
``` If we use the convention of naming the throttled method as `methodNameThrottled` there will be less space for confusion. It's likely you will see `methodNameThrottled` in the call stack of your `methodName`. This way it won't affect either to other uses of the methods in the component. I'm not too worried about the conventions and how we use it in `tracked-controls` system, it'll be up to the developer, so just thinking about the API (throttle vs. throttleTick).

I like `utils.throttle` flexibility, but I like not having to call `Date.now()` for each component for each frame. It's much tighter to use the timestamps given by `tick`. Though I haven't run into cases where I've only needed to throttle parts of a `tick`, it's always been all-or-nothing given that components are designed to do one thing and do it well. @mikebolt Thanks for the review. We don't need window.performance.now since that provides sub-millisecond updates, which aren't needed in the context of VR.

You could publish the throttle, but would maybe prefer it to be kept in the repo for now. Thanks! Glad I don't have to do this anymore:

```
tick: (t, dt) => {
  if (t - this.time < 500) { return; }
  this.time = t;
} Only nit (against @dmarcos concern) was we call the method `throttledTick` when it actually isn't throttled. It gets wrapped to `tick` which is the method that is actually throttled. Would have preferred a comment:

```
init: function () {
  this.tick = throttleTick(...);
},

/**
 * Note this method is wrapped to be throttled every 10ms in init().
 */
tick: function () {
  // ...
}
``` Congrats on 2500th commit  I think it's fine to let it break. It makes obvious what it's going on. If the animation just don't play you will spent more time figuring out what happened Animation are supposed to be defined in the model. The component is designed around the asset. I'm fine to let i break so a bug speaks loudly.   Had an idea for one way of solving the issues of #1564, #1437, and #2147, potentially with a simpler API. Instead of having any sort of global dependency resolution, tick/tock, or custom update cycle for shaders...

```js
// API
sceneEl.addTick(Number order, Function fn);
sceneEl.removeTick(Number order, Function fn);

// Constants
AFRAME.Phase = {
  PRE_TICK: 500,
  TICK: 1000,
  POST_TICK: 1500,
  POST_RENDER: 2000
};

// Usage
sceneEl.addTick(AFRAME.Phase.PRE_TICK + 1, function (t, dt) {
  // ...
});
```

The goal here is that component authors can still hook into the A-Frame scene lifecycle, without adding much complexity to the core library itself. Callbacks could be added by components, shaders, or just global code. 

/cc @ngokevin @wizgrav @dmarcos  Closing this out as there have been other suggestions and no clear consensus. Currently I'm using something like this for physics, with my own custom system driving the event loop, and that works well for my needs.  See https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/master/dist#release-builds for build information. Include the master or v0.4.0 version instead.  I think `hand-controls` should just be exclusive to `tracked-controls`. Other method inputs should map to different interaction models that are not hands. A gamepad or the gear VR touchpad should map to a controls schema other than `hand-controls`: a gaze based interaction for instance I want to keep `hand-controls` simple and exclusive to `tracked-controls`. The [tracked-controls](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/tracked-controllers/) demo (walking and reaching objects out with your hands) is not a very good experience with GearVR or a Daydream control. For experiences that use just pointing at targets I can see a 3DOF controls to be used but for GearVR you probably want something different than emulating a hand with your gaze. You're idea of responsive controls is really worth exploring and probably an excellent addition to the registry. We're trying to keep the core as nimble and simple as we can with pieces that are highly reusable and not very opinionated. Also I'm not sure if  a `gearvr-controls` makes sense. At the end of the day it's just one kind of gamepad. The same as the x-box or a PS gamepad. Maybe a `gamepad-controls` makes more sense. One could register mappings for different gamepads. This could also simplify `tracked-controls` to just handle the pose changes.  > right now the mouse/touchpad emulation is activated for GearVR when using Samsung Internet VR browser, and there is specific hackery to leverage the Carmel gamepad mapping

This is why I push back on this kind of changes. I want to minimize the liabilities in the core. We don't have the resources to pay close attention to each browser, version and device to adapt the code to all the quirks (specially for those in experimental phase). The reason of having the [registry](https://aframe.io/aframe-registry/) is:
1. Enable permission less innovation where multiple solutions to a problem can coexist and compete. 
2. Having a community that helps provide all the functionality that we don't have the resources to develop and maintain.

The core team will make its best to facilitate the conversation and create a system for people to share, discover and use those components.  I believe this was fixed by not having the default component override the set value.  https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2475 should fix  @salmanfarisvp what issue are you having with `git clone git@github.com:aframevr/aframe.git` I see. This seems to be the issue 
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2178#issuecomment-267395742 I personally prefer to use `git@github.com:aframevr/aframe.git` since it uses the keys already setup in my system. @ngokevin What do you think?

 Thanks!  @salmanfarisvp You may not have a public key attached to your GitHub account: that would prevent cloning from git@ URLs. You can fix that [with these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey/#verify-the-public-key-is-attached-to-your-account).

Alternatively, try cloning from the HTTPS version of the URL:

```
git clone https://github.com/aframevr/aframe.git
```  I'm not too familiar with this, but I think [adaptive streaming tends to require extra libraries](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28529383/why-do-i-need-dash-js-for-streaming-mpeg-dash-videos), like dash.js. If you set all of that up, it could certainly be possible to use with THREE.js or A-Frame. But, I haven't seen anyone implement this yet, and I don't think we're able to provide videos for testing sorry. @ronit-kadwane #2129 is merged does that solve it for you? Yes, this feature would be left as a component and to extra libraries.  @Charton100774 you should ask that via stackoverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe  I'm facing the same problem, and it's not related to expensive code, for example:
```javascript
var tween = new TWEEN.Tween({ alpha: 1.0 })
  .to({alpha: 0.0}, 1000)
  .onComplete(function () {
    console.log('completed');
  })
  .onUpdate(function () {
    console.log('updated', this.alpha);
  }).start();

 I've just tried to update to `16.6.0`  and the problem is still there :\ it's really strange because if I run the same code on the tween examples it works but if I run on the console with AFRAME injected it doesn't After discussing with @dmarcos it seems that there's a problem with the `TWEEN.update(time)` in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/scene/a-scene.js#L446.

 FWIW if we call `TWEEN.update()`, it will use it own timer (https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/blob/master/src/Tween.js#L52) and it seems to work correctly both in the examples and in the code pasted before. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/6a4bd10d4ac4b018ba7abea72532f8c4b0bc22c4  Make a button that calls requestFullScreen. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API  Thanks!  @Zergus the value of `data` will be passed in `event.detail`. Example:

```js
el.emit( 'actionstart', {value: 2} );
el.addEventListener( 'actionstart', function (event) {
  console.log( event.detail.value ); // 2
});
```

This is similar to the native [CustomEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events) `detail` property.  There's an `enter-vr-ui` component already. What about adding an `auto` flag to it? https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/scene/vr-mode-ui.js We can rename that component to just `enter-vr`  Have the `src/systems/material.js` keep a running count of usage for each texture. When a material component detaches, it'll call the system's `unregisterMaterial`. In that system's method, check how many other entities are using that texture. If there are none, then call `texture.dispose` on it. The issue was fixed by https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2686. No need to do anything, the fix will be released with A-Frame 0.6.0. @tsotneguti because 0.6.0 has not released yet 😄  **Description:**

  I think this could live as a third-party component for now. Could even be simpler, just reading the rStats value and outputting with text component.  Thanks!  To do this, I think we just need the shader registration to recognize an additional type for textures. Specifically THREE.Texture → 't' in THREE.ShaderMaterial uniforms. Yeah, I'd just use the ShaderMaterial API directly. Hm. ok textures are pretty pretty critical if there's going to be a registerShader API at all. I don't think this is the right line at which to ask people to switch from registerShader to using THREE.ShaderMaterial.

Especially since writing a component isn't that inconvenient for anyone who will be writing their own shaders. So a registerShader API that would be missing key ShaderMaterial features seems a little pointless. I think if we were to continue building the registerShader API, then yeah, texture support is mandatory. But I don't see the need for an API that tightly wraps ShaderMaterial, there's a lot of work for A-Frame to handle all of the uniform types and hiding three.js API. I'd rather registerShader just prescribe you to create a material through three.js. There's an issue filed to reconsider the API to be less hands on and more flexible. > I think if we were to continue building the registerShader API, then yeah, texture support is mandatory.

Ok. Yes I like either of those directions, just not the grey area in the middle of the spectrum. 🙂 Not just maps, we'd have to support a lot more things like all the uniform types and shader material parameters like fog or lights. @LarkinArt Whether `registerShader()` will evolve or be deprecated is TBD, I think, but in either case I would work directly with THREE.ShaderMaterial within a component, yes. [Here's an example](https://github.com/donmccurdy/webvr-experiments/blob/master/1-portal/components/transient-material.js#L19-L48).  Regression from probably non-recursive raycaster changes, checking it out. @ngokevin did you see this while working on laser-controls PR?  I assume you were using vive -- trying to understand if it is a core issue or an interaction with other components folks are using Yes. In the `examples/cursor-projection/` that loads an OBJ model. Errors on 2D desktop too.  Server side issue, the server did not allow CORS on the resource OK, will need to double check the XHR has CORS set. I believe it should, we set it on the XHRLoader (soon to be named FileLoader). Using an `<img>` in `<a-assets>` without crossorigin should work since A-Frame will auto-inject that.

I wonder about the inline URL piece though I've did an extra set of cross origin on the TextureLoader for inline URLs, maybe that will help even though we overrode the prototype already https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2544 Check if that works. https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/ee12d49/dist/aframe-master.min.js  We'd need a simple test case that would reproduce an issue for A-Frame. Not sure what would happen with Nuxt (never used) + Vue  It provides a loader for scenes to show something on screen while assets and the scene initializes. It demotes `canvas` and `vr-mode-ui` to libraries from components. The loader needs them before components initialize.
 Glad to review this if it’s still on the roadmap. Or perhaps we should create an external component if we’re hesitant to put this in core? This needs more work. We will postpone for 0.9.0  Can merge this with #1846. We hide the videosphere demo on mobile for these reasons, and I don't have the answers. Lately, people have been getting inline video to work on iOS somehow. If you have any hints, check them in at #1846.  Thanks!  Yeah, that's the issue. Fall back to the September 23rd builds for now.  thanks!  Alternatively, pass a selector for the camera The screenshot component should always operate on the active camera. There's maybe oportunity for a `point-and-shoot` component Yeah, probably a different feature. Like a literal camera component that you can hold and see a preview.  **Description:**

Let's say I've got a custom shader that depends on the camera's position:

```js
const glsl = require('glslify');

AFRAME.registerShader('myShader', {
  schema: {
    vCameraPosition: { type: 'vec3', is: 'uniform' }
  },
  vertexShader: glsl.file('./my-shader.vertex.glsl'),
  fragmentShader: glsl.file('./my-shader.fragment.glsl')
});
```

I'll need to update `vCameraPosition` on every frame, but the shader itself doesn't have a `tick()` lifecycle method. So I can do that by adding a new component, instead:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('myShaderUpdater', {
  tick: function (t, dt) {
     el.components.material.material.uniforms.vCameraPosition.value.set(...);
  }
});
```

That works, but there's also no guarantee that the camera (or any other components my shader depends on) have already ticked. In practice, the shader ends up 1 frame behind.

Any suggestions on a better way to update uniforms? Some ideas:

1. Declare order/priority of components (sounds complicated).
2. Use a system (do systems always tick after components?).
3. Add support for `tick` lifecycle method to the shader itself, which should be invoked later than components. Closing this / not any sort of urgent.   r+  Thanks for bisecting. This makes the fix much easier I investigated this and It's a bigger problem than I thought. The root cause comes from the collision between the primitive mappings and some of the existing component names. Primitives map the `material.visible` to the `visible` attribute while `visible` is also one of the core components. When `visible` initializes it also triggers the primitive mapping update that sets the material component and the original `material` attribute is overwritten. 

I opened https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2145 to explore a solution. My first approach is to ignore mappings that have the same name as one of the registered components. This still won't work if components are register dynamically as the inspector does. @ngokevin What do you think?

I still don't know why https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/8b0df2365c77dd43666afb6f63e922b4d4037753 unveiled the issue and we did not see it before.  What about this one?
````javascript
data[key] = typeof defaultValue === 'object' && defaulValue !== null? utils.extend({}, defaultValue) : defaultValue;
```` Well this another case:
````javascript
typeof [] === 'object'
````
But if we have an array as default it would be a single property schema and it would not run the line you pointed out. Your proposals are good but I think mine it's a bit more explicit and easier to understand. @jesstelford You're more than welcome to submit a PR if you want to take this. Can you add a test to cover for the bug? @dmarcos @jesstelford I've filed a bug separately but of the suggestions so far, only one handles arrays correctly:

```js
data[key] = (defaultValue.constructor && defaultValue.constructor === Object) ? utils.extend({}, defaultValue) : defaultValue;
```

See also, [is-plain-object](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/is-plain-object/blob/master/index.js).

Default values may be arrays whether it's a single-property schema or not, so I don't think there's an easy out there. Although, IMHO, primitive types `string` (or `int`, `number`, ...) should be non-nullable and either cast to an empty string, or throw an error when assigned a non-string default value like `null`. But that's personal preference and not really the question here. :)  Warning added.  **Description:**

Common case to only want to call a tick behavior on an interval rather than every frame.

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('foo', {
  tick: utils.throttleTick(function (t, dt) {
  
  }, 500);
});
```

This would keep track of last time the function ran, and wait 500 ms before calling again.

 Added  `auto-detect-controlers` would be an excellent contribution for [the registry](https://aframe.io/aframe-registry/). For the core I prefer to have lower level and simpler components. In order to support touch I would add a new component `oculus-controls` that is similar to `vive-controls` but specific to touch. I would then modify `hand-controls` to add `oculus-controls` and `vive-controls` to the entity at init time and map the events to the high level actions: thumbup, thumbdown, gripclose, gripopen, pointup, pointdown.

I developed the rational a bit more here:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2124#issuecomment-262604106 I don't think you actually need an `auto-detect` logic in a new compoennt. The `oculus-controls` ,`vive-controls`, `daydream-controls`... will query the gamepad API and look for the corresponding id. If the controller they're looking for is not present they won't do anything. You could have something like:

```html
<a-entity daydream-controls vive-controls oculus-controls></a-entity>
````

Only the one that corresponds to the available controller will be active. There will be an implicit auto-detect logic hence there's not necessary a new component just for detection I think It's unlikely that there will be 11 controllers in the market. Even if there are most of the experiences will focus in 1 or 2 because the capabilities are very different. Doing an experience for Daydream is very very different than doing one that uses the Vive. Also in the worse case there's very little cost on dragging 11 components around on a single entity in the scene. I would defer something more complicated until those things are a real problem. You might be right and `hand-controls` should not be part of the core. Once the registry is officially released and devs get used to it we will consider to move it out. @machenmusik thanks for the criticism by the way, we really appreciate these discussions :) I agree with @machenmusik that things will get messy quick once more controllers become popular. But also agree with @dmarcos when the need arises, we can improve the API and decide what's in core, what's not, how new controllers can be registered cleanly. I think @dmarcos wants the simplest approach right now while keeping the abstractions reasonable, and we can extend later.

And yeah, really appreciate the PRs, tough problems! I think short-term, we could abstract how @dmarcos suggests. Separate Touch component, and support hand-controllers temporarily to be able to use both. That shouldn't take too long. After that, we can easily have master builds that support Touch, as well as introduce different controller components in the Registry that are easily consumable.

Long-term, we can try to envision an API that will handle most controllers and controls (which you are giving great ideas for). We have a PR open for extensible controls we might be able to utilize.  Is there any problem of each controller calling `navigator.getGamepads` to detect if the controller they're looking for is present? We could make a `utils` function that both `vive-controls` and `oculus-controls` components use. `utils.isControllerPresent(controllerString)` . The controls first make that check and if the controller is present then they set the string on `tracked-controls` and attach event listeners. If the controller they're looking for is not present they'll just remain inactive. `tracked-controls` should not call `getGamepads` on every tick. We keep a reference to it:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/tracked-controls.js#L31

That reference changes when the controller and/or id properties changes.  Those properties is what `oculus-controls` and `vive-controls` will set.  Oh that's the system `tick` That's necessary because there's no events to know when gamepads are connected or disconnected (constraint of the Gamepad API).This is in the `tracked-controls` system which is a singleton. There will be just an instance regardless of how many entities use the `tracked-controls` component.  We can find ways to improve it. Correct. If you have `oculus-controls` and `vive-controls` on the same entity you will just have one `tracked-controls` instance. On the `init` method of `oculus-controls` and `vive-controls` you will have:

1. Check if the controller you want is present. `utils.utils.isControllerPresent(controllerString)'
2. If it is present you set the `id` and `controller` you want on `tracked-controls` and  `attachEventListeners` to be able to emit the corresponding button events.
3. If it is not present then you do nothing :). The component stays quite and out of the way.

 `tracked-controls` will always fire events. `oculus-controls` and `vive-controls` will decide if they want to listen to them or not. You could have a flag `listenToEvents` that you can add to the `play` \ `pause` methods to decide if you want to attach the listeners or not:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/vive-controls.js#L50 @machenmusik Yes could definitively debounce the calls to `getGamepads` I requested a few more changes. We're getting closer :). Thanks for sticking with it Hi @machenmusik I've just tried the `tracked-controls` example and I've found the following issues so far:
- If you press and/or release the grip button it does the animation instantly, but if you do the same for the trigger it takes a time to change the state, having so much delay. In fact if you keep pressing the trigger the animation doesn't change at all.
- I've tried to grab the cubes using any of the buttons/triggers and I couldn't move them.

I'll keep trying to see if I find more issues.
Thanks for your work on this PR! @machenmusik testing on oculus @machenmusik probably manually changing the position of the cubes on the example itself: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/examples/showcase/tracked-controls/index.html#L29 to something closer Should we add the teletransport component to the example? @fernandojsg I just noticed that there're no events for just "touch" buttons as they do on oculus games, I mean if you want to just do a fist you don't need to press both trigger, but just touch them (the same as we've the touchstart/end on vive and then we've a button value). Is it because the gamepad api doesn't expose them yet? Unit tests? Mock/stub if we need. 700 LOC, there'll bound to be bugs and regressions arising from future maintenance. @machenmusik I give you a starting point:

https://gist.github.com/dmarcos/b53c571919f56e289faa103957c498b5 @machenmusik the link to the gist on my previous comment was wrong. This  is the one:
https://gist.github.com/dmarcos/b53c571919f56e289faa103957c498b5  Thanks  This might be a breaking change. Components might be expecting a string. If we do this for video, we should maybe be creating video elements if a string is passed, and same for audio and images, and to also inject to a-assets so it's referencable. Will need to look into that I'm worried that previously components always accepted a string, now they can sometimes get a string or an element. I think I'd like to ensure that an element is always received if we do this to keep things consistent:

1. If it is a selector, just return the element. Ensure it has a `src` set.
2. If it is a URL, then maybe we create a media element for them, setting the src, ensure `crossorigin` and `playsinline`. And we append it to `<a-assets>` so they have a reference to it if they want to control media playback.

This PR does look like it fixes things without breaking any official examples, but I think I'd like to resolve it completely. For your case, you could work with an A-Frame fork for a while. Then once it's committed, we'll start having auto-generated master builds you can use. Sorry, just got back from vacation and work trips, will look at it tomorrow as I prepare release. Thanks!  https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-site/commit/661b154dd1e16f417625050ad18989a66fef49e6

fixed, thanks!  Do you have this tested with an Oculus Touch? Don't need to commit the dists. Thanks. That will require some thought on how to untangle and handle different controllers gracefully. Not too worried on getting it out too soon since we are about to ship a release, and Touch controllers are still rolling out. Here is what we have now:

```
hand-controls
<adds hand model and uses events from>
vive-controls
<adds button mappings and uses tracking from>
tracked-controls
```

What do we need? Maybe:

```
hand-controls, vive-controls, oculus-controls, X-model-controls
tracked-controls: handles both tracking + button mappings?
```

But @dmarcos and @fernandojsg have played with controls more than me. Is there a need to make `modeled-tracked-controls` separate? We can assume controllers will always have models + mappings. I see, maybe it's OK to just duplicate the mappings between the uppermost layer? We can expose common mappings as a constant. As opposed to what I think you are proposing, a thin intermediary component just to handle mappings. I would start simple and just add `oculus-controls` and a logic to `hand-controls` to select either `oculus-controls` or `vive-controls` at runtime.  I don't think `modeled-controls` is an abstraction we need. What about adding a `modelSrc` property to `tracked-controls`? We would have `tracked-controls` that optionally loads a model through a `modelSrc` property and then `oculus-controls` and `vive-controls` will manage button mappings, controller specific events and animations / highlights related to the model.  `oculus-controls` and `vive-controls` will use `tracked-controls` , set the appropriate `modelSrc` and pass the corresponding string for the gamepad id `OpenVR Gamepad` \ `Oculus Touch`. You could add both to an entity if you want to support both Touch and Vive:

`<a-entity oculus-controls vive-controls></a-entity>`

If either the Oculus or Vive gamepad is not present then the corresponding controller will have no effect on the entity. 

More abstract controls like `hand-controls` will set both `oculus-controls` and `vive-controls` on the entity (and maybe `daydream-controls` in the future) , set the `model` property to false and map the buttons to the specific high level actions: pointing, grip, grab... `tracked-controls` won't be much heavier. It would just handle the model loading.  If you have exotic model formats or want to make something procedural you could always handle that yourself in your higher level component: `hand-controls`,  `magic-wand-controls` ...

An alternative is to leave `oculus-controls` and `vive-controls` to handle the model loading. That would mean some potential code duplication but everything is simple and clear Authors don't have to enumerate the controllers manually. For instance `hand-controls` (and other high level controls schema) would instantiate and configure them in the init method:
``` javascript
el.setAttribute('vive-controls' { ... });
el.setAttribute('oculus-controls' { ... });
````
The capabilities of each controller are very different. Daydream is only 3DOF, Vive has a touchpad, Touch has two analog joysticks and two triggers. Each application and type of controls should explicitly decide what input to use and how integrate it. Integration is not straight forward and there's going to be cases where you cannot simply support all inputs for your interaction model. You cannot for instance do a-painter with a Daydream controlller or there might be an application that uses the two analog triggeres of the Oculus Touch in a way that won't work in a Vive controller. We should favor highly reusable non opinionated components in the core and let 3rd parties to compete on the higher levels of abstraction.  I's fine to have an old version of a dep lib. Upgrading it won't do much, but I plan to replace tween with anime anyways.  The capture seems correct to me. The scene is rendered differently for each eye. Look at the image on the left side inside the white band. What do you mean by your eyes don't identify they're stereo?
 Which Android device are you using? OK, this seems exclusive to large Android phones. I'm glad you found https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/issues/176 , that's the appropriate area to fix. Will leave this open for now. @thoragio Thank you! 🏆 Can people confirm that https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2345 fixes this issue? https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2345  try https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-star-component
  What do you exactly mean by form controls?
 Can you describe a use case?
 Widgets and interactions can be accomplished through application-level or community components, does not need to be part of the core.  In cases like these, you would document your component to prescribe certain response types? Or have the component handle both? Would there ever be an issue where two components are expecting different response types on the same asset?
  thanks!
  **Description:**

The root issue was the dependencies were not being initialized for primitives because primitives were trying to do `setAttribute` on `attachedCallback`, but at that time `Entity.load` had not been called yet, so dependencies were being blocked from initializing on `el.hasLoaded`.

I initially tried keep them more-or-less separate and give primitives their own `load` method, but it  got messy fast and it became much easier to have the `Entity` prototype have knowledge of the extra data supplied by primitives (through `defaultComponents` and `mappings`). Thus I made primitives implement a method called `getInitialComponents` which the Entity can pull from. 

As an extra bonus, this also means primitives no longer have to duplicate some of the Entity data building process. Primitives only have to worry about default components + mappings, and the entity handles the other data sources.

I made `getInitialComponents` a method rather than having primitives set a property because when an instance of a primitive was setting the property, it would overwrite that property used by other instances sharing the same prototype.

**Changes proposed:**
- Primitives implement `getInitialComponents`.
- `Entity.updateComponents` includes `getInitialComponents`, merging it on the level of DOM components

 I would try to avoid adding extra complexity on `a-entity` to fix primitives. I need to think about this and see if there's another way to solve this.
 I'm not worried about duplicated code in primitives.
 Primitives need a way to hook in early into the component initialization process or else it's extremely difficult to maintain. I've refactored primitives over and over but there's always been issues, I'd like to just end it with a tiny hook and not have to maintain it. The hook isn't primitive-specific code and won't affect existing entities.
 I spent a couple of hours trying to mixin the primitive `defaultComponentsFromPrimitive` into `defaultComponents`. I have the hunch that it might be the cleaner way to fix this. In the process I discovered an inconsistency in the system. Values in the default components are not honored. For instance if you do:

``` javascript
var proto = Object.create(ANode.prototype, {
  defaultComponents: {
    value: {
      position: '2 2 2',
      rotation: '',
      scale: '',
      visible: ''
    }
  },
```

The position value is not applied. I think fixing the inconsistency together with the mixin I described above might be more elegant.
 @dmarcos that would need to be `position: {x: 2, y: 2, z: 2}` — I patched this into one of my examples and default position still works.
  @takahiro Thanks for this! 

@james-h-stephens To get a better picture, can you give a specific use case for this?

Need to think because this property type would probably only be set by other components since it's awkward to hand-code it.
 The rightmost column of affine 4x4 matrix is always [0,0,0,1] that's why some engines uses 4x3 matrices instead of 4x4, maybe we could simplify this one using just 4x3 (and then it will be parsed still to a THREE.Matrix4) but without explicitly define the latest column?
 Should the property be explicit about column-major vs row-major format? The latter is more readable to me, but the former is required for `THREE.Matrix4.fromArray(...)`.

From an ergonomics perspective, I think I like this syntax:

```
<a-entity my-matrix="1  2  3  4,
                     5  6  7  8,
                     9  10 11 12,
                     13 14 15 16">
</a-entity>
```

.... but the output should be a flat array, regardless, as it is here.
 I screwed up and started a duplicate PR, #2113. If we're still undecided on syntax here feel free to compare/contrast.
 Agreed. Summary of my vote:

Serialized / user input: row-major, either `n1 n2 n3 n4` or `n1 n2, n3 n4`.
Deserialized / output: Either column-major array, or THREE.Matrix4. > what type/format of parse() and stringify() input/output/defaultValue should be

any resolution on this?
 I'm happy with @takahirox's implementation as it stands:

- in serialized form: row-major space-separated string.
- in deserialized form: column-major array.

I do realize that this preference sounds inconsistent. IMO the deserialized form _must_ be either column-major or a THREE.MatrixX — those are the two forms that will play well with three.js. Row-major is nice for readability, but if we think readability of matrices in HTML is less critical than API consistency, we could change the serialized form to column-major as well.

EDIT: row-major in, THREE.MatrixX out would be acceptable too, without the internal inconsistency, but then is no longer consistent with the vector types, which don't return THREE.VectorX. This needs rebase @takahirox what use cases do you have in mind for this type? About rebase, ok. 
Regarding use cases, for example applying rotation matrix. Not sure what to do with this PR. No complains about code or the API. My issue is that I struggle to find good use cases for the matrix type. I also think that the components APIs are a layer on top of three and passing matrix values around in my view breaks the level of abstraction. I propose shelving / archiving this PR until we find a legitimate use case. What do you think @donmccurdy @ngokevin @fernandojsg ? @dmarcos I don't think it breaks the abstraction — reasonable that someone might want to encapsulate scale/position/rotation, and matrices are the appropriate primitive for that — but I don't have an immediate use case, either. We've done OK without even an official `quaternion` component, so maybe it is best to table this.

I'm certainly OK with re-opening this PR in the future though. As per prior conversations. I'm archiving this for future reference.  Thanks!
  thanks!
  Will look into it.
 Yeah. The actionable thing to do here is to convert that A-Frame example video to a friendlier codec.
 @JonathanGrant You can try any a-frame scene on regular Chrome and see if the video plays. (https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/videosphere/ plays fine) You won't be able to enter VR but at least you know if it's a problem with the video codec or something else.
  Oculus touch has to be first supported in browser in order for us to integrate it.
  @theDrGray I'm going to close this. Please reopen if you think it's a problem with a-frame
  Thanks!
  Performance stats inside VR mode is really needed. Just a FPS counter attached to the headset tracking, in a corner of the screen, or even just a small quad with a color code indicating if fps > 90 (green) or not: orange ( >= 80 ),  red ( <80 ).. https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/fps-counter#aframe-fps-counter-component  **Description:**

Systems are currently pretty much just components that auto-initialize on the scene and set a `this.system` reference to components that match the system name. The concept is that they are services or managers for components, but there is not much API or features to it, only semantics.

The issue is that we have to maintain both Systems + Components. This means extra code for us, and extra concepts for developers. And then things like the Inspector and Registry have to take the differences into consideration.

The proposal is to remove `AFRAME.registerSystem` and use `AFRAME.registerComponent`.

## API

The true MVP is to just remove the idea altogether and use components. The developer can specify the API and separation of concerns.

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('physics-system', {
  addBody: function (el) { // ... }
});

AFRAME.registerComponent('physics-body', {
  init: function () {
    scene.components['physics-system'].addBody(this.el);
  }
});
```

But we could add a property to differentiate a normal component and a "manager" or "system" component. This alone can enforce that the component must be added to `<a-scene>`. And that perhaps auto-initializes once it's registered.

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('physics-system', {
  system: true
});
```

Taking it further, we can instead specify the components it oversees to give it references and handlers:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('physics-system', {
  manages/systemOf: ['physics-body', 'physics-joint'],

  entityAdded: function (el, component) {
    PhysicsWorld.addBody(...);
  },

  entityRemoved: function (el, component) {
    PhysicsWorld.removeBody(...);
  }
});

scene.components['physics-system'].entities
```

Then @dmarcos thought about handling entity updates and marking them as dirty such that system updates in response to a component update are run only once per tick as well.

## Benefits

- Less concepts for A-Frame. There are only Entities and Components.
- Get all of the magic of components (lifecycle, data management). 
- Smaller API surface area. We can delete a bunch of code and documentation and issues.
- The Inspector gets "system" support for free.
- Fixes issues we have currently with systems (no update/play/pause). @wizgrav I don't think it's necessary to define any API for execution ordering, the developer could have control over it. If you defined a system that oversees multiple components, you'd have a group of entities that have all of those components, then you can do as you please.

``` js
AFRAME.registerComponent('foo-system', {
  systemOf: [['bar', 'baz']],

  tick: function () {
    var barData = this.entities[0].getAttribute('foo');
    var bazData = this.entities[0].getAttribute('baz');

    // 1. Do stuff with barData.
    // 2. Do stuff with bazData.
    // Do whatever.
  }
});
```
 That's why you wouldn't put `tick`s on the components. You have the components act as data containers, and delegate the logic/execution to the system.
 For physics, my components implement a `step()` function, and the system invokes those in custom (two-phase) ordering.

I wouldn't want to reduce systems to unprivileged components without also having real control over `tick()` order. That would potentially break physics badly. Managing `tick()` order seems like a much harder problem. Having systems extend the Component prototype, and support play/pause, would seem great though. Is it possible to merge system/component code while continuing to support a two-pass `tick()`? So there would still be a concept of systems, but fewer codepaths?

I also like the `systemOf` syntax. I could see AFRAME.registerSystem just being an alias of AFRAME.registerComponent that enforces/requires a `systemOf` property. We could make systems extend components, but there's a lot of code involved in managing the lifecycle. Right now, the lifecycle is the same so it makes sense to make them components with some extra sauce. The minimum level of extra sauce, IMO, would be that system-components' `tick()` handlers are invoked after all components on scene descendants. Or, alternatively, one of the various tick ordering proposals. What are the open questions for answers/feedback on this currently? I'm currently thinking having Systems extend Components but keep the `registerSystem` API. I can imagine Systems gaining more functionality like `entityAdded` and `entityRemoved` handlers. I'll close this for now as System updates just landed and there is currently a separate issue for entityAdded/entityRemoved handlers. If refactoring is needed later, we can re-evaluate.  @james-h-stephens working on this, but also there is a `vec4` property type that [works well for quaternions](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system/blob/master/src/components/math/quaternion.js).
  **Description:**

```js
entityAttached: function (el, componentData) {

},

entityDetached: function (el, componentData) {

}
``` `entityAttached` vs `componentAttached`?
 Not fleshed out yet, but probably entity. The entity is now managed by the system. You could possible do neat stuff like specifying two components, and matching entities that only have _both_ of those components (e.g., `enemy` + `dead`).
 This could be done nicely with mutation observers:

```js
var observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) => console.log(mutations));

observer.observe(sceneEl, {
  subtree: true,
  attributes: true,
  attributeFilter: ['foo']
});
```

Except that sadly it won't catch `foo__1`.   thanks!
  thanks! it should be load
  thanks!
   Related: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1515

The above solution makes cubemaps an entirely separate shader, but they should perhaps be a property type that can be used for any property.

I was thinking whether the `map` property type could support both textures and cube textures. Would that make sense to do? If I have `<a-sky>`, could `src="#myMap"` and `src="#myCubemap"` both work, or should they be separate properties?
  Thanks!

  It would be nice to offer a different set of mirroring options with VR:

 Since 0.8.0 there's a spectator mode for the camera component https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/camera.html#properties_spectator

I have not seen much demand for the reduced mode. Should it be part of the core or an advance feature provided by external components?  Try setting `window.scrollTop to 0
 Well, it's a Safari problem. If you can find any solutions such as http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24889100/ios-8-removed-minimal-ui-viewport-property-are-there-other-soft-fullscreen , that'd be great...else we recommend more recent hardware/software.

  I think that sounds good. I don't imagine needing non-ID selectors for assets.
  moved to a-painter https://github.com/aframevr/a-painter/issues/156
  Here's a test I wrote, it oddly passes:

+
+       registerComponent('root', {
+         dependencies: ['dependency']
+       });
+
+       registerComponent('dependency', {
+         schema: {foo: {type: 'string'}},
+         init: function () {
+           assert.equal(this.data.foo, 'bar');
+           delete components.root;
+           delete components.dependency;
+           done();
+         }
+       });
+
+       // Create entity all at once with defined dependency component and component.
+       el.setAttribute('dependency', 'foo: bar');
+       el.setAttribute('root', '');
+       this.el.appendChild(el);
+     });
```

Any suggestions for this test case?
 OK thanks! I'll try to inject raw HTML as string then.
  **Description:**

Lots of properties for THREE.Texture at https://threejs.org/docs/?q=texture#Reference/Textures/Texture , how to expose these in a clean way for each kind of map?

Maybe a texture property type?

```
material="map: [src: #texture; anisotropy: 1.1; flipY: true]"
```

Or a indirect route?

```
material="map: #texture__map"
texture__map="src: #texture; anisotropy: 1.1; flipY: true"
``` Looking at https://aframe.io/docs/master/components/material.html#built_in_materials and how there are multiple map types trying to expose every texture properties for each one, it seems necessary for a separate texture component. @dmarcos toyed with this before.
 I think this will be important as currently, we have to create a different property on the material component for each type of map, duplicating a lot of the texture setup. The standard shader has:
- ambientOcclusionMap
  - intensity
  - repeat
  - offset
- displacementMap
  - intensity
  - repeat
  - offset
- normalMap
  - intensity
  - repeat
  - offset
- map (src)
  - intensity
  - repeat
  - offset

Then what if we want to add a new texture property, like configure the wrapping or flip? We'd have to add it to each single one, and in the code, we'd have to duplicate logic.

A separate texture/map component would be cleaner. It could have its own system for caching. You just define a texture component, and reference from the material (or any other) component.

`material="map: map__texture" map__texture="src: #textureImg; anisotropy: 1.1; flipY: true"`

And alternative, allow inline definition

`material="map: [src: #textureImg; anisotropy: 1.1; flipY: true]"`
 I'm not 100% sure whether I like this any better, but for discussion's sake here's a counter-proposal. No integration with the existing `material` component, just a separate `texture-config` component that modifies properties of the object it's attached to, whether there's a `material` component or a model of some kind.

```
<a-entity obj-model="obj: url(...); mtl: url(...);"
          texture__customemissive="map: emissiveMap;
                                   src: url(emissive.png);
                                   flipY: false;>
</a-entity>
```

If `src` is omitted, it would just modify the existing texture on that object, if any.

Potentially more complicated if this is a model with multiple meshes. Apply to them all? Allow a `name` selector? I think my concern with the original proposal is that it's verbose and requires changes to the schema, for a case where I (personally) would probably just define the THREE.Material in a component.

Like, I'm not going to want fine-grained control over textures on a cube geometry, and if it's a custom mesh then why not package textures with that? Where I might want this would be to, say, add an emissive channel to something exported from MagicaVoxel ([example](https://twitter.com/donrmccurdy/status/838971043909894145)) and in that case there would be no `material` component to begin with. I wasn't thinking of this issue as being specific to custom shaders; seems valid even for the default three.js material types. But whether the issue is common enough to be worth a component (or schema changes) in core at this point I'm not sure.

Example: MagicaVoxel doesn't export an emissives channel, so I threw together [this component](https://github.com/donmccurdy/webvr-experiments/blob/master/3-postprocessing/components/material-map.js) yesterday to add that. Could have done this in Maya or Blender, of course, but eh. Or maybe you want to enable/disable emissive when something turns on, etc. Maybe this could be done more internally by having a texture property type of some sort that gets mixed into the material just for code quality (easier caching of identical textures, easier handling of updates). Maybe I'm not sure what problem you want to solve, sorry.

My working assumption is that very few developers will use things like `aoMap` with the `material` component, much less `aoMap.flipY`, because the `material` component isn't very compatible with custom models and occlusion maps of primitive geometries aren't very interesting.

But if there's something about the current implementation that would benefit from cleanup then please go ahead. :)

EDIT: And, is there caching that can't be done at the TextureLoader level? I want to solve manually implementing multiple different texture property types for each type of map and be able to easily add more texture property types to each.

I also want to improve texture caching, in memory and for the GPU. TextureLoader handles network caching, not memory and not sending duplicate texture data to GPU. We currently cache textures if they have the same `src` and same `repeat`, but there are much more texture properties to take into account.

I agree though that perhaps these property types aren't important for the basic material component, and they could just be imported using glTF. I'll close this then in favor of more of a code quality / refactor route without affecting the API to descope this.  Workaround might be to do a super stub of the `window` with `global.window = { ... }`. 

aframe-react actually only needs `AFRAME.components`, so yeah, need to find a way to decouple for Node purposes.
 Solution might be to have a `browser.js` entry point and a separate `index.js` entry point which contains Node-friendly requires. The `browser.js` entry point can export what `index.js` does. Point `package.json` `main` to `index.js` and `package.json` `browser` field to whatever is in `dist/`.

  You can ask on StackOverflow.

I posted and answered it at:

  Need to `npm run lint`
 Looks like we have to bump Node for the lint tests to run well on Travis. But can you do `npm run lint` to fix lint errors?
 Yeah, can you run `npm run lint` locally and fix those errors? It also now needs a rebase. 
 Thanks for addressing the lint. Working on reviewing this now. I have fetched and rebased this. I'm currently doing some cleanup and refactoring and will get merged/approved shortly.
 How come we are doing `el.getAttribute('preload') === 'none' || !el.hasAttribute('preload')` to check for media element progress. What's the situation on what audio and video need to preload?

Video: needs autoplay
Audio: needs preload

?
 I dug into this more. There is an issue. There is no way to get the number of bytes through HTMLMediaElement progress events, only time/duration. Ideally, we'd be able to calculate total size of assets in the scene in bytes. But right now, XHRs give bytes and HTMLMediaElements give seconds. There isn't an easy way to get an accurate percentage or progress.

I think the solution is to not rely on HTMLMediaElement progress, and use XHRs for everything. However, with HTMLMediaElement, I was confident that the browser would cache these types of assets. My question is: is there a way to make the browser cache video/img/audio that are requested first via XHRs and ensure that only one XHR is sent per asset? > There is no way to get the number of bytes through HTMLMediaElement progress events, only time/duration.

Did you check on responses with and without `Content-Length` HTTP response headers?
 > My question is: is there a way to make the browser cache video/img/audio that are requested first via XHRs and ensure that only one XHR is sent per asset?

It's a hack, but probably the most bulletproof way that comes to mind: I'd suggest monkeypatching three.js' XHR loader.
 @jonalex let me know if you need help with this; I'm excited about this functionality Yeah, I've been looking through this code just recently, which I was commented here. I'll follow up at some point here and let you know if/where the assets logic could use some help; stay tuned. Thanks for your help - it's much appreciated.
 is this close to graduating from WIP? is there anything I can do test or simplify this? If you can get it to read byte progress from media elements, be my guest.  This pull request contains a merge commit instead of the changes. Try starting with a new branch:

```
git checkout -b mybranch
```

Rebase. Make sure the `aframevr/aframe` repo is added remote in your `.git/config` (let's call it `upstream`).

```
git pull --rebase upstream master
```

Then make your changes and commit. Push your changes.

```
git push origin mybranch
```

Then make your pull request :)
  The browser and device support will change a lot. Maybe just a plain link under the `Find out more:`.
  thanks!
  yeah that's a bug, can you fix it? thanks!
  **Description:**

Only works in Firefox. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/contextmenu

But helps discoverability of these tools.
  **Description:**

Just a random idea.
- Rely less on `this`.
- Make functions more contained such that they can easily be adapted, unit tested, and more predictable. You wouldn't need to the DOM to test.
- Makes it more explicitly apparent what is available rather than a `this` namespace.
- If another framework wanted to adapt the A-Frame components, they could write an adapter for `entity`.
- By passing in state, modifying it, and returning it, we could have debug tools to keep a history of all state changes. (i.e., state machine). Perhaps open doors to composing/wrapping functions

```
AFRAME.registerComponent(‘foo’, {
  initialState: {
    currentPosition: new THREE.Vector3()
  },

  schema: {},

  update: function (entity, data, state, oldData) {
    state.currentPosition.x += 1;
    return state;
  }
});
```
 @mflux Can you articulate what `this` confusion mean? Simply passing the prototype of the component to `registerComponent`  as we do know is simple and effective.  Using `this` is pretty vanilla JS and every developer regardless of the library they come from understands it. In your example, It's not clear what `context` is without having to read extra docs. The current architecture is not opinionated and very flexible. You could wrap your variables in a closure if you prefer or you could even create your own `registerComponent` that implements the pattern you describe. 
 You can actually do what you describe... You can create `AFRAME.registerComponentFn`.
 I think he means you wouldn't have to do [method binding](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/look-controls.js#L67), doing [`var self = this`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/scene/inspector.js#L59), or doing like [`var x = this.x`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/light.js#L43).

I can see the benefits. This is still vanilla JS, and you don't know what's in `this` either without reading the docs. At least with `context`, you can `console.log` it and read it cleanly. They're both equally flexible, this is just a bit cleaner. You'd also be able to create private "methods" that have still access to the scope, which currently you can't.
 It's also prescribe developers to [pre-define all their state/internal variables up top](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/light.js#L32) and discourage them from [calling handler functions as if they were methods](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1853/files#diff-6285039eee70ed830f70f7d2f7b7dfa5L60).
 I like simplicity over all. @mflux design is for me a proof of success of keeping things simple and unopinionated. He comes to a-frame with his own particular background and was quickly able to successfully bend the current design to his own taste. 
 Awesome. At the very minimum, we can expose the Component prototype now.

I'd like to write components this way too as it would be much easier to unit test and decide what is private and public. Ideally, we could be able to pass a prototype _or_ function into the same function while having both of them go down the same code path and not introduce extra API. Will have to explore that more.

Also reminds me a bit of React. All components were classes/prototypes, but then they introduced stateless functional components where you could define a component via just a function, input props and output the render `props => <ReactComponent/>`. 
 Having used them in AngularJS, Express, and Koa, my opinion is that state management through `state`/`context`/`scope` arguments often introduces more inconsistency than it fixes, and I would prefer not to see that become a required pattern. The nuances of `this` are inherent to JavaScript, and the community is already dealing with those at the language level (fat arrows, `class` syntax, etc).

Exposing component prototype makes sense to me; I'm certainly supportive of letting devs write however they prefer.
 The prototype is exposed now. We can create a third-party wrapper and try it out, test its ergonomics.
 While I like the closure syntax more than our current state, we're on the road we're on...hopefully `class` syntax might help things later on.  **Description:**

Something to do with the webvr polyfill buffer scale again?
 Probably a result of the WebVR polyfill post-processing. Will check issues there and remove from the Milestone.
 Can we do both at the same time? Thanks! Yeah, we can give it a couple of days.

This issue is reported to also affect iPhone 6. Maybe because the VR effects (e.g., barrel) applied by the polyfill degrade the resolution? I believe the step is to target when in the WebVR Polyfill the blur was introduced. This is made difficult due to WebVR API migrations. My guess is it was when the barrel distortion and VR effects were added to the polyfill. The solution may be to introduce a way to toggle off those effects to preserve resolution.

  You can take the stereo sound source from the video and use the positional sound component for left and right, perhaps?
 The 360 devices are focused on images rather than video capture, so I'd be surprised. The videos you saw were maybe professionally produced with binaural mics and rigs?
 I recommend demuxing the audio from video and place the sounds where you want with the positional sound component.
  **Description:**

Easiest way is to make sure it's in the `<head>` to reduce errors where people are including A-Frame after the scene HTML.
- A-Frame Version:
- Platform/Device:
- Reproducible Code Snippet or Demo URL [highly encouraged]:
 It might be helpful to also have a warning if components are registered after a scene is already in the DOM. Ideally that would "just work," but since it's complicated and we don't support it yet, nice to have a safety net for users putting A-Frame in `<head/>` but registering components after the scene.

(I've made this mistake myself a few times, since scripts that modify the scene do need to go later or wait for DOMContentLoaded)
 The issue was originally filed as #485. Want to forward dupe?
 Yeah, nice catch. I'll close that one as it's trying to support actually having the `<script>` in the body, and this is for a warning. We might be able to have `<script>` in the body with logic, but things could get messy, and components via `<script>` tag might not work as well if they also have to be in the body.
  Try defining your components before `<a-scene>`
  I'm experienced with npm and ES6 modules and Browserify/Webpack/UMD workflows so I understand. A-Frame is pretty large scope, it's VR in your browser, I think that warrants a global. Think of it as the global `window` of VR.

I used to prescribe components when installed through `npm` do:

```
var AFRAME = require('aframe');
AFRAME.registerComponent('foo', require('my-component'));
```

But I preferred less work for developers so they can just require and go. For your linter, you can do `/* global AFRAME */`. And there's not much of a consequence of exposing a singleton as a global, traditionally, it might feel bad because applications used to put _everything_ in global.
 Don't think we can do much as A-Frame is and should be used as a frontend library where a window is available. I think it is requirable from Node now though.  Depends on their browser's WebGL/WebVR support. If it can't load a simple skysphere, there's something up with their browser.
 Let me know how three.js examples load
 Would have to wait for a WebGL-compatible browser from PS.
  I think we are running out of room for badges :)

Otherwise, we've been promoting just our `aframe.io/releases` or `unpkg.com` (which we use for our component ecosystem). Thanks though!
  It introduces a scene level component `screenshot` that allows to take a snapshot of the rendered scene with the `alt-S` shortcut. It is configurable to take either equirectangular (panoramas) or screen snapshots. It should also work with the inspector. @chriscar I believe you were asking for this a couple of days ago in Slack. It would be great to get your feedback on it.

I still have to organized the code a little bit better but the functionality is complete. 
- Bumps three.js r81
 The perspective screenshot is upside down and reverse

 I made a bunch of changes based on review and fixed the vertically flipped pixels on perspective projection.
 There are still a few typo/doc comments to address in the diff.

Also, curious what changed about how three.js stores `<img>`s? Otherwise, r+wc
 I fixed the typos and changed the shortcut to `alt+ctrl+s`. `alt+s` opens the history menu on Firefox. Using `alt+ctrl+s` also makes it consistent with the inspector shortcut
  The mouse cursor component should work.

 You can force the scene to keep the HTML up to date by using `<a-scene debug="true">...</a-scene>`. There are moderate performance losses for doing this.

However, `getAttribute()` will always give the latest data (with or without the `debug` option). Example:

``` javascript
var cameraEl = document.querySelector('[camera]');
cameraEl.getAttribute('rotation');
```
  We've deprecated a-animation. Try https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation and file issues, and component will be merged in in the future.  Do three.js examples work?

  Are you using the cursor component or raycaster? Cursor component adds the click events.

Either way, check the raycaster max distance is sufficient (videosphere has 5000m radius, so set to 5000+)
  thanks!
  Thanks! Can you update the docs too?
 thanks!
  Not quite sure what's going on, there's too much stuff sitting on top of A-Frame, it's hard to debug (Angular 2, routers, typescript, es6, multiple scenes).
 Any updates? I am not sure this is actionable unless we have more details.
 Will close without a test case for now  Doesn't work yet https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/916 ... it'll be non-trivial to support that actually.

For presentations, I've been detaching the current scene and appending new one when I change slides. Also consider I-Frames.
  Good catch! Thank you

  Hi @Hongbo-Miao – try the list of [community-made A-Frame components](https://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe#components). You probably want [one](https://github.com/bryik/aframe-bmfont-text-component) [of](https://github.com/maxkrieger/aframe-textwrap-component) [these](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-text-component). Showing text in WebGL is a bit complex, and different approaches are better for different things, so it has been left out of the core library so far.
 I like using https://github.com/bryik/aframe-bmfont-text-component

Whether that should be standard I am not sure. Currently, it's the solution that works and looks the best. It might be nice to have it out of the box. But other solutions like html-to-canvas might win out?
 We should consider having a basic sample text implementation (I like @bryik's) as part of the standard lib. This way if third-party components want to add text for whatever reason (debug, labels), they don't have to depend on a third-party text component or consider how to package that in.
 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2200  > Do you have any guesses what router would change? The error is because something hasn't initialized with the scene when the geometry is initializing. I don't know how that could happen.
 There's an event. `scene.addEventListener('loaded'...`

Or attach your Angular init code in an A-Frame component `<a-scene angular-init>`
 alternatively:

``` js
AFRAME.registerComponent('angular-init', {
  init: onLoaded
});
```

``` html
<a-scene angular-init>
   ...
</a-scene>
```
  The newest version of Chromium uses WebVR 1.1 API.

Sorry about that, need to communicate that somehow!
  Thanks for filing. Before we weren't versioning our docs, so there wasn't an easy way to pull in typo fixes. Now there is, so going forward this shouldn't be an issue. We'll just have to leave pieces of 0.2.0 with typos.
  Thanks, I think there were some merge conflicts. Will get that fixed.
 Component dependencies don't have attributes. They could but the current API only allows to define the list of dependencies to guarantee an order of initialization. If the component is also defined in the entity we call `updateComponent` with the proper data defined in the DOM attribute:

  **Description:**

I've found cases where we want to be able to update systems (e.g., `enemy` system). Since systems already have schema/play/pause/init/data...with update, they will have the same API as components. We should be able to reuse the prototypes, but maintain the same registration API + system-to-component referencing
 :+1: I run into the same problem while developing the `decal` system for the a-shooter.
 Considering instead https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2071
  0.4.0 has a nicer message: `Uncaught (in promise) Error: Failed to enter VR mode (requestPresent): No VR hardware found.` It didn't work because the calls to go into fullscreen failed, and then orientation lock. You can't control these things with javascript because they are app settings.
Both of them are in the correct settings of course. The fix here is to disable the fullscreen and orientation checks when in a webview. The same will apply to iOS. This is because the WebView doesn't support vrDisplay, and aframe doesn't support browsers that don't support vrDisplay.

A potential fix is to use a-frame 0.2.0 code for presenting as a fallback. Sorry, I don't understand the problem. Chrome (not the Chromium WebVR builds), Firefox (not Nightly), Edge or Safari don't support VRDisplay and a-frame works fine. The polyfill should kick in in all those cases. What's different in a webview? We don't do Android development in the a-frame team so we cannot test webviews easily. If someone can investigate and provide a fix we will take it Sorry, I'm not very familiar with the codebase. Where is the polyfill located?

Ahh, it seems to be in index.js - I will have a look into it. OK, looks like a simple fix for the webvr-polyfill project. I will submit a pull request with them and keep this bug open to make sure we update the dependency on a-frame. Hmm, it looks like the changes were submitted and denied. WTF.

Is it a harmless warning, or does it prevent stereo mode (one render for each eye)? Is there a way to detect a fullscreen/native/pinned context?
 I mean is there a smarter way to automatically handle it without having to create a property? "If this app is in Cordova, don't fullscreen".
 Yeah, perhaps that'd work. Can you confirm that'd work on hybrid mobile apps?
 Might be some work on A-Frame side to fix this too.

  **Description:**

This is a well-ingrained API, and a lot of people like it. Unfortunately, I think there are too many issues with it that are inherent making `<a-animation>` its own Custom Element. We should consider delegating it to third-party component (I have a sample [animation component on kframe](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation)). Since it's very ingrained, we'd probably give it a few versions to slowly deprecate. 

Here are the issues:
- **Poor Imperative Ergonomics**: To add an animation imperatively, we must do `createElement`, multiple `setAttributes`, `appendChild`, and `addEventListener('loaded')`.
- **Asynchronous**: With `<a-animation>`, we must wait for it to append to the DOM and register a callback listener. It's not synchronous when it could be.
- **Inconsistent with the Framework**: The `<a-animation>` tag is the only outlier in which we use a child DOM element rather than an HTML attribute to modify an entity's behavior. Components are nice because they can easily be mixed in, and you could use things like [aframe-mss](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-mss)
- **Difficult to Maintain**: I made an animation component, and it is a 3-4 times smaller codebase and much simpler. This is because `<a-animation>` duplicates a lot of component logic related to entity lifecycles (having to handle attach, update, remove). We also have a lot of edge case code in our base classes just for `<a-animation>` that we could move or remove (e.g., move states from ANode to AEntity). 
- **Buggy**: Lots of animation-related bugs that are tough to fix and often just result in adding more attributes. We don't have the manpower to maintain it when it's already fairly hard to maintain.
- **Faster Development**: Having animations be detached from the A-Frame core library means faster iteration. Due to being easier to maintain, having more features, and not being tied to A-Frame versions, we can do bug fixes and add features without needing to tie it to the an A-Frame release.
- **Verbose** (nit): A-Frame Component form is much shorter than DOM form
- **Inspector**: component form would be automatically compatible with the Inspector
 are you comfortable with people using https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation?

honest question: why not move your component into core?

I understand the desire for faster development, but for front-end devs it's not trivial to drop in a component, unless they're comfortable with the command-line + Node/npm + Browserify. (until there's some sort of graceful component loading such as how it works [with the Holodeck Club's `manifest.json`](https://github.com/holodeck-club/holodeck-club.github.io/blob/79a5cc9/molo/manifest.json#L22) and [ESNextbin](https://esnextb.in/?gist=27fd38f51a4a9303e9c7&execute=true)).

I can imagine a third-party component with (even more) stock animations (i.e., canned effects) such as those defined in https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ but for A-Frame.
 Faster iteration is pretty much it. We can bump a component and release it rather than people having to wait at least a month for a new A-Frame. And we have more leniency to include additional features if it were to live as third-party. It also lets us offload work to community so that we so that we can focus on larger things because there are a lot of of costs to keeping this module (documentation, issues, support, bugs).

I think difficulty in requiring a component is a separate and larger issue. But people don't need command-line/NPM/Browserify, it's just a script tag. Front-end devs are accustomed to pulling in code via `<script>` tag (A-Frame being included). My brother in high school was able to grab aframe-extras with no coding experience.

I was somewhat on the fence, but I think offloading to community vs. a large batteries-included library is best long term (for now).
 Forgot to answer the first question, I'm comfortable maintaining that just as I have `<a-animation>`. The two or so versions of deprecation will give a good buffer time as well to transition. If I don't maintain it well, naturally people can fork it (just like Blair MacIntyre forked to a better look-at component).
 > Faster iteration is pretty much it. We can bump a component and release it rather than people having to wait at least a month for a new A-Frame.

perhaps it's worth finally adopting [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) (which despite its name doesn't require adopting semver naming) for "continuous releases" (issue #304 covers this). if I'd have to vote, I'd place that issue high on the priority list. but you and @dmarcos definitely have a better idea of priorities.

> My brother in high school was able to grab aframe-extras with no coding experience.

That's awesome and reassuring. I can actually see (and am a bit concerned) that `aframe-extras` becomes what the `aframe` core should've/could've been. Do you share those worries? I've seen with other OSS projects, it becoming a bit awkward when you need to need an additional lib to do anything "interesting."

> Forgot to answer the first question, I'm comfortable maintaining that just as I have `<a-animation>`. The two or so versions of deprecation will give a good buffer time as well to transition. If I don't maintain it well, naturally people can fork it (just like Blair MacIntyre forked to a better look-at component).

That seems fine. I just wonder where to draw the line. Could go the `stack.gl` or `express` approach - of having micro-modules and having folks install + require each dependency. Is that the desired path of A-Frame? Or should it become (or remain?) the jQuery (a "stopgap" solution until the browsers catch up - no offence to jQuery) of WebVR for now. Is there concern that deprecating `<a-animation>` could sacrifice the ease of A-Frame scene development (for its hundreds+ WebVR devs/enthusiasts) in an effort to ease development of the `aframe` core lib (for its 71 contributors)?

Asking these questions because they're things I've wondered myself about A-Frame's vision and strategy. More precisely:
- When, if ever, will A-Frame be considered _done_?
- What do we need to get there?
- What is currently getting in the way? Lack of core developers/reviewers, core features, platform dependencies, curation, documentation, third-party component creators, scene creators, enough innovative scenes?
 > perhaps it's worth finally adopting semantic-release

`semantic-release` is sort of related, but if you want to pull in one fix for a single component, developers shouldn't have to worry about bumping A-Frame and having to pull all the unrelated changes with it. I'm actually sort of against continuous releases, I don't think it's right for A-Frame because releases should be fairly stable, QAed, and with documentation, which sounds hard to do. Feel free to enlighten me about continuous releases in another issue...I'm all for automating them though.

> I've seen with other OSS projects, it becoming a bit awkward when you need to need an additional lib to do anything "interesting."

I don't share the worries. Every framework you're going to pull at least one dependency. It's hard to imagine if someone was able to make fireballs or mountains with a component, but were deterred by having to include a `<script>` tag. People'll actually want to because with a line of code, they can save themselves a ton of work (or be able to do something they couldn't otherwise). Of course, we can always ease the process. More documentation and more abstractions (Inspector, Editor, Atom plugin).

p.s., I also think it's quite beautiful that developers are adopting `aframe-extras`, it shows a healthy ecosystem. People are discovering it, are able to use it, gives them value, and all without us.

> I just wonder where to draw the line.

Thin vs. large standard library is a legitimate question. I've thought about it over the months, and thin is best for us _currently_ for the long term. It is sort of micro-modules, but I think that isn't necessarily a bad thing for WebVR today to enable open experimentation and to keep bundle sizes down. Component packs like `aframe-extras`, `kframe`, and perhaps our own curated pack will make this better though. 

As we see more necessary things (i.e., link traversal) or unbeatable/must-have components pop up (i.e., perhaps a solid `grab` component, physics, controls), we can adopt more into the core or standard lib. Take it on a case-by-case basis, I don't think declarative tweening is vital or prime enough to make the cut. So don't worry too much that we're going to have a library that does absolutely nothing, it'll be plenty on its own :)

> Or should it become (or remain?) the jQuery

I think three.js is already like the jQuery of 3D/VR. Grab bag of convenient modules with no opinionated structure.

> Is there concern that deprecating <a-animation> could sacrifice the ease of A-Frame scene development (for its hundreds+ WebVR devs/enthusiasts) in an effort to ease development of the aframe core lib (for its 71 contributors)?

Deprecating `<a-animation>` will improve ease of development for the many performance and technical reasons mentioned above. Being able to set an animation with `el.setAttribute('animation', {...})` is so much better than `createElement(); setAttribute(); setAttribute(); setAttribute(); setAttribute(); appendChild(); addEventListener('loaded')`. Since it's a component, you can use it via mixins, my CSS syntax in `aframe-mss`, or the A-Frame Inspector (which you currently can't!).

> When, if ever, will A-Frame be considered done?

I think it is possible to get the A-Frame's API in a solid state since we don't have the burden of trying to enable every feature. We can have a healthy ecosystem of components, shaders, controls, primitives, etc. that are all created without hassle through that API. By that point, we should have a good story of where components live. Then we focus less on the API, and more on human-centric tools like a full Editor or VR Editor (although we have the capability to do these things in parallel).

> What do we need to get there?

If we all build more scenes and components, we can continue to iterate A-Frame's API as well as gauge what is necessary to include into the core.

> What is currently getting in the way? 

Nothing is in the way, necessarily. We're making progress. All the above helps move things along. My itch is having more innovative scenes being built.
 (First off, apologies for the wall of text. I'm trying to get in the habit of over-documenting things, as our team is effectively remote as is the A-Frame community.)

Awesome, this all makes perfect sense. Thanks for writing that all up. I can dig it. Personally, as someone who doesn't want to bother with build steps (though I am very comfortable with build systems), I don't want to manually add scripts (`aframe.js` + `aframe-extras.js` + …) to my scene. There are build systems out there that attempt to alleviate this (such as [`systemjs`](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs)).

I'm asking these questions – and my apologies for my questioning (and these questions are perhaps better left to be answered in a separate issue in this repo) – in the hopes that we can keep things simple and usable. It's great to keep the A-Frame core small + elegant is great and enable developers to not have to have their components vetted by us. But I wonder if we could borrow some lessons from [hapi.js](https://github.com/hapijs) and [express.js](https://github.com/expressjs)).

All-in-one editor tools such as [`esnextbin`](https://esnextb.in/?gist=27fd38f51a4a9303e9c7&execute=true), [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/), and CodePen are great for prototyping (and even the first two could actually be productionised). But, today, devs still have to introduce Node + npm + the command line + Browserify/Webpack + git + GitHub if they want to create, publish, and share a scene with the world. If it's not Node + npm + the command line, it's a trial-and-error adventure of copying URLs + moving files into a directory + testing. (I know we can improve on both fronts; I touch on this later.)

> I think three.js is already like the jQuery of 3D/VR. Grab bag of convenient modules with no opinionated structure.

three.js doesn't have a module system (though I know there have been attempts and arguments for/against it), but it could be considered opinionated in that it offers an anti-modular, expansive feature set.

It's certainly frustrated me that with three.js I couldn't just pick and choose modules like I can with customised jQuery/lodash builds (which admittedly causes fragmentation and makes bugs harder to trace, report, reproduce, etc.).

three.js' solution to this problem is to include everything in one giant bundle (though with Webpack/rollup.js, tree-shaking makes the problem obsolete; and also a promising contender has recently entered the ring: [optimize.js](https://github.com/nolanlawson/optimize-js)) and encourage the community to build an ecosystem of examples that also live in the repository.

I agree adoption and ease of use would falter if A-Frame took the same approach. But, I will say that even npm and GitHub are suffering from the problem of "which module does what I want it to, is it compatible with the core library (and the version I'm using), do I have a guarantee that it is and will be well maintained and tested." I've heard from tweets, blog posts, podcasts, etc. that folks at both the companies are working on this problem. Curation helps for sure, but at the end of the day things need to work (most of the time).

I'd say that requiring a build step to create a scene now ups the learning curve. If you aren't moderately comfortable with the command line, Node, npm, and JavaScript, copying and pasting or downloading a third-party script (or bundle of scripts) becomes a black box.

I think it's important to support the pro-build folks and the anti-build folks. And, the anti-build folks aren't necessarily JS-naïve; they may instead want to simply invest more time in a scene than searching components, testing components, and settings things up from the command line.

I look at at [`stack.gl`](http://stack.gl/), and even with its learning resources, such as [Shader School](https://github.com/stackgl/shader-school) and [WebGL Workshop](https://github.com/stackgl/webgl-workshop), and I have to stop and wonder why I don't see many folks cranking out WebGL shaders/scenes (or maybe I'm looking in the wrong places). There's also [regl](http://regl.party/) ([source](https://github.com/regl-project/regl)), which seems to be getting some attention.

I have no doubt A-Frame will continue to thrive with its growing ecosystem of components and abundance of developers creating cool scenes.

I just hope the tools aren't getting in the way. I'm not necessarily advocating a "monorepo" (see [this](http://danluu.com/monorepo/), [this](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md), and [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10138946)), but I wonder if there's a way we can ensure that folks can compose scenes easily without having to worry about compatibility and quality (and build-step complexity).

A fair comparison I'd say is assets. There is a wildly active community of artists out there, and you can find some good assets (paid and free), but making sure they work with three.js/A-Frame out of the box requires a lot of manual work. I know there are steps we can take to automate those steps and reduce those stressors. And, I'm excited to introduce tooling to improve that process.

I just question whether scattering components and creating third-party packs improves or complicates the mental model and scaffolding of what A-Frame is, what A-Frame isn't, and when to rely on third-party modules. IMO, ease of scene creation for developers should be the #1 priority, whatever it takes.

So to bring things back, here are some ideas to solve the problems mentioned above:
1. Put non-core components in their own repos in [the `aframevr` org](https://github.com/aframevr/) (à la [hapi.js](https://github.com/hapijs) and [express.js](https://github.com/expressjs)).
2. Pull more and more code out of the `aframevr/aframe` core repo (which is exactly what express.js did over the years).
3. Continue to curate [a community-driven list of "vetted" components](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-components) (with extensive metadata) for easy discovery (and it could be possibly eventually automated).
4. [Maintain easy component management](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector/blob/3dc164f4/src/lib/componentloader.js) from within the [A-Frame Inspector/Editor](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector) (à la Package Control for Sublime Text, with granular flexibility for versioning/searching, etc.).
5. Build a tool like [`esnextbin`](https://esnextb.in/?gist=27fd38f51a4a9303e9c7&execute=true) (or commission the existing tools such as [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/), CodePen, et. al. to properly support A-Frame goodies such as tab completion, snippets, component discovery, etc.).
6. Ensure that there exists awesome A-Frame plugins and snippets (see [this one for Atom](https://github.com/bhuizi/aframe-atom-snippets)) for the commonly used text editors (and possibly IDEs) ([this](https://draculatheme.com/) is possibly a good list to strive for).
 > But, today, devs still have to introduce Node + npm + the command line + Browserify/Webpack + git + GitHub if they want to create, publish, and share a scene with the world.

There's a bit of a tangent with the pro-build vs. anti-build in the entire comment: _build steps are a barrier to adoption_. Firstly, there are no build steps. I don't know why Node + NPM + Browserify are being mentioned, they are by no means required nor are they pushed over normal HTML. Secondly, people have no issue including script tags for extra features, we can see this based on how well `aframe-extras` has been received and been used by even the non-technical. I've seen no evidence that A-Frame or including extra features has been too difficult, and for this issue, pointing from `<a-animation>` to an animation component shouldn't be a large hurdle.

That being said, yeah, we can definitely improve the process. [And we are!](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-components/issues/5) Most of your suggestions sound good, so keep those noted down. 

p.s., `Express` and `Hapi.js` are not good comparisons because they are backend frameworks, adding additional code has no performance tradeoffs for them. If you look at the contrary on popular frontend frameworks, you will see a micro-module approach for non-core features.
 ![ceilingcat](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1848368/18696117/8f6c946a-7f84-11e6-9c90-5a11a4e4a795.png)

I have no strong opinion about whether `<a-animation />` should stay in core, but:

> 1. Put non-core components in their own repos in the aframevr org.

That's beneficial, especially until points 3 and 4 come together. I don't particularly need to sit on `aframe-extras`, and if part(s) of that should be split out somehow I'm open to doing that. With loaders, for example, it's important that those components be consistent. Scattered community-driven loaders make it harder to change things, like adding model animation support.
 Yeah, case-by-case basis we can maybe start introducing non-core components in the `aframevr` repo. That may be physics, loaders, controls, post-processing effects, etc. I think those decisions will come naturally as the needs arise. 
 Right now, I am starting to gather un-published components that I think are useful to re-use (e.g., the sun shader example, A-Painter landscape, reverse look controls drag) in K-Frame. Also I'm making it easy to add new things with auto-generated example pages, README, and component templates. As we learn more from this, we'll get a better idea in the future.
 I'm going to add this to the `0.8.0` milestone, because `animation-mixer` is already there, and these two feel like they should be considered together. But also fine with me if we punt them both to the next version, instead.

EDIT: Actually, bumped to 0.9.0 after talking to dmarcos. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3518  https://github.com/nolanlawson/optimize-js

Provides hints for JS engines for optimized parse speed.  Most notably a massive speed improvement for Three.js, our underlying technology.
 Thanks to @AdaRoseEdwards for finding this!
 See https://github.com/nolanlawson/optimize-js#benchmarks and https://nolanlawson.github.io/optimize-js/. Would be interesting to test an optimize-js three.js build and measure. Additionally, it'd be cool if we created an A-Frame benchmark they could include on that list.
 Will just leave as is. Don't know if the extra build step is worth it and can come with surprises. It doesn't look to be maintained nor adopted.  Hi @s1mar – we'd be glad to help with your question, but could you [repost it to Stack Overflow with the "aframe" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe)? To get good answer, it would also be great if you could include more about what you mean by "hotspot functionality", and any code you've got so far.

We ask for questions to be put on Stack Overflow for a couple reasons: (1) new SO questions are automatically posted in Slack, so they get attention more quickly, and (2) answers on SO are easier for others to find, so your question can help others learn A-Frame too.
 Posted here:

Closing this and we'll focus on the S/O post.
 Will do. Thanks!
 https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/guides/building-with-components.html
 @Carpetsmoker thanks!

@ngokevin @darkwing Based on the clarification, I guess the question would be a duplicate of [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36499971/aframe-io-creating-hyperlinks-and-download-links/36956240#36956240). I'm not sure how to flag it as such. Or we could fill out the question/response for a 'hotspot' that triggers events when the camera enters an area, which has been asked several times before.

@s1mar Sorry, again I don't know what you mean without more details and a demo. The `rotation` component is where you would start. You might also see the code for the [look-controls](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/look-controls.js) component, which uses discrete pitch/yaw/roll to track camera orientation.
 The documentation and the guide linked above and the school all teach exactly how to add hotspots to a panorama.   @terryleee your best bet would be to show a loading effect using HTML/CSS, an image, or whatever you want, and then to hide that effect when the `loaded` event fires:

``` javascript
loadingEl.classList.add('visible');
sceneEl.addEventListener('loaded', function () {
  loadingEl.classList.remove('visible');
});
```

If that isn't doing what you need, could you post this question with additional details to the [A-Frame tag on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe)? We can generally give more helpful answers there. Thanks!
 Appears to have been re-asked here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39586429/how-can-i-add-a-loading-effect-before-all-assets-are-loaded
  Missed this question. Do you want to render in stereoscopic without VR capabilities, or are you interested in using accelerometers and gyroscopes of a Raspberry Pi? Can you explain the use case more?
 The code that determines whether to use VREffect is `if (checkHeadsetConnected() || this.isMobile)`. 

`checkHeadsetConnected` ultimately depends on having a `VRDisplay` https://w3c.github.io/webvr/#interface-vrdisplay and setting the orientation to something that's not a zero vector.

Hacky way is to set `document.querySelector('a-scene').isMobile` to `true` and remove the orientation modal overlay. 

You can check how the WebVR polyfill does it too https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill which does it for smartphones, you can do something similar for the Pi.
 Leave this open for maybe an API to force stereo rendering.
 I'd stand with just hacking it and set `isMobile` to cheat it It was a hack that might have worked just by coincidence, not a feature we were supporting. What is the use case for stereo rendering in desktop without a headset?  The position of the camera is going to be similar in VR and 2D mode. What value do you extract from stereo rendering and distortion without a headset? What kind of content are you developing? Mono rendering is usually enough for object positioning. There is a Web extension that simulate VR hardware (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webvr-api-emulation/gbdnpaebafagioggnhkacnaaahpiefil?hl=en) for that purpose. @skrichten Can you be more specific about your use case? Why is mono rendering not accurate enough for testing? Can you present on VR hardware from an Electron context? This is not a trivial feature to implement and maintain over time. I’m just trying to understand the problem we are trying to solve. @skrichten What headsets are you supporting? Distortion and field of view are hardware specific. If you want accuracy you would need to exactly simulate the characteristics of heach headset. Random or generic stereo rendering and distortion won’t solve your problem if what you need is precision. Also notice that WebVR is only available on Chrome Canary behind a flag. I have no experience with Electron and how they update the version of Chromium / Blink they ship. Chrome only supports Vive at the moment. You can use Firefox but you cannot then use Electron. There’s nothing I know of that simulates hardware if accuracy is what you need. You mention you want to simulate a static camera position. Just make sure that the approach is useful since we people are never completely static. The fine adjustments you do assuming a static point of view might not be perceived by a real user. I would recommend to test on real hardware if accuracy is a top priority for you.   Try `play/pauseSound()` or pause/play the audio element

.play/.pause are callback methods
 Cool, changing the issue to improve our docs.
 Perhaps this is deserving of its own issue, and let me know, and I can file.

When I was dealing with some scenes in the past, I wanted to just mute all sounds on all the entities in the scene. [Here was my hacky solution.](https://github.com/MozVR/oculus/blob/e73ea2c8/assets/js/common.js#L20-L85)

If there's already a component that handles this, awesome! If not, can we introduce it into core (e.g., `AFRAME.sounds.mute()` or something)? Or, if folks feel it should be a third-party component (even one under the `aframevr` org), what would it look like? (I assume my [approach](https://github.com/MozVR/oculus/blob/e73ea2c8/assets/js/common.js#L20-L85) above is not a good one to evangelize. I kept hitting issues, and that hacked-up mess is what I arrived at.)

I see this issue is being repurposed to improve the docs. Regardless of the componentisation/functionality point above, can we also document how to pause all sounds in a scene?
 Loop over the sounds

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1083 will make it marginally easier
 done
  thanks for approriately addressing this issue
  Perfect, thanks!
  Hi, thanks for filing. We made a tradeoff between resolution and working around a canvas resizing issue.

This should be cleared in iOS 10. Here's a workaround (with disadvantages): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39305663/why-is-a-frame-0-3-0-resolution-low/39305668#39305668
  Hi, could you try again? You added another line instead of modifying the existing one.
  Thanks for the prefix-removal information, might have to update some information. In `<a-assets>`, we automatically fix up all tags with `crossorigin`, we could do something similar for playsinline.
 > The same technique can be used to render into a WebGL context. Note in this example that a user gesture–the click event–is required, as the <video> element is not in the DOM, and thus is not visible. 

So maybe need a click or pin-to-homescreen still?
 > Thanks for the prefix-removal information, might have to update some information. In `<a-assets>`, we automatically fix up all tags with `crossorigin`, we could do something similar for playsinline.

we already do for `webkitplaysinline` [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/a578f6fd/src/systems/material.js#L282) and [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/a578f6fd/src/systems/material.js#L317). just need to now add another attribute for `playsinline`.

the click-to-play policies previously existed before iOS 10. and those were tracked in a separate issue (#316), but it was decided that a third-party component would could be responsible for introducing a "play" button if we detect any video or audio on the page. see these comments too: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/316#issuecomment-212608703
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/316#issuecomment-219181039

I'd recommend just adding the `webkit-playsinline` attribute in `material.js` where we are already setting `playsinline`. And then file a separate issue for the "play button" for autoplay media that requires a user-initiated action. Keep in mind that not every browser on iOS has this restriction; I don't expect Safari for iOS 10 to change, but Chrome may and [Firefox will](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ios/pull/1651).
 @caraya Thanks! Are we ok in iOS now then? :) try using a different video codec. you can use [`ffmpeg`](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide) to do that:

```sh
ffmpeg -i IMG_1040.MOV img_1040.mp4
```

btw, which platform are you testing this with? @pdnellius can you link me to your video source so I can take a look? oh, yeah, you're probably hitting this [CORS bug on WebKit/Safari](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135379). I've got some code that I'll be making a PR to `aframe` for that works, but, again, it's just a workaround. it is a known, and unfortunate, WebKit bug.
 That CORS workaround is only functional for MP4, not HLS for example (and may force entire MP4 loading rather than streaming, which may be problematic in some cases?) @machenmusik have you tried using MPEG-DASH instead of HLS? it's supported on iOS Safari. HLS is going to be deprecated anyway. Last I tried (not super recently) DASH did not play with iOS 10 mobile safari... do you have a working example? What error do you see on iOS? The CORS error in the console, or something different? you need user gesture to trigger media playback that has audio when using mobile safari, and gaze selection doesn't count as a user gesture to the browser, you need touch event or touch-generated click > I'm not sure if this is directly related to this issue, but I'm having trouble triggering audio on iOS devices. I'm listening for click events that play audio assets. I'm curious is anyone else is having a similar issue on iOS devices or if you know of a solution?

which audio codec is the sound encoded with? if you're listening for `click` events, the user-gesture requirement should be met. can you share a URL of your project?
  thanks!
  Maybe because the default camera is created after the scene is loaded...to check for existing cameras.

There is an event: `camera-set-active`. Does that help?
 A bit hard to follow all these callbacks (our fault!). So you can't move code outside the `loaded` callback and into the `camera-set-active` callback?
 You can check for `nodeready` which is emitted after attach...but ideally we shouldn't have to do that. If you write your code within components/systems, you should be assured that everything has been set up. I think I'd need full code to give more helpful guidance though.
 Is it feasible to remove invocations of `init()` from inside `setAttribute()`? This also bit me in #1900. 

Another option, specific to this issue, might be some scene-level config to prevent injection of default cameras.
 Maybe we can also let it look for `data-aframe-camera`...?
  ``` js
<a-entity id="parent" geometry="primitive: plane; width: 0.1; height: 0.1;rotation:0 0 0" position="0 -1 -1" material="src: #menu_hamburger; shader: flat; transparent:true; depth: 1; opacity: 1">
  <a-animation begin="mouseenter" attribute="material.src" from="#menu_hamburger" to="#menu_mais" dur="1000"></a-animation>
  <a-animation attribute="material.opacity" begin="mouseenter" to="0.5" dur="100"></a-animation>
  <a-animation attribute="material.opacity" begin="click" to="0" dur="100"></a-animation>
  <a-animation attribute="material.opacity" begin="mouseleave" to="1" dur="100"></a-animation>
</a-entity>
```
 Try this https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-event-set-component for setting things in response to events when you don't need to tween.
  I don't think I understand the Slack discussion, but components emit events on their element, so this works for any component:

``` javascript
el.addEventListener('mouseleave', function () {
  // do stuff.
});
```

OTOH `cursor-hovering` is a state, not an event, but the `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` events should tell you when it could have changed. You can check an element for a state with:

``` javascript
el.is('cursor-hovering') ? 'yep' : 'nope'
```

@cvan was your comment in Slack saying that maybe state changes should fire independent events, e.g. `statechange`?
 I think there's a stateadded / stateremoved event on the entity
  thanks!
  That'd be weird since if you stare at something, it'd keep clicking it.

you can copy/paste the cursor component to customize it though https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/cursor.js
  Made this for now: https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/reverse-look-controls
  thanks!
  I cannot reproduce this on A-Frame 0.5.0 and iOS 10.3.1. Please reopen if this is still an issue.  thanks!
  Not sure. A-Frame doesn't depend on .VOX though, and suggested exports from MagicaVoxel is OBJ (or at least PLY).
  what's this for?
  Not quite possible, at least it won't be out of the box: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36298195/how-to-render-youtube-videos-as-a-texture-in-a-frame?s=1|5.0516
  bounce isn't a valid easing function, you have to prefix with ease-in or ease-out or ease-in-out
  Thanks for reporting this. In principle the rendered size  when entering VR should be the one reported by the webvr API. More preciscely `vrDisplay.getEyeParameters`. This is managed by `VREffect`. I need to check how the window size is influencing the renderer size
 This also reproduces on Firefox Nightly  I think the bug that causde the regression is that the cursor is listening for the wrong event names `raycaster-intersection` and `raycaster-intersection-cleared`. Replacing those with `intersection` and `intersactioncleared` should fix the problem

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/cursor.js#L53
 Nevermind. Disregard. I was looking at 0.2.0 :)
 There are a couple of failing tests
 addressed at:
- https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/e4900e16ea9228af39d2a4fef6798393e79bd82a
- https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/37c33d2cc88de369feff7027f3d1e24b305ef496
  If you use 0.3.0 stable, then #899 shouldn't apply. Are you using master or stable 0.3.0?
 I see. Will think about how to resolve that.

You can do a workaround by using entities.

`<a-entity geometry="primitive: plane" material>`

When you are ready, set the material src:

`el.setAttribute('material', 'src', 'url(myvideo.mp4)');`
 This was introduced in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1789

Need to update that code to not error if there's not a `src`
 Fixed thanks
  Can you PR to rstats: https://github.com/spite/rstats to add a **class** to those under/over-threshold fields? That way we don't have to hack the JS file and apply through CSS
  Thanks!
  We bumped the webvr-polyfill which had some issues with iOS. There is currently a bug in iOS Safari related to canvas resizing such that if we had it at full resolution, VR mode would look broken until you turned the phone. This should be fixed in iOS 10, so we told A-Frame to give it full resolution for iOS 10 Safari.

If you want full resolution (but it will look broken until you turn the phone), you can set `window.WebVRConfig = {'BUFFER_SCALE': 1}` before you include A-Frame.
  You can remove the `look-controls`.

Just define `<a-entity camera>` without look-controls
  nice catch
  everything else looks good
  Is the funcionality equivalent?
 We use the ghpages script across the boilerplate, most published components in the ecosystem use it, and I use it for my projects too. So it's good, thanks!
  Seems like we could also assert the URL now for good measure: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1864/files#diff-4f03fc30c4b0a8c6c5d3703fc9d6e58aR29
 The `<script>` tag would still be there and not destroyed right? We can tear it down in the test teardown.
  needs unit tests
 thanks!
 FWIW, I opened a PR about `postMessage`-ing data in #1487. probably not necessary any time soon, but I can see the query-string parameters getting messy over time.
 query string params for stats would've been useful in several cases when i wanted to showcase scenes that had stats on.
 Test added.
 Where are `queryStrings` documented? I agree with @cvan. It is a slippery slope to sprinkle queryParameter based switches all over the place. Is there a way to make it component agnostic and self contained by having a `queryParameter` component?
 IMO, the behavior should be contained within the component. I don't think it's a slippery slope, having query params here isn't going to encourage us to have query params in other components. We have some precedent on not trying to anticipate. To date, we only have two: `stats` + `vr-mode-ui`. We'd document the behavior from within the relevant component.

Though alternatively, you could have an agnostic component that detaches/attaches components based on query parameters. Something like `queryparam-detach="component: stats; queryParam: stats"`. I don't like this as much because it's more API, more default components to add, and it's indirect.
 What about going with a strictly `postMessage` API? Seems lightweight and changing the settings wouldn't cause a page refresh. Or if we don't want to go there yet, use hashes (since those won't reload the page upon changing, but you can listen for `hashchange`).
 postMessage is for I-Frames and is more complex. My use case is just when someone publishes a scene with stats on, I want to share it with stats off. We don't need dynamic change of the settings here, don't think we're gonna be toggling the stats on and off across origins. And also web pages should only have one hash, giving it functionality for stats makes things odd. 
 > postMessage is for I-Frames and is more complex.

`postMessage` is not necessarily for iframes. can be used for these following use cases:
- a document can `postMessage` to itself
- a scene can `postMessage` to another scene
- a Web Worker can `postMessage` to scene(s)
- a Service Worker can `postMessage` to scene(s)

> And also web pages should only have one hash, giving it functionality for stats makes things odd.

Do you think that will hold true? Already the author of the [`aframe-href-component`](https://github.com/gasolin/aframe-href-component/blob/e1e49f3/basic/anchor.html#L16) is using a hash to jump to an entity in the scene. How would you load https://gasolin.github.io/aframe-href-component/basic/anchor.html#blue-cube and disable stats if we're assuming a "single hash"?

I don't have a perfect solution in mind, but I think it'd be more future-proof, extensible, and user-friendly to introduce a `postMessage`-based solution and introduce a method on the `AFRAME` global, such as `AFRAME.stats.disable()` - which would disable stats and store a value in `localStorage` to disable stats upon subsequent page loads.

(Related: For the [eleVR Web Player](https://github.com/hawksley/eleVR-Web-Player#ability-to-load-external-video-urls-via-query-string-hash-postmessage), I introduced a few (albeit complicated but versatile options) for configuring the player without having to write a bunch of boilerplate code.)
 RE: postMessage use cases. None of those have anything to do with stats. I mentioned I-Frames because I assumed that was your use case.

> How would you load https://gasolin.github.io/aframe-href-component/basic/anchor.html#blue-cube and disable stats if we're assuming a "single hash"?

I wouldn't, which is why I'm in favor of using queryparams and not hashes as you proposed `use hashes`.

> I don't have a perfect solution in mind, but I think it'd be more future-proof, extensible, and user-friendly to introduce a postMessage-based solution and introduce a method on the AFRAME global, such as AFRAME.stats.disable() - which would disable stats and store a value in localStorage to disable stats upon subsequent page loads.

Don't see why all this over a queryparam. I think we're missing why we're introducing a flag to disable stats. If a developer wanted to disable stats on their own, they would just remove it, they wouldn't call a global method. The use case is to disable stats when the developer has set it and we want to showcase it without.
 > Don't see why all this over a queryparam.

what do you mean by `all this`? as I'd expect in any other PR, I think we can agree it's fair to question additions to the codebase, regardless of the seeming size or scope of the change.

> I think we're missing why we're introducing a flag to disable stats. If a developer wanted to disable stats on their own, they would just remove it, they wouldn't call a global method. The use case is to disable stats when the developer has set it and we want to showcase it without.

apologies, either the past conversation I think got truncated here, or I was just getting confused between PRs (as this is over three weeks old now).

> If a developer wanted to disable stats on their own, they would just remove it, they wouldn't call a global method. The use case is to disable stats when the developer has set it and we want to showcase it without.

what do you mean by "showcase"? do you mean fire up the URL of an A-Frame scene, manually/automatically take a video/GIF/screenshot? or do  you mean link to a URL from our "showcase" (i.e., the A-Frame Blog or from Twitter)?

in any case, I would imagine that we would want to normalise all the presentation of the page (meaning disable stats UI, debug mode, cursor style of `<body>`, hide the VR goggles/any other button UI). if that's what we're going for, I would recommend instead of having a one-off for `stats` (which as @dmarcos says could be a slippery slope), perhaps what we want instead is a `presentation` mode? thoughts?
 > what do you mean by all this? 

I was questioning the complexity of the solution (which actually doesn't solve the problem).

> what do you mean by "showcase"?

Both

> in any case, I would imagine that we would want to normalize all the presentation of the page...could be a slippery slope

The only thing we currently desire is the ability to disable stats. Debug mode has no visual effect, don't had a need for cursor style customization, don't have a need for hiding the goggles. I don't imagine a slippery slope, adding a query parameter here is not going to encourage other uses, it's just the simplest solution that effectively solves the problem so we can move on.
 Any more thoughts on his?  Just want to keep it moving....
 I'd r+ it, but making sure everyone's OK with it. Simple use case, simple solution, should be cut/dry.
 go ahead
  There's a currently a PR open to swap to BrowserSync. Will close in favor of that: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1671
  Thanks, should we just use that video on desktop too?
 I see, thanks. I suppose the proper API might be something like:

```
<a-assets>
  <video id="city"></video>
  <video id="cityMobile></video>
</a-assets>

<a-videosphere degrading-src="desktopSrc: #city; mobileSrc: #cityMobile"></a-videosphere>
```

where degrading-src is a component...although it's a lot to bend backwards just for iOS. I wonder if we should just document the limitations and move on
 Thanks, will keep that issue to have that example swap to mobile using a component and/or just wait for iOS 10.
  Crap, thanks.
 Here's a workaround:

``` js
AFRAME.registerComponent('gearvr-height-fix', {
  dependencies: ['position'],

  init: function () {
    if (!AFRAME.utils.isGearVR()) { return; }
    var position = this.el.getComputedAttribute('position');
    position.y += 1.6;
    this.el.setAttribute('position', position);
  }
});
```

``` html
<a-entity gearvr-height-fix>
  <a-camera></a-camera>
</a-entity>
```
 @poshaughnessy Fixed to call `isGearVR()` correctly. 

Will get around to a proper fix.
  brave enough for a test? i spent a lot of today testing look-controls, would be great to have a start on wasd-controls. i'd mimic https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1853/files#diff-387522ff670c30773ff46795b9f7dc84R7 where tests are in `core/controls.test.js` and we integration test using the default camera.
 could use a small test
 I was writing a test for this today, it kept failing, so upon further review I don't think this is needed due to @ngokevin's recent PR and this line: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1904/files#diff-6231789e7e7fac0fbea47834d09b3bdcR56

Let me know if I'm wrong but I think this can be closed.
 Cool. Thanks. I was just writing the tests to accompany the look-controls and guess I accidentally did this too.
  Thanks, if you catch any `you`s in a guide, we could make it consistent.
 This should be good for review @ngokevin 
 Still a few "you"s instead of "we"s
 The remaining "you"'s are appropriate -- they reference the user making future scenes, not the scenes we're making in the guide.
  Thanks, we can apply the same to the other couple parts
  Thanks for the feedback. Those events should be provided by an external component. They are out of the scope for aframe core. 
  Thanks for catching this.

The `obj-model` component has an initialization dependency on the `material` component. But it seems that it's not being honored?
 fixed
  We can get full coverage if we also test the `remove` (detached) callback. This should remove the event listener when the components is detached (with `removeAttribute`).
 Thanks!!
  I found some stuff here: https://github.com/bfred-it/iphone-inline-video

I wonder if you need to add `muted` to get it to play without user interaction?
 Hm, they should both follow down the same code path. plane/sphere shouldn't make a difference.

What if it's just one video? And does the city.mp4 video play on desktop? What if we try to play `#video1` on the videosphere?
 Thanks for the investigation. We should re-encode our example video and document the restrictions.
 Will keep the issue around for now to do those couple tasks.
 FWIW, I already fixed this in `master` in PR #2656. are y'all referring to something else?

After a lot of trial and error, the command I used was this:

```js
ffmpeg -i city.mp4 -vf scale=3168:-2 city-3168.mp4
```
  thanks!
  **Description:**

With an extended deprecation period for the src type. 'asset' reinforces the relationship to a-assets and is less vague / more descriptive compared to 'src'. 
- A-Frame Version:
- Platform/Device:
- Reproducible Code Snippet or Demo URL [highly encouraged]:
 `<img>` is a type of asset within `<a-assets>` so it related. I'd intend to only have one property type, but giving time for deprecation.
 It's supposed to map to the concepts of assets, not 'src' which is a string. And 'src' in context of property types is not immediately obvious. 

Note this is only for property type name in schema, not the attribute name 'map: {type: 'asset'}'
 Hi! Again, this is for the name of the internal property type, not the name of the HTML attribute.
  I got it working in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1845

I wonder if it's a component initialization order issue.
 fixed
  Thanks!
  thanks!
  Thanks, I agree, it needs an iteration. I'm trying to get more boilerplates into the repo each with a guide so this guide will be de-emphasized.
 thanks, we've just remove that section since we had a patch that makes it no longer necessary.

i will try to get a guide some time about detailed case studies on writing different kinds of components
  I have tested these updates fairly extensively. Failed to update three to 0.79 because of failing tests on textures and material
 Thanks! I;m not in favor to update dependencies if there's not a reason too. There can be a lot of subtle bugs. I for example spent too much time chasing viewport problems with the webvr-polyfill
 Update three.js dependency is definitively due.
 I believe dependency update has to be deliberate: why do we want to update?
 @dmarcos Better to do it now than later. As aframe is running for 0.4.0 many new futures will be added! Right? As currently there are long time warnings for some deps. about to become deprecated. while now you already see warnings that your deps will stop working since their deps will not be included in future releases etc. I find that this is a must that at the beginning of next version roadmap you update your deps and solve any exposed issues before you start building new futures on top of something which may not work anymore when you finally to the update. Another point here is that webvr and aframe are cutting edge therefore should not take to easy keeping deps up to date. Quality of Aframe can suffer in long term. Can't say that this will happen, but risk factor it is for sure. For example it was known after three 79 came out that Aframe has issues with it, but so far nothing has been done to fix that while three is nr 1 dep. I don't know if that makes any sense to you and do you get what I'm worried about, but I shared my opinion anyway :). And I totally understand your point ex with polyfill, but can that be as excuse not to update nevre again or if then when everything craches?
 And if you have solid plan how to track that need of dep update, based on what to consider when to update - then please share. It would be useful info.
 > As currently there are long time warnings for some deps. about to become deprecated. while now you already see warnings that your deps will stop working since their deps will not be included in future releases etc. 

@mkungla What warnings are you referring to?
 > I find that this is a must that at the beginning of next version roadmap you update your deps and solve any exposed issues before you start building new futures on top of something which may not work anymore when you finally to the update.

Dependencies like `object-assign`,  `promise-polyfill` or `style-attr` play a very specific role and they fulfilled their function flawlessly. Why fixing what it's not broken and expose us to possible regressions or carrying additional features we don't need? A library increasing a version number does not mean that there are less bugs than the previous version or regressions have not been introduced. 
 Can we change this PR to just update `three.js` and evaluate each dependency individually. For the `devDependencies` I'm not that worried if we make sure that they work on Windows.
 i'm on gihub mobile at the moment and can't tell from head right now. Im back online within 3-4 h and can check then. But you can see by your self by installing aframe and (verbose) output of npm speaks for it self.
 Sure lets to three then.
 @dmarcos 
So I revert then all, but devDependencies?

> Can we change this PR to just update three.js

Sure, but which version? `0.77.1` which has been tested and working or `0.78 , 0.79` which exposes some issues and requires to fix blocking issues with `textures`.

> and evaluate each dependency individually

That lives here for a while #1635
 @mkungla can we move the devDependencies to a different PR?
 sure, how is it going to be then with three? 0.77.1?
 @mkungla anything wrong with 0.80.0?
 Yes, as build finishes and fails, Check the build logs. These failures are with three  >= 0.78
 @dmarcos I guess we have to start digging into these issues first and reference each issue to this PR?
 @mkungla Yeah, it seems something is different with the `THREE.TextureLoader`. We have to investigate what has changed. Thanks for looking into this.
 This has been done. Thanks though! We still need r82.
  thanks!
    Fixed by @cvan, thanks!
 Also see #316 and https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/introduction/faq.html#why-does-my-video-not-play-on-mobile for more info.
  Uses `event.code` in browsers that implement it, which is layout-agnostic and should consistently correspond to the physical locations of the WASD keys, not their letter-equivalents.

Also adds <kbd>←</kbd><kbd>→</kbd><kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd> for good measure.

Would understand if we don't want to merge this while #1248 is still open, but this seems like a nice-to-have for users outside the U.S.

Fixes #333, #1409, and #1490.
 Thanks!
  Nit that's been bugging me, in both Sublime and Atom I have JSHint plugins configured that automatically apply the nearest .jshintrc. In A-Frame's case there's nothing to indicate that `require()` and `module.exports` are allowed, so they're flagged:

![screen shot 2016-08-19 at 11 34 19 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1848368/17828631/a4c837e8-6665-11e6-9345-3df55229248c.png)
 Same here has bugging me too with Atom
  @darkwing **Steps to reproduce** is definitely needed info in many cases. Besides that I find really useful how [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/new) new issue templates are.

So even if you find a bug in `Windows`, `Chrome`, `Aframe 0.2.0` and I test it and get same bug in `Linux`, `FF`, `Aframe 0.3.1` then adding these gives better overview about extent of issue.

But I don't know what others think about that. @ngokevin , @dmarcos ?
If there is something else to be considered to add into new issue template perhaps you can add it to this PR.
 Most cases we can track down the issue given a simple description. In the contributing guide, it mentions a test case as optional/extra.
 Is it fair to replace the text with?
`Reproducible Code Snippet or Demo URL [highly encouraged]:`
If someone does not have the time to provide the test case... Do we prefer them not to file the issue?
 Thanks!
  thanks!!
  Let's not commit the dist
 Would you have time to add some unit tests in `src/tests/shaders/standard.test.js`? Unit tests for setting each kind of map and wrap type? If not, I can help out. 
 Looking good, thanks! If you rebase the PR, the Codecov errors should go away.
 Also think it'd be good to put your example scene in `examples/test`
 We can do that now or later ^ your call
 Sorry, one more thing. Is it possible to get coverage for spherical maps after post-load?

 Hm, okay. We can do that when we add coverage for envMaps in general (as well as a bit of refactor) later on.
 We merged a patch to normalize carriage returns and line feeds. Might be easy to start from master and copy paste your code on. @mkungla might have tips for rebasing
 @AdaRoseEdwards what files do you have conflicts with? Try to replace windows endlines with unix end lines in those files. Commit in your branch and rebase again
 Whe I said commit I meant ammend... @AdaRoseEdwards I'm happy to help if you need
 Trying setting `git config --global core.autocrlf true`
 @AdaRoseEdwards your ~~last~~ commit went wrong since your merged `master` branch was behind `aframevr/master` 
1. revert this last commit 

``` sh
git checkout standard-material
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push -f origin standard-material
```
1. Make sure you have one `git remote` pointing to `aframevr/master`

``` sh
git remote -v
#should give you output something like this
origin  git@github.com:AdaRoseEdwards/aframe.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:AdaRoseEdwards/aframe.git (push)
upstream    git@github.com:aframevr/aframe.git (fetch)
upstream    git@github.com:aframevr/aframe.git (push)
```

if you don't have any remote pointing to `git@github.com:aframevr/aframe.git`
then add it 

``` sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:aframevr/aframe.git
```

then update your forks master, as I see you have also there one conflicting commit "Add more physical maps to stadard material" back this code up and revert this commit as well

``` sh
git checkout master
git reset --hard~1
git push -f origin master
```

Now you can rebase your master

``` sh
gir fetch --all #do get info from both remotes
git rebase upstream/master
git push -f origin master
```

Now your fork master is in sync with aframe master and you can rebase/merge with your other branches
 #67e1ecd worked and can be squashed when merging but good idea to sort out your fork anyway :)
 @dmarcos lgtm
  Main purpose is to fix mixed linefeeds and have cleaner
master branch by flaging some files as binary so that git
won't create unnecessary big diff objects. Related to #1586, #1658
This is necessary so that added .gitattributes
could be dealt same as regular PR's and would not affect
new clones. No action needed by Collaborators since together with
second commit including fixed line feeds this PR can be treated as regular!
Some currently open PR's may need rebase with this commit if PR's
if PR have common files fixed with this PR.
 After merge only thing to do is to bump new dist!
  You can use the CubeCamera from three.js: http://threejs.org/docs/api/cameras/CubeCamera.html

And something like grabbing the render output from a renderer using the camera: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15558418/how-do-you-save-an-image-from-a-three-js-canvas

I haven't done this yet so I don't have specifics. But you can definitely research, and it would be cool to see someone do it.
 Relevant links:
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/record-almost-everything-in-the-browser-with-mediarecorder/
https://mozdevs.github.io/MediaRecorder-examples/

Could easily build an A-Frame component using the `MediaRecorder` API (in very few lines too).
 I think this is for 360 recording or recording from an external in-scene camera, rather than a screencap.
  Thanks!
  https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-animation-component might respond to updates
 I've been trying to maintain https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation more, but I haven't fully finished my most recent update. We've deprecated a-animation. Try https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation and file issues, and component will be merged in in the future.

The component will respond to updates  Using something like [`markserv`](https://github.com/f1lt3r/markserv) as a dev dependency.

So you don't have to stand up both the `aframe-site` repo _and_ this `aframe` repo.

A very nice-to-have (but, of course, low-priority) feature.
 sounds good
  Thanks!
  Can we consistency-tize it the other way?
 I'd already been slowly moving it towards without spaces. I think spaces make them look like if or function blocks, and we don't have spaces for arrays.

 This one is risky. I would postpone this post 0.3.0
  In order to use "powerful APIs," your site must be served from a "secure origin" - that is, be served over TLS or `http://localhost:*`/`http://127.0.*.*` (see [this](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features and [this]%28https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/%29 and [this]%28https://github.com/w3c/webvr/issues/60%29, etc. for more context).

It's worth noting that WebVR is not a "powerful API" just yet, but already today some APIs such as are already a hassle to use (door-hanger permission prompts spamming on every API request/page load in Firefox or disabled in Chrome). Example: `navigator.getUserMedia` with Firefox over HTTP won't persist the "allowed" notification (only for HTTPS), and the API is already outright deprecated for external IPs/non-HTTPS origins in Chrome.

There's an easy way to create a self-signed cert from an `npm command`: https://github.com/cvan/webvr-holodeck/blob/6581527/package.json#L9

It's worth noting that `budo` offers this out of the box now: https://github.com/mattdesl/budo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#900

Relevant to issue #1277, which is being handled in PR #1671… also good news is that BrowserSync also already supports HTTPS out of the box (just set `https: true` in the options). (And here's the relevant script: https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync/blob/master/lib/server/certs/gen.sh)
 Merging with https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1277

Though I am not sure why we need SSL for localhost since APIs will allow access to localhost, but #1277 will solve anyways. There's a PR open https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1671 Although `http://localhost` and `http://127.1.x.x` are whitelisted as "secure origins" in Chrome and Firefox, if you need to test on mobile devices or dedicated remote devices (Google Daydream/Cardboard, Gear VR with Samsung Internet/Carmel, dedicated Windows machine for VR), you must load a URL on your LAN (e.g., `http://10.0.1.59:9000`) and load the scene in the headset.

Additionally, when testing a WebVR site (without ngrok/localtunnel/self-signed HTTPS), any WebVR site loaded in Chrome for Daydream injects a "This site is not secure" window that persists directly in front of you in VR (for the entire duration of the VR session); it's really the worst.

Unfortunately, when serving over a non-secure origin, most browsers won't let you use APIs such as Service Workers, `getUserMedia`, Speech Recognition/Synthesis, `devicemotion`, etc.
 (Chrome tends to be stricter in [its secure-origin policy](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features), but Firefox, Safari, and Edge all have similar documented and enforced policies.)

I've looked at several projects/boilerplate/starter kits; unfortunately, most of them have quite convoluted instructions for setting up HTTPS (because it's intentionally difficult to generate self-signed certs [especially wildcard ones] and get the browser + OS to accept them, especially on macOS).

Possible solutions that come to mind:

* Recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (which returns both `http` and `https` URLs).
* Consider creating a boilerplate using BrowserSync (which is a nice `npm` local dev server that has a bunch of cool recipes, including easy HTTPS, built-in `localtunnel` support, and live-reloading).
* Document instructions for self-signed SSL certs and serving HTTPS.
    * Somewhere in the docs for local development (and for any A-Frame boilerplates that run locally, such as [this one](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-boilerplate/)), we could link to [budō's docs on HTTPS](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo/blob/master/docs/command-line-usage.md#ssl-and-https).
 OK. I had a section on ngrok in the School, and I can add it to the Getting Started some time. Since the entry point is starting to be more and more Glitch, that will help as well. awesome - thanks! 👍  also, great work on the Glitch boilerplates. very excited to be able to do more development from my Chromebook. 💻  😺   **Description:**

Workaround for [Webkit bug on iOS Safari < 10](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152556).
### Before

Upon Entering VR from landscape without orientation change:

### After

Stereo now sized correctly, at the cost of decreased resolution. With the version check, this should automatically be addressed once people upgrade to iOS 10 as the Webkit patch rolls out.

![img_3575](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/674727/17687931/92350a14-632e-11e6-9d0e-278b66cab73f.PNG)
 I have to try this tomorrow on my iphone 6 Plus that has `devicePixelRatio === 3`
 The canvas size gets fixed when turning the phone to portrait and back to landscape. Is avoiding that glitch more important than keeping the high resolution? 
 I think so, I don't think it's acceptable that people (not developers) have to know to rotate their phone back and forth. Many would think it was just broken and leave. With the version check, trying to have it automatically be addressed once iOS 10 starts rolling out.

I'll change it to `1 / window.devicePixelRatio` then for iPhone Plus.
 Yes, I confirm we need `1 / window.devicePixelRatio` to make it work on the iphone6 Plus

  **Description:**
- [x] wait for travis to see if it works
## **Changes proposed:**

  It is due to the use of `MutationObserver` in the `registerElement` polyfill. Default lights are first added to the scene and immediately removed by the light system when the scene lights initialize.  By the time the `attachedCallback` method is called for the default lights `parentNode === null` due to have been removed. The solution is postponing the default light creation until the scene has loaded and prevent the spurious default lights. This also makes the light and camera systems consistent.
 @FrederickDesimpel yeah! good point! I'm going to make some changes to adjust.

`updateHeightOffset` was not taking into account mobile.

**Changes proposed:**
- Simplify by removing `updateHeightOffset` since `addHeightOffset` can handle it if `oldData` is passed in.

- Should not have to do `addHeightOffset` on exit VR now since `restoreCameraPose` handles that.

All of our docs and guides are in `docs/`. It would be cool to have a script check grammar/typos across all the docs.

Examples:
- https://github.com/robinvdvleuten/gingerbread
- Prose checkers: https://github.com/btford/write-good / https://github.com/ngokevin/engrish
 @Coder206 go for it
 I have feeling that should not be as part of `npm start` (`npm run dev`) .
Seeing that more as independent script which maybe executed as  part of `npm run precommit`, but that's just a thought.
 [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) is also quite good
 Grammarly is a browser extension, we're looking for something we can run as a script on our files
 I know, was just suggesting it because I know a lot of companies and schools use it (so it's probably decent). I've used it with some luck a few times. As for automated scripts, I saw the one you wrote, which is cool, and I'm sure there are many, many others out there. I'm sure y'all have done your research. I found these links, if they're of any help:

https://github.com/mrmarbles/wordsworth
https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/proposed-changes/spellcheck-api
http://codepen.io/aecend/pen/rOebQq
 thanks for the research. so far i think gingerbread looks the most complete, although it relies on an external service. most of our doc typos so far have been grammatical in nature rather than spelling
 Thanks for experimenting! Maybe we can trim code snippets?

```
var gingerbread = require('gingerbread');

var text = readFileSync('blah.md', 'utf-8').contents;
cleanedText = removeCodeSnippets(file);

gingerbread(cleanedText, function (error, text, result, corrections) {
  // result contains 'The smell of flowers brings back memories.'
});
```

This includes inline code blocks (separated by backticks) as well as entire code blocks (separated by triple backticks).
 Yeah, and the YAML headers. And links. It will take some fine tuning, but would be useful to many other projects too.

 there's an edit button at bottom of docs that makes it super simple in case you didn't catch it
  We mention it at:

https://aframe.io/docs/master/guide/device-and-platform-support.html

and I believe the new FAQ will lead to this page as well. I deferred to caniuse and iswebvrready because the browser support will be changing outside of the scope of A-Frame.
 Although just briefly. I suppose I could highlight it more with a Browser Support section
 Heard that  WebVR API will  be put into [caniuse](http://caniuse.com/). It would be difficult to maintaining own browser list and keep it up to date.
 @mkungla that'd be really nice in combination with https://caniuse.bitsofco.de/
  **Description:**

It'd be beautiful if all assets in every scene were automatically cached by service workers.

Or perhaps cache everything fetched by three.js loaders in general. We should be able to hook into everything that three.js loaders fetch (which is stored in THREE.Cache).

[Service Workers: Cache then Network](https://serviceworke.rs/cache-then-network_index_doc.html)
 Just to keep it mind that with `audio` and `video` `THREE.Cache` can cause problems since you can't modify `ArrayBuffer` after it is attached so you may ran into.

>   Uncaught InvalidStateError: Failed to set the 'buffer' property on 'AudioBufferSourceNode': Cannot set buffer after it has been already been set
 Service Workers act as HTTP request interceptors, and can choose to resolve a request with data from IndexedDB immediately? Seems like that could be cleanly separated from AFRAME, aside from registering some sort of cache-clearing mechanism. 
 > Service Workers act as HTTP request interceptors, and can choose to resolve a request with data from IndexedDB immediately?

That's one use case, yep. You could create a "synthetic"/mock REST API.

I think Service Workers are more useful here as a pass-through cache: upon requested, if the resource matches a certain host, path, and/or extension, cache the resource after the response has been fulfilled. Also, selectively caching resources that will be used often and not change - that's also a great use case. Or, even if they are used often, the Fetch + Cache APIs are super powerful when used within a Service Worker. There are lots of interesting use cases, especially for WebVR. The obvious end goal being to have a completely offline VR experience, but the low-hanging fruit is obviously quicker loading times with aggressive caching.

IME, a Service Worker for A-Frame scenes is not premature optimisation. But, YMMV, definitely.

Also, IMO, there should be multiple configuration options. Caching the resources (and invalidating them appropriately) can make all the difference in the network response time. Offline is obviously a great goal to have in mind, but at least to start, scenes will load _drastically_ faster with default/smart Service Workers that can be enabled. (I had some decent luck with Service Worker-ify-ing [DrawVR](http://drawvr.com/)'s scenes and was messing around with them for the [Holodeck Club](https://github.com/holodeck-club/holodeck-club.github.io/)).

[sw-toolbox](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-toolbox/blob/master/recipes/cache-expiration-options/service-worker.js) IME works pretty well without having to write a ton of boilerplate code.

 Here are the related issues for the https://aframe.io site (aframevr/aframe-site#110) and the Examples we show there (aframevr/aframe-site#110).
 What do you think about an opt-out API?

``` html
<a-assets sw-cache-ttl="3">  <!-- Invalidate in 3 days. -->
  <img id="myTexture" src="texture.png">  <!-- Will get cached by default. -->
  <a-asset-item id="myModel" src="myModel.obj" sw-cache="false">  <!-- Will not get cached. -->
</a-assets>
```
 My two reservations about an opt-out API would be:
1. Users should be able to fork and/or add custom modules to the SW, since a site only gets one. Physics would also seriously benefit from SW, which I haven't configured with aframe-extras.physics yet, but it's definitely a goal.
2. For opt-out – I don't think it's possible to both install and run a SW from the same script; you need to invoke `navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')` and then that file needs to just be there. This makes Browserify and Webpack dev workflows pretty incompatible. So the current add-aframe.js-and-go would need to be replaced with more of a prescriptive boilerplate.
 I would definitely have the units for expiry not be in days - need to be way more granular (even preferable to be in sec or ms).

We can document this. And it can be optional. Also, see https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache. TBH, it's probably asking some library maintainers (maybe folks on the Polymer team?) how they plan on maintaining SW.

What I would do is just make it really easy to opt-in with config settings (which IMO we should have on `require('aframe')`/`window.AFRAME` - and have the `sw.js` URL easy to download (or pull from npm).

<hr>

This is part of a larger discussion that I'll postpone having in this issue, but I've been thinking about Webpack for a while now. and it seems like it might help us do some nice custom builds with ease. and the size savings seem to be quite significant. I was a Browserify proponent back in the day, but the "flavour of the month" seems to have something to it. We can discuss in another build.

Thanks for all the feedback, y'all. Appreciated.
 @Coder206 nope, this can be totally different. I would try aframevr/aframe-site#110 first and then see which best practices you can borrrow for aframevr/aframe-site#111 (which technically could live in this repo [aframevr/aframe]). Or it could be part of a hexo pre-deploy script, whichever.

 Btw, I filed #951 back in Feb. Do you want to keep that open? My inclination is to have this issue be for investigating SW and writing an opt-in component. And then #951 would be for including an example of using aforementioned component. Sound good?
 yeah sounds good
 I would suggest using https://github.com/GoogleChrome/http2-push-manifest for weighting the manifest by filesizes. Before we run `npm run deploy`, I would generate the Service Worker. And we should keep a quota limit so we don't exceed sane limits. would leave as a separate generator tool for a-assets and can link from docs

  thanks good catch!
  @darkwing and @ngokevin wouldn't following be a solution? and perhaps add then polyfill into lib for compatibility.

``` js
var medias = Array.from(this.querySelectorAll('audio, videos'));
var imgs = Array.from(this.querySelectorAll('img'));
```
 makes sense while there would be possibility to add polyfill for Array.from
 Selecting nodes without the need to traverse the DOM in tedious loops is nice, however @ngokevin and @dmarcos probably have better overview what performance impact querySelectorAll can have in this context for A-Frame.
 @davidwalsh I noticed a bug, it should be `video` not `videos`.
 I'd file an issue for polyfilling NodeList forEach/map.
 Thanks!
  Thanks
  It would be more robust to traverse all the scene children and check for the `isEntity` flag on them. Nothing prevents people to register a primitive with a prefix other than `a-XXX`. By checking `isEntity`  you don't need a special case for `a-animation` either.
  @darkwing could you edit please your issue and  review the [guidelines](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributing to this repository. 
Missing information about OS/Browser!
  @darkwing actually, how are we sure qsa returns an array again?
  @fernandojsg The inspector is involved with this. Thoughts?
 It's ok for me, as I could look for those `aframe-injected` and remove them before exporting or copying to clipboard the scene.
 @fernandojsg Do you want the aframe-injected also on the VR mode UI, canvas, meta tags?
 Yep that would be great! As right now I'm removing them by hand: 
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector/blob/b9e46216e005a1117a708943342cb589aed81524/src/lib/exporter.js#L39-L47
So what you said VR Mode UI, canvas, metatags, CSS, ...
 @darkwing would you mind remove those as well? I think the issue was primarily for @fernandojsg's inspector to generate HTML
 thanks!
 @ngokevin @darkwing  ops, sorry I was a little bit late to the conversation, maybe it could be another PR, but what about including `aframe-injected` to the CSS?
`<style type="text/css" data-href="src/style/aframe.css">`

And probably for the stats too?
`<style type="text/css" data-href="src/style/rStats.css">`
  **Description:**

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1701 addressed it somewhat, but compared to 0.2.0, the resolution is still degraded.

This is probably webvr-polyfill issues, but need to fix it somehow for the release.
### iOS (iPhone 6) / A-Frame 0.2.0

- A-Frame Version: master
- Platform/Device: iOS
 This is a polyfill problem. The polyfill decides what size the canvas is going to have based on a data base of devices. The size is returned via `getEyeParameters`. 
 Yeah, I noted it is part of the polyfill and marked `needs dependencies fixed`. Still strongly affects A-Frame. For now, we should hack the polyfill to get the behavior as it was before.
 Also the polyfill introduces distortion so the image is going to look distorted on your display when not looked through the lenses. You cannot compare both images (before and after) pixel by pixel
 I notice that the resolution values of the polyfill are also conservative. A compromise between image quality vs performance? Performance takes priority over image quality
 Yeah, but it is a serious decrease in image quality with no noticeable performance gain on our example scenes. The decrease in resolution doesn't seem worth the distortion when testing side-by-side.
 You also have an iphone 6. 
 We've been recommending latest smartphones for Cardboard (last two generations). That would be minimum iPhone 6.
 I would change the title of this bug and remove artifacts. What you call artifacts are the effects of the distortion. You can't compare both images pixel by pixel.
 @ngokevin and @dmarcos . perhaps aframe should enable us to set which camera effect is used when in vr mode. Since I have feeling that `THREE.VREffect` with distortion can't bring the comparable quality in detail as `THREE.StereoCamera` did in 0.2.0.

Something like 
`<a-scene vr-effect="default">`
`<a-scene vr-effect="stereo">`
if that makes sense.
 We did not use `THREE.StereoCamera` in 0.2.0. The distortion is not done by `THREE.VREffect` is done natively by the browser or by the polyfill. 
 @dmarcos hm some reason I false idea that 0.2.0 used stereo camera by how that looked and prop stereoRenderer but now checking it's clear. 

> with distortion can't bring the comparable quality in detail as THREE.StereoCamera

translates to then that the distortion made by polyfill to render HQ requires more memory than most mobile browser allow per tab
 Flat desktop also has low resolution, the buffer scale patch fixes it for some reason...
 Never mind, separate issues.
 Yes that is known issue at this point that resolution of VR effect on any mobile is quite low
Related #1873, However using stereo view like in A-Frame 0.2.0 (2 squares ) would make affect experience on Gear VR and Cardboard

 @caseyyee can you make these changes when you get a chance?
  This fixes the error of `parentEl === null`  seen on console in some of the demo like anime-ui.

This removes also what I believe is unnecessary sceneEl specific code since the same logic (updating components) is run for every entity (scene is just another entity).
 The naming is for consistency.
 I think I got equivalent and simpler code. I added a test to cover for https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1383

Now all entities wait for all the children nodes to load so we don't need specific logic for the scene anymore.

The animations check for the parent to have loaded before playing. If the node is not loaded then they postpone the start of the animation

  Nice thanks! Good catch
  **Description:**

Since we removed the modal and switched it to a fullscreen icon, there is no indication that the scene is VR-capable. Imagine the case where someone Tweets an A-Frame scene, and someone who opens up the scene on desktop does not know much about WebVR. The fullscreen icon alone makes it look like a plain 3D experience.

The primary solution I can think of is to re-introduce the modal that linked people to the Mozilla VR website. As most WebVR scenes today are built with A-Frame, this Enter VR CTA is important to introduce users to WebVR and how to consume it. We can add a referrer to the link so we can gain metrics whether people are engaging with it, but we can't assume it's not helpful yet.

Another solution would be an icon that conveys both that a headset is not connected, but fullscreen can still be entered. When a headset _is_ connected, then the icon changes to just the Goggles.
 @dmarcos said he will revert the fullscreen icon.
 @ngokevin does #1712 close this?
 Yes, solved! I still have some reservations behind removing the modal since it trades off user experience for reduced maintenance and less code. Perhaps that can be a separate component.
  Thanks!
  Thanks!
  Good catch. The call should be removed from `init()`. And IMO, the addEventListeners/removeEventListeners methods should be removed and put into `play()`/`pause()` directly because it implies they're used somewhere else. And yeah, it should be `pause()`.
  Nice! Thanks!
  @liuwaichung can you ask this via SO http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe

  @FrederickDesimpel yeah! Congratulations! I let @ngokevin check this out
  Safari Mobile requires user action to play a sound.
  Try playing with the `theta-length`. `<a-sky theta-length="180">`
 Can you ask on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aframe with more details for help? Thanks!
  Yes. I think we should get rid of Array.from. We can open a different PR to remove the one introduced by #1642
  A-Frame's style guide is a combination of https://github.com/Flet/semistandard and @dmarcos preferences (one if which is early returns and flattened logic blocks). So some things might be weird, but style guide is mostly set in stone.
 No problem, takes getting used to :)
  This issue needs more information. And this question would probably be better on StackOverflow.
  **Description:**

I cannot get audio to play on iOS, both on Safari and Chrome.

What I tried:
- `autoplay` directly on the component. #1463 made me think right away that this wouldn't work. But #1463 description implies that it wouldn't work for Chrome for Android, but it **does** work for me.
- using `entity.components.sound.play()`, both with a setTimeout and with user events.

Both approaches worked properly in Chrome for Android and desktop browsers (Chrome, Safari and Firefox). In Firefox for Android, my app crashes even before I could try the audio, but that is just information, I'm not focusing on Firefox.

I inspected the iOS Safari console and network tabs with remote debug and there wasn't any error or something.

Also, as a side note, I tried the [a-wakens demo](http://ngokevin.github.io/a-wakens/), and it worked on: 
- Chrome, Safari and Firefox (desktop), Firefox (Android)

but didn't work on:
- Chrome (Android), Safari and Chrome (iOS)

So, I'm pretty much clueless about how to get audio to play on iOS and would appreciate some tips.
- A-Frame Version: 0.2.0
- Platform/Device: iOS 9.3.2, iPhone 6, both Safari and Chrome 51
 Hi, I moved to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38645716/cant-play-sound-on-ios because I think this is a question and a matter of figuring out how to use WebAudio on mobile, rather than A-Frame issue.
 Thanks @ngokevin 
  This bug has been [fixed](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/systems/tracked-controls.js#L20)

 You just have to bump the dist `npm run dist` 
  @michael829 In standard Geometry objects, an array of THREE.Vector3 elements are in `geometry.vertices`. In BufferGeometry, which A-Frame uses, the vertices are still available but flattened out:

```
var vertices = geometry.attributes.position.array;

/*
[
  x1, y1, z1,
  x2, y2, z2,
  x3, y3, z3,
  ...
]
*/
```

If you need THREE.Vector3 instances, you'd need to re-create them from that array. If you're just hoping to align things to the edges of the shape, also check out [geometry.computeBoundingbox()](http://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=geometry#Reference/Core/Geometry), which is faster.
  …low on windows

@cvan @ngokevin I don't know if this is the most elegant way to deal with this but it's 100x faster on Windows :). I should have done this a looooong time ago. I was suffering in silence.
 @cvan I need your input on this
 yippie, I'm glad this is faster - testing…
 @cvan How does this look like?

 @cvan As far as I understand `browserSync` just monitors the build file to reload the browser. `Watchify` observes the `src` files to regenerate the build. Any suggestion on how both should be combined?
 @cvan As far as I understand `browserSync` just monitors the build file to reload the browser. `Watchify` observes the `src` files to regenerate the build. Any suggestion on how both should be combined?

that's correct. if you're going to use `watchify`, you'll need to watch `{src,vendor}/**` to know when to rebuild `src/index.js` -> `build/aframe.js` and then `browser-sync` needs to watch `{build/aframe.js,examples/**}` to know when to refresh the JS bundle or the HTML page.

I spent some time trying to get it all to work without `watchify`. I have a patch, but it's not all working correctly:

I can try to keep digging into it. but if you want to keep `watchify`, we just have to make sure the reloading works correctly. because currently it doesn't, at least for me on Mac.

Even [`budo`](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo/blob/c4aa94428/package.json#L39) uses a [custom middleware for `connect` (the dev web server)](https://github.com/mattdesl/watchify-middleware`).

I tried seeing if anyone else has tried to combine `browserify` and `browser-sync`. They have with `gulp`, but I don't think it's worth adding yet another build tool.

My patch is nearly close to getting it to work, but it might be slower than just using `browser-sync` + `watchify`. What are your thoughts? IMO, let's do whichever's easiest (without adding Gulp though).
 in addition to changing the commit message, can we fix the typo of "reliable" ("relialable")?
 I have a _hunch_ that budo was unreliable and slow because of the connect server and middleware. Want to try switching out the [`connect`](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) middleware ([`connect-pushstate`](https://github.com/brentertz/connect-pushstate)) for a BrowserSync one? Here's [some sample code](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo/issues/140#issuecomment-193360011) from a `budo` issue.

[`budo`](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo/) is powerful, designed specifically for browserify, is actively maintained by the community, and @mattdesl updates it very frequently. If BrowserSync makes Budo more reliable, I'd suggest trying that first. And, if that's the case for you, Diego, on Windows, let's file an issue for @mattdesl to consider making the same change.
 > This is the first I've heard of budo being slow, I think as with most code it's just a matter of benchmarking to determine the culprit. Can you provide more details about what is slow? Maybe a test repo I can try on Windows?

I think it happened when the `ecstatic` server was replaced by `connect`. I develop primarily on Mac OS X, and only test my scenes on Windows (and Chromebooks).

For other projects, I have resorted to using BrowserSync instead of `budo` for mainly these reasons:
1. a plethora of options (though I see you have an `--ssl` flag in `budo 0.9.0`, which is awesome.
2. out-of-the-box support for https://localtunnel.me/.
3. the main reason: the WebSocket hanging issues  I've had a lot of budo-specific issues with multiple HTML pages open and directories [i.e., any HTML file whose url is not `'/index.html'`] - I've filed issues for all those in the past. I don't think others could reproduce my issues. (FYI: I'm referring to budo/issues#79 and mattdesl#80 mostly, which I cannot tell whether they are fixed or not because they are intermittent but common enough to be a problem/nuisance.)

The HTTP server alone feels significantly faster. The headers are the mostly the same, and neither is sending gzip'd responses. So, I'm not sure what is accounting for the "hangs" (or "drops"?) @dmarcos is experiencing on Windows. All I can attest to lately is that `browser-sync` _feels_ much faster than `budo`.

`budo` is so easy to drop in a Browserify project and get going. I'd rather we not switch dev servers - or worse, go the Webpack route 😏 
 @mattdesl: thanks for chiming in here. Since budo was using connect, I was having some problems with the speed (not sure if it was tiny-lr hanging or what). For other projects, I tried BrowserSync (which is just express under the hood, with a nice plugin system).

I saw your new branch and am actively using it for development of another project. Nice work on the perf improvements - definitely faster than any other watcher with a build step.

I haven't filed an issue because I'm trying to find reliable STR, but every so often when I make file changes, the server will die on me on some socket error. I'll capture it next time I see it.

Having multiple pages open with multiple browsers open, watching files *added*, etc. - those seem to be the factors I've noticed when I have to restart budo to pick up my changes.

I have a few related budo questions for you. Would be easier to chat over Slack or Twitter DM. When you have some time, hmu. Thanks!

P.S. I'll make a PR to A-Frame using the latest budo once this has all been figured out. @dmarcos Do you still have issues with Budo? I haven't run into much issues. I haven't had many issues. If we wanted to simplify the workflow and since most component authors are using webpack, we could switch to webpack 2. As complicated as I think webpack's config system is, version 2 supports a local dev server and easy prod building out of the box. @ngokevin: does webpack provide the nice error logging and https support that budō does? Yeah, pretty sure it does, given the huge ecosystem behind it. The workflow won't be simplified that much, you still run a dev server that rewrites paths to an in-memory build and you still have a build step to pack, just as we do now.

The benefits are smaller build size (someone reported shaved 100KB in one of the issues) and **simpler** config. If you see our current Browserify steps, they're a bit complicated to modify, and really hard to add additional steps like license-prepend or autoprefixer especially without messing source maps. But not high priority given other work. I have not seen much problems lately with budo. Let me spend a bit more time with it and I'll close this if it's not relevant anymore.  I think we can close? I haven't seen any issues with budo. I think can close  It looks good. The only concern is some problems we had in the past that might not be issues anymore. When using HTML templates the isScene might not be available (because the custom element is not yet initialized) while you can still check for a tagName. @ngokevin @cvan Do you have any use case in mind where these changes could break things?
 Don't think there will be much side effects. HTML templates are no longer used. And the changes here look like `isScene` will be available.
  maybe because we use spaces and not hard tabs?
  Thanks! It looks good. I want to make a round of test to all the examples before merging this.
 @mkungla this needs rebase
 @dmarcos just rebased.
 Thanks!
  If it helps, A-Frame is just a three.js framework and what it does is copies the values on pos/rot/scale onto the `THREE.Object3D`.

There is an `.applyMatrix()` method on that object, though that's internal. You could write a higher-order component that takes a transform matrix and sets appropriate value on the position/rotation/scale components. 
 There could be a `matrix` component that internally decomposes to rotation, position and scale but not sure it should be part of the core.
 Yeah, I would just apply the matrix to the Object3D. Networked-aframe should not assume transforms are only updated thru transforms and provide some sort of detection such as dirty flags or wrapping of object3d methods Only updated thru aframe setattribute*  Yeah, perhaps in the best practices guide.
 Would not be Stack Overflow a good place for those questions? If we maintain such a wiki it would be upto us to keep it up to date, review and curate all the PRs. Stack overflow is more decentralized and more easily searchable through google
 Don't think there's much to do here. A-Frame is focused on WebVR, which will be responsible for normalizing all the devices. At least, we won't be maintaining and documenting cases across versions of mobile browsers and smartphones.  thanks!
  Hi,

You can write a component that wraps the DDSLoader (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/loaders/DDSLoader.js).

https://aframe.io/docs/core/component.html
 We aim to keep the first-party list of components to must-haves. Since we can't maintain every possible feature out there. This lets other people be module owners of components. In the next version, we will lazy-load curated components so they will seem first-party. (call them second-party).
  It seems that is a problem of your specific device and the DeviceMotion API right? The examples in the website have not changed in the last month
 @dmarcos this can be closed. Just tested again with same device and this is fixed in master.
 @mkungla thanks for checking. @michael829 please reopen if this is still a problem
  looks good to me
 @darkwing thanks!
  **Description:**

Embedded A-Frame scenes (iframe) within Twitter if the `twitter:player` metatag is set. See if we can inject that metatag with info from window.location.

- A-Frame Version:
- Platform/Device:
 Yeah. If it should be configurable/toggleable, it should be a component. 
 Cool. I think this doesn't have to be a component/system. It can just be a module that is always run when the scene attaches. I would also check whether Twitter player metatags already exist before creating them.
 I think this isn't possible because Twitter will fetch statically.  Thanks!

Also check out https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-animation-component, I will be repping this implementation from now on.
  Nice! Thanks!
  Thanks! We removed those examples, forgot those links.

  @FrederickDesimpel What's would a regular cursor component be?
 Could be with the mouse: https://github.com/mayognaise/aframe-mouse-cursor-component/
 Reticle makes sense, though it would be a lot of work for everyone to rename. Perhaps we can do this when we start extracting out prescriptive components and we can have both names work for a while.
 I think it would be too much effort to rename. For consolation, `reticle` is an uncommon word, and `gaze cursor` is somewhat a common term nowadays.  https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/bd1bdd8159e0f947bdebc01d66d5e12361733960

my browser makes a request and downloads the full audio. But, strangely, it finishes with HTTP status **206 Partial Content** (even though it has downloaded the full file, as I can check in the Content-Range header):

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4842605/16847846/5fe05f7e-49c9-11e6-8736-99a06e1f7508.png)

But when I actually want to use the audio, I need to place the URL to the audio again in the `src` for the `sound` component:

```
src: ./assets/sound/hall.mp3; autoplay: true
```

When this happens, a new request is made, and downloads the whole file again (no caching), with the same size, but this time with status **200 OK**:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4842605/16847926/bb703512-49c9-11e6-90e7-8dd34f7ce056.png)

So my question is how to get this working for real? I would like to make a single request, that should end with a 200, or at least that the next requests end with status 304.

As a side question, one thing bothers me: when I use assets management for images, I can refer to the asset via its `id` attribute. Why when using `audio` should I refer to them via `src` attribute? At least this is what the docs show in the [example](https://aframe.io/docs/0.2.0/components/sound.html):

```
<a-scene>
  <a-assets>
    <audio id="river" src="river.mp3">
  </a-assets>
  <a-entity sound="src: river.mp3"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```
- A-Frame Version: 0.2.0
- Platform/Device: any
 Thanks for filing. This is sort of currently being addressed in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1629 where we can refer to an `audio` tag by ID, but need to see if we can make THREE.AudioLoader accept audio tag contents.
 Thanks, I'll stay tuned.
 After talking with @mkungla, we have to:
- Detect if `src` is an `<audio>` or path.
  - If `<audio>` then don't use the Loader, and create context manually and get buffer.
  - If path, then use AudioLoader to fetch.
- Modify or fork the `src` type so that it preserves whether the data is media element or raw path. Right now, it always returns a string/path.
 @mkungla nice! Will try ASAP. Closing.
 Is not working exactly how I expected, actually:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4842605/17178539/3e4c6eb6-53ec-11e6-8b7d-fdcbbe57422f.png)

I'm dealing the same way with images and audios, but they seem to be handled differently by the assets management. For instance, the image `sl-hall.jpg`, it only appears once in my network tab, with a 200, but the corresponding sound, `sl-hall.mp3`, seems to make a request every time I go to the same room. The first one with 206, and subsequent with 200 but with `(from cache)` in the Size column.

This is basically the same situation that led me to open the issue initially, the difference here is that in my sound component now I'm referencing the src by id, not by the url anymore.
 Thanks @mkungla , your explanation gave me a better understanding of the underlying problem.
  Thanks for the work. I do feel workflow instructions are important. Though for the purpose of endorsing just one, I feel these instructions might be:
- Prescriptive (must use Git, GitHub, Node, Atom)
- Challenging (introduces a ton of new technologies into the stack)
- Out-of-scope (tutorial for getting started with web development tools in a section about getting started with A-Frame)

However, I feel like this might be a great blog post material if there're more screenshots and elaboration. And then we can also put your face on it. Something along the lines of "Workflow for Web Development Beginners".
 Going to think about this a bit more, actually. Still on the fence. It might not be prescriptive since we should recommend Git, GitHub, Node, and I re-read and saw you didn't actually enforce a text editor. If the section is small and contained enough, it might be useful.
 Thought about it more. I don't think we should recommend this workflow for total beginners. GitHub + Node + CLI is too much. This would make a good blog post for easing people into web development. For the next version of the A-Frame though, we will be featuring different workflows for different types of creators.
 The homepage we will have something that acts like a playground for beginners. There's also Codepen, and workflows like MagicaVoxel.
 Will close for now, but will loop you in homepage posts.

I recommend publishing this workflow online somewhere for now though for those that need it! (like Medium)
  Thanks, PR is open
 PR welcome!
 Also look into using text shadows
 Thanks for playing with it! Seems like we still have room to decrease the shadow a bit and still be readable?
 Looks better :)
 Great! We can copy and paste the new rStats into A-Frame. And add a class to style it in `src/style/rStats.css` using `.rs-counter-base.alarm`
 thanks!
  Yeah, can you update the examples and docs as well? Thanks!
  Yes, should be up :)
 Fixed thanks!
  thanks!
  **Description:**

**The scenario**:

I'm developing a "virtual tour" application with a-frame. The core of my app is basically a `<a-scene>` with `<a-assets>`, a single `<a-sky>` and some (1 to 3, depending the situation) `<a-image>` used for navigation purposes. On every navigation I just change the sky `src` attribute with the id of another asset.

I'm using React to organize my scene in components: one for the scene itself (together with assets and camera), a child component for the room (with the sky and the nav elements) and a nav component.

For the assets, for each room, I put in `<a-assets>` the image for that particular room, and the image for all the possible rooms that can be reached from that one (to prefetch them). Since I'm using React to help me here, I keep an array of all the assets that were already put in `<a-assets>`, and I only add to it the ones that never were loaded. So I start with, say, 5 assets (nav images, current room sky, next room sky), and as I navigate, more assets are put in `<a-assets>`, but the ones that are already there are never touched. So, at the end of the tour, I might have about 15-20 assets in `<a-assets>`.

I have around 15 different "rooms" (so 15 sky images). The sky images range from 500kb to 2mb. My nav images are always with the same src, and it is a small png image (less than 100KB).

Each sky image is only being loaded once and not making any more requests (100% sure, checked on browser and on server), but my navigation image gets loaded once and then on every navigation it makes the request again, but with 304 status. Could not find a way to overcome this, but it shouldn't be a big problem.

The components are behaving well, so I'm not having several renderings of my react components for each transition or something like that.

**The problem**:

I have a major performance problem testing the app in my Android phone (Motorola Moto X, 2nd generation, 2GB of RAM) with Chrome. After around 10-20 transitions between rooms (in some rooms I don't have an option besides going back to the previous room), the transitions begin to get slower and slower, to the point where I focus to my nav element and my phone freezes, so I need to restart it. I tried Firefox on my phone but the Firefox will crash every time a few seconds after loading the app. Firefox even crashes with the oficial [hello world demo](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/helloworld/), so I don't think that this is my problem exclusively.

In my computer (MacBook Air, 4GB of RAM, i5 CPU), I can run my app with much more stuff on it and everything runs fine. I've added [gifs](https://github.com/mayognaise/aframe-gif-shader) in my navigations, [text](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-text-component), audio (a different audio for each room) and [mouse-cursor](https://github.com/mayognaise/aframe-mouse-cursor-component) and I had no problem running my app. Although, when I navigate about 20 times between rooms, the RAM consumption gets bigger than 500MB with all this stuff, and 200MB-300MB without it (as simple as when I get the crash on mobile).

**Conclusion**:

It would be really nice to receive some suggestions about what I might be doing wrong. I can show some code if my description is not enough and if you think that would be helpful, but I think my description was pretty complete.
- A-Frame Version: 0.2.0
- Platform/Device: critical on mobile (Chrome 51.0.2704.81, Firefox 47.0), bad in desktop (Chrome 51.0.2704.103)
 I just found this app: https://aframe.io/blog/syria/
I'll try to figure out what they are doing, because they don't seem to have the performance problems that I described, even though my app is simpler than that.
 Edit: removed all the links since the repo is private now

@JohnRodney hey there, thanks for the input.

I just made my repo public so you can take a look: [edited]

The component that creates the sky and changes the src is this one: [edited]

You might get confused with some "state" and "properties" that you might see in the code. Besides React (that uses "state" and "props" nomenclature), I'm using a state-machine called Macchina that I've built some time ago, where I also used "state" and "properties" but with a completely different meaning. It needs refactor, but it helps me to keep the mapping of the rooms properties simple (see this file: [edited]).

The current state of the repo is with almost everything stripped out (sound, gifs, text) to try to spot the perfomance leak.

I will try now your suggestion. Thanks!
 Forgot to mention, to play with the app you should just run:

```
npm install
npm start
```
 @JohnRodney (or should I say Daryl from TWD?), you suggestion DID work. I cannot thank you enough, man!

On the other hand, this seems to me a very random solution. I would like to have a better understanding on why this works.

The downside is that since all my `<a-sky>` are in the DOM when the React app is mounted, I need all my assets in the DOM also, so my prefetch now has become pointless.

But I'll try another approach: put my `<a-sky>` as needed, and once they are in the DOM, never remove them. This way I can use the assets lazy-load/prefetch.
 So @JohnRodney , my current solution is: I put a `<a-sky>` in the DOM for each visited room. If I am in that room, then the entity holding the sky is visible, otherwise, not. Keeping one `<a-sky>` for each src, and never changing the source was the solution, but not putting all of them at once in the DOM was my way to delay loading all the assets.

I'm in the same situation that you was, so I'm not very happy either, but the deadline ain't getting further. Closing because I think my issue was solved, thanks to your help.

(I'm also putting my repo as private, because it should be). 
  @FrederickDesimpel Would love if you could add a target property (type `selector`) for the light component.
 spotlight.target added, thanks!
  @FrederickDesimpel can I have the example scene that you're using in your screenshot to test it on the editor?
 fixed
  Pushing back. Considering https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2071
  Thanks!
  I think this is the issue: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1715
  The webvr polyfill uses a device database to determine the resolution that the polyfilled version of the `getEyeParamers` will return. The `navigator.userAgent` string must contain the device model name that matches the one in the database. In the case of a nexus 5 is `Nexus 5` (https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill/blob/master/src/dpdb/dpdb-cache.js#L182)
It looks it's a problem with the polyfill database or your emulator not containing the correct device model name for those devices. There's nothing that we can do on the a-frame side.
  I can confirm that your scene is broken with your A-Frame bundle. Not sure which version you are using but it's not `0.2.0`, and it's not `master` (`861c369`) - according to my `diff` checking. Try https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/dist/aframe.js / https://cdn.rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/dist/aframe.js.

When I forked your scene and used `<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/dist/aframe.js"></script>` instead, it worked on mobile.

I wish we included a `sha`, not just the `package.json` version in the bundle.
  Should be fixed now?
 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/6be3725d548e5f071b0ec19a534d6235643ee525
  I can address at https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-animation-component
 We've deprecated a-animation. Try https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation and file issues, and component will be merged in in the future.

The component will not include delay in every iteration. If you want to add delay before each iteration, can control the animation with a bit of JS   r+wc
 This is ready to go but I first need @fernandojsg input first. In order to lock the version of the editor to a version of A-Frame we have to agree on the url schema. @ngokevin suggested `https://aframe.io/aframe-editor/builds/0.3.0/aframe-editor.js` where the version refers to the A-Frame version. I made the editor url a property of the component so people filling adventurous can try experimental versions
 Yep, I agree that probably will be more useful to follow the same version number for the builds to match aframe. We could use `https://aframe.io/aframe-editor/builds/0.3.0/aframe-editor.js` for the first release
 Alternatively `https://aframe.io/releases/0.3.0/aframe-editor.min.js` to match A-Frame.
 @ngokevin :+1:
 @ngokevin @fernandojsg How are we going to deal with master? If you use a-frame master it should point to the master version of the editor as well.
 Maybe we can immediately point A-Frame Master to Editor Master after we release. But A-Frame 0.3.0 should be locked to Editor 0.3.0.

Or we always point to the last release. If developers are using Master, we prescribe to configure their Editor URL. `<a-scene editor="url: mastereeditorurl">`
 @ngokevin are you going to add the release command for the editor? As you mentioned master should point to the latest release of the editor and devs can just change the url if they want bleeding edge. Before merging this It would great to have a functional URL `https://aframe.io/aframe-editor/builds/0.3.0/aframe-editor.js`
 How about I copy one to `https://aframe.io/releases/0.3.0/aframe-editor.min.js`?
 Yes we can copy it manually for now.
 Remember to `s/editor/inspector`
 Let's push a build to `https://aframe.io/releases/0.3.0/aframe-inspector.min.js` so I can point this PR to it.
 `ctrl + alt + i/e` loads the editor and immediately jumps into it the first time.

When I exit, and press `ctrl + alt + i/e` again, I expected it to open the Editor again, just like the Browser DOM Inspector you can toggle on/off with the same shortcut.
 In Windows the shortcut for the inspector is `ctrl+shift+i` . `windows key + alt + e` opens the browser menu in chrome.
 @fernandojsg how can I programmatically exit the editor so I can close/open it with the shortcut? Maybe the shortcut should be handled by the editor instead of aframe. What do you think?
 @dmarcos once the editor is injected you can use `editor.enable()` and `editor.disable()` (I just realised that I should change also s/editor/inspector there :)
I could include the shortcut in the inspector to toggle it, but to inject the first time should be done outside the editor, how to handle this two entry points?
 Just a nitpick, could be `editor.open()/editor.close()` or `editor.enter()/enter.exit()`.
 @ngokevin yep, just after writing that, I was thinking how bad naming these functions have. I'll change them for `open/close`
 r+wc
 One question regarding this shortcut. If you press `ctrl+alt+i` to inject the `inspector` and open it, should I add also the same shortcut once injected to toggle the inspector right? (Even if after that we could create a easier shortcut like `Esc` or whatever for doing the same)
 Yeah, would be nice to toggle like the Chrome Devtools.
 I think we're using alt instead of shift.
 > I think we're using alt instead of shift.

nice, ok - can we update the docs?
 I suggest to not do reviews if the label `needs review` is not present. This PR only went through a rebase cycle. There are a bunch of changes coming soon and we will have to do the work again.
 r+

can do later:
- unit tests
- bump package.json
- test with most recent inspector build that ctrl/alt/i can toggle inspector open and closed
 restarted the build
 just marked `needs changes` for the typo in the `remove` method
 Just changed to `AFRAME.INSPECTOR` https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector/commit/50eaa732febc6b989338e81d94cb3b9b4e07d543
  **Description:**

Earlier, I changed `click` to `cursor-click` for the cursor component to know where the event comes from.

But if we want to support multiple interaction mechanisms (mouse, gaze, controller), should we come up with standard event names such that developers only have to listen to one event (`click` vs. `cursor-click` + `trigger`)? Right now, we have "mousedown" even though you might not be using a mouse, should we keep those old names?

Example names:
- `cursor-click`, `trigger` -> `click`
- `cursor-mouseenter` -> `hoverenter`
- `cursor-mouseleave` -> `hoverleave`
- `cursor-mousedown` -> `clickdown`
- `cursor-mouseup` -> `clickup`
 yes, please standard event names. Those `cursor-*` have been bothering me.
 What should we name them, should they interoperate with controller event names?
  @dmarcos r? This will make the archives only have `dist/` + LICENSE + README. I'm mostly okay with it.
 I don't remember having ever used those archives on any of my projects. What's is the expectation when downloading one? Having a snapshot of the whole repo or just the library dist files?
 So after some talking, it seems that while it is nice to have it slightly cleaner, the expectation is that it should serve as a snapshot of the repository. It's a bit more flexible to leave those files in, and follow what other big projects do.
 @mkungla Do you use any project that follows that pattern? Using the archives to only package up the dist files
  [React for example](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases) offers two kinds of downloads in the release (they're even represented with different icons)
1. A zip file with the dist files
2. A zip with the archive of the repo

The purpose of git archiving is to actually snapshot the directory tree of a repo:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-archive

@mkungla I don't know how the `.zip` with the dist files is generated but React is not using `.gitattributes` (https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/.gitattributes). Can we change this PR to let the archiving be the whole repo snapshot and generate another zip with the dist files like React does?
 FWIW, here are my current thoughts:

It seems more flexible and less contentious to have it serve both purpose of release and snapshot. Downloading the `.zip` will still give you access to the `dist/` files, it shouldn't be too obstructing to also have other files in the archive.

I agree that most people that would want the other files would just clone it. And it would make it cleaner to exclude those files, but it's a marginal benefit.

You mentioned that we might want a `.gitattributes` for other purposes. The one you posted, is all that does is just add EOF newlines? Just not sure we want to maintain another file unless it's really useful.
  Try setting on a wrapper entity.

``` html
<a-entity rotation="SET THIS"><a-camera></a-camera></a-entity>
```
  @msj121 Would you might updating this patch? Thanks!

  Add support for tracked controls. It introduces three levels of abstraction: 
**`tracked-controls`** that is limb/vendor agnostic. It just applies the pose and emits events on the entity. it's applicable to any future tracked objects: feet, scene elements... 
**`vive-controls`** that is specific to the vive controller and makes the proper button mapping: trackpad, trigger, menu, grip
**`hand-controls`** that applies a hand model and maps button events to higher level of abstraction events like `grip` or `point`
 @donmccurdy Oculus Touch and Daydream will be supported through `tracked-controls` that provide the lowest common denominator: pose and button events
 I have a new version of the patch that filters out all the controllers besides those with the id "OpenVR Gamepad" We should maybe discriminate those that don't have a pose but I don't know if that's reliable. I'll push the update later in the day.
 This puppy is ready to go. @ngokevin 
 OK, will give a final sweep today once I finish up some stuff. Thanks for waiting.
 @ngokevin One last decision it has to be made is to include or not `hand-controls`, `vive-controls` and `blend-model` (that carries an extra THREE module) as part of the standard build. It's quite a bit of code for a feature that won't be used much right now (but pretty important in the long term)
 I was in favor of including everything, and then extracting them out later once we have the component consumption system down. I think this feature is important enough to be batteries included.
 I'm going to addd the componets to the core and documentation for them
 I made the relevant component part of the core so you can get hand controls out of the box.
 r+wc
 I also added docs for the components.
 OK thanks, i can clean those up when i sweep the docs again before release 
 It would be worth to add an example that uses the vive-controls. We can do that in a separate PR.
  It seems Ricoh knows how to orient the image based on EXIF data for horizon correction. You can adjust the rotation of the skysphere `rotation="0 0 30"` or something
  I suggest that you move to master that wil be 0.3.0 soon (1-2 weeks) We prefer to focus on getting 0.3.0 rather on a 0.2.1
 Yeah, would be less overhead to go straight to 0.3.0. `master` is available in the meantime.
  Good idea, could you add one for us?
  It's intentional. Letting the user move up and down on mobile becomes disorienting quickly in combination with the phone sensors. It also makes the scene unusable in a headset because the vertical axis won't match the real orientation of user's head.
  **Description:**
Creates a showcase to illustrate link traversal, characteristic of the WebVR 1.0 spec. A hover and click effects for the links are still pending.

@cvan I know you have opinions on how pages should handle link traversal while remaining in VR. Let's discus and incorporate those ideas into this PR.

This is a link to the demo if you want to quickly try it out:
http://swimminglessonsformodernlife.com/aframe/examples/showcase/link-traversal/
 can you rebase?
 Tests pending Alright, Nightly enters for me now. Camera had a low height for a bit until I restarted.

I debugged and found that `attrValue` at some point became a string value of `pano` rather than an object like I'd expect. material component was calling `updateCachedAttrValue('pano')` I think an issue is `el.setAttribute('material', 'pano', data.src.src);` in link.js. If I pass in a raw URL vs `<img>` from `<a-assets>`, then it sort of breaks. This has been an awkward part of the API, we should just have the link component check if it's an `<img>` or string, or hope it just works as a string.

Changed to `el.setAttribute('material', 'pano', typeof data.src === 'string' ? data.src : data.src.src);` It doesn't look like the portals are doing `look-at` on the camera Should `<a-entity link scale="0.5 0.5 1">` work?  I think the title text above the portals need double-sided materials in case you go to the other side r+ This is for VR to VR scene traversal.  The UI is componetized in the `vr-mode-ui` component:

``` html
<a-scene vr-mode-ui><a-scene>
```

You can remove it and implement your own.
  As @donmccurdy said. You should convert your FBX to a format better suited for real time applications. FBX was designed as an exchange format for design applications.
  OK, I see the problem. We weren't setting fog on MeshStandardMaterial despite documenting it.
  Does the problem reproduce in master?
 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/e4900e16ea9228af39d2a4fef6798393e79bd82a
  We're trying to call `setAttribute` before everything is initialized. Two options:
1. Use the component system to write script components (recommended to automatically hook scripts into the A-Frame system)
2. https://aframe.io/docs/0.2.0/core/scene.html#running-content-scripts-on-the-scene
  thanks!
  Pretty awesome! People have been registering custom materials, but this seems like a much simpler API.
 Should be good after changes, thanks!
 Thanks! I can squash-merge.
  This code is much cleaner that the previous attempt. @fernandojsg, What do you think?
 @wizgrav nice, thanks!
 Nice it seems mrdoob accepted the patch
 We can now copy and paste to the vendor directory
 I still didn't check the code, by now I'm trying to run the demos with a headset and on chromium they won't work as the video won't load so maybe the demo version could be something simpler using just geometry?
I've tried also to run it on Firefox nightly 50.0a1 with Oculus Rift and I just get rendered the right eye, the left eye is black. 
Has someone successfully make them work on windows with headset?
 @wizgrav I've just tried the new version and it's still painting just one eye. I'll try to debug it this afternoon!
 Now both eyes works, but it looks weird. The left eye looks at the front but the texture is stretched and the right eye looks like the camera is rotated to the left:

 @wizgrav sure! just drop me a line on slack and we'll do it!
 Would still be easier to review if it was broken down further like:
1. tock (purely)
2. post-processing
3. graph-ordered execution
 @wizgrav @fernandojsg ready for review right?
 Not an example, but could use unit tests for adding/remove `tock` and that components that define `tock` have those behaviors registered on the scene.
 @ngokevin @wizgrav do you mind if I leave this review to next week as I'm quite busy right now? I'll give it a try and try to use in another context with other effects to see how it will scale
 @AnnCaryn Yes, the effects probably will be added to the https://aframe.io/aframe-registry so people could register their own posteffects and then you could easy include them in your project, they won't belong to the core, just the base functionality, as @wizgrav explained.
 @wizgrav @ngokevin is this change still something that is desired to be merged? Since this thread got bumped, the update for post-processing is there's pending work in three.js to get it to work well for VR (a camera for each eye). The `tock` looks OK, I've since merged the System update pieces. Thanks for the patience. I would like to keep the `tock` related logic and move the postprocessing logic to a different PR. Can we do that? @wizgrav A use case for example we needed this for (and we hacked temporarly) is the ability to capture an animated gif of a running scene. @wizgrav we would call `tock` in the render function the same way we call `tick`. This is what the render method would look like (renderTarget is null by default)
```javascript
render: {
      value: function () {
        var effect = this.effect;
        var camera = this.camera;
        var delta = this.clock.getDelta() * 1000;
        this.time = this.clock.elapsedTime * 1000;

        if (this.isPlaying) { this.tick(this.time, delta); }

        this.animationFrameID = effect.requestAnimationFrame(this.render);
        effect.render(this.object3D, camera, renderTarget);

        if (this.isPlaying) { this.tock(this.time, delta); }

        this.effect.submitFrame();
        window.performance.mark('render-iteration-finished');
}
```` I would not check for the `postprocessing` attribute inside `a-scene`. The postprocessing logic should be decoupled from the scene. The postprocessing component could instantiate the renderTarget for the scene and you can move the logic to the `tick` method (that happens before render) so nothing specific to postProcessing remains in the render loop. We might want to consider a separate scene component called renderTarget that instantiates the renderTarget for those components that require one. Thanks a lot for the patience. Longest running PR in aframe history. It need a rebase. Yeah! Thanks very much for sticking with it. @wizgrav one last thing. I see changes on VREffect. Are those coming from the three repo? Do we need then! Amazing! it only took a year to land this 😄 @wizgrav It's fantastic you were able to bring it back home  I don't think animations is the proper solution. Try creating a delay-set component:

``` js
AFRAME.registerComponent('delay-set', {
  schema: {
    component: {type: 'string'},
    delay: {default: 2000},
    property: {type: 'string'}
    value: {type: 'string'}
  }

  init: function () {
    var data = this.data;
    var el = this.el

    setTimeout(function () {
      el.setAttribute(data.attribute, data.property, data.value);    
    }, data.delay);
  }
});
```

``` html
<a-sky color="#73F7DD" delay-set="component: material; property: shader; to: flat"></a-sky> 
```
 Oops, should be data.component, not data.attribute

``` js
<script>
AFRAME.registerComponent('delay-set', {
  schema: {
    component: {type: 'string'},
    delay: {default: 3000},
    property: {type: 'string'},
    value: {type: 'string'}
  },

  init: function () {
    var data = this.data;
    var el = this.el;

    setTimeout( function () {
      el.setAttribute(data.component, data.property, data.value);    
     }, data.delay);
  }
})
</script>
```
 Nice. Found out GitHub comments are not a good environment for coding :)
  What do you mean by misalignment between split screens? Anyways, I don't think VR mode is useful in a tablet form factor. There are no holders in the market that fit tablets.
  removed getComputedAttribute  I believe you fixed this, thanks!
  @msimpson That error you see means that video playback has to be initiated from a user action: A click or a tap on the screen. I don't think it's a regression on A-Frame side but a change in the policies with respect to video playback in Chrome Mobile. @lautarorb Does the problem reproduce with a Chrome Mobile older than 51.0.2704.81? I don't have an Android device I can test on.
 @timmhayes what phone do you have? Sanity check.  Does this work for you?  https://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/gRPZqd You can fork the codepen and replace the video URL with whatever you like, as long as it is wide open for CORS Interesting.  Does the A-Frame example video work if you also specify the mime type as part of the video element, rather than only replacing the URL?  Maybe a regression in mime type detection behavior in Chrome? Can you try with the master branch?  We recently versioned our documentation and have not cherry-picked the fixes. So 0.2.0 documentation has this broken link, but master documentation, it is fixed! http://codepen.io/mozvr/

https://aframe.io/docs/master/guide/getting-started.html

I will try to start cherry-picking fixes. Thanks!
  @nikhilnayak98 Can you provide a link to an example that reproduces your problem?
  Thanks! 
  **Description:**

It's possible that you may call `scene.enterVR()` and it won't work because [`THREE.VREffect`](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/fdca37f/examples/js/effects/VREffect.js) hasn't finished [its async logic](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/fdca37f/examples/js/effects/VREffect.js#L49-L58).

This means that when you try to call `scene.enterVR()`, it calls `this.effect.requestPresent()`, which throws `No VR hardware found.`.

I have to actually call `navigator.getVRDisplays` myself and hope that when that resolves, `THREE.VREffect`'s `navigator.getVRDisplays` call has resolved and the `VRDisplay`(s) are detected and ready to be used.

 Marked help wanted to just add `rendererready` event at the end of setupRenderer.  We got working a proper solution at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/365829f688a420631e0f575c2598fe07a6abe554 which was a bit more involved and fiddly.

Thanks so much for the work though!
  Yeah. When we versioned the docs, this was the compromise, not easily being able to push small revisions. We can fix this by updating the tag with the fixes. Perhaps I will have to do a weekly manual update...
 We might have to just leave 0.2.0 like that, but 0.3.0 going forward we are cherry-picking fixes
  Something to do with pixel ratio or the WebVR polyfill.
 Was able to fix this by modifying VREffect to use `window.devicePixelRatio` instead of `1`. Not sure the implications or intentions though.
 @dmarcos was wrestling with this. I think he knows what's up. and there's some discussion in the [webvr-polyfill issues](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill/issues) too.
 I was able to fix it by changing the BUFFER_SCALE to 1 and having VREffect use the set pixel ratio. But need to compare performance.
 @mkungla has been doing some investigation and said:

> Problem with The Perspective cameras and how these are created and updated
> 
> And function fovToProjection, fovPortToProjection, fovToNDCScaleOffset do not give exact results they should always
> 
>  As I see then 0.2.0 you used `THREE.StereoCamera` instead of `THREE.VREffect`

 #1701 has addressed the issue.

  Thanks!
  Thanks!
  There is a `buffer: false` option, but preserving the original geometry data sounds harmless. Let's do it.
  good catch
  You can create a half-sphere using the sphere geometry and reducing the thetaLength/phiLength

 @dmarcos Did you try setting the position immediately after append?
 I've tried setting the position before appending to the scene and it also works.

 I tried and it works for me. Perhaps a codepen would help.

``` js
>>    <a-scene stats>
        <!-- Cube -->
>>      <a-entity position="0 0 -10" rotation="45 30 0"
                  geometry="primitive: box; height: 8; width: 8; depth: 8;"
>>                material="color: #167341; roughness: 1.0; metalness: 0.2;"></a-entity>
>>      <a-camera position="0 0 10"></a-camera>
>>    </a-scene>
+
+     <script>
+       (function () {
+         var box = document.createElement('a-box');
+         document.querySelector('a-scene').appendChild(box);
+         box.setAttribute('position', {x: 0, y: 10, z: -10});
+       })();
+     </script>
```
 That could be his problem. If the JS runs before AFRAME is initialized our `setAttribute` wrapper is not in place and hence the form `setAttribute('position', { x: 0, y: 0, z: -10 })` won't work. If you do `setAttribute('position', '0 0 -10')` will run through the standard setAttribute method and the attribute is set as you would expect even if AFRAME is not ready.
 @tbalouet You should make sure that your JS runs after AFRAME loads. Follow what @donmccurdy said.
 I'm going to close this because I'm 95% sure that the problem was the order of JS execution. @tbalouet feel free to reopen if loading AFRAME before setting up your entities does not solve the issue.
 @tbalouet Nice! Your scene looks really nice. are baking the lights?
 Can you post code + what you expect in a new github issue so we can check it out? thanks!
  For now, I think I'd rather we create a general event-proxying component (published outside A-Frame, but eventually be able to be lazy-loaded) than add more features into the animation system. That component might be useful in other cases. I feel the animation system right now is becoming unsustainable.
 I recommend trying to go through the component system. It is less asynchronous (going through the DOM system), becomes composable, and is easier to work with since you can just do `setAttribute` rather than `createElement + append + setAttributes + wait`.
 Nope. `animationend`/`animationstart` events bubble so they should be available to listen to on the parent entity. To select tie the proxying to the specific animation, you could maybe use a selector.
  Not reproducible anymore  dupe/fixed on master https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1497
  You could write a component that emits an event on another entity when you receive a certain event:

``` html
<a-event event-pass="on: click; emit: show-tooltip; target: #my-target">
```

What three.js does, and @donmccurdy says it would allow him to do blanket PRs. It looks harmless, but I am not sure of the implications.
 I'm fine with it
  thanks for doing this 👍

[`webcomponents-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webcomponents-lite) (updated a year ago) still includes Custom Elements, HTML Imports, and Templates. we use Custom Elements but not the other two in A-Frame (we used HTML Imports in 0.1.0 but they're gone now).

could try [`webcomponentsjs/micro`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webcomponentsjs) (updated two months ago) includes only Custom Elements and Templates. can we try to see if that works?
 Am not sure that'll you find a working one, we had to fix a couple of very subtle things with the polyfill we're currently using. If we wanted to save some of the bytes, we'd probably hack on https://github.com/dmarcos/document-register-element and remove lines of code. Not sure that is worth doing because then we are really maintaining a true fork.
 @gasolin: @ngokevin: I've heard from numerous folks that the WebReflection document.registerElement polyfill is incomplete and not spec compliant (and there are issues filed for them). @csuwildcat told me we should be using the webcomponentsjs Custom Element polyfill instead.
 OK, we can try if @gasolin you want to help out with that, would be much appreciated. There may be quirks as A-Frame was developed on top of the other polyfill so it will take a lot of investigating and massaging.
 The webreflection polyfill has served us well. besides saving a few KBs what's the benefit of this?
 Added a WIP tag. Let us know you can get the tests passing and investigate the quirks in switching. 
 Going to close for inactivity, let us know if you make progress on this. Thanks!
  Yeah, no HTML Imports coming.

Also try https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-template-component which can load external HTML.
  @dmarcos Looks good to me. The alternative is to have the raycaster traverse up, but that's not performant.
 Can you add a small test in the entity suite?
 @msimpson Thanks!
  What'd you do?
 @cvan any ideas?

 Updated.
 @dmarcos want to merge so people aren't updating old docs? we can continue to build/edit off of this
  Thanks!
  AFRAME only uses the custom elements API. We decided to go that route because the API spec is mature and it can be easily  polyfilled. We want AFRAME to reach the largest possible browser base without much performance hit and minimum bloat in the code base. We keep en eye on the shadow DOM but we have not played with it in the context of AFRAME but we are defintively interested. @trusktr how does your approach work across different browsers with no shadow dom implementation?
 Don't think shadow DOM is necessary (at least for core). The template component or using three.js scene graph to represent as the "shadow" scene graph are other options
 Actually not too worried about shadow DOM. I don't think it solves many issues in the 3D/VR space where the actual HTML ends up pretty hidden, and we have a lot of components/tools to abstract/render subtrees (whether in DOM or 3D scenegraph). Even in Web Component land (which is not too adopted itself), shadow DOM isn't well adopted. But yeah, if you can find an easy fix that doesn't require much maintenance, cool!
 One important note that I don't think has been mentioned in this thread — A-Frame does not, by default, write attribute values to the DOM. If an entity's position changes on every frame, A-Frame will only add the `position` attribute to the DOM once, and after that all updates are virtualized. More information in docs for the [`debug` component](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/components/debug.html).

All that to say, A-Frame's entities are already a sort of virtual DOM — if you can measure noticeable DOM overhead (after initial scene setup) I would be surprised.

Being able to run A-Frame in DOM-less environments, e.g. serverside, is not built in. I would be curious how that goes for you, if that's something you're planning to try.  Do you think you could add a unit test for this?
 Thanks!

There's a PR open for merging extensible controls in.
 @dmarcos an simple-ish fix for this, #333, and #1409 (short of the whole controls refactor) would be to (1) support the arrow keys, and (2) use `event.code` instead of `event.keyCode` if it's provided. In browsers that implement it, that will reflect the physical location of the key so that Dvorak and ZQSD keyboards work as expected.

Example:

``` javascript
// Tiny KeyboardEvent.code polyfill.
var KEYCODE_TO_CODE = {
    '38': 'ArrowUp',
    '37': 'ArrowLeft',
    '40': 'ArrowDown',
    '39': 'ArrowRight',
    '87': 'KeyW',
    '65': 'KeyA',
    '83': 'KeyS',
    '68': 'KeyD'
};

var code = event.code || KEYCODE_TO_CODE[event.keyCode];

```
 thanks
  I created a `template-set` component: https://github.com/ngokevin/staryu/blob/master/components/template-set.js when I was loading data from an API.

https://github.com/ngokevin/staryu/blob/master/index.html#L26
 Yeah, I guess I can add it as sugar to the template component. 
  Can you provide an example?
 I'm no able to reproduce this. @justvova please reopen if you can provide a test case that illustrates the problem.  To both. Have to hack with our complicated Browserify steps and make sure source maps still work.  **Description:**

@dmarcos and I don't know why this is needed. Before the callback, parentNode is defined. At the callback parentNode is briefly null. parentEl works for some reason. Have no idea what is happening to the read-only parentNode.

 Not being swapped, the defining lights replaces the default ones. They shouldn't be related to one another. But seems this might be a bug.

  Should we include this in the core lib? I don't care much about IE11 given it doesn't have WebVR, but it seems small enough.
 I use Windows 10 and aframe.io works properly on Edge. If Windows 10 includes both (IE 11 and Edge) you're always one click away from an aframe capable browser. On Windows 7/8 you can just install Chrome or Firefox. 

The problem with IE 11 goes beyond CustomEvent support. I've tried [the three.js examples](http://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_decals) and many of them don't even render or are extremely slow. It seems that there also WebGL compatibility issues. I don't think IE 11 reaches the minimum quality bar to do any sort of 3D work. I'm closing this.
  … and positioning can be controled styling the a-scene when adding the embedded attribute
 Should we add a test example showing multiple scenes on a page?
 I don't think multiple scenes per page works quite yet
 Need to move the A-Frame scene above the fold, else it looks like a normal Wikipedia page:

 This puppy is ready to go home.
 ok will look when i can
 Clicking on the Goggles for `Anime UI`, `Dynamic Lights`, other examples, the icon just disappears. For `Composite`, you get teleported into the cube. It works for `Cube` though.
 Can we maintain some of the padding in non-embedded mode? It's a bit too close to the corner now.
 This is ready to go. I made an important change I think it's sensible at that point. The default camera position was `x: 0; y:1.8; z: -4` so objects at `x: 0; y: 0; z: 0` are visible in front of the user. Now the camera starts by default at `x: 0; y: 1.8; z:0` so it's consistent with the position returned by a headset when entering VR.
 Can we maintain that offset if we detect non-VR fullscreen? 
 No because the scenes will look different with and without a headset. It's better to be consistent and behave in the same way that other libraries operate. I think it only adds confusion. -4 meters default displacement in the z axis it just feels arbitrary. 1.8 metes in the y axis makes sense because it's human scale
 Right now, if I play a scene on desktop and enter fullscreen, I'm on the ground or below the ground.
 The offset in the y axis should still apply
 Yeah, I'm just talking about the Y-axis. Try the geometry gallery scene and enter fullscreen (non-VR).
 I believed I covered all the cases: Desktop with and without headset, mobile, scenes with and without default camera. I have to do one more round of tests with a headset. 
 1. Consider configurable camera property `nonVRHeight` or similar name such that user-defined cameras can benefit from the non-VR offset. Default camera can set this to 1.8 by default.
2. Consider, now or later, to differentiate between VR and flat fullscreen. The save/restore camera pose when entering in and out seems useful for only VR, not flat fullscreen.
 Ready to go. The offset in the y is now applied to all cameras and configured via the `userHeight` property in camera. The offset is removed in the presence of a headset. When exiting VR the previous (before entering VR mode) position of the camera is restored when a headset is connected.
 very nice
 r+ when you ready to merge
 I would probably add `userHeight: 1.8` to `<a-camera>` as a default.
 @ngokevin can you test a bit to see if everything make sense?
 I tested around a few examples on my laptop, everything makes sense there:
- Flat:
  - Default camera, 1.8m offset.
  - Enter fullscreen, offset still applies.
  - Exit fullscreen, pose is not overwritten.

I haven't tested in VR. But I assume you have this:
- VR:
  - Enter VR, offset is removed.
  - Exit VR, pose is restored to before entering VR.

Just the one note that if I did `<a-camera></a-camera>`, I would sort of expect to have similar defaults as the default camera.
 We can decide on the user-defined `<a-camera>` default later.
 Nice. Love resolving the camera height inside and outside VR.

document.querySelector('a-scene').enterVR();

 [Nice section here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/core/scene.md#running-content-scripts-on-the-scene), but for some reason waiting for `loaded` doesn't work. you have to add a `setTimeout`. gotta figure out why:

``` js
<script>
   (function () {
       // switch to stereoscopic mode directly on page load, this needs to be after the a-scene loads.
       var scene = document.querySelector('a-scene');
       if (scene.hasLoaded) {
           scene.enterVR();
       } else {
           scene.addEventListener('loaded', function () {
               setTimeout(function () {
                   scene.enterVR();
               }, 1000);
           });
       };
   })();
</script>
```

Also, not exactly specific to this issue, but still think we should support #705.
 Well, no one is against #705. Though I might also just recommend creating a scene component. They have the advantage that you don't have to worry about query selecting, waiting for events. Just write JS and attach:

``` js
AFRAME.registerComponent('auto-enter-vr', {
  init: function () {
    this.el.sceneEl.enterVR();
  }
});
```

``` html
<a-scene auto-enter-vr>
```
 like it
 Though I guess you might still have to add the event listener...but at least you don't have to query selector or worry whether it's already loaded. And you get reusable code for free.

Are you testing in Chromium or Firefox Nightly? Chromium currently has a temporary user-gesture requirement; Firefox Nightly does not.

 (Accidentally closed issue.) @Silver-Seagull yep, there is - I'm working on it right now. out of curiosity, are you working with only Cardboard? or are you using Chromium/Firefox w/ Vive/Rift? I'm just curious which platforms A-Frame devs are using. @Silver-Seagull there are a couple bugs in that code. I'm fixing them right now. but if you're trying to do it right now, just set `<a-scene auto-enter-vr="display: all">`; that's a temporary workaround though. Just for the record. `auto-enter-vr` will go away in next version in favor of the `link` component and system I got [this patch](https://gist.github.com/cvan/c9351d20223e7824041557a94c414ced) working to auto-enter VR, but I still have to fix up the tests (and write new ones).

As Diego mentions above, the code in A-Frame (and three.js) is going to have to be reimplemented soon anyway (to support all the variations in Oculus Carmel, Google Daydream, Google Cardboard, Firefox Nightly, and Chromium Desktop), as the [WebVR API](https://w3c.github.io/webvr/)'s navigation flow (for auto-entering VR) is in flux right now (see issues w3c/webvr#30 and w3c/webvr#152).

@Silver-Seagull: I'd recommend dropping this JS snippet into your scene for now:

```js
window.addEventListener('load', function () {
  var scene = document.querySelector('a-scene');
  if (scene.hasLoaded) {
    scene.enterVR();
  } else {
    el.addEventListener('loaded', function () {
      scene.enterVR();
    });
  }
});
```

Hope that gets you where you need to be.
  Thanks for catching. Can you click edit on github at bottom of docs page
  You can create a system and move your tick function there so it's called once per frame regardless of the number of models in the scene
 Yeah, that would be easiest. People can consume it right away, and later we will allow lazy-loading components in.
 Thanks for doing the good work. Shall we close this?
  **Description:**
- `registerShader` API is actually registering materials. Even for custom shaders, it is using `ShaderMaterial`.
- Confusing that `registerShader` maps to providing options for the material component. It's pretty tough in the docs to explain this.

Related: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1457
 How might `type` be ambiguous? It maps to `THREE.Material.type`.
 @dmarcos Thoughts? I think this will be less confusing.
 `type` isn't actually reserved:

This is single-prop:

``` js
schema: {
  type: 'string'
}
```

This is multi-prop:

``` js
schema: {
  type: {default: 'string'}
}
```
 @dmarcos Any objections?
 I would keep registerShader. Material use shaders and it's what you select on the shader property. It's also consistent with the registerPrimitive API for geometries. 
 Shaders is an advanced feature. We have to document it but it's not necessary to dumb it down.
 Shader is a wide spread computer graphics concept. ShaderMaterial is specific to three.js
 Yeah, materials use shaders technically, but API is an abstraction on top of three.js materials and an extension to the material component. registerMaterial registering materials and is way more clear than registerSbader registering materials.

geometry is registerGeometry, not registerPrimitive. 

For documentation, I'm not referring to documenting custom shaders, I'm referring to documenting our materials that we refer to as Shaders. Readers would not expect that A-Frame materials map to A-Frame shaders.

Just doesn't make sense to break a perfect mapping.
  **Description:**

Allow configuration of systems through the DOM like we have for components. 

For example to adjust physics gravity `<a-scene physics="gravity: 9.8">`

Or Websocket server `<a-scene multiuser="http://myserver.5000">`
 Currently, all systems are initialized before the scene has initialized. So systems currently cannot do `getAttribute` to retrieve data. Having a schema and data initialization in place would allow systems to access scene data. Having this issue with the broadcast component+system
 Yeah, I have been using proxy components as well. 

I think we do initialize systems before components ATM.

A schema would solve problems.
  On a user gesture, explicitly play sounds that have `autoplay`. (Born out of #316.)

Firefox for Android (and soon for iOS) enables `autoplay` playback by default! woo! 🎈 
 I don't know whether I fully understand the problem here, but in my Chrome for Android the sound autoplay just works. In iOS, it doesn't.

In Firefox for Android, though, I can't even open the initial screen of my app without crashing the browser.

Am I missing something?
 Whoa, that's a different issue. Does the scene load okay on desktop?
 Yes. Actually I've now finished my project, and probably won't be using a-frame again in the next weeks. But in the end, I just couldn't make audio play at all on iOS, on both Chrome and Safari, even on user events like `mouseenter` (with fuse cursor) and even with `click`. It did work on Android and desktop, though. 
 We ought to create an FAQ entry about this, as the question does come up a lot... There is really no way to start an audio clip on iOS without a user interaction. If you want ambient noise or music in the background, you could have a "Begin" button overlaying your screen, prompt users to click that before they enter VR, and kick off VR mode and the audio at the same time.

For sound that would play at arbitrary times, I haven't seen a working example yet. Presumably you would need to put all your sounds into a single file, start that at the beginning, and skip around in the file as needed to play specific effects. This is a pretty painful solution. :/

> But in the end, I just couldn't make audio play at all on iOS, on both Chrome and Safari, even on user events like mouseenter (with fuse cursor) and even with click.

A couple notes here:

1) Chrome and Safari on iOS are effectively the same thing; Firefox might work, per @cvan's comment a year ago?
2) `mousenter` and `click` events generated by the fuse cursor are not user interaction from the browser's perspective... those are still events generated by the scene's `cursor` component. You would need the user to press the screen, physically, to generate supported user interaction.

A few more resources:

- https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-ioshtml5/
- http://matt-harrison.com/perfect-web-audio-on-ios-devices-with-the-web-audio-api/ We've had really good results using howlerjs for some production projects and games. It'd be great to see someone write a component that extends the standard `sound` component to add audio sprite support using howlerjs. > Everything says you need a user interaction on ios to play audio, but i can't find a working example of that.

The problem is that interaction within an A-Frame scene doesn't count. The browser can't tell what's going on inside WebGL, so it has to assume those events are just generated by arbitrary JS. You need an old-fashioned physical `touchstart` or `click` event, triggered by the user's finger (or Cardboard button) and not by a fuse or gaze cursor. Gamepad buttons might also count. I don't know of a live example of this though.

> It'd be great to see someone write a component that extends the standard sound component to add audio sprite support using howlerjs.

+1, this sounds like great idea. It would be nice to see this prototyped as a separate component (`sound-sprite`?) and added to the registry, where multiple instances of the component can share a single audio file.  This works on my iPhone 6 Plus by gazing at the cubes. I had to make sure I turned the silent lock switch off on the device otherwise sound wouldn't play (expected behaviour).  It looks good to me. I let @ngokevin merge it.
  thanks!
  **Description:**

With the `registerGeometry` API, a variety of geometries can be registered that won't have to be geometric primitives (e.g., text, extrude, svg)

Smaller reasons would consistency with three.js API as Geometry objects have a `type` and simpler wording.
 Or alternatively if we detect an attribute that is not type/default/parse/stringify, then we switch it to multi-property.
 Actually, `type` is not reserved. If `type`'s value is a string, then it will be single-prop. If it is an object `type: { type: 'string' }` then it is multi-prop.
 I think type is ambiguous and carries a different meaning in a programming context. Primitive is commonly used in many 3D packages: [3D Studio](http://docs.autodesk.com/3DSMAX/15/ENU/3ds-Max-Help/files/GUID-66152BDE-BA64-423F-8472-C1F0EB409E16.htm), [Maya](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya-lt/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/MayaLT/files/GUID-6D21314A-54AD-41D4-AFC0-AAED13CD50A6-htm.html), [Blender](https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.4/Manual/Modeling/Meshes/Primitives)
 In 3D programs, the word primitives is used to create geometric primitives, yes. But three.js geometries don't have to be geometric primitives. 

`type` is what three.js refers to their geometry types. No one is going to confuse geometry component type with programming types. Better the possibility of being ambiguous than being incorrect anyways.
 type is not descriptive enough in this context. let's move on
 I made points and counterpoints. If you want to close it, it would be copacetic to address them rather than brushing them off.
 I think renaming does not bring any benefit. it's changing for the shake of changing and type is a very ambigous word and used in other contexts. primitive is a common concept used in computer graphics https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_primitive
 OK. The main exception I was thinking of was text, SVG, and extrude, but if they're the minority, and we're okay with the slight awkwardness of `<a-entity geometry="primitive: text">` or `<a-entity geometry="primitive: svg; src: mysvg.svg>`, this isn't too big of a deal.
 text should probably be a separate component. 
 and svg as well
 You could, but then you don't get free geometry merging, caching, buffering, and automatic memory management provided by the geometry component.
  thanks!
  nice
  thanks!
  Animations don't take components. I imagine this will work:

``` html
<ent yourlistener>
  <anim/>
</ent>
```
  Where is this happening?
 We don't set any favicon iirc
 OK, we should probably remove that.
 if you set a `<link rel="icon">`, we won't inject our own. is this an issue?
 @alexcheninfo sorry about this. opened PR #1477. it should get merged very soon 😄

> Hey @ngokevin we got that dino animating yesterday — but it looks like AFrame is only set up for skinned animations (where the animation is a child of the geometry) — in (regular?) animations, they are in the Collada object which is discarded in Aframe’s loader implementation
 To contribute, check out how it's done in  http://codepen.io/anon/pen/XdGpEy?editors=1010

In the COLLADA component (src/components/collada-model.js), use `THREE.Animation` if the mesh is a `SkinnedMesh`. Once the animation is created, use component `tick` handler to step the animation.
 Discussing this a bit here: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/issues/82

@ngokevin any thoughts on what the play/pause API should look like, since models can include multiple animations?
 Making some progress on animation support in [three-model](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/loaders/three-model.js). But since THREE.AnimationMixer (the replacement to THREE.AnimationHandler) isn't specific to a particular model format, it probably makes most sense to not bundle animation code into the `model-*` components themselves.

Strawman syntax:

``` html
<a-entity collada-model="src: url(...);"
          model-animation="name: run;
                           duration: 0.5;
                           fps: 30;"></a-entity>
```

Animation name can be optional; perhaps the first animation available will just autoplay.

There are multiple kinds of animation: morph-based, skeletal, and keyframe-based (?). Options need to be set on the material to support morph and skeletal animations. [Perhaps that can be done automatically by loaders](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/loaders/three-model.js#L46-L48), or retroactively applied to the material.

A `model-animation` component could be fairly detached from the model-loading code, so it might make sense to include it in core. It should be triggered by events, or programmatically.

Also, idle thought, would the current `animation` component be better named as `tween` to reflect that it's not the right choice for effects like changing `src` attributes?
 Wrote an [animation-mixer component](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/feat-animation/src/loaders/animation-mixer.js) that works out of the box with [json-model](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/feat-animation/src/loaders/json-model.js) and [gltf-model](https://github.com/xirvr/aframe-gltf). It should work for ObjectLoader aka `blend-character-model` too, but i'm working out some issues there.

I think it's probably worth having a dedicated component for animation, rather than baking it into model loaders, to support things like [blend tree animation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-BlendTree.html) and to have a consistent API. This component depends on [THREE.AnimationMixer](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/animation/AnimationMixer.js) (the fancy new animation system in THREE.js).

But Collada models still require the older [THREE.Animation](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/302c693b27663d4d280b156b5ebe4ed38cd062e4/examples/js/loaders/collada/Animation.js), which has been moved into an example folder with just Collada-specific code. We could bundle both animation systems, but I'm more inclined to use the new system and encourage people to convert their Collada stuff to glTF with the online converter.

---

EDIT: I was incorrect about glTF, the animation was playing because `gltf-model` autoplays animations itself. THREE.gltfLoader has its own, third, [animation system](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/302c693b27663d4d280b156b5ebe4ed38cd062e4/examples/js/loaders/gltf/glTFAnimation.js). 😐
 The glTF-specific animation system has been removed in favor of the new/common animation system, THREE.AnimationMixer: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/10276.

In terms of adding model animation support to A-Frame, I think it would make most sense to start with the THREE.js JSON format and glTF — those are the two formats that use the new animation system. @msj121 everything in THREE.js `dev` is now cross-compatible for that to work — hopefully all we need to do is update `gltf-model` to the latest version of THREE.GLTFLoader. 

But definitely a chance there will be version mismatch issues, and if so it may be necessary to wait for the next THREE.js + A-Frame releases. Going to close in favor of supporting glTF animations. If COLLADA benefits from that then great. Otherwise, see the three.js code for playing COLLADA animations (use the `model-loaded` event to grab the collada scene):

1. Import animation code 

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/webgl_loader_collada.html#L36


2. Traverse the model and play animations

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/webgl_loader_collada.html#L57

3. Tick the animation

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/webgl_loader_collada.html#L181 For posterity, is an example implementation of animation with COLLADA:

 Yeah https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1423

diego has been testing it on multiple devices. working on the iOS part atm
  Is this just a jQuery thing, or maybe a bug in your code snippet?
 It does not work after remove you mean? We call remove in the components when removed from the DOM
  dupe https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/316
  Thanks for tackling this. I don't think emitting events from the render loop is a very good idea. It adds overhead (and most of the time you won't even use it) and compromises performance. Having a way to do postprocessing effects would be indeed very cool. I like more @donmccurdy approach of providing two methods at the component level. You can currently insert your logic in the render loop via the `tick` function of components and systems. It would be nice to have a way to throw warnings or stats on console if  any those user defined functions in the render loop are too slow.
 Can you remove the `dist` bumps?
 Hmm, after going over the PR, I'm not sure about piggybacking off the component API. It assumes `postRender` might have a wider use case than just post-processing. And having to add special cases for pause/play is not great since post-processing shouldn't have a concept of pause/play. Maybe we need a tighter API for register post-processing effects. Thinking about it...
 I don't like using the component API too much. We are adding a special handler and property that from what I can tell would only be used for post-processing, and then we have to touch play/pause code, and such.

Brainstorming, but here's an alternative API, which would be harder to implement, but would be a bit more explicit. Using the System API, this would be a bit similar to Don's Controls API:

```
AFRAME.registerPostProcessor('some-effect', {
  schema: {},
  vertexShader: 'vertexshaderstring',
  fragmentShader: 'fragmentshaderstring'
});

<a-scene postprocess="bloom, hdr, ssao" bloom="intensity: 0.5>
```
 Ah, right, thanks for the details. I should clarify the sample API I had would still make post-processing effects a component, but just a subset API of a component. Just because `postRender` + `postRenderPriority` would only be used by effects, seems to make sense to fence it off. 
 Thanks, will take a look when I can
 Can you remove the `dist` files from the PR?
 - `dist/` files are out and look OK now.
- Yeah, that's not great. But @dmarcos just pulled them into `vendor/` for WebVR 1.0 API reasons. We still wouldn't want to touch them. Maybe we need that module to live in its own home?
 Needs a rebase. I'm not sure how we should handle the `VREffect` change collisions. Ideally, all the changes would be upstreamed to three.js, but maybe we should just move it to `lib/` and maintain it for now...
 Bunch of `npm run lint` errors
 Yeah, still need to resolve it with the VREffect in `vendor/`, but there'll be a lot of lint errors for `a-scene`, and all the example JS files.
 @fernandojsg r?
 I'm looking around the API and I'm thinking how to deal with multiple postprocessing on the scene.
Sometimes you may want to add gloom + ao for the whole scene but also want to active from time to time other effects like nightvision or some kind of underwater distorsion.
Ideally you could be able to chain them, switch on/off and change the parameters for each one.
Did you already think about a way to solve this with the current implementation?
I was thinking on something like:

```
<a-postprocessing>
    <a-effect id="sparkles1" type="sparkles" img="sparkes1.jpg" opacity="0.5" color="#fff">
    <a-effect id="sparkles2" type="sparkles" img="sparkes2.jpg" opacity="1.0" color="#f00">
    <a-effect id="gloom" type="gloom" intensity="1.2" radius="2.0">
    <a-effect id="nightvision" type="nightvision" intensity="2.0" noise="1.2">
</a-postprocessing>
```

Everyone will be loaded but just some of them will be used, defined by the `post-process` param on `a-scene`, and just the last one is the one that will render back to the framebuffer.

```
<a-scene post-process="gloom, nightvision"/>
```

So you could add or remove effects from the postprocessing chain modifying `post-process` effect. And also you could modify the parameters for each effect accessing directly to the element defining it.
 Those individual effects could be components rather than adding a new element too.

@wizgrav I'm rethinking the tick/tock...It would be more flexible to explicitly define an order like you had before right?
 but if you want to reuse some like the `sparkles` but with different parameters, do you need to create a new component? or will you create a `a-mixin` for each one?
 What about this:

``` html
<a-scene post-process="effects: sparkles, sparkles, bloom, nightVision; bloomIntensity: 1.0; nightVisionIntensity: 0.6; sparkles1Color: red; sparkles2Color: blue">...</a-scene>
```

The name of the effect and the index are automatically prepended based on the schema of the effect and the order in the list.
 I think we should decide on a post-processing API later. This PR is really about being able to order component `tick` calls and being able to hook into the post-render. That is very flexible for now, and when we have more experience, we can maybe define an explicit PP API later.
 I think the post-processing component should be the one calling the tick methods of each effect.
 That could be layered in or decided later. Note that PP is just a component in `examples/`; it's just one use case. The PR is actually about ordering components. Another use case for that is the controls API needs support for ordering `controls` before `velocity`. 
 What I mean is that we just need a new method tock called after the render call and that's all. If there are multiple tick functions to call on a specific order should be managed by the component post-processing. We don't need a generic API at this point. What other use cases are there? The API proposed is over killing in my opinion.
 So if we had two components `controls` and `velocity`, where `controls` needs to be run before `velocity`, we wouldn't be able to control that with just `tick`/`tock`. We need a way to order those `tick`s as well. That could be a different PR though, yeah.

Yeah, I think the bare minimum for this PR, is a `tock` and events on `add/removeBehavior`. I think PP could be accomplished within those constraints?
 You can express that with the dependency components. If a component is a dependency it will be initialized in first place and the tick method called before the dependent component one.
 As the active PP `effects` could be dynamically modified I believe the order must be controlled from a `post-process` component that is the responsible to access the PP system. I'm not sure why do you want to implement `tick/tock` for PP instead of doing a composer similar to the one used in threejs' `THREE.EffectComposer` or Jaume's `Wagner`. So you could just inject a call in the `a-scene` render when postprocessing is active and the order, passes and so on will be delegated to the `post-process` components, instead of worry about `tick` order for each effect's component.
 @wizgrav With that approach you're avoiding multiple drawcalls but if the effects change dynamically (going inside/outside water, nightvision on/off) you're rebuilding the whole shader on each switch which is not very performant :\
Also the `fragmentText` should be defined in that way by the user? or it's dynamically generated from the original fragment shader from the user?
 I believe it will be quite hard to come out with an hybrid system to control the passes in order to optimize the drawcalls as creating just one whole shader is not possible for many effects so it should be necessary to create a logic to separate the "full" passes from the "composed" passes as you described.
For example if you want to apply blur, it's way much faster to do two passes with horizontal `blur -> rotate 90º-> horizontal blur`, instead of one pass. Also you will have some passes that will be applied to RT of different sizes, so the system should be intelligent enough to deal with this...
Maybe you could define which passes should be executes separately in the API to prevent overengineering it.
 Yeah, we can fix the tests to `delete`
 The `precedents`/`following` ain't too bad. It's better than just hijacking the `dependencies` API because that is meant for a different purpose (i.e., controls initialization rather than tick execution). It's also better than assigning numbers because it's much tighter and explicit.

Will have to look at the graph-based API because it is fairly complex. But sounds cool.
 Thanks. We'll try to get to this and understand it. Though it's Memorial Day Weekend, I'll be on a trip next week, and we'll all be in London for a week right after. Focuses will be on controls, documentation, and 0.3.0 release, but I hope we can get to this!
 Do you think it'd be a good idea to split this PR up into three parts so it'd be easier to review?
- `tock`
- execution ordering
- post processing exaple
 Is it possible to do `tock` addition first? I think that would be easiest. And then later, we can layer on the ordering?
 Yeah, I was suggesting that we save the post-processing example for last.
 Cool. We can keep this one open to track the overall work.
 @wizgrav did you want to wait until PR #1564 is merged before fixing this one up too? @wizgrav thanks. @ngokevin and @dmarcos are best to review #1564. thanks; excited to see this get merged 👍  I think we can close. Not much demand for ordering past tick/tock and it seems aframe-effects was able to get by.  Yes, we've known this for a bit but haven't addressed it. We need to clarify this. Sorry about this.
 The button should show a full screen icon instead of the googles.

  A-Frame is not expected to work on nodejs. It's a front end library
 NPM is heavily used these days for frontend dependency management for use with Browserify or Webpack.
 Yeah, or with Webpack. Not Node.
  Thanks! The convention we were trying to introduce for event names was: componentname-eventname. @ngokevin why do you think the new events are not working as expected?
 I wanted to remove the prefixes too. I think we can make these events standard.
 I see that the cursor component in master indeed emits events of the form cursor-eventname . The problem is that the  published docs don't reflect 0.2.0 but master. Someone reported that the color animations don't work as stated in the docs https://aframe.io/docs/core/animations.html#Color-Attributes. That's a feature that recently landed in master @cvan have we recently republished the docs? We should deploy 0.2.0 tag instead of master
 Yeah, we've been deploying master documentation. I agree, I can make it go back to the 0.2.0 tag and I can put a dropdown to view old/master docs.
 The current docs correctly reflect the API. The problem is that the published version on the website corresponds to master instead of the latest public release 0.2.0. I'm closing this and I filed https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1428 to take care of the issue
  This does not make the code harder to maintain (for loops leak an extra variable) and a bit more brittle? If you for example have two nested for loops. You need two variables and make sure you use the appropriate one. I've quickly checked backbone and react (just picking two random popular libraries) and they don't use that form of for loops. Why is that?

https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L145

Also most of the Stack Overflow discussion you pointed out is from 2011. Are the claimed perf gains still relevant in the JS VMs of 2016?
  I am proposing https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-event-set-component as the alternative to deprecate declarative events.
 Declarative events deprecated. Event Set should work
  thanks!

 @dmarcos Approve the idea? I've built a bunch of scenes, I almost always want `linear` over `ease`.
 The conventional wisdom is that animations should always have some easing because it's how natural movement occurs in real world. Linear animations usually feel unnatural. Look at how biological systems move and operate and how that influence animations in UIs and games. @ngokevin why did you prefer linear over ease in your experiments?
 I've used animations for:
- Falling. A cheap way for gravity.
- Continuous movement. Like a butterfly flying around a try, or something running, or like a plane/car. Or a laser. Something on a conveyor belt.

But those are probably exceptions, and even then they would probably have some miniscule easing. so I agree. Linear is unnatural. Sorry for the goose chase, @gasolin 
  thanks
  iOS might be able to play m3u8. The problem is using that video stream in the context of a WebGL texture. Please reopen If you can provide a working example.
 @radenui thanks for letting us know I would try first to make a core shader `video`. Can we expose the video texture to custom shaders? If tha's hard or not posible we can maybe try something like `video-material` approach There is now support merged into latest master for HLS on iOS 10 with Mobile Safari.

Unfortunately my understanding is that said support will not work on earlier versions (e.g. iOS 9) and no further work is planned there.

Should we close this one now?
  Thanks!
  dupe #333
  Can you show a bit of code?
  Thanks for PR! Unfortunately, this heavily collides with https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1399 because of the way texture loading and caching is changed. Let's re-open after that lands.

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1399 will make it easier to add more texture properties.
  thanks

  Thanks!
  I think that would be pragmatic.
 We've deprecated a-animation. Try https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/animation and file issues, and component will be merged in in the future.

The component won't take into account the delay on subsequent runs. If you do want delay on subsequent runs, you can control the anim with a bit of JS  Thanks!
  Thanks!
  I think for now, iPad/Android Tablet should be detected as mobile so that they still work without having to create custom touch controls. If they were not detected as mobile, then all of the Cardboard scenes that were built with accelerometer in mind would not work correctly.

You can open a PR for fixing TV detection; we're focusing more on VR rather than flat.
 For thumbpads or touch thumbpads, you'd be free to register your own controls. Each application has such specific controls requirements so we're leaving it up more to the dev.
  This is a limitation of Android.

GearVR has special IMU (internal measurement units) within the headset that it can retrieve faster data from. For Android browsers, we are limited to device orientation API which is much slower.
  **Description:**

How would we allow having multiple components of the same type, declaratively? If we should at all.
- Right now, you could create a custom parser and allow passing a complex string. Would be hard to code.
- You could do `setAttribute`, but you wouldn't be able to declaratively code that.
- Maybe a number suffix?

**Use cases:**

Set on event:

``` html
<a-entity set-on-event-1="event: click; property: material.color; value: red"
               set-on-event-2="event: mouseenter; property: material.color: value: green; target: #enemy"></a-entity>
```

Randomizer:

``` html
<a-entity random-1="property: material.color; min: 0 0 0; max: 0 0 0"
               random-2="property: geometry.primitive; oneOf: box circle sphere"
               random-3="property: material.roughness; min: 0; max: 0"></a-entity>
```
 The first case is logic `when this happens do this` and should be in JS. You're cramming imperative logic in a declarative language. In a real world application the logic is usually more complicated than `if this event happens change this single component attribute and nothing else`. Having logic in both JS and your DOM will make things harder to understand and follow. 
I think I don't fully understand the second case.
 Declarative doesn't mean logicless. Many components should and do have logic. 

Declarative events is just an example. It is not expected by all means to handle all logic, but it is a common pattern. I just want it to fit better into the framework, even as a third-party component. Think CSS hover states, active states. When something happens (click, hover, collide, gaze), do something.

Everything is up front and there is no behavior hiding in a script tag somewhere. ECS makes it easy to encapsulate logic such that all I have to do is append to DOM to get things to execute:

``` html
<a-entity sound="on: click; src: scream.mp3"></a-entity>
<a-entity event-set-1="on: collide; property: explode"
               event-set-2="on: collide; property: material.color; color: red"></a-entity>
```
 @andreasplesch That wouldn't work because then those would be modifying different entities. I'd want to be able to randomize any property value on a single entity.
 We're thinking animation is a special case because it will be too complex to define as HTML attributes (e.g., sequencing, keyframing). Components are defined as HTML attributes.

For the randomizer component (again, it's just an example), it doesn't require any parent-child relationship. You could register a custom element to do it, but that breaks away from the ECS mold. We generally reserve parent-child relationship for the scene graph.
 For this issue specifically, the only problem we have is trying to define more complicated data structures in the DOM. With traditional ECS, you just use code so it's easy to pass around arrays of objects. 

rotation/position/scale aren't an exception. They apply to the entity they are attached to. It's just the way that local and nested coordinate systems affect each other, which is documented.
 The declarative must not contain any logic to keep a good separations of concerns. Declarative: Describes what you want (HTML): A red cube, a cursor, a tiny elephant. Imperative: Describes how things will behave (JS). If you start adding logic to HTML you will have it scattered all over the place in JS and HTML making hard to follow the flow of your program. Writing the logic you propose above in JS is pretty trivial. You're optimizing for the trivial stuff and making the complicated stuff potentially more confusing and harder to understand.
 This is unrelated to the PR, but I heavily disagree.

No, again, declarative does not mean no logic. It completely makes sense to declaratively define behavior and functionality. Components can define behavior and logic, and that's what makes them useful. Does that mean we should get rid of `<a-entity sound="on: ...">`? That's logic. Should we get rid of controls? That's functionality.

It's not logic into HTML. The logic is encapsulated. It does not scatter it, but it encapsulates it into reusable pieces. If you put game/application logic into raw JS, then you no longer have control over its execution. Hell, it makes it easier to follow. Because it's defined right on the entity rather than in a bundle of ugly JS somewhere.

It's not about making it "trivial". It's about making it reusable.
 the logic of controls is not expressed in the component. The component API just configures that logic/behavior. Sounds logic is to play a sound when an event is emitted. The API let's you define the name of that event, and that's all. It's not expressing any logic. `If this happens do this` That's logic and it's what you propose that it's different.
 No, it's not easier to follow once things get complicated. It only works in toy examples. You will have to use JS in any non trivial application and then it will get confusing. Adding logic in declarative contexts has been tried many times and ends up being messy (angular I'm looking at you)
 How is "play a sound when X event is emitted" any different from "change this property when X event is emitted"?  What if I just want to make something red when it's clicked on, collided, or hovered? That's pretty much an analog to CSS which declarative.
 `play a sound when an event is emitted` is expresed in JS. Not in the markup
 `change this property when X event is emitted` is also expressed in JS. It's encapsulated within the component.
 Well. Ignore the declarative event example. There's controversy there. The other example just sets random property values, that doesn't contain logic. How could we define possibly multiple components of the same type?

The only way I can think of is create a DSL that's up to the dev, which might be hard to manage.

`<a-entity randomizer="property: material.color | property: position | property: scale; min: 1 1 1">`
 CSS pseudo only changes the visual aspect of your UI. They don't interfere in how the application operates. Our components do much more than visual aspect.
 Our components do much more than visual aspects, but shouldn't contain logic?
 OK. I think I will go down the DSL path and custom parsers path.

I think the component arguments will solve themselves as we build more demos. Good thing we have permissionless innovation.
  How does it compare to other WebGL content? Have you done your test with any three.js demo?
 Interactive WebGL applications are demanding and the browser adds overhead on top of that. There's indeed room for improvement on the browsers side. I'm going to close this since this is not an aframe specific issue. It would better to file it against Firefox or Chrome :)
  I think option 1 is more readable.

We do have a `transforms` attribute though that does what the second case you're talking about, though it might need some discussion/expansion.
  **Description:**

Details at https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-template-component

**Changes proposed:**
- Move template component to core.
 I'm not sure that the template should be part of the core. 
 Maybe not. Though it's immensely useful. I use it in most my scenes, and we have a lot of examples that could be cleaned up with it. It's a useful testbed for testing dynamically injected entities, mixins, and animations. And there's potential for enabling sharing of reusable snippets/templates.

With that, what do you propose?
- Put it in the examples folder, like three.js .
- Put it in the `extras/` folder, which is seeming like a place where we shove stuff that we're unsure about it.
- Keep it separate, and promote it elsewhere. 
- `aframe-extras` bundle?
 It's opinionated. I would not pollute the examples with those opinions. They should be as vanilla as possible even if they are a bit uglier. 
 I think this should be out of the core and stay as a third party thing.
 Shader toy is my personal bet for the future and something I think will become increasingly important. Being able to create completely procedural scenes (with no geometries) is something I want a-frame to support out of the box to give a chance for people to discover and serendipitously stumble on it.
 I deleted my comment because I was still mulling over it. A lot of the code was Shader Toy agnostic, but I would keep Shader Toy-specific things (if any) out of it if we're going to keep things unopinionated. I'm gonna move discussion there.
 Shader toy is just an extra shader it does not change the perception what a-frame is about. Writing the examples using a template engine obscures the a-frame core message. Is it a template engine? Entity component? declarative 3D DOM? All of the above?
 I think the core message is declarative ECS, which **enables** all of the above. I do think it is immensely useful to reuse chunks of HTML; I use it in every scene. But whether it's part of the core, or part of a component, I still have the ability to do so.

Later, we will promote third-party components more on the homepage, and support lazy-loading from a registry of components. So the lines of what ships with A-Frame and what's third-party will blur.
 It would be indeed useful to showcase examples of aframe using whatever template engine, d3, react... but making explicit that those are AFRAME + something else that it's not aframe. We could have a section in aframe.io examples that points to those demos.
  You cannot use images or videos as textures that are hosted in a different domain than your project unless the third party serves its content using CORS headers:

https://aframe.io/faq/#Why-does-my-asset-e-g-image-video-model-not-loading

The way to play youtube on a third party site is via their embed player that uses an iframe. You cannot use an iframe as a texture in webgl:

https://aframe.io/faq/#How-do-I-display-lt-iframe-gt-s-or-render-HTML-in-A-Frame

Please use Stack Overflow with the aframe tag for questions:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aframe
 Yes, you are adding an iframe that runs the embeded youtube player. The video indeed plays but it cannot be rendered as a texture within webgl. This is why you hear it but not see it.
 No, I don't think so unless Youtube decides to distribute its content with CORS headers. This is unlikely since they would lose control on the kind of advertisements they can insert in their videos. 
 If they use CORS headers, yes. For the Youtube case you have to download the video and host it in your CDN but this will go against their terms of service.
  Nope. But I encourage you to try to do it in a separate project or component :)
 I mean it wouldn't be a core part of A-Frame.
  Do you mean AR, or VR? Also that isn't A-Frame, so it seems this issue doesn't belong in this repo.

You could just do `<a-box ...><a-animation .../></a-box>` if you want to do that in A-Frame.
  **Description:** 

If value specified by the texture/map property type is a selector to an img/video, then don't do `getAttribute`, just return the `<img>` or `<video>`. That way the texture system won't have to create a new img/video element and do duplicate loading.
 @fernandojsg What do you think about the name `texture` vs. `map`?

`texture` is possibly more intuitive to A-Frame developers. `map` is technically more accurate.

If we use `texture`, would it be odd to have `{heightMap: {type: 'texture'}}`?
 Also `three.js` refers to them as `t` for texture uniforms (sampler2D), might want to match that. Even though it uses `map` for material properties.
 I use to prefer `map` over `texture`, maybe for a simple diffuse texture/map they could be used the same way, but when you talk about `normal map`, `envmap`, `bump map`, and so on, I believe it's more accurate and coherent as you'll find more references both in libraries, engines, and 3d programs.
 This has been done. `asset` property type returns `<img>`/`<video>`/`<canvas>` down.  **Description:** 

For true VR experiences, standard cursor should be mouse cursor like http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_interactive_draggablecubes.html

The current cursor component is meant more for Cardboard, which many of us don't want to be the primary VR experience.

@mayognaise's mouse cursor component is pretty inline with this. You move the mouse cursor, and it will project raycaster depending on the coordinate on the canvas. To look around, you use the HMD. 

There should be pointer lock upon entering VR mode so that we can create custom cursor appearances.

Should bounce off the raycaster component. Just like the current Cardboard cursor does.

Recent raycaster work https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1196 was a stepping stone to exactly this.
 Would be awesome if @mayognaise could tackle this. Else it'll be until I get around to it.
 @ngokevin okay ill work on it :)
 We'll keep it separate for now, and solve with component consumption story next cycle.
  @cvan Does this look good to you?
 @mkeblx Can you squash your commits?
 Just tested out GitHub squash merging. What's our opinion on that?
 I wanted @cvan feedback. I'm not sure this should have landed. We have no support for WebVR 1.0 in a-frame yet. I believe the value of hasNonPolyfillWebVRSupport is not correct after this patch.
 My bad, for some reason I thought the second comment was cvan's.
 I'm actually working on this in #1132... but thanks.
 @cvan this PR has been merged. Are you ok with this change or do you want to handle it differently?
 No, it's fine. But have to change a few other things. Finishing up my PR as we speak. 
  **Description:** `repeat` property from from material can't be used dynamically as once the `src` map is loaded, the texture won't be recreated based on a new `repeat` value.
  You can do `sceneEl.addEventListener('render-target-loaded')` or `render-started`

Maybe we should just rename that to `canvas-loaded`.
 Yeah, there're lot of ways to do that. I don't really have a recommended way of doing that yet.
 That isn't really public API. So what is the use case for forcing an update? Currently, `update` is called when the component's data changes. When would you need to call `update` when the component data has not changed? You can use `tick` to update in the background if that works, or use events.
 OK, you should use the event listeners for when the canvas is loaded or resize. From within the component.
 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/look-controls.js#L77
 Because you shouldn't have to force updates outside of the component. It should be handled by the component.
  lgtm, we'd file a follow-up issue on that obj-model dep bug. can you squash?
  **Description:**

This works as expected:

``` js
<a-plane width="12.5" height="20" position="0 0.1 0" pivot="0 0 10"
               color="#21897C" rotation="-90 0 0">
  <a-animation attribute="scale" from="1 1 0" to="1 1 1" easing="ease-out" begin="600"
                        dur="1000" fill="both"></a-animation>
</a-plane>
```

This does not:

``` js
<a-plane width="12.5" height="20" position="0 0.1 0" pivot="0 0 10"
               color="#21897C" rotation="-90 0 0" from="1 1 0">
  <a-animation attribute="scale" to="1 1 1" easing="ease-out" begin="600"

  **Description:** We could reduce the number of requestAnimationFrame if we implement THREE.VideoTexture ourselves using `tick`. Here is the source of three.js `VideoTexture`

``` js
THREE.VideoTexture = function ( video, mapping, wrapS, wrapT, magFilter, minFilter, format, type, anisotropy ) {

  THREE.Texture.call( this, video, mapping, wrapS, wrapT, magFilter, minFilter, format, type, anisotropy );

  this.generateMipmaps = false;

  var scope = this;

  function update() {

    requestAnimationFrame( update );

    if ( video.readyState === video.HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA ) {

      scope.needsUpdate = true;

    }

  }

  update();

};

THREE.VideoTexture.prototype = Object.create( THREE.Texture.prototype );
THREE.VideoTexture.prototype.constructor = THREE.VideoTexture;
```
  I also have a json loader in one of my side repos. I was thinking of creating a repo for all the loader components
 I have it at https://github.com/ngokevin/respecular/blob/master/assets/components/json-model.js

Might do: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1342 since there are so many loaders
 Ok, yeah I think we can close this in favor of gltf.  https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1339 will fix it
  Can we add a test for this?
 Should we add a test that tests the whole animation grabbing the correct `from` value if using dot notation?
 OK, that's fine. I'd emphasize that in the docstring more `getComputedAttribute that supports dot notation to look up a component property.`
 Did you see my comment about adding a more integrated test?
 I know it's a pain the ass (I'm going through this myself now) but we need to isolate the problem. @JohnRodney  Does the failure go away if you comment your test out?
 Got the tests working https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1349

I think the problem is you are creating a scene outside of the setup/teardown. We have global setup methods that expect the scene to be created in a setup handler.

 I can volunteer to pick this up.
 @JohnRodney I have restarted the travis build. It seems you need to be an admin of the repo to do it.
 Almost there. Just one more style change.
 Nice. Thanks for the patience :)
  **Description:**

Document in the `obj-model` component docs that if an MTL isn't working and you don't see your texture applied correctly, you have to dig into the MTL file to check out that all the paths are correct and that all related assets are where they should be.
 There is a [3D Models • Troubleshooting](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/introduction/models.html#troubleshooting) section in the documentation now; I think this issue can be closed if we just add a link from the `obj-model` docs.

That said, please feel free to improve these docs with PRs! :)  **Description:** For primitives, we specify a set of default components in the primitive definition. These are named defaultAttributes, but it would be more correct to call them defaultComponents. A simple grep job.
 OK. If possible, we could deprecate `defaultAttributes` for one version. So `defaultAttributes` still work, but everything is renamed to `defaultComponents`. If we detect `defaultAttributes`, just set `defaultComponents` to `defaultAttributes`.
  Sounds awesome. Could you publish an example so we could try it out? As a separate component would be cool so people can try it out in the meantime while waiting for possible merge + release.
 It's not a priority at the moment. @intensr Can you describe your use case?   I did some investigation, and it appears that the primitive attributes (e.g., `src`) aren't taking into account previous component attribute values (e.g., `material`).

Obviously because the primitive attributes break entity-component pattern, it can get confusing combining attributes like `material` and `src` - because you have to merge the existing properties of `material` with the properties that will change from modifying `src`. I didn't check, but I'd assume the same issues occur with mixins with component attributes.
 Mixins are fine.
  Yeah, maybe let's include that as a start for embedded/inline scenes? That's one of our goals:

like: `boilerplate-embedded-scenes`
 @enjalot this is almost ready - let us know when you've made the minor changes above. thanks! :smile: 
 Patch looks good. Still a bit of work to go for better support for embedded scenes, but this is a big step:

  **Description:** Stringification to DOM, and using the DOM to fetch data is one of the bottlenecks in perf.

We only want to stringify to DOM if the DOM inspector is open (still want to debounce that) or a flag is set. This may affect integration with other libraries, in which case the flag can be turned on.

  @dmarcos This looks pretty good. He made it not explicitly check for color, just let it fall through the if/else statements, saving about probably 50 LOC. I think even if we add more interpolation types, this should still hold.

(In that, I discovered an issue that is not related to this PR: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1334)
 I think we're ready to squash, and @dmarcos to sign off.
 Yeah that'd be great. An `test-animations-color` example would be cool too.
 We need to organize/rename the examples. But `test-` examples, to me, are examples that you check to make sure a particular feature works. They all have stats enabled on the scene at the moment so we can check mobile stats, but we could re-eval that.
 woo! this is awesome! :tada: 
 Thanks, hope you're better!
 @JohnRodney Is there any work left here?
 @JohnRodney Thanks! I hope the sun shines soon over there.
 OK, that should be the last of it!
 Awesome! I'll merge this once I get to the office.
 Thanks so much!!! That was a long process, but everything works, and your example is pretty cool and running at 60fps  :)
  You press the physical back button on your Android. I have a branch that updates to use the latest webvr-polyfill which now features a graphical back button on mobile in the top-left corner (used to be part of the webvr-boilerplate). There have been a few iOS bugs in the latest webvr-polyfill version so we've been holding off on updating: borismus/webvr-polyfill#46 and borismus/webvr-polyfill#57 Will be updating soon though, so stay tuned.
 > How can I add another back button to go back to other screen then if the back button is for switching between normal and vr mode?

what do you mean "other screen"? on Android devices, pressing the physical back button will exit Fullscreen; pressing the physical back button twice will take you back in history in the browser. on iOS, since there there is no Fullscreen API, when you rotate from landscape to portrait we let you exit VR mode.

clicking on webvr-polyfill's back button icon exits Fullscreen on Android but doesn't do anything on iOS. it should exit pseudo-fullscreen/VR mode on iOS. I'll have to open a PR for it to do that.
 wontfix, just use browser/physical back button or navigate somewhere else  Thanks for filing. I have a branch that updates to use the latest webvr-polyfill.

 Distortion is provided by the `webvr-polyfill`.  @cvan Can we close this as an aframe issue?
 > Any luck on this? Can we use the WebVRConfig json to add more buffer and add more referesh rate? the video is a bit slow, does it support stereoscopic spherical videos?

You can set it yourself before you include `aframe.js`:

``` html
  …
  <head>
    …
    <script>window.WebVRConfig = { … };</script>
    <script src="aframe.js"></script>
  </head>
  …
```

and we'll respect the config values set on `window.WebVRConfig`.
 Should look at @borismus' https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill#configuration
 > @cvan Hi Chris, am I right in reading that the latest WebVR polyfill contains the code for lens distortion and device configuration for different cardboard headsets? Do you know when aframe will update to the latest version or which branch we can get a preview from? Thanks for the help!

yes, it does. per [my comment above](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1295#issuecomment-223476637), just set this:

``` html
  …
  <head>
    …
    <script>window.WebVRConfig = {CARDBOARD_UI_DISABLED: false};</script>
    <script src="aframe.js"></script>
  </head>
  …
```
  Is this still relevant?  We use `THREE.OBJLoader` so it might be an issue with that: http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Loaders/OBJLoader
 If that's the case, I'd like to make a pull request to three.js to fix that. I'll do this.
   Note that they are percentages.
 Looks like the scene resizing is overwriting it
  thanks!
  very good catch. I updated the CodePen pen. thanks!
  Do the changes require Three r75? If not we should update three in a different PR since they're unrelated changes.
 The changes should be required for r75
 Need to update the docs about `scaleHeight`
 @ngokevin @cvan is there any reason to **not update** to Three r75?
 I tested every scene in the Examples, and everything looks perfect. good work. thanks!
 thanks!
  This can be application behavior. Use a video element in `<a-assets>`, listen to its events, and show an image texture on an entity in the meantime I'd like to work on this. Especially when videos take a while to load (which is pretty much always), having a black screen while the video loads (or having to manually apply an image texture yourself), it's just not ideal default behaviour.

The HTML5 `<video>` tag already supports the [`poster` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#attr-poster) (not just used on default HTML5 players, but it's used by YouTube/Vimeo players too).

So, like you have `<video poster="poster.png" src="poster.mp4">`, A-Frame devs could just similarly do `<a-videosphere poster="poster.png" src="poster.mp4">`.

Would be fantastic! This can be handled application level. Show image, when video ready, toggle the visible.  Almost there! It just needs a small change on the test.
 Can you update the docs as well?
 Nice! Thank you for keeping at it
  I believe this has been fixed. Thanks!
  Thanks!
  For `<a-obj-model>`, the `url()` wrapping should be done at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/extras/primitives/primitives/a-obj-model.js#L11 , maybe something wrong with the extend order.
 As a workaround, try defining it like https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/primitives/a-obj-model.md#example
 Found this issue, fixing
 @afvc the [Models → Troubleshooting](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/models.html#troubleshooting) section here is probably what you're looking for. In the `.mtl` file, you need to make sure that the textures are not stored as `C:\\Path\To\texture.png` or `/Path/To/texture.png`, but instead as `texture.png` or `images/texture.png`, based on where the image is relative to the `.mtl` file itself. I'm seeing a fair bit in that scene, including some textures. If there's a particular texture you can't get working, it might be best to write a question on Stack Overflow, tagged with "aframe", and point out the specific problem there. In Chrome, I see this:

 Hm I have no idea. :/ 

What device and browser are you using? And, any information in the JavaScript console?  @donmccurdy Is this still relevant? We want to focus efforts on `glTF`? Yeah, ok to close this I think.  Gonna consolidate my ideas here:
- Maybe controls components need their own registration API and prototype? `AFRAME.registerControls` :white_check_mark: 
- Could probably rename `universal-controls` to just `controls`. :white_check_mark: 
- <strike>Perhaps all registered controls include universal-controls as a dependency so it doesn't need to be explicitly attached.</strike>
- Might be good opportunity to utilize/expand the new `Systems` API (global scope/services). A controls system might have controls register their elements, and it might consolidate all updates to one tick. :white_check_mark: 
- <strike>Might want a `default-control-scheme` component that just sets all the control components appropriately</strike>

Summary:
- `<a-entity camera controls="rotation: custom-controls hmd-controls gamepad-controls mouse-controls; position: hmd-controls wasd-controls" mouse-controls="pointerLock: true">`: Controls component defines precedence though it will have default configuration if not specified. Controls can be configured within the individual components. :white_check_mark: 
- rotation/position controls can be registered with `AFRAME.registerControls` which they can define active/delta/getters :white_check_mark: 

Example `registerControls` API:

``` js
/**
 * registerControls automatically detects whether it modifies position, rotation, or both.
 * It will categorize it inside the `controls` system.
 * The `controls` component uses the `controls` system to know which controls are available.
 */
AFRAME.registerControls('airplane', {
  isVelocityActive: function () {},
  getVelocityDelta: function () {},
  getVelocity: function () {},
  isRotationActive: function () {},
  getRotationDelta: function () {},
  getRotation: function () {}
});
```
 I think `position` makes sense over `movement` to keep the mapping. Just as `rotation` modifies `rotation`, `position` modifies `position`. It also maps well to terms like "positional tracking".
 I love that this controls system will automatically disable pointerlock/mousedrag/gamepad when an HMD is connected.
 I would keep `mouse-controls` together for now and re-evaluate later. It is nicer for code to split them up, though if someone wants to use pointer-lock over mousedrag, they would have to redefine the whole controls rotation order, rather than just flipping a flag.
 Nice, how much do you got left before you think it's ready for full line-by-line review phase?
 There's also docs if you want to handle that as well, else I could pitch in.
 - Also need to update all examples to use the new controls.
- Need to update the default camera configuration in `systems/camera.js`.
 Found an edge case where updating `mouse-controls.pointerlockEnabled` to `true` in the DOM inspector instantly crashes Firefox
 @donmccurdy go ahead with the docs and the unit tests
 Nice on the docs. Yeah, good to keep it simple and in one page for now.

We're probably going to split up the geometry component documentation later, so we might do it with the controls to be consistent and give it its own little section. But later.
 Thanks, will test positional tracking tomorrow.
1. What's the context?
2. That seems okay to me. We can always change it later if we come up with API verbiage.
 Should we insert `enabled: {default: true}` into the schema automatically and have it work out of the box? Then you wrap every `is*Active` and automatically return depending on `data.enabled`.
 **Testing:**

Haven't testing positional tracking yet because I left my camera in SF...

 I get an `component/control not registered` error when I try my custom component alongside a standard one:

``` html
<a-entity camera
          controls="position: hmd-controls; rotation: comfort-turn-keyboard-controls mouse-controls"></a-entity>
```
 I'm trying it out here: https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-comfort-turn-controls/blob/master/index.js#L123

Couldn't get the `getRotationDelta` to get called. Will try more tmr.
 @dmarcos A couple of questions about strong changes to the direction the project we'd like your input on.
 @dmarcos and I talked.

Going to keep `keyboard-controls` around as a placeholder to ease into new locomotion. But the compromise for VR is that we remove it from the default camera, and have it go in "steps" rather than continuous motion. We can add the step/teleportation in later, but I imagine it wouldn't use the velocity API.
 By steps kevin meant that instead of continuous movement like wasd-controls do now we would move on discrete steps. You teleport 1 unit forward each time you press 'W'. The step should be configurable. There's no acceration or easing that can cause motion sickness
 This might complicate things, but perhaps we need `getPosition`. For HMD positional tracking, I don't think we want velocity controlling the position because the position should always absolute. When I move the camera up above the tracking volume, there's some leftover velocity that keeps moving the camera up and up even though the HMD is no longer moving.
 OK, I found my comfort turn snap controls aren't working because both my controls and the HMD controls use `getRotation` so the HMD controls are overwriting changes from my controls.
- Comfort Turn changes rotation by 15 degrees from the current rotation using `getRotation` on keyboard press.
- HMD is active again and sets its absolute rotation using `getRotation`, overwriting comfort turn.
 OK. Let's try `getPosition` that calculates velocity under the hood. And make rotation absolute (though if you didn't want it absolute, how would you do it?).

The main use cases for the controls component I think is:
- HMD - has to be absolute and exact. any controls changing the rotation would probably not want easing
- Vive controllers - has to be absolute and exact. but will still want to calculate velocity and angular velocity data and case you want to hit stuff
- But will still have to support flat experience controls? (drag-look, wasd for now, which we may want to snap by default as well)

Do we replace velocity with position, or do we add getPosition? That sort of solves the issue from earlier with rotation mapping to rotation but position mapping to velocity.
 OK, comfort turn controls work for me now.

Let's publish touch controls separately as well for reasons discussed above (recommendations on movement in VR, reserve for interaction, less code to maintain/test for us).

I'll have to wait until next week to get access to a headset, I'm abroad atm :(
 Disregard my deleted comments, I think I needed to restart my server.
 OK, I think most stuff works. We're going to land the new WebVR API soon so the hmd-controls might need changing in a bit. @dmarcos will update the current look-controls so we'd port those changes over.
 Got your rift? WOOT!
 @dmarcos just landed the WebVR 1.0 API changes. Just need to port his changes from the old look-controls. 
 Changes to look-controls at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1423/files#diff-6285039eee70ed830f70f7d2f7b7dfa5R33 

Gonna test this out and see what needs changing.
 I think in the context of the controls component, makes sense to be just `positionEnabled` and `rotationEnabled`. Only for `<a-camera>` does it need to be explicit.
 OK, I tested this with Vive + Oculus. Mostly works, but compared to `master`, it is jankier. Any ideas why? Maybe something around the velocity stuff.

I see that we have a `getPositionDelta` now. For controllers + HMD, should we just make `getPosition`? Those don't really care about the velocity, we just want to set absolute pose, right?

Right now, what's the flow for updating the position? Is it:
- Get new position
- Get delta using old position
- Use delta to calculate velocity
- Have velocity set position
 Not sure about having velocity update the position of the HMD. If you lose tracking, the velocity will just keep going, right? The tracking needs to be on point, velocity introduces some unpredictability with that.

Hmm, I'll have to think about the absolute vs. relative position. 

Yeah, no easing for tracked inputs. I'm not sure how that will play for flat experiences. Will need to think more on that also. For teleporting, you can use a wrapper entity.
 The post-processing PR adds support for tick/tock. So you could put controls before position. I'll try to see if that helps.
 I think a phase or order is starting to sound good. That's what the PP PR did at first... Will think about that.
 Would the next step for this be to decouple the controls from the velocity, and for physics we can have velocity be inferred based on changes to position?
 Not sure. I tested it by turning my head around quickly a lot, but maybe caused by subtle changes in position?

Are there any disadvantages of pulling out velocity?
 Looks like velocity wasn't the issue, still getting some lag. Have you tried testing the PR vs. master? I usually test on the geometry gallery scene.

On the Chromium builds (WebVR API 1.0), master is smooth, and the PR has some slight jank when turning head.

On Firefox Nightly (old WebVR API), master is smooth, and the PR stutters a lot when turning head.
 Awesome, everything looks good so far. Looks amazingly smooth on CV1. The Vive looks good so far, I'll have to side-by-side compare it to master more.

In the component property, I would rename rotationControlsEnabled/positionControlsEnabled to just rotationEnabled/positionEnabled. To be consistent and less redundant within the context.
 @dmarcos This seems ready for review after passing manual regression testing.

Note that we disabled `keyboard-controls` by default. Perhaps let's enable `keyboard-controls` by default again, but perhaps put it before `hmd-controls` in terms of precedence. This allows flat experiences to move around, but dissuades against using it for VR. Either way, this will be a change, what do you prefer?
 Yeah, I think we can have touch-drag back, but only if it doesn't affect tapping.
 @ngokevin about adding `keyboard-controls` before `hmd-controls`, what's the effect? Keyboard controls aren't active unless a key is down, so I don't follow how/if that would dissuade their use in VR (although I agree with the goal).
 I've added TODOs in the original comment for those last two items (resolving conflicts with #1474, and adding `touch-controls`).

Before I do that though, @dmarcos, do you have concerns with merging this into core, or is it just a matter of doing a full review? I'm really just playing catch-up-and-rebase at this point, and I see you have incoming changes to `look-controls`.. Fine with me if this should be separate, or put into an `aframevr/aframe-controls` repo or something, but let's make that decision with v0.3.0 coming up. Thanks!
 Let's look at this first thing post 0.3.0. This is a big change and I'm worried about rushing it.
 I'm currently writing integration unit tests for controls to cover all the cases, protect from regressions, and since there's currently no coverage. Combined with your unit tests, that should make getting this large change through easier once we get to it.
 @ngokevin sounds good! I'm traveling until Monday so I'll be slow on replies, but will try to take a look at those integration tests.
 I think we'll close this for now due to age and amount of work. What A-Frame has now can be considered a sensible default geared for WebVR, and other control schemes are welcome as community plugins. Both thanks and sorry for the amount of work on this. Could perhaps revisit later on?

Though I think perhaps we could take the Pointer Lock pieces and hook it up to full screen mode for A-Frame if you don't have a headset. Makes sense to me, no problem. There are also enough open questions about encapsulating a 'player' and keeping arbitrary controller components aligned with teleporting, that maybe it's better to come at any controls changes from the direction of roomscale, rather than touch/gamepad/keyboard as done here. (Referring to #2265)  Thanks! Can you do segmentsPhi as well?
 Aye, good catch.
 Future ref, you can append commit message with `(fixes #ISSUENUMBER)` so that issue auto closes on merge
 @ngokevin as I discovered, it'll auto-close the issue only if the author is added as a ["Collaborator"](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/settings/collaboration) to the project. I wish GitHub did that automatically.
 As long as it's in the PR message when one of us merges it, it'll close.
  Thanks!
  Nice! Can you squash your commits?
 What happened to this?
 You don't have to close it. Just force-push to the branch and the pull request will update. I guess now you can just re-open or open a new one.
  Thanks!
  **Description:**

If a user has **Portrait Orientation Lock** ¹ enabled (like any sane user does such as myself), we should tell the user. The first time we added this back in November/December, I was confused initially because nothing happened when I rotated my phone from portrait to landscape. I just kept seeing "Insert phone into Cardboard holder." Then, doy! I realised I had portrait orientation lock on, and since we only hide that message when an `orientationchange` event fires (which never would with portrait orientation lock on), nothing happened. FWIW, the **[webvr-polyfill](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill)** has the same problem.

Also, FWIW, I know I'm not alone. I've seen two other people encounter the same problem as I did. I do realise not everyone has portrait orientation lock on, but let's give a good experience. Otherwise, folks will just leave the site if it seems broken.

Anyway, we can easily solve the potential user confusion in this case. Using `deviceorientation` events, if we detect the user turned the phone landscape on iOS (or any mobile browser where the Fullscreen API is not supported) but no `orientationchange` event has fired, then let's add a small message below `Insert phone into Cardboard holder` that says `Disable Portrait Orientation Lock`.

- A-Frame Version: `0.1.2`, `master`
- Platform/Device: iOS/Android
 This gets me every time! This is technically a bug of the webvr-polyfill. We ought to fix it there.
  **Description:**

WebKit does not support the Fullscreen API. In Safari for iOS, fullscreen can be emulated using `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">` (which A-Frame already injects if `meta[name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable"]` doesn't already exist on the page).

Chrome and Firefox for iOS unfortunately do not support such a method of pseudo-fullscreen. In both browsers though, as you scroll down on a page, the chrome navbar disappears. But because we are `preventDefault`-ing on `touchmove` on the `canvas` and the `html` has `position: fixed` styles, this doesn't work. I have a WIP branch that sets iOS-only styles that adds a bunch of `padding-bottom` to the `html` element and then when the user swipes down, it works.

Calling `window.scrollTo` or setting `document.body.scrollTop` doesn't seem to work. I'll have to investigate that some more though. That'd be the "ideal hack."
 As stated above, Firefox for iOS (like Chrome for iOS) hides the chrome nav bar when a user scrolls down the page. Safari for iOS hides the chrome nav bar in landscape if `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">` exists on the page. We should get Firefox for iOS to do the same pseudo-fullscreen behaviour if `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">` exists on the page (which is what Chrome 32-39 used before using the W3C manifest: https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/installtohomescreen#fallback).

We should file a bug for Firefox for iOS to do this.
 This issue can be fixed in A-Frame's dependency, [`webvr-polyfill`](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill). When this issue is properly addressed and fixed, this will also be fixed in A-Frame too: googlevr/webvr-polyfill#114 @MagicIndustries you can do "Add to Homescreen" on iOS. Do you have a URL of your site andcau explain the user flow and what you're expecting vs. encountering. On a related note, have you seen these comments?

  **Description:** Everything in the examples directory is under one level, though we have multiple categories. We have asset folders prefixed with underscores in this directory as well. We should:
- Put all examples under one more directory respective to their category. For example, `examples/showcase-composite` would become `examples/showcase/composite`.
- Move all assets under the directory of their respective example. For example, `ui/1.png` should move to `examples/showcase/curved-mockups` since it is being used in that example only. This helps keep track of which asset belongs to which example, and if an example is removed, then it ensures the related assets are as well.
- Optionally, very commonly-used assets (at least three uses) live in an `examples/assets` folder.
- A-Frame Version: master
 @BhasinParth go ahead!
 @BhasinParth What's the problem exactly? You should move the images under the directory of each example unless they're shared by multiple of them.
 @BhasinParth you have to open a Pull Request against the master branch. https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/
 Going to work on this.
 #1394 
  **Description:** It is a common pattern to add event listeners in `play()` and remove them in `pause()`, but it is a lot of work to do for each component, and it ends up not being done at all. Perhaps have a utility that automatically does this. Like:

``` js
// Listener is only added on `play()` or if `isPlaying`.
// When `pause()`, the listener is automatically detached.
// If this is not desired, then one can still use native addEventListener.
Component.addEventListener(element, eventName, handler);
```

  @cvan Anything in the top of your mind?
 I haven't changed anything here yet. I am in #1132 but haven't touched it. I will investigate though.
 Investigated this a bit and figured out a solution. A slight regression occurred (I think when the code was moved to a component): On iOS, the orientation modal doesn't appear until you rotate to landscape then rotate to portrait again. If the device is in portrait mode when VR mode is entered, the orientation modal doesn't show up. (In A-Frame 0.1.2, this works as expected.)

On Android, the orientation modal never shows up. There's an explicit check for only iOS; that's because it's assumed that iOS is the only mobile platform where the Fullscreen API isn't supported. This is mostly true (except Windows phone; I know, not a big deal here). Anyway, I have a fix for this too.
 FWIW, it was working 2 weeks ago https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1111
 From what I found, it works only when you rotate to landscape immediately after entering VR mode then go back to portrait. Anyway, not sure which commit caused it; I didn't bother bisecting. But I've got a fix on the way, and it addresses a few other edge cases. And a few others, but I'm going to open up separate PRs for those.
 Yeah, I think that's always been an issue. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/879
 > Yeah, I think that's always been an issue. #879

ah, well then this bug is a dupe
  You can control the HTML5 video element used to create the texture https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/components/material.md#video-textures ... e.g, `<video>.pause()`
  **Description:** Currently, child entities initialize before parent entities. The scene is the most-parent/root "entity". Thus, all entities initialize before the scene. This means that scene components aren't initialized when entities are initialized. This might cause components having to register listeners to the scene to do things such as retrieve the canvas. We should initialize scene components first (for now, all of them, until we see a use case to not do so).
- A-Frame Version: master
- Platform/Device: all
 Canvas initialization and other logic has moved from components to the scene itself. Not sure if this is still relevant. Should we close?  Probably keep using a-entity. Those aren't deprecated. a-camera and a-cursor are helpers and we'd rather have these examples not be testing that layer
 Thanks!
 a-camera and a-cursor are just aliases of a-entities + components. These test examples illustrate how to configure a camera and a cursor using components. If we use primitives / aliases we lose the learning value.
 @amberroy nice! thanks! can you squash your commits?
  Similarly, might also want to check if sound is already playing before playing
 In `tests/components/sound.test.js`, can we add a small test?:

``` js
suite('pause', function () {
  test('checks if playing before pausing', function () {
    var el = this.el;
    el.pause();
    el.pause();
  });
});
```
 I can add the test.
 @ngokevin You should let contributors handle that. PRs have to come with tests or they won't merge.

   Do you think this belongs as a standard shader? It could function well either on your GitHub with you maintaining it, or within an examples/ directory.
 I always think about making a-frame a more flexible alternative to shader toy that you can embed in any page. If the toy shader is part of the examples or a separate module the message gets diluted. 
 As cool as Shader Toy is, it seems not-very-core to be catering to one service or website as a standard module. It is a "toy" after all. I don't think it will dilute the message much as long as we showcase it well, and being able to lazy-load curated shaders will help too.

At the very least, we could move it to the `extras/` directory. 
 I also want a-frame to be an outreach tool for computer graphics knowledge among devs. The cost of shipping with it (50 lines) it's negligable compared to the potential upside. I think it's a delightful easter egg. 
 Easter egg would be a perfect reason to put it in `extras/`. I agree Shader Toy is a good community to tap into but not by bloating the core API. This is debatable, but the only upside I realistically see is bragging rights.

I'm worried about the focus here. We've had a good sense on keeping a clean API and thus reducing code we have to maintain. I've had one-LOC PRs rejected on this basis, let alone 50 LOC! I hope we can keep our focus on WebVR.
 it can be in extras if shipped with the build. the 50 loc don't increase API surface, they don't run if not used. And the shader can be used also to generate cool viz in VR mode. the potential if these techniques catch on is huge. The cost is totally worth it
 @cvan this is flagged as WIP. not worth going over nits at this stage
 @cvan this is flagged as WIP. not worth going over nits at this stage

just for your reference - you'll need to clean them up regardless
 Question, is any part of this PR actually ShaderToy specific? Or is it just inspired by ShaderToy?
 It's just inspired on. I want a mechanism that allows creating 100% procedural scenes a la Shader Toy.  An easy way to explore techniques like raymarching.
 OK, that makes me happier. If it was ShaderToy-specific, I'd have qualms.
 Might change to `shader: raymarch`
 It's not specific to raymarching. We can change the name of the shader to something else. The core idea is having a shader that allows you specify a scene entirely in a provided fragment shader. It gives a normalized set of uniforms like camera, time delta, mouse coordinates, controller position... That's what shader toy is about.
 In later evolutions we can create a declarative layer to compose the fragment that the shader uses. So people can easily share and consume shader chunks.
 I can see new and enhanced uniforms + allowing specifying shaders from HTML. Does that sum up the PR?
 Going to close due to inactivity / age. We can open this when it's ready again and have a fresh PR.
 i want to keep it open
 @blairmacintyre This just did not get prioritized but I'm more than happy to revisit if there's interest. What this does it's what you described. It adds some extra uniforms that shader toy has a standard API. As it is you can almost copy and paste shader toy shaders this is cool. did you still want to have this live in this repo? or want to move it to its own repo under the `aframevr` org? I'd r- this. Still don't think it's right to cater to a service; people can do in a custom component, or as one-off component. Squeezing into the material component doesn't work as well and more to maintain. In the end, raymarching is too expensive to work well in VR scenes anyways, and Shadertoys' would only work on flat planes. IMO this is best packaged as component which is the approach I took for Shaderfrog Closing this since it's outdated and I want to revisit in a different form.  **Description:** Improve overall cursor + raycaster components with respect to performance, configuration, and code quality. This is a stepping stone for more complex cursor/interactions later on.

**[DEMO](http://ngokevin.github.io/aframe/examples/test-raycaster/)**

**Changes proposed:**
- Don't use requestInterval which adds an additional requestAnimationFrame call. Work off of the existing tick handler.
- Generalize raycaster component for general use rather than just the cursor. Allow specifying the near, far, recursive. Thus decoupling raycaster and cursor, and having cursor be an abstraction of the raycaster.
- Raycaster origin/direction can be set with position/rotation of entities
- Allow passing in a list of entities (via selector) that the raycaster should intersect rather than intersecting everything
- Allow passing in a list of entities to ignore
- Return full intersection data in events
- Move intersectioncleared/mouseleave logic to the cursor component to remove cursor/raycaster coupling
- Be able to update the raycaster 
- Prefix event/state names with respective component (`cursor-`/`raycaster-`)
- Removed `cursor.maxDistance` as it was redundant with `raycaster.far` 
- Fully unit test the raycaster and cursor components
 Yeah, returning full intersection data is part of the changes in that huge list.
 @dmarcos r?

  Thanks! A few changes + squash and we ship this :)
 I plan on handling everything at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1196, such as returning full intersection data. Thanks for the PR though! Sorry for your time.
  **Description:**

Heard reports of A-Frame scenes not loading in IE10. Makes sense to not support <= IE9. But perhaps IE10 is worth addressing. In my tests, scenes load fine in Edge on Windows 8.1 + Windows 10.
- A-Frame Version: 0.1.0 (on https://aframe.io/examples/)
- Platform/Device: IE10 on Windows
 IE 10? As far as I know IE 10 does not even support WebGL. Can we close this?
 Who's using IE 10 and why trying to load WebGL/VR scenes?

<hr>

@bryik: the [Anime UI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9kmhkXbM5H8WDF0OWFjVVoxWWs/view) issue I've encountered once or twice. Very peculiar.
 @cvan In the original description you mention IE 10
 I'm going to close this. IE 11 does not even have complete support for CustomEvents http://caniuse.com/#feat=customevent.
  Can you be a bit more precise about the problem? What do you exactly mean by "double click for navigating"? Do you mean "enter VR"?
 When you say navigating through your application what do you exactly mean? Can you point to an a-frame example where the same problem reproduces? 
 I still don't understand what the problem is. Can you share a link so we can look into it?
 Don't include A-Frame twice. Either NPM install it, **or** include it as a script tag, but not both.
  it looks great! Thanks!
  looks good to me. @ngokevin?
 @IagoLast thanks a lot! can you squash your commits?
 tube is radiusTubular
 Thanks for doing this!
 Thanks! I'm gonna make a few small changes myself in another commit.
  Looks good! Thanks and Welcome as a contributor! :)
  Nice! @K4orta Does this also solve when an a-frame scene is open within the twitter app using its appview?
 @K4orta I think it's specific to the Webkit based views. But It seems to work in the Facebook app web view.
 I confirm that this fixes the issue on the twitter WebView. Thanks a lot. This bug is a tricky one to figure out unless you're well seasoned in WebKit matters.
 Thanks! Saved me couple hours of my life.
  @alexcheninfo We've [deprecated](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/dev#a-frame) the `dev` branch. We are doing all work in `master` now. [The new docs](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/guide/getting-started.md#npm) reflect that, but we haven't pushed them live to https://aframe.io/docs/ yet.

Sorry for the confusion. VR mode should be working for you just fine on `master`.
 i..e, `npm install aframevr/aframe`
  Description: Slow, laggy for A-Frame. Pure three.js (circa. r70) is fine.
- A-Frame Version: 0.1.3
- Platform/Device: Android mobile (S6, Note 4, Note 5)
 Bad performance on iPhone 5 is expected as it runs nearly 4-year old hardware. We haven't come up with an official list of supported devices yet, but iPhone 5 is too old to become on that list (especially since the screen would be too small for VR).
 What demo exaclty? content with video? Scenes with lots of geometry? Lots of different textures? This issue is not actionable.
 Every demo. Like 15 FPS. Is that actionable?

Try Anime UI which runs perfectly smooth in iPhone.
 I will get more information later, but it's pretty widespread and easily noticable.
 @bryik thanks for testing, glad to know it's not on all Android. Don't think this is actionable, @dmarcos pointed out Android accelerometer hardware might not provide data very quickly.
  @IagoLast  Does setting fill="backwards" / fill="forwards" do what you need? 

https://aframe.io/docs/core/animation.html#Fill
 That won't do. We have code that always resets to initial value on `.stop()`.
 Maybe `stop` should consider the fill value.
  This is almost ready to go. @bnolan a couple of quick changes and we can merge
 Thanks!
  You can listen to window click in parallel, the entity's "click" can mean different things, but not necessarily associated to a hardware mouse  check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia . 
 also https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill/blob/master/src/webcam-position-sensor-vr-device.js
  There's a timeout attribute on a-assets:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/dev/src/core/a-assets.js#L26

It has a default value of 3000ms but we should maybe remove the timeout by default. @ngokevin what do you think?
 I think the issue is that the event is not firing at the right time.
 Maybe it is cached? But I wouldn't doubt there's a bug, the assets system definitely needs to be put through its strides.
  Expected: one single event once all assets loaded
 Thanks, this is fixed: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/5728902d29cc73b12269f41d5417ae92ab63ae77
  Good catch! Thanks!
  One option:
1. When unknown component is attached to an entity, store the component in an object.

``` js
var queuedComponents = {
  'some-unknown-component': [el1, el2, el3]
}
```
1. When a component is registered, and there is a queue for it, init the component on each entity.

``` js
queuedComponents[registeredComponent].forEach(initComponent);
```
 Good point. Will have to think about that. I hope there's a pub-sub way to do it without introducing asynchronous code into the core API because that will become infectious and spread through the entire codebase.
 - Entity attaches component that is not yet registered. That component is later registered. The entity initializes the component.
- `<a-hyperbolic-star>` and `<a-hyperbolic-grouping-thing>` are not components. If you mean primitives, those are just entities that attach components.
- Most logic will be in `src/core/entity.js`. Perhaps some in `src/core/component.js`

Implementation details and dependencies not sure about yet. This issue is marked as `easy` but that's more of a `help-wanted` label.
 We are currently exploring the trade-offs and ramifications of allowing this.
 I think we are not going to do this. It quickly gets messy. What happens when a component that is not yet registered is initialized via a `setAttribute`? Waiting for it to register will cause a big delay.
 Is this still considered "help wanted"? 

This issue seems to come up a lot, e.g. it's not possible to use the JS panel in Codepen because it is appended at the end of `<body/>`. And, for that matter, putting JS at the end of the body tag is pretty common practice.

Couple ideas:

1. At the bare minimum, component registration should throw an error if run after a scene has been parsed. Silently ignoring the newly registered components is not what the developer expects, and this is a common source of confusion.
2. Agreed that resolving dependencies is difficult. My suggestion would be, if the scene gets to the point of initializing components and any components have dependencies that haven't been registered yet, don't wait or delay — throw an error. Then, we've simplified things and all that's left is a way to initialize on attributes that are already in the DOM. If a developer has some components above the scene with dependencies on components below the scene, that still won't work, but I think we can very reasonably consider that an error scenario rather than trying to accommodate it. We won't go for this due to the potential complications. 

Will see for another issue for warnings about component registered after a scene  I made similar changes for the [a-invaders demo](http://swimminglessonsformodernlife.com/a-invaders/) but never submitted them as a PR. For wasd-controls I see use cases where you want to constraint / invert movement on a specific axis or assign WS and AD keys to a different axis:

https://github.com/dmarcos/a-invaders/blob/master/js/components/wasd-controls.js#L20

@RSpace What do you think?
 BTW, while the review process goes down, for clients, feel free to copy-and-paste the look-controls, modify it, register it under a different name, and use it.
 Nice. I think the idea of forking/remixing of components is interesting. I can imagine a site where you can write components with a live editor, share them, and remix them. Like CodePen for components.
 I'm going to tag this as needs-dependencies-fixed for #975
 We may be looking to overhaul the controls API, meaning this patch will have to change. Going to keep it open for now in case we want it later.
 I am going to close this for now. With Don's patch, all the code will completely change. Once that lands, we can evaluate adding this. Thanks!
  We don't want to enable vertical panning by default on mobile. It's disorienting when combined with the orientation given by the phone sensors. You quickly lose track of what's up or down and rotating the phone becomes frustrating. It's a better experience to constraint panning to the y axis
 I don't think it will scale to enable/maintain every controls use case under the sun. For now, I recommend forking the controls like you have. And hopefully https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/975 will make it easier to extend the controls.
  Keep track of things we should document further. Megathread so we don't have individual issues for small parts or typos we should document or fix.
- [ ] animation + cursor
 Yeah can you pr? Thanks!
 Don't think we need to an issue for this. If you find something, PR it! :)
  Nice!
  - `tests` should be `test`
- and added a few more
  Can you rebase, get rid of those misc commits.
 Almost there! :). You need to squash and remove this comment:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1140/files#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8R3
 Probably easiest to just start over with a fresh branch since you got a merge commit in there. Cherry-pick the single commit onto a fresh branch and re-PR.
 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1143
  Thanks! And thanks @larouxn for testing :)
 Can you open this against the Master branch?
  I'm fine with ignoring them. @ngokevin what do you think?

Opened up a PR against three.js to fix several things in `VREffect`: mrdoob/three.js#8330

Needs testing + help in
- Firefox for Android
- Chrome for Android

I tried for quite a while but the remote debugging workflow was a PITA and I kept getting weird issues. Anyway, on Android, stereo upon clicking the "Enter VR" button is not working and some resize issues have been introduced. I don't yet know if they're related to pieces of A-Frame I've touched, `VREffect`, or latest `webvr-polyfill` w/ WebVR 1.0 API changes. Help needed!
 @masom Thanks for helping
 Travis complains
 @K4orta Thanks for testing this
 thanks, y'all. any help with figuring out how to get Android (and all other browsers) to play nicely when
- `navigator.getVRDisplays` is polyfilled by webvr-polyfill
- `navigator.getVRDevices` is polyfilled by webvr-polyfill
- `navigator.getVRDisplays` is natively supported
- `navigator.getVRDevices` is natively supported

https://github.com/cvan/three.js/blob/fix-vreffect-safari/examples/js/effects/VREffect.js
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/8330/files

https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill/issues/41 would help identify more reliably whether the interfaces are polyfilled.

thoughts with the `VREffect` changes?
 I think there will be more progress this week as the team gets back together. This PR is high priority.
 branch updated. sorry for the delay, folks. currently, there are quite a few changes/regressions with `THREE.VREffect` and [webvr-polyfill](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill) that need to be resolved. also, the 1.0 API implementation in the Chromium builds is _very_ buggy and unreliable, but I'm glad it exists. so, I'm experiencing a lot of WebGL crashes, and the logs are cryptic (to me at least). anyway, could use some help with this. @ngokevin, do you have some cycles early next week to help?
 yes
 I've tried this PR with on Chromium WebVR 1.0 + CV1 + Windows 10. Android and iOS. The only weird thing I've seen is that Android does not trigger stereo mode. @cvan Is that the only thing that was missing?
 @cvan Do you have a list of the open problems on the VREffect/VRControls/WebVR-polyfill front?
 Do we need to import all the individual files of the webvr-polyfill? We can just use the dist/bundle? I've realized that webvr-polyfill imports the three.js Math library. We could cut its size in more than half if we build the polyfill to use the THREE math we already have in aframe.
 I close this in favor of https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1423
@cvan can you provide feedback
  We will be working on standard physics implementation and collision detection some time.

You can use https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-physics-components 
  Follow up to @legendtang's https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1099
 I know the naming is unrelated, but perhaps could call it just `query` à la `xtag.query`:

https://x-tag.github.io/

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/203725/13662508/e4c1ce54-e64f-11e5-84c3-5bd005169f49.png)
 @cvan But x-tag requires additional polyfills for mainstream browsers for now. Maybe too early to use this name?

I was not suggesting to use X-Tag, just using its method names as inspiration/prior art. And we are already using a polyfill for Custom Elements: https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element - I've heard bugs with the polyfill, and we have an issue (#567) on file to investigate if the more "popular" [WebComponentsJS Custom Elements polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/tree/master/src/CustomElements) fixes the bugs/inconsistencies we've seen between native and polyfilled.
 Hard to tell whether you are selecting one element or multiple with `query`. And I think selector/selectorAll is easier to get what it means. (query)selector/selectorAll are in the browser and probably make a stronger for "prior art".
 yeah, I think that's a good point. though jQuery seems to handle this fine - `$()` vs `$()[0]`. I've always liked `$` vs `$$`. but, the naming you have is fine.
 Yeh. This is for property types though, not for manually running queries.
  Thanks!
  Can you squash your two commits into one?
 Thanks! Good work!
  @larouxn Thanks for catching that up 
  Thanks!
  @ngokevin Should fit-texture be a property of the flat/standard components instead of a separate one?
 It's very edge case because it only works well for the plane geometry, and is mostly for `<a-video>`. I don't think this crosses the line for being a standard component, but we make this a third-party component and document this harder.
 Then maybe once we have lazy-loading curated components, this won't even need to be a standard component. Does that sound alright?
 Yeah, thinking about it again, images/videos on planes will be very common. Gonna rethink this.
 This component seems to only work with primitives that expose a height /width attributes. Two problems:
1. Primitives other than a-image or a-plane might expose height and width that have different semantics.
2. We shouldn't couple components to primitve APIs. Primitives are just aliases for an entity and a set of components.

If we are going to implement a fit-texture it should be implemented at the material component level
 Let me know if you disagree, but I think this is better as a third-party component.

In some cases, you might not want to keep it to proportion. And usually if a component is for convenience and could be done thru other means, it doesn't need to belong in the core. 
 It's a fine line to decide between usefulness and inclusion to core code. We're thinking more on the stricter side. Gives us less code to maintain, allows module ownership, and with the component system, this can be used by anyone that would like it.

Just a matter of teaching and showcasing to devs about these cool components.
 Would be awesome if you can publish it in a repo or code snippet!
  Thanks!
  Not to revert that, but to have removeState look up the index.

Better to return `true` because index `0` should be a truthy case.
 Fixed in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1115
  Nice. Thanks! Can you squash your commits?
 Thanks a lot!
  If you are inlining the URL to the material component (as the `<a-video/sphere>` elements) do, then the video element created will loop by default. I will document this.

It is recommended to provide your own video element:

``` html
<a-assets>
  <video id="my-video" src="vid.mp4">
</a-assets>

<a-video src="#my-video>
```
 Added to doc list at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1072
  Currently can't pass position as a single number. Has to be X Y Z

We have issue on file https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/451
 Actually the issue on file is just for scale. Position should be three numbers always
 Here's a demo: https://codepen.io/donmccurdy/pen/qxEpzy. Note that you can see only one `<a-sky/>` initially, but if you swap the order of the DOM elements you will be able to see both photospheres.

This problem occurs, in one form or another, in all realtime WebGL renderers. Because of certain limitations in the WebGL API, three.js renders opaque objects followed by transparent objects, sorting the objects in each group from back-to-front. Because these are spheres surrounding the camera, three.js can't effectively sort them, and so depending on the default order in the DOM you get different results.

You can work around the problem sometimes, reordering objects or by setting `el.object3D.renderOrder`, but neither three.js nor A-Frame can automatically guess how to resolve this problem in all cases. For more information see https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/4724.

Note that if you don't need partially-transparent materials, but just want to see through the 100% transparent parts of a PNG or GIF, you can set `material="alphaTest:0.5"` _without_ setting `transparency`, and avoid many of these issues. This can be helpful for things like leaves, fences, and shrubbery.  Nice! Thank you!
  To hide/show an entity you can use the visible attribute 

``` html
<a-entity visible="false:></a-entity>
```

We have [mixins](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/examples/test-mixin/index.html#L12) as an analog of CSS. This allows you to group a set of components/properties and apply them to multiple entities the same way you group CSS properties in classes.

We could have used a CSS syntax for mixins but custom properties on CSS are discarded by many browsers. Their properties are not calculated and the values not shown in the dev tools. We could have carried our own parser but using CSS can lead to misunderstandigs. Most of the standard CSS properties don't apply to a 3D scene. We would have recreated CSS with complete different semantics. Also the CSS syntax does not accommodate well properties with complex values. background, padding or border have unlabeled complex values but it would be very confusing in the case of components. We would have to come up with an extended CSS syntax that allows for things like this:

``` css
.red-cube {
  geometry: { primitive: box; size: 5 }
  material: { color: red }
}
```
 @trusktr Have you tried  a `MutationObserver` on a stylesheet? I could not apply them to `CSSStyleRule ` elements. What would be the advantage of using CSS over the current mixins mechanism? Reusing CSS comes with a lot of baggage and we would like to explain why traditional properties don't work . Why does ` visibility: hidden;` not work? Mixins are close enough to CSS, we can break expectations and we don't have to support all the functionality and intricacies of traditional style sheets. I'm more than happy to see the community experimenting with different approaches. Concerning the core, browsers are not ready to implement the functionality we need (lack of MutationObserver) and in my opinion the cost of implementation, maintenance and user reeducation are not worth the delivered value.  Good catch and welcome as a contributor! I realized that you are submitting the PR against the `gh-pages` branch. Can you reopen it against master? Thanks!
  Nice. Good catch! Nice to see PRs with faces :) We have moved development to the master branch. Would you mind reopening the PR against `master`? Thanks!
  @nylki Are you on Windows/OSX? Can you file an issue?
 Can you describe a use case for this? Should the `selector` type behave like `selectorAll` instead of having two separate types? @ngokevin What do you think?
 It's useful when you want a list of entities (class) rather than a single entity (id). But both have distinct cases:
- selectorAll use case was to be able to pass in a class name to whitelist raycaster targets.
- selector use might be to select a single target like `look-at`.
 This looks good to me.
 A single selector type that returns all the matches  can cover both cases described above: raycaster and look-at. In the case of look-at and multiple matches the component would just pick the first one. 
 It _would_ work, but it's better to explicitly define in the schema whether a property is intended to return a single match or multiple matches. Doesn't make sense (and is inconvenient) to have it return an array when you only want a singular match; it'd be akin to defining an int array when you intend to define an int.
 On more style change and this is ready to go
  Can you squash your commits?
 Thanks!
  @legendtang want to bump karma-sinon-chai?
  Love to see new contributors!
 Travis is complaining
   Maybe also viewport size like shader toy. Should those be new schema types?
 Let's create some shaders and see what's useful :)
 Yeah I think these would be built-in schema types.
 A shader we need is a neat animation for the loader spinner. The loader should not use any assets ( textures, models, sounds...) so it loads super quick. It has to be self contained within the aframe library without adding bloat
 Would be good for placeholder for loading models.

Don't think we can use shaders for the spinner blocking scene load. Because that depends on rendering, and we are blocking rendering until assets load which is when we show the spinner. A simple image or data URI would do, it could also function as the "click to play" placeholder.
 We can create a `loader`  `scene component` that creates it's own renderer and render loop independent to the scene one. It renders on the `a-scene` canvas
 Yeah, I guess it is good to have the loading screens support VR too. 
   I believe this is fixed by removing command substitution in the lint command.
  Perhaps one of the LCD variety

The sound system should handle creation of the AudioListener.
  Should probably do the `bind` method since that is the intent, and just to please the standard linter.
 Yeah, I was wondering why we couldn't just do `sound.onEnded()`
 There are conflicts. Needs rebase. We also moved development to master.  @meta-meta Would you mind to reopen the PR against master? Sorry for the inconvenience.
 These changes landed on https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1106
  Nice I love to see you tinkering with the soud. 

Travis is complaining. One linter error:

https://travis-ci.org/aframevr/aframe/jobs/113555636#L503

And the sound tests fail as well.
 I have the same problem with the linter. On Windows it doesn't output anything. I filed https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1084
 Thanks! Sound really needs love! 
 @dmarcos SQUASH!
 I always forget :S 
  dupe https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1069
  Try `npm install aframevr/aframe#dev` for now. The newer branches pre-build the bundle published to NPM so it should be smoother. It's latest code which will be released soon.
 Lots of issues with different versions of NPM in older builds, I think newer builds have corrected it.
  Thanks for requesting. This doesn't seem like it will be a core feature, but you can write your own A-Frame component to do anything you want: http://ngokevin.com/blog/aframe-component/

Or sounds like you might be able to use an animation and rotate the camera in a circle.
  So once can just listen for cursor events to get what element has been clicked.
  Can you add a test to `tests/core/a-animation.test.js` in `suite('detachedCallback')`:

``` js
    test('stops animation', function (done) {
      setupAnimation({begin: 'test-event'}, function (el, animationEl) {
        animationEl.parentNode.removeChild(animationEl);
        // Check that it doesn't have event listener somehow.
        // Maybe emit the event + process.nextTick + check it isn't running + done().
      });
    });
```
  It should work. It already works with React and d3 which also do data binding. Feel free to publish your own example and we can share it :) 
  Currently can't enter fullscreen because that's reserved for VR.

We should allow fullscreen (and swap out the Goggles icon for a fullscreen icon) for mono experiences if a headset is not detected.

If a headset is detected, then fullscreen will also enter VR mode.
 This is related to https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1056 because there is less reason to have pointer lock until we support fullscreen + mono. 

vr + pointerlock doesn't seem to go well together (unless we maybe restrict the pointerlock to a single axis)
 I like this. And I also like the idea of making the "enter VR" button a friendlier color (like green) when a headset is plugged in.
 Maybe Goggles when headset plugged in or mobile...else fullscreen arrows?
 The minimum work required for this when a VR headset is not detected, then clicking on the Goggles button triggers a simple requestFullScreen.

Then we can subsequently layer on proper UI for it.
 perhaps, this is one way. but we shouldn't conflate "entering VR" with "entering fullscreen" (or even being a sufficient fallback). some folks may actually be using A-Frame and just want to enter fullscreen w/o VR. or may want to enter VR but on a VR-capable device (e.g., my phone). also, what would the icon look like? a VR googles/fullscreen icon - would it be conditional?

load https://mozvr.com/demos/SECVRITY/ in Chrome and Firefox Nightly to see how we handled this for the Unity WebVR template. since game devs often want to enter fullscreen, we just gracefully add VR icons if they have VR support (even if no devices are connected yet).

/cc @caseyyee 
 Just breaking up the chunks of work.

Right now, simply just allow fullscreen.

Then work on conditional icons:
- Desktop, headset connected: googles -> VR mode
- Desktop, no headset: fullscreen icon -> fullscreen
- Mobile: always goggles

  When a component is defined as a key in `defaultComponents`, the component's `init` method gets called twice.

 ah, sweet - thanks. can you tell `@ml` in Slack?
  Thanks! We'll take a look at this
 this works very nicely. thanks for doing this :+1:.

perhaps we want some way of toggling between mouse-drag controls and Pointer Lock (which IMO is much easier and more intuitive when you actually have a headset on).
 Is there an argument to keeping mouse-drag? Either mouse-drag or pointer lock, you have to click to discover. 

@dmarcos has mentioned to support multiple scenes on a page. Not sure if we should optimize for that use case. We have also proposed pointer lock only on full screen.
 though we can't assume that the user will use the mouse/pointer for look controls, it might be nice to call `requestPointerLock` if it hasn't been already. maybe not. it could be too presumptuous + annoying.
 This would be assuming if the user is using the mouse. If not, then it doesn't matter mouse-drag vs. pointer lock. But let's assume the user is using the mouse. When to mouse-drag (if at all) vs pointer lock?
 > This would be assuming if the user is using the mouse.

Precisely what I said above, yeah.

> If not, then it doesn't matter mouse-drag vs. pointer lock. But let's assume the user is using the mouse. When to mouse-drag (if at all) vs pointer lock?

Pointer Lock requires you to keep still. Mouse drag allows you to move and sit still until you explicitly click + drag. Two different types of look controls with some different and some overlapping use cases.
 again, we don't know if the user is going to use the mouse. I meant to mention above it would be nice to request pointer lock upon entering VR (if we deem the user wants pointer lock). this way you can avoid the Pointer Lock permission prompt in Firefox. [see this example.](http://dontcallmedom.github.io/web-permissions-req/tests/pointerlock-fullscreen-combined.html)
 I think pointer lock should belong to a different component. `fps-controls`?
 > I think pointer lock should belong to a different component. `fps-controls`?

I like that :+1:

I fancy myself FPS in (Web)VR, so I'd use that component _a lot_.
 Let's figure how this is going to work. Are we thinking something like:
- `first-person-controls`: WASD + mouse (pointer lock by default, I agree, even with the prompt, it's way better than mouse-drag)
- `look-controls`: WASD + VR + WebVR polyfill

How does responsiveness work? What if we want first-person-controls for a mono experience, but look-controls for a stereo experience? Is that done by the developer?
 Mobile would be handled by look-controls that has the WebVR polyfill. Maybe first-person isn't the best name, maybe fps-controls might have been the better name even though it's not always a shooter.

We don't have solutions out of the box for mobile locomotion yet. Right now you can do gaze-based teleport navigation manually. Later will probably use Cardboard V2 mouse/touchdown to move forward
 > I think another component makes sense - but my vote would be for pointer lock to be the default interaction component on desktop.

I 100% think A-Frame should ship with a Pointer Lock component. For non-VR content on desktop, mouselook can sometimes be more desirable.

Because we didn't have a Pointer Lock-like component, we've seen folks create custom components to support the mouse-based FPS controls that Pointer Lock makes real simple.

Here's [`no-click-look-controls`](https://github.com/alexrkass/aframe-no-click-look-controls). And an [example](http://alexrkass.com/no-click-example/). And an [issue I filed about using Pointer Lock](https://github.com/alexrkass/aframe-no-click-look-controls/issues/1).

Besides my [old closed PR](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/pull/121), I guess I forgot someone made a component for Pointer Lock: [`fps-look-component`](https://github.com/cemkod/aframe-fps-look-component/blob/master/index.js).

Have you compared this last one with yours? I haven't looked closely, but I'm curious if there's anything better or overlooked in his approach. Personally, I like the `sensitivity` property - that's super useful (even to make it configurable for mouse-look controls too).

> The drag-to-look is an inferior user experience imo.

For VR mode, I 100% agree.

My opinion: I love Pointer Lock for FPS (whether in VR or just plain mono content on desktop) and whenever I have a VR headset on and can't see my trackpad/keyboard. I like mouse-look controls for when I want to be careful about where/when/how I want to pan.

My conclusion: If I had to pick one, I'd go with Pointer Lock (`fps-controls`) be the default with a configurable `sensitivity` property.
 We could make this real simple and just always enable Pointer Lock when entering VR mode but keep mousedrag-look controls for non-VR (for now). Can everyone agree that'd be the best user experience?
 That's the hard part. Encapsulating WASD+mouse control schemes vs. HMD-oriented control schemes.

Pointer Lock for mono desktop + mono full screen is great. But it doesn't pair well with an HMD.
 - **Desktop, headset, not fullscreen**: WASD + pointer lock
- **Desktop, headset, fullscreen/VR mode**: WASD + HMD
- **Desktop, no headset, not fullscreen/fullscreen**: WASD + pointerlock
- **Mobile**: Touch to move + WebVR polyfill

Sometimes might want a floating cursor too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uteFosiioUI

What comes built-in, what is configurable, how do we make it easy for people to fork and compose their own controls?
 Also be aware that aframe scenes when in mono mode might not be alone on the page. Look at code pen or aframe.io. It doesn't seem right to me to capture the pointer by default. For next version we will also allow multiple aframe scenes on a single page. 
 re: @dmarcos multiple scenes on a page, haven't seen anyone try/request that use case yet so i'm wary about going out of our way for it. Even then I think pointer lock is better, you click on one of the scenes to select it and lock into it. The experience of mouse-drag is poor enough to warrant that.

re: @ashconnell Yeah, I noted in that comment to restrict it to an axis. But yeah, WASD + HMD + restricted-axis-mouse sounds good.
 I want people to easily integrate vr content on 2d pages. aframe scenes have to easily cohexist with other elements in the page. When a scene goes fullscren pointer lock would be acceptable.
 Aframe scene hijacking or hiding the pointer does not seem a good experience to me
 > I want people to easily integrate vr content on 2d pages.

That's extra work and consideration for something I haven't seen anyone try or request. We should optimize for full-page 3D + VR.

> Aframe scene hijacking or hiding the pointer does not seem a good experience to me

Mousedrag is definitively worse though. Hiding the pointer (via a browser API) is not that bad if it's activated with focus/click. In fact, it's expected for a first-person experience.
 > I want people to easily integrate vr content on 2d pages.

I don't understand why Pointer Lock makes it more difficult to integrate VR content. The browser handles the pointer capturing/releasing. You can have a button over your VR content that says "play"/"enter." For obvious performance reasons and presentation reasons (not wanting audio/video to play in the background), it's unlikely you're going to be playing more than one 3D/VR experience at a time.

I think it'd be great to have a newspaper article with three embedded 3D/VR A-Frame scenes. But those scenes IMO shouldn't just automatically load and have to rely on tedious mousedrag look controls.

You can add a Play/Start button. That's how YouTube/Vimeo embeds work, and it's how JSFiddle snippet embeds used to work as well.

> Mousedrag is definitively worse though. Hiding the pointer (via a browser API) is not that bad if it's activated with focus/click. In fact, it's expected for a first-person experience.

:+1: definitely agree here. I'd love for A-Frame to get to **[Quake status](http://media.tojicode.com/q3bsp/)**. Imagine how hard it would be to navigate that scene using mousedrag (by default).
 you haven't seen it because there's no production sites out there yet. Do you think people are going to go all out and convert their sites to aframe? I doubt it. I want to see the new york times including pieces of VR content or Wikipedia enhancing articles with VR media. aframe.io or codepen already follow that model. When an aframe scene is on 2D / no fullscreen mode I consider that the experience is on preview mode. Drag to look is ok. As I said pointer lock is acceptable when going fullscreen. What we should do is enaging fullscreen + mono when the user clicks on the goggles icon if an HMD is not present. We can then enable pointer lock.
 As cvan said the play button would be the goggle icon. It conveys that the user wants to engage with the experience. Otherwise pointerlock should stay out of the way
 That sounds like an improvement (given that desktop users are allowed to enter fullscreen without a headset) and a step in the right direction.

Though it's not very optimal to consider a full-page A-Frame site "preview mode". Mousedrag still sucks in that case. Allowing non-VR mono fullscreen experiences will help though.
 > a seperate component for proper pointerlock + wasd + arrow keys (for the germans) and we can abandon this PR.

I think that could be done in this PR
 @dmarcos @cvan We talked about this earlier. Did we decide on (for behavior):
- Non-fullscreen
  - Pointer-lock by default. Can be configured to mousedrag (e.g., `look-controls="nonFullscreenMouseDrag: true"`) to satisfy embedded scenes
  - Or vice-versa? Mousedrag by default. Can be configured to pointer lock (e.g., `look-controls="nonFullScreenPointerLock: true"`) to satisfy full A-Frame sites
- Fullscreen
  - Pointer-lock always
  - Pointer-lock restricted axis if headset is plugged in
 Bump for discussion.
 When it's not fullscreen pointer lock is disabled by default to prevent aframe hijacking the page where it's embedded. The rest of the description above is sensible behavior IMO
 In the proposal, it'd be up to the developers who embed A-Frame to specify mousedrag in non-fullscreen mode. I think once we validate the embedded use case, we can re-evaluate. But in the meantime, it seems less confusing for A-Frame sites, most of which are non-embedded, to default to pointer lock. I think it's not optimal to start with mouse drag and then go to pointer lock (remember not everyone will think to full screen).
 As I said what we're seeing now is people getting their feet wet with aframe and not creating production content. Websites won't be completely rebuilt in aframe. It just does not make sense at this point. Hijacking the pointer by default is too prescriptive and gets in the way of the experience a website wants to provide. In my opinion the user should decide when to fully engage with the content by clicking fullscreen. We should consider **no-fullscreen as a preview mode by default** and drag to look around seems appropriate. I agree we can let devs override the default behavior.

I think that our codepen demos would be immediately worse if pointerlock is the default in non fullscreen mode.

Most of [playcanvas](https://playcanvas.com/explore/featured) and [turbulenz](https://ga.me/) content doesn't use pointer lock and the demos that do I find it irritating. Look at tanks for instance (http://tanx.playcanvas.com/) and try to interact with your browser (switch tabs for instance). It's just not a good experience.

[Clara.io](https://clara.io/library) and [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/models/staffpicks) previewers don't lock the pointer either I think the experience is what it should be.
 Referencing the author of the PR. Visit the gallery of sceneVR:  https://www.scenevr.com/scenes
With AFrame those previews could be interactive with click/drag to look. Selecting one is for me the equivalent of clicking play/fullscreen. The user wants to engage with a particular experience and pointer lock then makes sense. 
 OK I have reservations about that:
- Mousedrag is not great for embedded scenes with preview mode. You have to click the scene to play it (assuming not all scenes will be rendering at the same time), and then click again to drag it.
- I think hijacking is okay given that the user has already expressed interest in interacting with the scene by clicking it + giving the browser permission.

But let's move forward and re-evaluate later. We can make these agreed improvements today:
- Pointer lock upon fullscreen (axis-restricted if HMD is plugged in). This can be done in this PR
- Option for pointer lock on non-fullscreen (something like `look-controls="pointerlock-always: true"`)
 @bnolan I think we should handle our extensible controls story first (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/975#issuecomment-196093953) because every change to controls is like a temporary fix at the moment. If we go ahead with Don's proposal, all the controls API will change.
 Going to close for now to checkout https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/975 first, and since this PR has gone a bit off-track. But we still do want pointer lock as an option, just not sure if it will be part of a look-controls component.

  oops, so sorry! 2995220. this one was my fault/Brandon's fault. mostly my fault for not testing.
 fixed in PR #1065 for polyfilled environments such as mobile and all pre-WebVR v1.0 environments (Firefox Nightly and deprecated Chromium builds), along with support in experimental Chromium WebVR v1.0 builds
 @meta-meta did you run `npm install` after checking it out?
 @cvan any insight on this?
 I'll check whether the scene refactor regressed this.
 @masom What phone are you testing on?
 This was due to a regression in the latest webvr-polyfill: https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill/tree/webvr-1.0

I'm reverting my original commit until there's a fix.
  Thanks!
  https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/dev/src/utils/coordinates.js#L5

`setAttribute('position', [1, 2, 3]);`
 It's just a coincidence:

You can do  `this.el.setAttribute('position', { x: 1, y: - 2;  z: 6 });`

It happens that `three.js` Vector3 stores the coordinate values on the x, y and z attributes as well.
 Ah, okay sweet. Someone was saying it didn't work with Vector3s.

Still need to get it to work with arrays.
 What's the value of adding support for arrays? An array carries implicit information on what position corresponds to each coordinate. I pretty much prefer to always see { x: 1, y: 2, z: 5 }. I think arrays don't add much, reduce clarity and potentially introduce bugs.
 `Vector3` carries implicit information on what position corresponds to each coordinate.
 The benefit is that it's a more compact data structure for something that's going to be typed over and over. Much easier to type since `{x: 0, y: 1, z: 3}` uses keys from all over the keyboard back-and-forth.
 No. it doesn't. The coordinates are labeled with x, y, z. In an array the correspondence is positional and totally implicit. You can easily mess up the indices and pass the wrong thing.
 Typing is not something you want to optimize for on API design:
1. Code is write once ready many. You have to optimize for legibility and understanding and reduce cognitive load.
2. Autcompletion on modern IDE's makes typing a non issue.
 Though when you instantiate a Vector3, you are passing x, y, z in order. There's no difference in using an array shorthand and the precedence that three.js has made on this:

`new THREE.Vector3(1, 5, 7)`

`new THREE.Vector3.apply(this, [1, 5, 7])`

Internally, it will still be converted to an XYZ object
 That you are used to it doesn't mean is a good design decision. Also a-frame targets an audience that it's not familiarized with graphics / game development.
 Math is not a good example of consistent and terse notation either.
 three.js does it, and it's [been requested](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react/issues/12). Having built lots of scenes and components, you can feel having to create XYZ objects over and over gets irritating.

There's no potential for bugs. The only case is if a developer does `setAttribute('position', [1, 2, 3])`, it gets converted to an XYZ object. It's completely external.
 I really don't think an array adds much value. It's just more code to maintain and extra risk for bugs when managing your local variables and passing them around. There's less chance to make a mistake when you are forced to be explicit { x: -1, y: 0, z: -4 }
 Even in A-Frame, we are already making it implicit `position="0 1 2"`...
 It does add value. Lots of developers that are actually using A-Frame (including me) say it would improve our workflows.
 The XYZ order is already implicit in A-Frame, three.js, WebGL, math, our heads. There's no need to make this explicit.
 `position="0 1 2"` is just for backwards compatibility to be able to pass strings to `setAttribute`. It's not a design decision. When using the DOM inspector there's no option. I would get rid of the string notation if I could.
 It's not just for backwards compatibility, that's the API design when people are writing scenes in HTML.
 Still backwards compatibility. You cannot write HTML attributes as objects.
 When writing code is always better to be explicit. Have you never messed up with the order of the arguments in a function? This is why I like objective C and its labeled parameters.
 Sure we can, it could have been `position="x: 5; y: 10; z:15"`, but we didn't because it's annoying to define something so commonly accepted explicitly. 
 That rule doesn't apply in this caseIt's not always better to be explicit if it doesn't make sense to. There's precedence in A-Frame. The way we define single-property schemas is very implicit.
 Typing on the DOM inspector is a real pain so it's sensible to have a more compact notation. Also when manipulating the DOM on a text editor and DOM inspector you're writing the values directly. There's no chance that you have an array manipulated somewhere else that you have to keep track the origin and state.
 How can we address these points in favor of an array?
- XYZ order is universally accepted in A-Frame, Unity, three.js, WebGL, shaders, game development, math, our heads.
- Many developers are saying their workflows would improve if they could pass an array. 

An umbrella argument of "explicit is better than implicit" isn't really a strong enough argument either. There's already precedence of favoring implicitness for ergonomics in A-Frame.
 Because we're forced to by legacy systems, mainly the DOM inspector and the string nature of DOM attributes. It's not a decision we would make without those constrains. In JS world those limitations don't apply.
 I still have to understand why arrays improve workflows more than the risks they introduce. There could be some marginal value on but it doesn't pass the cost / benefit analysis.
 I'm not really worried about the DOM inspector or DOM. I just want to be consistent with the fact that XYZ order is already universally accepted as arguments in universally all of math and development.

I'm willing to let it go because you're right, it's fairly marginal. But it would be an enhancement nonetheless
 On the other hand, I can imagine people writing all sorts of helpers to convert XYZ objects to arrays within their projects, which would be a little riskier than ensuring + testing it ourselves.
 I'm going to leave this open as _needs answers_ since it's not quite resolved. But won't take action yet.
 Is this our first public flame war? I guess we're a real open source project now :)
 Yeah, it's like our [own mini Rust int/uint](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/restarting-the-int-uint-discussion/1131) :)
 For now, you can do in your projects:

``` js
function v (x, y, z) {
  return {x: x, y: y, z: z};
}
setAttribute('position', v(1, 2, 3));
```
 I'll close this for now. One way to do things keeps things simpler. The helper is above pretty simple.  I think this sort of makes sense for stdlib. Later on, we have APIs to be able to dynamically swap the schema based on conditions, which will allow us to internally split up the geometry component for cleaner code.
 We could possibly have `registerGeometry`. Dunno.
 Need a lot of input from @dmarcos since the potential API for geometry component might change

Thanks for the PR! I was thinking of being able to pass vertices.
 A registerGeometry API makes more sense to me than passing vertices on the component. I need to think a bit more about this.
 Yeah, at the very least it can be a separate component for now. I feel like we might the geometry component API more generic and extensible later.
 I think we will close this in favor of a future `registerGeometry` where you can define a name + Geometry object + options and share with other people.

``` js
AFRAME.registerGeometry('triangle', {
  vertices: [ // ... ],
  faces: [ // ...]
});
```
 But it can be separate component until then!
   Thanks! I created a Stackoverflow question so hopefully this can get found later: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39768099/how-to-ignore-seems-to-be-a-pre-built-javascript-file-try-to-require-the-orig/39768100#39768100
  On dev branch of A-Frame `aframevr/aframe#dev`, the bundle will be prebuilt so no build step will be required.
  Looks good after those comments! Thanks!
 Thanks!
  You can define custom `parse` and `stringify` functions to effectively create one-off types because that is mostly what types do. That should work well: http://codepen.io/team/mozvr/pen/yeEQNG

I previously thought of it at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/881, but we agreed that it would get messy if there were lots of components registering types into the global space, it'd be hard to tell what was a built-in type and what was third-party. Let me know what you think.
 Definitely, I had that in mind, never filed it.
 Feel free to PR that, should be simple. Function to split on comma, function to join with comma, then a small test.
 Thanks!
  Have not experimented with streaming. It would be nice if someone could give it a shot and write an A-Frame component to stream a video feed into a texture.
 Would leave this for a third-party A-Frame component + JS library  Probably an `end` attribute? Similar to `begin`
  Can you try with an event name that is not `play`? I think entities will emit `play` when they are attached.
 Confirmed, don't use the `play` event name. This will be documented later. https://jsfiddle.net/yL0cozoh/

 @meta-meta Thanks for investigating. @cvan Does anything ring a bell?
  @dmarcos will look at this once he finishes up his current work
 @dmarcos r?
 Does not nesting solve the problem? 

``` html
<a-entity gamepad-controls>
   <a-entity camera  look-controls></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```
 @donmccurdy Should we investigate your universal controls solution rather than pulling in this temporary fix?
 @dmarcos hasn't looked at it yet, but it looks promising to me. I'd poke him.
 Going to close for now to look at a bigger solution. If we don't arrive to that, we can reopen this.
  `material-texture-loaded` would be a good event name. It prefixes the component name to the event name, and we haven't been using camelCase for our event names.
 Once we rename to `material-video-ended`, this looks good to me. The nitpicks are optional, I can clean up later.
 Adding a test would be a bonus, but I could do that if you want.
 Tests and nitpicks are important. It costs nothing to do it right away. We will never do it later.
 Do we need our own style guide on top of https://github.com/Flet/semistandard? The idea of that was to spend less time nitpicking, but it seems we need more rules?
 It would be nice If there's a way to automate those nits.
 I looked and we can configure our own with http://eslint.org/docs/rules/ , there are a lot of rules there that we are using that aren't configured in semistandard (e.g., force vars on top, no else after return)
 Yeah, sorry, we hijacked your PR to talk about stuff :)

You can just add a test in the material component to check the event is triggered, yeah.
 do you have your devdeps installed for testing?
 Tests don't pass
 PR needs rebase
 OK looks mostly good :)

@dmarcos we should get this in before your custom shaders so you can handle the future merge conflict
 @dmarcos looks good to me
 Cool stuff! Thanks!
  Can you remove the dist files from the PR?
 Ok. I had no idea what the difference was.
 Waiting for green! 
 AFrame works on IE and almost on windows phone. There's a problem with the values we read from the device orientation API that we will fix on next release.
 Thanks! Congratulations! You're the 8th contributor. I guess we have to order t-shirts soon to give away :). Ideas for a awesome designs are more than welcome. 
  look-controls changes the rotation of the camera by modyfing the rotation attribute. If the rotation attribute is not defined on the entity getAttribute will return null. This is how dom attributes behave. I consider this expected behavior
 Actually the expected behavior is `{ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }`, and a-camera comes with look-controls

But this has since been fixed on the dev branch for a-camera
 You can report either, and then I can help confirm whether it has been fixed or not. I think at the moment, I prefer people use the `dev` branch as it feels more stable than master.
  When do you say an image what do you exactly mean? An image floating in the user's field of view? A completely different scene? For the former you can now show/hide entities based on user interactions. For the latter we will be soon supporting multiple `a-scene` elements on the same page.
 Yea, there's also http://codepen.io/team/mozvr/pen/RrxgwE for Cursor with Visual Feedback.

And yeah, there are many ways to do transitions. One way we did before is to create a black mask entity that fades in when transitioning, and you change the scene during the transition.
 For now, use `<a-entity camera>` instead of `<a-camera>` to get fuse working
 @coleholyoake Something similar to http://codepen.io/team/mozvr/pen/RrxgwE but you can animation the theta-length/geometry.thetaLength rather than the scale

Want to copy-and-paste what I have there to the current A-Frame docs?
  ``` html
<a-assets>
  <a-mixin id="frame">
    <a-box position="0 1 0"/>
    <a-box position="1 0 0"/>
    <a-box position="0 0 1"/>
    <a-box position="1 0 1"/>
  </a-mixin>
</a-assets>

<a-entity mixin="frame">
  <!-- All of the boxes will be injected here. -->
</a-entity>
```
 Mixins are applied left-to-right. So right mixin trump the left ones.

Entity attributes trump attributes applied by mixins.
 I am not sure what to do if you apply multiple mixins with children. Could either _replace_, or _merge_.
 Being mixins, it seems more predictable to merge
 as I'm sure you know, this is reinventing templates lol. you do have to make `a-mixin` inert (behind the scenes, it should extend `<template>`) or else a bunch of custom elements are going to get prematurely called and callbacks called and events fired and so on.
 if I have `<a-entity mixin="frame">`, you're going to inject a bunch of elements (event delegation now again needed for `<a-event>`, btw).

then suppose some other elements get inserted. or some JS modifies some attributes - or some elements inside have `mixin`s themselves. the HTML is going to change.

and then if I set `<a-entity mixin="">`, what happens? do you remove everything?
 Yeah, it provides a subset of the feature set of templates. But it doesn't try to do any custom element registration or parameter passing. It solves the most basic use case of templates, I have something, and I want to copy/paste it.

I'd expect removing the mixin to remove that was everything injected. It's a bit of an edge case. But removing vanilla mixins at the moment doesn't do anything right now anyways.

I'm not worried about `a-event`. Mixins are a first-class citizen, `a-event` is not. `a-event` will still work anyways since it applies the listener to the parent node. We never really agreed as a team on its place within A-Frame so it's almost even on the chopping block let alone getting in the way of core implementation.

``` html
<a-entity mixin="frame">
  <a-event></a-event>
  <!-- Elements injected here. -->
</a-entity>
```
 `<!-- Elements injected here. -->`

you're going to have to keep track of where that element is (that's what the `<a-root>` was for)
 > We never really agreed as a team on its place within A-Frame so it's almost even on the chopping block let alone getting in the way of core implementation.

I don't remember having a team discussion on mixins
 this isn't templating exactly, it's not taking attributes and templating them so i don't think we need a-root. If we want to support removal, we can just assign data attribute

Mixins weren't created in a vacuum though. Maybe not the whole team, but at least some agreement
 note i'm not 100% sold on this idea yet since it does provide a subset of template logic. but it could be useful for simple copy/paste common sets of entities or mixing in animations

When a component is initialized, it will try to play. For the sound component, this means it will try to play even if autoplay is not set. And then when the sound is loaded, THREE.Audio will also play the sound if autoplay is set.

We could maybe get rid of the play() method for sound, but how do we handle resume? We need a way to detect when play() is being called as initialization vs. being called to resume. For the sound component, we don't want to call play(), but we do want a way to provide a resume if the scene was paused.
 Also where does tick come into play?
 `playSound` seems to solve it, thanks!
  for the following:

``` html
<a-scene>
  <a-camera></a-camera>
  <a-cube></a-cube>
</a-scene>
```

I see:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1560884/13120944/fa935604-d564-11e5-89f7-e3bbe92b745d.png)

Expected to see nothing, since the camera and cube should be sharing the same position.  

This is only an issue on the dev branch.   Seems to be fine with 0.1.0
 I'm touching this right now. Might be that the scene doesn't catch `<a-camera>` initializing its camera, and it swaps to the default camera, disabling the set camera. setTimeout in camera setup code fixed for me.
 FWIW, I tried setting the camera and cube object to position 0 0 0 and basically get the same as the screen capture.   It looks like the camera is set back and higher than the cube.

  Yeah, should be doable to escape semicolons in url().
 Want to make a PR to aframe#dev to bump the style-attr version?
 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/985
 Ah right, it still worked, but good to mark it down
  The a-image helper currently doesn't accept selectors. It will in the next version. Sorry about that, the docs might have been misleading 
 You can use `<a-entity material="src: #img-01">` if you are using 0.1.0. The `dev` branch will soon have a patch landing that will let you set that material component on the `<a-image>` element.
  Set the material to visible false for raycaster to ignore

`material="visible: false"`    You can enable/disable components by
calling el.components.yourcomponent. pause() / play() 
What about handling the configuration of your controls in a separate component "my-controls" that sets up mouse-look, gamepad, hmd-controls... and enable / disable them based on the specific needs of your content? I'm trying to determine if we should handle controls collisions at the core or if it should br up to the application to manage it.
 Sorry, I'm a bit late to this issue. Is it possible to add controls to wrapper entities so they don't collide?

``` html
<a-entity gamepad-controls>
  <a-entity camera look-controls></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```
 Thanks for the proposal, will read through thoroughly once I have time.
 @donmccurdy OK, that is awesome. I'm looking through it, and it might solve our controls story. Looks like we'd be able to register new controls and have them all concatenate correctly using an single interface. I love the separate velocity component, will be necessary for physics.

There could probably be further abstraction to have preconfigured control schemes? 
 @dmarcos Can you look through those controls when you have time? They are device-specific, but looks like they can be composed to create control schemes.
 Will close for now to focus on WebVR and keep simplicity without the extra layer. But the `universal-controls` are still a great option and can reconsider layer or take some of its nice defaults (e.g., pointer lock, but only after entering fullscreen).  rendering html into as a texture is fairly non trivial. 
 In order to render HTML to texture we need a new browser API that allows us to do that. There's a hack using foreignObjects in SVG with the limitation that you cannot use external resources https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Drawing_DOM_objects_into_a_canvas
 I created this pretty basic script called [dom2screenshot](https://github.com/cvan/dom2screenshot), which behind the scenes uses [html2canvas](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas) (different but similar to the SVG hack).

With dom2screenshot, you can create images from HTML, they get uploaded to a CDN, and you get a URL back you can use in your scene. See this [CodePen example](http://codepen.io/cvan/pen/xZYKqO?editors=1100).

All you get is a static image (and not a high-res one at that).

As @dmarcos says, rendering live DOM in WebGL is not possible today. But you can take an `<iframe>` and apply a CSS transform to give the perspective that it's in your scene, but it's really just layered atop your scene.

See [gl-css3d](https://github.com/deathcap/gl-css3d) as an example of this.

Also:
- http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2013/04/30/closing-the-gap-between-html-and-webgl/
- http://jensarps.de/2013/07/02/html-elements-in-webgl-recursion/
 You can use an iframe or any other element + css 3D transforms but you will have to handle stereo rendering by duplicaing the DOM and even in that case distortion won't be applied to the DOM content in VR mode
 > You can use an iframe or any other element + css 3D transforms but you will have to handle stereo rendering by duplicaing the DOM and even in that case distortion won't be applied to the DOM content in VR mode

True, good point.
 > @cvan technically, with the dom2screenshoot, couldn't you map a users position on the screenshot to an action in an iframe? example: In cardboard they see the image version of the page, and they hover over a button to trigger the js to actually correspond with the iframe and reload a new view?

if you have the iframe is on the same origin, yes. otherwise, no. and you'd still need to duplicate the iframe twice (for the stereo rendering), which gets tricky.
  Every time someone makes a PR then, it will auto-target the `dev` branch.
 I'm kind of favour of this, but when people land on https://github.com/aframevr/aframe they're going to see the unstable (`dev`) version of A-Frame.

idk, I'm not a big fan of this `dev` vs. `master` workflow. I'd prefer to just do very regular releases.
 Maybe that's fine if the people checking out Github are people that more interested in seeing what's happening or want to use the latest builds. If `dev` is `master`, then every PR is sort of an unstable release to the Github repo.
 again, yeah, that's why I think `dev`/`master` workflow isn't the best system. it encourages breaking trunk and longer releases. I realise the intention may be to move faster, but it seems to do the opposite.
 Okay, I agree, just have a single `master`. Bump dist when we feel ready. Publish NPM when we really feel ready
 I like that
 What would staggered releases look like?
 @dmarcos Input? I'm currently for developing on master:
- More transparent
- Project looks more active
- People see latest code when they hit GitHub
- Many people already working off of dev branch
- The people that go to GitHub are interested in grabbing latest code + developing. Those that want to use Stable A-Frame will grab from CDN or NPM.

Master would then not be expected to be Stable. Which is fine since `dev` is arguably more stable than `master` at the moment with its mass amount of bug fixes.
 I'm fine with converging development on master. Should the files on the dist directory reflect the stable version?
 We can have both stable dist + nightly dist in the `dist` folder?
  à la https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/HACKING_QUICKSTART.md

Perhaps move/duplicate a bunch of the commands from the [`README.md`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/dev/README.md) and throw them here. The [A-Frame Docs](https://aframe.io/docs/) are specific to _usage_ of A-Frame as a library, not about contributing to the A-Frame codebase itself.
 consider consolidating into CONTRIBUTING to avoid plethora of `.md` files
 @joshgalvin: "most windows node devs don't have the node-gyp compiler tool chain installed"

need to note that
 some updates https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/35de321a704578cb284667c630a6cc7c2673370d

could go into more detail like writing tests or style guide
 I was going to file a separate issue, but it's probably fine to add as a comment here. We need to document how to enable the debug-level console logs.

I had this information in the README, but [it was removed](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/4171d021#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8L52).

I couldn't find this info. anywhere in the docs, only [in the code as comment](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/701e47e/src/utils/debug.js#L73-L82).

Let's add it probably to both the docs and the `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

``` js
localStorage.logs = 1
```
 FWIW, we only have one debug-level log in the whole codebase, and I've never used it.
 Things I would add:

**Contributing Code:**
- [ ] Mention of style guide (`semistandard`) and to use `npm run lint` to check.
- [ ] Add a note on how to rebase
- [ ] Add a note on testing and link to tests/README.md
- [ ] **Spreading the Word** (maybe)
  - [ ] Links to good slidedecks for A-Frame/WebVR evanglism until we have an official onboard kit
  - [ ] Where to give talks (e.g., meetups, contact Mozilla reps)

In tests/README.md, I would add more details on how to use the test suite. (explain the tool chain of karma/mocha/sinon, the process of adding a test).
  Add a note on how to rebase is good idea, but also other git stuff for PR life cycle  
Since you most likely first clone you fork then that is your `origin` remote
1. **first you add upstream remote**
`git remote add upstream git@github.com:aframevr/aframe.git`
2. If you want to make contibution you would create new branch shortly describing what you working on or just name it `patch-x`
`git fetch --all`  _to update trackers_
`git checkout -b patch-x upstream/master` _checkout new branch from upstream master_
`git push -u origin HEAD` _push and create new branch under your github_
3. Do some work, commit it, push and PR
4. If you branch fells behind or needs rebase run
`git fetch --all` \* to update trackers*
`git rebase upstream/master` to rebase and play your commits on top
`git push -f` to fast forward your `patch-x` branch on github
5. After PR is merged you can just delete this branch by running
`git branch -D patch-x`
`git push origin :patch-x`
 Yeah, thanks. I saw that is already linked in the CONTRIBUTING guide. Just wanted to address rebasing because sometimes people's branches get all messed up and they have to open a new PR.

  I think you are setting `color="yellow"` for the entity. Setting `color` on the entity won't do anything. I think for entity, you will have to manually register an event listener in Javascript to set the color. I don't think those declarative events can handle setting a component property.
  I think this is an addressed issue on the `dev` branch where we bumped 3js to fix Android shader bugs.

Today, I think I will try to publish a patch version to master to address Android. Sorry we have not done this earlier. Thanks for reporting!

 I think it affects all except perhaps `shiftKey`
  In 0.1.0 we had the concept of templates:

``` html
<template is="a-template"
          element="a-image"
          width="1.75"
          height="1.75"
          opacity="1.0"
          src="">
  <a-entity geometry="primitive: plane;
                      width: ${width};
                      height: ${height}"
            material="shader: flat;
                      src: url(${src});
                      opacity: ${opacity};
                      side: double;
                      transparent: true">
  </a-entity>
</template>
```

Because our primary use case has been to _extend_ entities for common use cases, we agreed to rethink "templates" (formerly known as "mixins" - not to be confused with `<a-mixin>`s, heh). And by rethink I mean remove until we've proven all the interesting use cases (and there certainly are some).

So instead of providing a declarative means of encapsulating one or many entities and exposing it as a custom element by some name (via the `element` attribute) through a `<template is="a-template">`, we've decided to use "primitives" as a way of extending entities.

The "old" templates are now not a high priority, but they're something we should not forget about and revisit some time.

If we don't want to enable devs to define templates from inline HTML (or HTML imports), we could introduce a JS API à la `registerComponent` for registering templates. For inspiration, check out X-Tag's `xtag.register` (go to https://x-tag.github.io/ and check out the examples in `Docs > Content is King`).

<hr>

Relevant: PR #883
 If we decide to reintroduce declarative templates and allow them to be defined from HTML imports, we ought to revisit #579 and resolve that issue. If templates do get resurrected but in the form of a JS API, that's a non issue.
 Good sticky note, but not actionable at the moment/not an issue.
 I think we need a discussion about which types of bugs to file and which to keep in our heads. I file issues like these so that we can track our thoughts and point contributors to them.
 I just take things case-by-case. We file whatever and then we decide what to do with them.

For this issue, I felt it was ok to close since it was just a note that summed up to something like "we are removing templates, maybe sometime we can look at them later", which I'm predicting will be quite a ways out and our expectations will have changed.
 if we set the proper expectations for what's a valid issue to file, I'll know what I should bother filing - and what I should not bother filing and just make a personal mental note of.
 i just say file whatever seems right and we'll handle it. but we can chat more later
 Would also be good to think what an A-Frame templating layer would provide over existing templating solutions.
 I did have that idea earlier that you could add child entities to mixins, and those entities would get mixed into the scene when used. It's not template registration, but i like that.
 Not necessarily. While components change the appearance/behavior of an entity, mixins aim to make component property definitions reusable across the scene as a whole.
 Doing a lot of experiments with templating at https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-templating-examples

I'm converging to a flexible template component which I think has an elegant and powerful API with more predictability the previous a-template/a-root implementations.
 @dmarcos and I talked and agreed any implementation would be too opinionated. It functions very well as a third-party library for now, and we can promote these elsewhere:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1384
  Have you tried https://github.com/Jam3/threejs-generate-gif?
 I think we should create a renderer scene component that allows the user to set the flags that three.js exposes. `preserveDrawingBuffer` among them. 
 I would do a renderer component for the scene that let you do:

``` html
<a-scene renderer="antialias: true; preserveDrawingBuffer: true; …">…</a-scene>
```
 you're right. It might be confusing. Could we reinitialize the renderer if one of the values changes?
 @RSpace I have to update the docs. With `<ctrl> + <alt> + <shift> + s` you can take an equirectangular screenshot (aka 360 image)
 @chriscar you can take a screenshot programmatically if you do:
`sceneEl.components.screenshot.capture()` pass `perspective` as parameter if you want a normal screen capture `sceneEl.components.screenshot.capture('perspective')`
 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2316 should allow it now?

Shader should now compile since it's just string concat via array join. Let me know if that's still an issue.

 @Esmolan Can you provide a link? Not sure what you mean by camera feed. `ctrl+alt+s` takes the screenshot below in `https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/anime-UI/` that it's what you would expect.

![screenshot-anime ui-1528137031829](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39342/40934776-c1cb6238-67ea-11e8-8626-291c750313af.png)
 I don't know how the camera feed is rendered in ar.js. It's probably not rendered in THREE and that's probably why it's not visible using the screenshot component. If you can bring that camera feed into THREE then it will be picked up automatically by the component. Render the camera feed as a texture. That's more of a question for AR.js folks. It will probably not be worth since it will likely degrade performance. I would look for alternative ways to take screenshots in ar.js. There;s not much we can do on the A-Frame side  We can provide a default spinner with a cool aframe logo animation shown while assets load. It also serves as an example for people to implement their own spinners if they don't want the default one. @cvan @ngokevin What do you think?
 I don't think this has been implemented. Just crossed my mind again; I've written up some thoughts on the component wishlist: 

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-registry/issues/64 There's a work in progress https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2153 Nice! I'd been thinking of something in CSS (quick and easy; could be done as a third-party component, etc.). I assume you chose canvas instead so the loading screen could be visible in VR? Good point...   No, it's just to assist with user/developer errors. I mess this up sometimes.

Although I sort of want to deprecate `<a-animation>` for better solutions in the future, so this is not too important.
  see https://gist.github.com/cvan/eb86d3f45992575d9943
 We're going to document _everything_ we know :)
 Going to track and do this as a part of https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/921 . I got it documented
  Confirmed bug
 "If you're texture is not a pow of 2 size one, don't use (or do disable) mippmapping on that texture minifier method."

 This also happens on Safari I believe, @mayognaise 
 Maybe https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133511
 I found it works if the asset is on the same origin.
 Chromium and Safari are not respecting `crossOrigin/crossorigin`.
 Don't think this can be addressed soon, but I can at least document it.
 This certainly seems like a regression in Chromium. Wonder if it's specific to Brandon's builds or not. Will have to check.
 I just used the standard Chromium builds.
 see this relevant three.js issue: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/8110

 Confirmed by @davatron5000 that you can clear the cache to make it work on iOS if the `img` or asset was previously loaded without `crossorigin`. This is because iOS pulls it from the cache and doesn't recognize the new CORS flag.
  Fullscreening (entering VR) with iframes work with Firefox but not with Chrome
 This should be possible. Check out https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/components/canvas.md
 > This is probably the reason we'll need to abandon A-Frame for our project. It stinks, but we can't use the iframe solution.

Actually, this is supported now. Sorry, this issue didn't get closed with a mention of the proper pull request that enabled this to work.

@dmarcos worked on this for [A-Frame v0.3.0](https://aframe.io/blog/aframe-v0.3.0/) (also documented in [the release notes](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/releases/tag/v0.3.0)). [Here's an example of a mock Wikipedia entry](https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/wikipedia/), demonstrating the ability to embed one scene (but could be multiple) in an existing 2D page alongside content.
 @cvan multiple scenes on a page do not work yet. It is complex to do. And the issue is still 
 I frames don't quite work entering fullscreen yet
 > I frames don't quite work entering fullscreen yet

even with `<iframe allowfullscreen>`? what's the issue? is there an issue on file in this repo?
 I'm actually not sure. I neglected the `allowfullscreen`. I remember it didn't work in CodePen. Need to check.
 Multiple scenes on the same page are not still supported directly. You could embed multiple scenes within iframes. @hawaiikaos  I'm closing in favor of I-Frames. three.js doesn't support multiple scenes with their own contexts either. > I'm closing in favor of I-Frames. three.js doesn't support multiple scenes with their own contexts either.

is the existing "embedded scenes" not a use case that A-Frame intends to support? @dmarcos' [Wikipedia example](https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/wikipedia/), for example, does not use `<iframe>`s; isn't that a valid use case A-Frame would want to support (especially considering how likely it would be for there to be two scenes on a web page)?
 @cvan The issue is about multiple scenes, not one embedded scene.

@brianblakely Sorry, it is not easily possible with three.js to have multiple embedded scenes with separate contexts. Even if so, it would require major refactor and energy to make it possible. A-Frame is focused on immersive WebVR meaning we'll be consuming one scene at a time in a headset and traversing between them in a headset. This is not going to be a sticking point in the long term at all. > @cvan The issue is about multiple scenes, not one embedded scene.

correct, see my comment above:

> (especially considering how likely it would be for there to be two scenes on a web page)

my point about the Wikipedia use case, is that there likely would be more than only one scene on a given Wikipedia page (just like there are multiple images, charts, tables, etc. on Wikipedia pages).

> Even if so, it would require major refactor and energy to make it possible.

I trust your assessment here. my fear is that we ought to not close issues because of today's constraints and efforts of the current core A-Frame developers. if we were to vote on this, I'd vote for this to remain an issue - not necessarily fix it any time remotely soon.

> A-Frame is focused on immersive WebVR meaning we'll be consuming one scene at a time in a headset and traversing between them in a headset. This is not going to be a sticking point in the long term at all.

this is a very large assumption actually - that all A-Frame scenes will be constructed as separate documents as scenes. (the recent influx of JS frameworks for supporting single-page, reactive apps I think is proof that we didn't always correctly predict future Web tech trends and evolved user expectations.)

also, we know how WebVR experiences are being delivered for consumption by users in Chrome for Google Daydream (and beginning to with Oculus Carmel). multi-tasking, preloading, shared messaging of scene/entity contexts, universal inputs - all that becomes incredibly complicated when an A-Frame scene is isolated to a single document (resulting in such workarounds as `<iframe>`s + `postMessage`).

à la [DrawVR's "Escape Room" game](http://drawvr.com/escape/), users can carefully construct SPA-like experiences by separating levels/worlds in separate entities whose visibility are toggled appropriately.

then there is the case of unnecessarily duplicated code (and inability to easily share state). even if you have the best-in-class server-side caching and a Service Worker, the perf penalty is certainly _not_ negligible by loading three separate documents in `<iframe>`s for three different A-Frame scenes vs. one document for the same three scenes. you can reuse all the code that was fetched, parsed, and executed - those seconds, and even milliseconds, break _immersion_.

is there harm in keeping an issue open? I wouldn't want to see A-Frame issues getting closed without having a full community discussion.
 SPAs can swap entities in and out as you say, you can use the very same JS frameworks to implement the SPA logic; you don't need multiple scenes for that. Separate WebGL contexts can not share resources and are just as non-performant. Introducing multiple scene support will add more layers to maintain in the codebase. I also don't imagine Wikipedia ever embedding A-Frame scenes given the weight; a VR-specific parallel site would be more realistic.

Yes, there is harm because it draws focus and energy from more important issues (as seen from the amount of time discussing here). I'm happy to address feedback as I do interfacing with the community every day, but a full community discussion on every single issue would burn everyone out. 

Understand we're in a position where we're faced with 200+ open issues, many of which would not be worth spending time reviewing, maintaining, testing. I ask not to try to paint closing issues and triaging as a Bad Guy move.  I agree with @ngokevin keeping issues opened is not free. You have to manage the expectations around those bugs as long as they stay open and makes the direction and priorities of a project confusing. I would love to support multiple scenes. That was my longer term goal after the Wikipedia embedded scene. Affer analyzing perf and other implications like for instance the behavior of the inspector I decided that the effort was not worth it given the focus of our roadmap on VR immersive experiences.  Thanks for filing! There's an existing issue on file: #316. Sorry about the issue; we're working on a fix soon.
  That's not using A-Frame either, can you file it at https://github.com/MozVR/sechelt ?

Thanks!
  That actually isn't using A-Frame. A-Frame examples are at https://aframevr.github.io/aframe or http://aframe.io/examples

  Thanks for the PR! It's weird that the cursor doesn't work on mobile with a flat shading.If we change the shader to standard the cursor then will be affected by the lights in the scene and this is something you don't normally want. Let's investigate why the flat shading is not working for you.  Do you have a screenshot of the problem? 
 This might be due to the Android bug we fixed by bumping three.js. The shaders had some bugs on Android. It might work on the latest branch now.
 @sergioroja Have you tried if the bug is fixed on the dev branch?
  /cc @ngokevin 
 fixed when we bumped three, on our dev branch. we releasing a patch today
  Thanks for the feedback! Each entity can take one component of each type. If animations were components, How would you apply multiple animations to a single entity? How would an API to play animations in parallel or in sequence look like?
 We have https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/732

I had an idea to refactor animations such that we create an imperative API and `<a-animation>` uses that API, but unfortunately we have a couple other priorities before we start to focus on improvements to the animation system.
  This is a Nightly issue, not A-Frame. You will get that error on most pages you will visit, and you will have to create a new Firefox profile. I ran into this.
 No problem, sucks that it corrupts your profile.
  Hi, we will support this with custom shaders https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/880 alongside the extensibility with the custom component API we already have. These use cases can be implemented within the project rather than the core library. Thanks for filing!
  we wrap `setAttribute` and you can do for instance:

el.setAttribute('wasd-controls', { enabled: true, acceleration: 120 });

or to update a single property

el.setAttribute('wasd-controls', 'acceleration', 120);
 Going through the docs will help in understanding the entity-component system that A-Frame is introducing to the DOM. It's a new concept, but its composability over inheritance is powerful once learned. It's not actually complexity creep, it's actually the core and heart of A-Frame. If anything, helpers like `<a-cube>` can be considered creep.

If you want to update the component properties programatically, you can do:

``` js
el.setAttribute('wasd-controls', 'acceleration', 120);
// or...
el.setAttribute('wasd-controls', { acceleration: 120 });
```

 @potch We actually do all the components update within `setAttribute` to avoid the asynchrony of using `attributechangecallback`
 @potch in reall world applications you will potentially have thousands of entities and thousands of components. I prefer to see an entity and its associated components all in one place. We also explored a child/parent relationship but that results in confusion because you won't be able to differentiate what elements belong to your scene vs their associated components.
 Yeah, `setAtttribute` was made to run synchronously.

At this point, A-Frame is nearly a game engine and not just a toy, so naturally there will be some learning curve for traditional web developers. If we learn it, then we can appreciate the composability. There are solid reasons for the new syntax that overcomes the limitations of flat HTML attributes.

The problem with baking the logic into elements is that you lose complete flexibility such that it becomes useful to only a few people. That was always my problem with Web Component libraries like Brick. It looks pretty and succinct from the front, but in the end it's only as useful as the number of elements the maintainer ships and the attributes it exposes. 

With A-Frame, if someone ships, say, a Speech Recognition or Physics component, it can be plugged into any existing entity to modify its behavior today rather than having to ship and bake another Web Component.
 @potch the `setAttribute` wrapper only affects entity elements. In all the rest of DOM elements the default `setAttribute` applies
 Hm, at the moment, I'd say it's for web developers to easily create VR experiences. It's deceptively powerful, and we hope to resolve and improve messaging about it.

The DOM actually works nicely with entity-component. The DOM isn't just for writing static markup, but  it's also an interface. It's something web developers are familiar with, and we get interoperability with libraries like React, D3, and Popmotion for free. It greatly reduces the barrier to entry, although there are still concepts to learn.
 I like this translated-from-German quote from [this A-Frame article](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fthevrjump.com%2Fde%2Faframe-komponenten&edit-text=) by @rubenmueller

> So far, we have focused in the series of articles to A-frame on the basics and simple areas. It can quickly create the impression that A-frame something for beginners is more and nothing for experienced programmers \* inside or larger and complex projects.

> Exactly the opposite is not the case: A-Frame enables especially in larger projects a clean structure and long-term expandability. I had already addressed this integration with the React Framework. 
 VR development tools are currently tailored to game / computer graphics developers. Even in JS world libraries like three.js / playcanvas / goo create are more appealing to a game developer wanting to deliver content in the Web than they are for a pure front end Web developer. A-Frame approaches the space from the other side of the spectrum. How can we onboard front end developers into the computer games/graphics domain? A-Frame fills a knowledge gap by letting people reuse some of the concepts and ideas that they already understand (that doesn't mean there are no new things to learn)
1. Entities are DOM elements and represent things that are rendered on screen.
2. Components with their CSS like syntax customize their appearance and behavior.
3. The events API is the same one you already know and use in the traditional DOM.
4. Web inspectors operate as expected
5. And as @ngokevin said. a-frame can easily integrate with existing front end libraries. We don't force people to give up the tools they already know and like.

A-Frame might become obsolete as Web Developers learn new skills. It will be worth the effort If a-frame just helps some people with the transition. Only time will say if a-frame is just an interim solution or delivers long term value. We have a bunch of features in the pipeline that we think enable interesting use cases that no other existing solutions offer today.
 @potch A-Frame will still have the `<a-camera look-controls-enabled="true" fov="80" acceleration="20">` syntax helpers for newcomers. We believe the extensibility and permissionless innovation enabled by entity-component is one of the core values of A-Frame and will not being going away

To help get past the style-like syntax, in the future we will have a stylesheet format for defining component properties.

Seriously, thanks for the feedback! Will be closing as not actionable.

 @enjalot if you replace your `a-cubes` with `a-entity`. Do you see the same problem?
 I don't think this is a problem with the cursor. If you wait for the animation triggered on mouseenter to finish and then you move the mouse out of the object the animation triggered on mouseleave plays consistently. I think it's a problem with having two animations playing at the same time.
 If it was cursor-related, this was probably fixed by e4900e16ea9228af39d2a4fef6798393e79bd82a.
 mouseleave is fixed, but this is a dupe of two animations at the same time https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/857
  @misterburton Can you provide an example to reproduce?
 We believe it is a bug with the cursor. Manually registering the events, `mouseleave` still doesn't fire well.
 I don't think this is a problem with the cursor. If you wait for the animation triggered on mouseenter to finish and then you move the mouse out of the object the animation triggered on mouseleave plays as expected. The problem only reproduces if you move the mouse out of the object before the mouseenter animation finishes. I think it's a problem with having two animations playing at the same time.
 We have logged this in our next milestone: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1036

The two animations are colliding, so introducing an `end` event may help. Feel free to submit a PR!

> aframe.js:39054 THREE.WebGLRenderer: OES_texture_float_linear extension not supported.

Hmm, that's very interesting considering we don't have any textures whatsoever in the Hello World example. It could be that the [blank `url()` for `<a-sky>`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/e49552/src/elements/templates/a-sky/index.html#L13) is causing this. I'm not sure.

I see mrdoob/three.js#6606 mention similar issues but it seems to be related to only videos and cubemaps.

I wonder if this error is even what's causing the black error though. Will need to investigate some more.
 @i3games: thanks for sharing that info - that helps. and sharing the snippet should help folks until this gets fixed in the upcoming release. appreciate it :+1: 
 is fixed on our dev branch, we will be releasing a patch today
  I think HMD-control should be its own component. When I was writing [fps look component](https://github.com/cemkod/aframe-fps-look-component), I found out mouse look and hmd look are coupled in a single component, so replacing one of them is not possible without duplicating code. 

[No click look controls](https://github.com/alexrkass/aframe-no-click-look-controls) also seems to hit this barrier and chose to duplicate the hmd tracking code in their component.

I think this should be more modular so that we can replace just the desktop look behaviour with a component.
 @dmarcos Does this sound good to go ahead with?
 I would like to keep look-controls as they are. We can have other components like `fps-controls` that will be used instead of `look-controls`. They will manage internally the different inputs mouse/hmd to move the entity accordingly.  I prefer to see purpose specific controls instead of a set of input method oriented ones. How you handle hmd/keyboard/mouse input is application specific.
 If it's split up, can we create purpose-specific controls that use dependency components like hmd-controls and mouse-controls and fps-controls?
 as @donmccurdy said making them composable is difficult. Composing rotations and translations in the way you want is tricky. It's better to just let each controls listen to the inputs they care about and handle the composition internally. I think self contained single purpose specific controls is a better approach 
 I think for now, we will recommend self-contained controls, even if they are duplicating logic for now. 
  This is because npm runs the npm directives through `cmd.exe` on Windows. We're using pure node scripts now on the (dev)[https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/dev/package.json] brand and this problem will be fixed in the next release. Thanks for reporting.
  Controls should be non-opinionated and should be free to swap out, but for an out-of-the-box experience, we should use some form of pointer lock rather than click/drag (on desktop, maybe VR mode only?).
 Here is my implementation of pointer locked look controls for reference: https://github.com/cemkod/aframe-fps-look-component
 I don' think lock by default it's the more sensible since an aframe scene can share space with other content in the page
 I would prefer to have a separate set of controls to provide that functionality as @cemkod has done. theres's a lot of value on keeping components as simple as possible. There will be less bugs and make it easier for people to understand them and do derivative work. @RangerMove would it make sense to you to see look-controls (with no pointer lock) and a different set of fps-controls (with pointer lock)?
 @dmarcos: Please see: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/850 as it is somewhat relevant.
Currently a component like the fps look control i made needs to duplicate hmd controls too, otherwise it camera doesn't work as expected on vr mode.
 Pointer lock only on focus or full screen would allow for multiple scenes. Separate components sound good. Until we resolve our component consumption story, might be worth pulling into standard components.
 Thanks! @alexrkass I point to your examples so people can have a quick look:

https://alexrkass.github.io/no-click-example/

http://alexrkass.github.io/aframe-thetarestricted-example/
 I definitely think we should _support_ Pointer Lock. But I'm not sure if Pointer Lock should be the default. IMO the main reasons would be (1) Pointer Lock, though very useful, is not super common on the Web so it might be confusing for users, and (2) Firefox still prompts for permission first (Chrome doesn't, fwiw). I mentioned some pros and cons of using Pointer Lock in this issue: https://github.com/alexrkass/aframe-no-click-look-controls/issues/1#issue-126760588
 Pointer lock _upon entering fullscreen / VR_ would be the default. Mousedrag is a bit irritating for first-person scenes.
 > Pointer lock upon entering fullscreen / VR would be the default.

IMO, a gamepad is the ideal experience. Though I saw you closed #785 since we probably don't want to introduce gamepad support in the core aframe lib. I'd rather us have stellar out-of-the-box gamepad support for many controllers. And if we detect the presence of a gamepad we use that. Otherwise, we fall back to these mouse/WASD controls (or Pointer Lock, in the case of FPS).

> Mousedrag is a bit irritating for first-person scenes.

Yeah, good point. I totally agree.
 Also, FWIW, I filed this back in September as #471
 See my good comment [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/471#issuecomment-190048811)
 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1248#discussion_r60652822

We're going to publish pointer lock as a third-party controls. The direction of A-Frame is veering more towards serious VR rather than flat experiences. Mousedrag is the bare minimum default controls for non-VR users to at least look around. But if you want to design for flat experiences, the components/controls will be available
 @ZhuJo I would open an issue on https://github.com/alexrkass/no-click-look-controls 
It's also not that big, just 262 lines. I see that the `dist` is including A-Frame itself and it should not. Try to create your own controls by using only the component code: https://github.com/alexrkass/aframe-no-click-look-controls/blob/master/index.js On a quick glance I don't see any reasons why it should not work with A-Frame 0.7.1  From @brianchirls on [WebVR Slack](https://webvr.slack.com/messages/help-and-bugs/):

> **brianchirls [5:53 AM]**
> @joshcarpenter et al: I ran a quick CPU profile of a-frame, and it looks like raycasting is the slowest thing. I’ll be working on my own optimized solution for that today and will let you know what I find out. But…a good way to speed it up is to turn off raycasting for photo spheres, since they’ll ​_always_​ show up wherever you look. Or even exclude any objects that don’t have an event listener or something on them.
 Thanks for analysis and raising the performance issue. In the issue you posted there's a link to an octree based raycaster implementation. I think this should be fixed on the three.js side. @brianchirls Do you think there's something on the aframe side we should do?
 The easiest thing I plan on doing is adding options to the raycaster component to whitelist (and possibly ignore) targets. Then reflect that in the cursor component.

Clear color rather than single-color skyspheres would also be a good enhancement.

Am getting lots of feedback about using DAE in A-Frame. Feedback seems pretty unanimous that DAE is an awful format for end user delivery, and outdated in broader industry. I think we need to seriously consider whether we want to encourage it's use by including in A-Frame. Switching to GLTF would (apparently, I haven't had time to look into it deeply) give performance and load time benefits.

I've pinged the internal games mailing list for their opinion. In meantime we should be look at level of effort to switch from DAE to GLTF in A-Frame. Tony says his new Three.js GLTF importer should be ready soon.

eg:

https://www.reddit.com/r/WebVR/comments/3scbtx/video_the_mozvr_team_talks_about_their_new_aframe/

> a-frame supporting DAE would be like img tags supporting PSD. It sounds kinds nice and super-convenient. But, it's also a very sure plan to give webvr a solid reputation for being embarrassingly slow to load.
> 
> DAE is explicitly designed to be an editor format and explicitly not designed to be an end-user delivery format.
> 
> Although I can see many arguments in favor of making DAE convenient to embed in the web, I must strongly recommend against it. Instead, promoting DAE -> glTF converters as the equivalent of PSD -> PNG (an important step in the sensible and responsible process required to respect the users bandwidth/time) would be much better in the long run.
> 
> edit: Just in case FBX, OBJ or STL support is also planned, I'll also recommend thinking more than twice about reconsidering their support. Frankly, glTF (preferably compressed) is the first simple, non-proprietary 3D model format I'm aware of that isn't ridiculously bad for end-user delivery.

Tony Parisi reports (via WebVR Slack discussion):

> The official glTF repo has the latest Three.js loader, which is ​_almost_​ done: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF
> branch threejs-importer has the truly latest. i need another week or so, squashing some serious bugs with skinning
> after that I will send Ricardo a PR and it should get into the Three.js repo shortly after that

Using DAE-to-GLTF converter I could start exporting GLTF files from C4D tomorrow.

More feedback from Vlad:

> Yep, what jeff said. Collada is really a tool interchange format, it was never good (or intended for) direct asset loading.  GLTF is designed for explicitly that (and conversely, is not great for interchange -- you'd use collada to ship stuff between various tools, then do a final bake/cook into GLTF).

And @kearwood:

> +1 for GLTF as a run-time format. Note that GLTF also has the capacity to encapsulate an entire scene, but in a less human-friendly (although json based) format.  A broader topic may be to determine the interaction between the GLTF imported scene graph nodes and those declared with a-frame syntax.  For example, Unity deals with this by presenting similar UX as a prefab within the editor and IIRC allows you to traverse these nodes as regular scene graph nodes through its api.  Exposing these interior nodes from the GLTF format may be necessary when rigged models are supported within a-frame.

We currently support OBJ and Collada formats. Investing in GLTF in the long term might be the way to go. In the short term, the spec is not finalized and there's no content out there published in GLTF. Most of the `aframe` users won't create their own models and will want to use premade assets. None of the sites out there with free content will be useful for them.

Having looked into this further, I agree that it's probably too early to go with gLTF only. I've been trying to use the converters today and the workflows are all pretty rough. Or based on the outdated 0.8 spec. I instead will change this issue to "Add support for gLTF", instead of "switch to"

Woot. Got a workflow going here by using Tony's latest loader from the glTF repo and the Cesium Collada to GLTF converter:

Initial promising results have turned into new dead ends:
- Cannot get textured modes from DAE source --> [Cesium Converter](http://cesiumjs.org/convertmodel.html) --> new glTF loader. Have tried lots of different approaches, with no luck.
- The `.gltf` source from the Cesium Converter looks different (much more verbose) than the files included in the gltf repo. Even when I use identical source DAE files. Makes me think the repo models were converted with the command line 
- I tried switching to the command line tools, and there too, I hit problems, as documented here: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/issues/494

Overall impression is the workflow is still half baked. If I could find a reliable Cinema4D to textured GLTF pipeline we'd be set. But for the time being it doesn't look possible.

> - Cannot get textured modes from DAE source --> [Cesium Converter](http://cesiumjs.org/convertmodel.html) --> new glTF loader. Have tried lots of different approaches, with no luck.

The monster model in the [the three.js example](http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_loader_gltf.html) looks like it was converted from the COLLADA model from the [original source](http://www.3drt.com/3dm/free/3drt.com-free-monster-animated-character.zip): https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/models/gltf/monster/monster.dae
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/models/gltf/monster/monster.json#L2436

The duck model used in the same [three.js example](http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_loader_gltf.html) looks like it was converted from a COLLADA model: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/models/gltf/duck#readme
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/models/gltf/duck/duck.json#L61

Tony added both of those models.

> - The `.gltf` source from the Cesium Converter looks different (much more verbose) than the files included in the gltf repo. Even when I use identical source DAE files. Makes me think the repo models were converted with the command line 

This converter is actually backed by a simple Node service that just calls the command-line `collada2gltf` binary directly (with simple input, output, and some undocumented flag [at least not in `./collada2gltf -h`] called `-e` [which seems to _embed_](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/collada2gltf-web-service/blob/master/lib/collada2gltf.js#L29) the resources [e.g., shader files]):

If you run `./collada2gltf` without the `-e` flag, that'll get you what you want.

Yeah I came across some of these undocumented commands earlier today in convertAll.sh: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/sampleModels/convertAll.sh

Make standard glTF:
`collada2gltf -d -f sourcefile.dae -o outputpath/outputfile.gltf`

Use `-e` flag to embed assets:
`collada2gltf -d -e -f sourcefile.dae -o outputpath/outputfile.gltf`

Use `-k` flag for MaterialsCommon
`collada2gltf -d -k -f sourcefile.dae -o outputpath/outputfile.gltf``

And there also seems to be a ModelConverter for outputing binary glTF:
`ModelConverter -b -i sourcefile.dae -o outputpath/outputfile.glb`

I haven't had time to pick through the glTF spec, but it based on examples like the [CesiumMilkTruck](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/sampleModels/CesiumMilkTruck) it looks like standard glTF leaves everything unbundled, and binary, embedded and MaterialsCommon all have varying levels of optimization/bundling.

I've been working with those models as well as others from the glTF repo, and comparing them with DAEs from C4D. There's not much consistency in results, unfortunately. Even among the "canonical" models.

@kliang3: it's on the roadmap. we've been waiting for gLTF stability before add support. there are several upcoming changes to the THREE.js loader we've heard.

it's just a matter of adding the THREE.js loader (and keeping it up to date, likely using [`three-dev`](https://github.com/ngokevin/three-dev)):
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/webgl_loader_gltf.html
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/js/loaders/gltf/glTFLoader.js

anyone is welcome to help here. but we'll keep this issue up to date. let us know if you have any other questions.
 Support has landed on three.js https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/8316
 Yep, I saw - we should test
 Nice work! https://github.com/xirvr/aframe-gltf

This will become "out-of-the-box" once we have component lazy-loading.

When running the examples, there is a constant stream of the following error message in console log:
`Invalid timestamps detected. Time step between successive gyroscope sensor samples is very small or not monotonic`

Gyro controls seem to be responsive with no lag.

If you make a small typo like `<a-entity geometry="primitive box;">`, it fails silently.

When viewing the example in the package at examples/template-video/index.html on mobile devices, all I see is a black rectangle where the video should be.

Chrome 47.0.2526.83 on Android 5.1.1 Samsung Note 5
Safari on iOS 9.0.2 on iPhone 6 

There are no javascript errors when running this on Android Chrome. 

The example at http://threejs.org/examples/#canvas_materials_video is giving me similar results, perhaps I should escalate to threejs? (Edit: created an [issue there too](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/7932))

I've tried a bunch of different video file formats on different browsers/devices, and results are very uneven and scattered, but I couldn't get any video files to work on mobile whatsoever except I got this example to work in firefox on Android.

I could list out everything I've tried, but since sharing and working with video files is kind of cumbersome, let's see if we can get _just this one_ video file to work on mobile chrome/safari first. 

Thanks!

Thanks for the detailed issue. Unfortunately, this is a known issue. See original issue filed here: aframevr/aframe#316.

It has to do with Chrome for Android disabling `<video>` autoplay by default; you have to play a video upon a user-initiated event. We'd love if the platform just supported it out of the box, but likely for some time things aren't going to change. In the meantime, I'm going to introduce a "play" button that will start the videos that are detected on the page (if any).

Antialiasing is disabled. We saw a big performance boost by disabling it.

Want to be able to have positional audio from a video which would require a separate sound entity and a video-textured entity. Sound component accepting a video source would allow them to sync.

JS Bin, JS Fiddle, and many online code editors that embed pages do so using just an `<iframe>`. This means when we `requestFullScreen({vrDisplay: vrHMD})`, the browser blocks the ability to enter fullscreen/VR mode.

So actually when you click on the enter VR button, we enter stereo, the button disappears, but we don't actually enter fullscreen mode.

Load http://bl.ocks.org/enjalot/8be32e6f1f32920ba841 for example
And see the console:

> Request for full-screen was denied because at least one of the document's containing iframes does not have an "allowfullscreen" attribute.

<hr>

CodePen, thankfully, does `<iframe allowfullscreen="yes">` so we're good there :heart_eyes:. We should look into reaching out to JS Bin and JSFiddle seeing if they would be willing to allow bins to enter fullscreen. In just the past few days, I've seen many folks creating their own JS Bins even though we have a forkable CodePen ready to use. So, there's definitely folks out there who could benefit from this.

So, let's first fix the Enter VR button when we failed to actually enter VR. We can provide some error state - some icon with messaging. Then we can do do some outreach to get folks to allow codebin services to allow entering fullscreen on iframes. And hopefully sometime next year we'll have an API that replaces `requestFullScreen` so we don't have any of these issues.
 @cvan originally filed the issue. I haven't seen much use of embedded bins, but have seen some share the full editor around. It would be a bit more useful to fullscreen embedded scenes given their smaller size.

But the new WebVR API no longer depends on fullscreen which makes this less of an issue.
 API no longer depends on full screen. Don't think it should be A-Frame to handle runtime compat warnings with third-party playground sites. We are recommending Glitch/CodePen which does not have this problem.  <a href="https://github.com/cvan"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/203725?v=3" align="left" width="96" height="96" hspace="10"></img></a> **Issue by [cvan](https://github.com/cvan)**

The goal is to make the concept of mixin easier to grasp by Web Developers. This is an example taken from Twitter bootstrap:

``` html
 <div class="dropdown"></div>
```

Our entities would look like:

``` html
<a-entity class="cube"></div>
<a-class geometry="primitive: box" material="color: red"></a-class>
```

Not 100% sure if this is a good idea because our mixins behave a bit differently than CSS classes. For instance, mixins are dynamic as opposed to classes being static. You can change the list of classes for a given element but you cannot modify an existing class at runtime.  Our classs will also be defined in the DOM and not in a style sheet.

We could provide primitives that help people getting acquainted with the E/C arquitecture.  It would be an `a-frame bootstrap` library with a set of mixins/classes to create basic elements. Specialization will still work as you would expect. If you want to make a green cube you would do:

``` html
<a-entity class="cube" material="color: green"></a-entity>
```
 I think mixin is more clear on what it does. We can still have the bootstrap idea but with mixins.

`class` might be used by developers for running querySelectors later rather than applying mixins, so we don't want to conflate the two.

Re-open if you think there's a good case for this.

If I naïvely create a `<video autoplay="false">`, the video will still autoplay.

See http://codepen.io/team/mozvr/pen/6b5b73a9b78c8e3d315d6976723da3a1/

The `<video>` element has been [spec'd to be kind of weirdly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#Attributes).

It'd be nice to prevent such footguns (or handle logic in templates - but primitives will solve).

It looks like the Audio was positioned different in chrome than Firefox 
 I'll have to try again at some point and post a test case.
 I found that if you position the sound at the level of your head, a bit forward, it sounds pretty fine:

``` 
<a-entity position="0 1.7 -0.5" sound="src: #soundAsset; autoplay: true;"></a-entity>
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```  This happens when the audio source is exactly on the same plane as the camera and you move the camera cut across the plane perpendicularly.

e.g., `<a-entity sound position="0 0 0">` and `<a-camera position="0 1.6 0">`.   <a href="https://github.com/cvan"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/203725?v=3" align="left" width="96" height="96" hspace="10"></img></a> **Issue by [cvan](https://github.com/cvan)**

It will be common to superimpose images w/ alpha channels. There is a currently a footgun where order of declaration in the DOM must be carefully managed, or transparent elements will cull each other.

For example, in the AnimeUI test scene in A-Frame, I have a series of transparent images arranged on the z-axis. I must declare them in order of depth, furthest from camera to closest, or I get blending problems.

``` html
<vr-image src="images/schematic1.png" width="7" height="7" position="0 0 -6"></vr-image>
<vr-image src="images/ring2.png" width="3" height="3" position="0 0 -2"></vr-image>
<vr-image src="images/ring1.png" width="0.5" height="0.5" position="0 0 0"></vr-image>
```

This is what it looks like when the user takes the correct steps:

![anime-ui](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1425497/11314580/b3768a20-8f9b-11e5-97d4-a49b65d7f3ca.png)

This is problematic because:
- The failure state is obvious and ugly
- The cause will not be obvious to users
- The resolution is sometimes not feasible. The point of A-Frame is grouping elements to fit your scene layout and mental model. The current resolution forces you to group things by z-axis.

We should solve this automatically for users.

I've had to fiddle with a bunch of different properties in the past.   I really don't fully understand how each one works under the hood, but if re-arranging the order in which objects are added to the scene doesn't work, i've used some of these properties in different combinations to get things working:

`Mesh.renderOrder`
Controls the order in which objects are rendered.

`Material.depthTest=false`
Whether to have depth test enabled when rendering this material. Default is true.

Here's a good fiddle I found that demonstrates the combo:
http://jsfiddle.net/sg02e5sm/2/

`Material.alphaTest`
Sometimes the alpha on the texture itself is problematic.   Adjusting this value can make it work properly.   It does clip data sometimes though if you are not careful.

`Renderer.sortObjects`
Defines whether the renderer should sort objects. Default is true.

Each of these have different impacts on perf as well (especially forcing sort order).

As per @jcarpenter, The user shouldn't have to deal with any of this.    I think we could probably be intelligent with how objects are sorted in the scene to make it work for most people.

Yes as mrdoob says it's not an easy problem and there're a lot of papers about how to do a real OIT.
@caseyyee pointed some properties that can be use for simple scenes and mainly for billboards as the one used on particles that they're just simple planes. 
The problem is when the objects intersect between them, just as simple as like two boxes colliding. If two boxes intersect each other you can't fix it by change the rendering order, in that case you should split the faces and do a sorting for faces not objects. In this case the sorting is a huge bottleneck.
One step further is when some faces intersect each other in this case, the most general one, you need to sort by fragments not just even by faces, so the result is a huge performance problem.
So as mrdoob pointed the only easy solution could be that the GPU would take care of that for the most general case, meanwhile I believe we could just rely on this kind of tricks and simple properties to finetune our scene :disappointed:

Just spent 20 minutes trying to figure out why animating opacity on a foreground element was making all other images in the scene disappear. It’s because they were further away in z-space, and I forgot to take into account this issue. I definitely foresee some huge user confusion on this one...

Sent email to Games mailing list about this...
 `material="alphaTest: 0.5"` seems to magically help in most cases. I'm not sure why that's disabled. @dmarcos, aware of any history? As far as I remember it was disabled to favor manual control. We can revisit. I have not dealt much with transparent objects so no familliar with all the problematic of automatic sorting. +1 for defaulting to `true` with an option to disable. Here is an example: https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/#model=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter/master/polly/project_polly.gltf

As you rotate the scene around, watch the glass display sign at the front of the scene. The "Polly" text will appear and disappear from the sign, depending on camera orientation, because of transparency sort issues. This type of problem cannot be trivially solved in WebGL... the proper solution here would be for the artist to split the mesh of the glass casing in two parts, so that transparency sort will resolve correctly. Scene tree order isn't used, the order is:

1. draw opaque objects, in order from furthest away to nearest.
2. draw transparent objects, in order from furthest away to nearest.

Three.js does expose an [`object.renderOrder`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Object3D.renderOrder) property to override sort order. You can also turn off the depth sort, in which case order is probably based on the scene tree but I'm not sure. Related reading: https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Transparency_Sorting

Usually three.js's defaults are what you want. A-Frame does not currently expose an HTML attribute to override sort order, but this is easy to implement. I do still say +1 for removing that line. Even better (IMO) would be to create  a `renderer` scene component exposing a few more advanced options:

```html
<a-scene renderer="sortObjects: true;
                   gammaOutput: true;
                   physicallyCorrectLights: true">
  ...
</a-scene>
```

^The other two properties I suggest are required for "technically correct" glTF rendering. These can be done in user-land components, but to change `gammaOutput` you have to recompile every shader in the scene, so it's definitely preferable to have that set correctly during initialization. Suggested a fix in #3424, and we could leave the default `sortObjects=false` while still allowing others to override it. For what it's worth, since I don't see it mentioned elsewhere in the thread, it is easy to do a component patching this as needed:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('my-renderer-settings', {
  init: function () {
    var sceneEl = this.el;
    sceneEl.renderer.sortObjects = true;
    sceneEl.renderer.gammaOutput = true;
  }
});

The canvas where we paint the scene has transparent background. When we go fullscreen we lose the default color of body and it's replaced with whatever the compositor puts in the background when an element goes fullscreen. How should we handle this?

I thought we should enable `<vr-scene material="color: black">` - thoughts?
 Accidentally closed during merge
 Use renderer `.setClearColor` in `src/core/scene/a-scene.js`. 

Off-white is appealing (`#DADADA`)...though also consider off-black `#111` to reduce eye strain in headsets.

Bonus points for making this configurable. `<a-scene renderer="clearColor: #222">`

Keeping a WIP at https://github.com/MozVR/aframe-core/pull/348
 This would add a ton of depth to even basic scenes.   Would love to have this in the next release.
 We have our plates full for the next release and need to fight off some feature creep, but definitely soon after. There's extra work involved in bumping three.js since they revamped shadows. And arguably, text + physics are more valuable features. But the component itself is fairly simple, though I had some trouble fine-tuning the shadows back in Nov
 Cool. Yeah, didn't get it merged last time because I had trouble tuning the shadows to look good, and then never got back around to it.
 Or an API like:

```
<a-scene shadow="type: soft">
  <a-box shadow="cast: false; receive: true"></a-box>
  <a-entity light light-shadow>
</a-scene>
```

Where `<a-scene shadow>` is defined as a system: `AFRAME.registerSystem('shadow', {})`
 @takahirox I'm not sure about a roadmap for official support, but the bugs I mentioned above about `aframe-extras.shadows` have been fixed. @ngokevin +1 for that suggested syntax change, and having either a system or a scene-level component that configures the renderer. What do you think about aiming to include shadows in 0.5.0? Or would a registry package be best? I support shadows for core, the PR is already tagged for the 0.5.0 milestone SG. Before I (or someone) opens a PR, here's a proposed structure:

```
src/extras/
├── ...
└── shadows/
    ├── components/
    │   ├── index.js
    │   ├── shadow.js
    │   └── shadow-light.js
    ├── systems/
    │   ├── index.js
    │   └── shadow.js
    └── index.js
```

Is this consistent with what you have in mind, @ngokevin @dmarcos @takahirox ? May be worth considering whether `shadow-light` should be a separate component or simply add some functionality into the `light` component. It [modifies the schema significantly](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/shadows/shadow-light.js), but doesn't do all that much otherwise. Slightly leaning towards putting the light's shadow parameters as a part of light since the shadow-light component needs a light, and the light component is very small so it doesn't hurt adding the shadow pieces. Cool, this sounds good to me (i just haven't had time to start yet).

I'll re-assign to myself and remove the 'help wanted' tag if my schedule frees up before someone else takes it. So this issue is still up-for-grabs now.  I agree also that looks more convenient to add it to `light` instead of another component, it's typically how it works on 3d software, you add a light, click shadows and you're ready to go.  <a href="https://github.com/caseyyee"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1560884?v=3" align="left" width="96" height="96" hspace="10"></img></a> **Issue by [caseyyee](https://github.com/caseyyee)**

Otherwise the cursor can be obscured by foreground element and rendered behind objects.

Also causes eye strain since it is basically floating in your gaze in front of everything.

Just watched "Oculus Connect 2: Game Design Un-Rules: Examining Design Failures in Time Machine VR" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14p9mqs2LiQ

In this game, Instead of a specific target reticule.   The designers used concentric circles to form a holographic  tube.   They found that this:
- Avoids parallax eye un-focus issues.  Much more comfortable for users.
- The holographic/semi-transparent treatment proved less distracting to users.
- Surprisingly accurate.
 I'm ok to close. I don't think this is easy to implement in a generic way and would probably better done in an external component.

Currently, if I have an **invisible** sphere in front of a **visible** cube, clicking with gaze-based cursor results in a `click` event for the invisible sphere, not the cube. This was unexpected to me and was not the behaviour I desired.

If you want elements that can be intersected when "invisible" then I would recommend folks use `material="opacity: 0"`. Thoughts, @dmarcos?

![text-selection-canvas](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/203725/10746552/55ad0d6a-7c09-11e5-8fc6-981b780b8f06.gif)
1. Load http://localhost:9001/examples/panoexplorer/
2. Double click on the page a couple times
3. Notice the blue highlight, especially visible with the three block images
4. Select the entire text of the page (using **`Command` + `A`**)
5. Notice the blue highlight again

How to fix?

This is a start:

``` css
.vr-canvas {
  -webkit-user-select: none;
  -moz-user-select: none;
  user-select: none;
}

::selection {
  background: transparent;
}

::moz-selection {
  background: transparent;
}
```

But it doesn't completely solve the problem. And you don't want to disable the text-selection color for the entire page; there could be a sidebar, text/legend at the top or bottom of the site.

I think you need to actually do like disable text selection on all the canvases like so:

``` js
canvas.addEventListener('selectionstart', function () {
  // stop propagation *and* prevent default!
  return false;
});
```

There's probably some better solution. Investigate!
 cant repro, is this fixed?

Enables the developer to specify the physics properties of their scene.

For example:
- Collision behaviors (eg all objects default to rigid bodies w/ collision enabled by default?)
- Player movements (eg slower walking speed for underwater level)
- Gravity (eg low gravity for moon level)

Per @kearwood's advice, we should also make sure that collisions are relatively low-friction, so a user walking past a cube does not become stuck unnecessarily.
 https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-physics-components
 And with Oimo https://github.com/JoshGalvin/aphysics

We'll compare which is more appropriate. Feel free to vote for an engine.
 @bnolan Thanks for the breakdown
 @bnolan thanks so much for input from your experience! We knew about the Cannon being better documented, Oimo being quick, and Ammo being big, but the notes about friction, framework, interpolation are great to know
 I think we'll keep external at https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system for now (given the file size and not all scenes need physics). If it becomes more ubiquitous, we can naturally re-consider.  <a href="https://github.com/nickdesaulniers"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1823839?v=3" align="left" width="96" height="96" hspace="10"></img></a> **Issue by [nickdesaulniers](https://github.com/nickdesaulniers)**

Enables developer to display something in scene for user while asset is being pulled down. It's not uncommon for models to be multiple MB.
 This could be done as a simple component, possibly for the Registry or as a project component. Display something until `model-loaded` fires.

```
<a-entity model>
  <a-entity indicator geometry material/>
</a-entity>
```

```
AFRAME.registerComponent('indicator', {
  init: function () {
    // Remove this entity when `model-loaded` fires.
  }
});
``` Yeah. You can also check if the model is already there with getObject3D('mesh').

Should text be part of `vr-markup` or provided by `vr-elements`?

alternatively https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-text-component
 This will be handled by 3rd party components.
 https://github.com/bryik/aframe-bmfont-text-component has a case for standard since it works well. But component consumption story would solve it as well and give us less code to maintain.

Enables user to easily add links to their scenes.

User can specify:
- href
- Name of link
- Anything else?

We'll need to decide if the link is triggered by physical collision and/or by cursor click event. I imagine we can start with physical collision. And if users want to define clickable links on other types of objects, they can use click event components to do so.

From Oct 13 meeting: 

vr-loader as currently implemented will work on Chrome Mobile, but not on Chrome desktop. Team consensus is therefore not to ship it in v1. Instead, we will: 
- For v1: attribute changes (eg swap panos) only. Evangelize this to devs.
- In the future: either...
  - Wait for new WebVR API and new mechanism for entering VR
  - `[or]` Implement `vr-loader`, with new implementation that switches inner content of the page, instead of current iframe hacks. Limitation is it only works across sites that use A-Frame.

If the site is built with A-Frame, we should swap the scene contents (see issue #113 and PR #264). If the site is not built with A-Frame or is not a VR site, we should just do a synchronous `window.location.href`.

Any thoughts on how this will look? If the look of a link is defined by default you might consider adding attributes based on how it looks, like an outline color, an image for the link, etc. Coming from Janus I'm used to a link looking like a portal but I'm not sure what you guys are envisioning here.

The link component would only add behavior of linking (check for collision detection, or clicks, then navigate). The appearance is agnostic and would be defined by components such as `material` and `geometry` components.

An example API would be

``` html
<a-entity link="to: http://janusvr.com" geometry="primitive: plane" material="src: portaltexture.jpg">
```

So more like typical HTML where you can surround something like an image in an anchor tag?

Well, I wouldn't say so because surrounding something implies hierarchy and a parent-child relationship.

Combining link + geometry + material components implies composability. Like you could add a sound component too to give a portal sound. Or a look-at component to always have portals face the user.

Yeah sorry I ninja-edited that in
 Until we land this in this repo (if we so choose to do anytime soon) and until the WebVR 1.0 API ships, in the interim we should show folks how to do this if they want to. CodePen snippets would suffice. It'd probably be helpful to document this in the A-Frame FAQ and/or Docs.
 Sorry, I will update the FAQ now. We are currently improving the link traversal experience in the browser and spec. While we got it working, we want to improve it before releasing documentation + components.
 My PR with the link component is still opened https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1575/files#diff-de1c6f37e5303b00ff65041ea3b0ad69R3

The API for link traversal is not completely agreed upon yet. Should we hold on a link component a bit more?
 The `vrdisplayactivate` event does not seem to be properly implemented on either Firefox or Chrome. I would postpone this to a `0.4.1` release as soon as a minimal functionality is available in browsers.
 Sounds good to me.
 Not yet. the feature is scoped for 0.6.0 #1575  <a href="https://github.com/jcarpenter"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425497?v=3" align="left" width="96" height="96" hspace="10"></img></a> **Issue by [jcarpenter](https://github.com/jcarpenter)**

cssvr shared depth buffer issues
 Due to browser security, this is non-trivial.

With three.js, you can currently overlay a CSS-transformed I-Frame element over the canvas. This works okay, but this falls apart with VR and stereoscopic rendering.

It is possible to render a canvas as a texture, and we can create images using the DOM. But not sure if we can do that with I-Frames.

Crazier solutions involve a backend server streaming textures.
 Unfortunately, this is not possible without having a new Web API to render elements as textures in WebGL. We could indeed position an iframe with CSS 3D transforms that integrates in the same coordinate system as the WebGL content but:
1. For stereo rendering, we would have to manually duplicate the DOM which is inefficient and will introduce confusion when handling events and selecting elements. 
2. Distortion wont be applied to the iframe since it's handled by the browser on the canvas element pushed to the HMD.
3. The iframe would always sit on top of the WebGL content making it useful only for HUD kind of applications. You could hack your way with techniques like alpha punching (that creates multiple canvases with wholes that let DOM elements pass through) that are very inefficient.
4. No shading can be applied to the iframe to integrate it in the 3D scene. Imagine you want to show an iframe behind a glass surface that reflects the environment. 

Until we have a browser API to render an arbitrary element as a texture in WebGL you won't be able to use iframes (or any other DOM element) in an aframe scene. There's some discussion going on to bring such a feature to gecko. More info here:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1237489
 Parallel discussion https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/974#issuecomment-189995329
 Closing because not possible. If a solution ever lands, we can re-open and add the feature ASAP.
 @cjroth btw, there is a MediaRecorder API (supported in both Firefox and Chrome/Chromium):

* https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/record-almost-everything-in-the-browser-with-mediarecorder/
* https://mozdevs.github.io/MediaRecorder-examples/
  /cc @ngokevin + @dmarcos 
 Is it working now?
 Needs more info / update
  Sure does!

https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react
https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react-boilerplate
 https://github.com/ngokevin/threeschwifty
https://github.com/ngokevin/a-wakens
 Yeah, we use the Custom Element API pretty heavily.

You can use plain A-Frame with plain React, but I'd recommend using `aframe-react` so you can pass component data as props using plain objects. You're going to end up doing that yourself anyways. It's a very thin unopinionated layer that preserves the entity-component system of A-Frame. I have some more features in mind too to help pair along with A-Frame.

``` js
const material = {color: 'red', metalness: 1};
<Entity geometry={{primitive: box, width: 5}} {...material}/>
```
 Yeah, it's quite genius, bringing ECS to the DOM. @jcarpenter and @dmarcos idea.
 Sorry, shouldn't be using acronyms :)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system
 Ah wow, yeah, that's very similar. I should read through that more and see if we can take any ideas from it.

Yeah, it's pretty agnostic. We found it works well with D3 too.
  Could be configurable with a scene component.
 @jcarpenter, @dmarcos we've talked about how to trigger/delay animations several times on and off weeks back. did we reach a conclusion of how we want to handle (either imperatively or declaratively) starting animations? we should probably put all the proposals together somewhere here in an issue to weigh the pros and cons and come to a conclusion.

a related issue: aframevr/aframe-core#761
 Not heavily documented yet, but components can be created for scenes. If we implement this, clever to force the scene to wait would be attaching a custom node and controlling when it becomes loaded, and thus controlling when the scene is loaded.

@dmarcos is also working on global play/pause functionality that might help this.

``` js
registerComponent('scene-wait-event', {
  schema: {
    eventName: { default: '' }
  },

  init: function () {
    if (!this.data.eventName) { return; }
    var node = document.createElement('a-node');
    el.appendChild(node);
    document.body.addEventListener(eventName, function () {
      node.load();
    });
  }
});
```
 You can also use the `begin` attr to control when animations play https://aframe.io/docs/core/animation.html#Begin
  Thanks!
  This is a bug. I filed https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/issues/765 in core to track this problem.
  There's not support for animated gifs applied as textures. This is why you only see the first frame.
 Sure! Please do
 https://github.com/mayognaise/aframe-gif-component
  Been following your work here. Excited to see where this goes.

Also related: aframevr/aframe-core#699 and #347
 Thanks for filing. We found this works: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/pull/782

Let us know if you have better solutions.
  It's `thetaLength` and `phiLength` instead of `phiEnd` and `thetaEnd`
 The documentation is ahead of the released version. `phiLength` and `thetaLength` are still in the `dev` branch of [aframe-core](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core) this is why they're not working on your example. You can play with this example and see: http://swimminglessonsformodernlife.com/aframe-core/examples/cube/

If you're not going to use the primitives and you have some tolerance for quirks :) you can move to use dev branch of the core. Sorry for the inconvenience
 @cvan We have to make sure that the published docs correspond to the
released version aka master branch. There's no `thetaLenght` and
`phiLength` properties in the published version

 Thanks for catching this. I'll need to start versioning our docs now. :+1: 
 blocked on aframevr/aframe-site#121
 @ngokevin: can you confirm this is fixed in PR #883?
 yeah
  Not a bug. Expected security behaviour of the browser.

It doesn't matter if the transport is http or https, the browser expects an access-control-allow-origin header to allow the resource to be loaded. 

aframe.io webserver returns this in the response header:
access-control-allow-origin:*

Your webserver doesn't have this field in response header. If you configure your webserver to send a response header that allows http://s.codepen.io or all domains (*), it will work.

Please see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing
  Does the examples of the website work for you? https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/sky/

You should be able to rotate the panorama with the mouse
 I think what he meant was rotating by linked x,y coords of mouse as opposed to dragging.
 Sorry for the misunderstanding. `look-controls` component only provides mouse dragging. Implementing a different component with a different control scheme is definitively possible. 
 Is there something actionable we want to do in this issue? Docs, create an example?
 @wahengchang: Have a look at this component I made. It may solve your problem:
https://github.com/cemkod/aframe-fps-look-component
 You can use the third-party components that simulate or implement pointer lock. We have issues on file to evaluate the default mouse controls. Thanks!
  Hi Peter, we haven't looked at AR applications yet and we're focused on other priorities for the next few months (eg improving mobile support, fixing bugs, etc) but this is an intriguing idea. Perhaps it could be implemented as a custom component. Eg "ARcamera". I'd start by writing up a mini spec and circulating it here, on Twitter, and on the A-Frame Slack. You may find people jump in to help :)
 I think we should change it back such that the orientation is absolute, rather than centered at 0,0,0 based on how the user holds the phone when they load the page. It used to be this way, but we arguably erroneously changed it to support the use case where the phone is laying on the desk and it starts off looking at the ground.
 I tend to agree. I open my phone a lot when it's flat on my desk.
 AR cameras and utilities: https://github.com/argonjs/argon-aframe for A-Frame There's also https://github.com/jeromeetienne/aframe-artoolkit that's worth checking out  Thanks @staus. Curved image in general needs a lot of work to be "smarter". We're looking to address that when we move to a new implementation of the primitives. My first draft of the new approach for curved image is here: https://github.com/jcarpenter/aframe/blob/primitives/elements/primitives/a-curvedimage.js It does not yet have the logic for automatically determining theta-length / height based on image dimensions, but it does implement new approach to setting texture, using `repeat: -1 1` instead of scale. TBH I can't recall _why_ I went this route (a month ago seems so long!) but I do recall it was after much fiddling with different combinations of side, scale, and repeat.
 now using repeat -1 1 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/883
  Very sorry about this; we'll be addressing this very soon. Thanks for filing!

 On mobile the cursor switches to fuse mode: You hover the element for a couple of seconds and a click event triggers. @AlexandreLeitao Does this work for you: http://swimminglessonsformodernlife.com/aframe-core/examples/panoexplorer/

  Thanks for filing this, @cemkod. We weren't able to do this before launch. In interim you should be able to use the sound component on an `<a-entity>`. Docs are here: https://aframe.io/docs/components/sound.html
 FWIW, in [aframe-core](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/), we do have a example, the [Pano Explorer](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/blob/1d07db6e/examples/panoexplorer/index.html#L17-L21), which makes use of the `sound` component. _(sidenote: those examples are not hosted online unfortunately [originally to minimise the size of the git checkouts]; see aframevr/aframe-core#689.)_
 I would probably file an issue to have a sound example added to the site though: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-site

There is a PR (#362) to merge aframe-core into this repo, so we would inherit the example with sound (Pano Explorer). But, IMO we should have an example dedicated purely to "sound" - hopefully nicely demonstrating positional sound. So, I would reopen this if you don't mind.
 I reopened the issue with comments from @cvan here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-site/issues/131
  This is a limitation of the WebVR APIs relying on `requestFullScreen` API. Whenever the location of the page changes, the full screen mode and hence the VR mode disengages. In future iterations of the WebVR APIs we will probably move away from `requestFullScreen` to allow page navigation without dropping the user from VR.
 As @dmarcos says, we are in the process of writing a spec that will enable seamless link-to-link traversal of WebVR pages. We are evaluating our platform options at the moment. We will be public and transparent with the authoring of the spec (likely to live here on GitHub à la the the [WebVR Spec](https://github.com/mozvr/webvr-spec). Once implemented, this will be a non issue.

I can keep this issue open, but there's nothing in A-Frame we can do beyond hacks. We have previously implemented a solution that works in Firefox only using `<iframe>` - originally designed for [HIRO](https://github.com/mozvr/hiro), a browser prototype from back in 2014 (check out [this video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-72zb81QFw), if you're interested).

And, there was also [a proof-of-concept solution](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/105/files) of swapping out the scene markup (and JS) from one A-Frame scene to another. But we decided to forgo this solution because it requires the scene to be an A-Frame scene to go from one to the next.

The third option is to embed multiple "pages" as different worlds wrapped in `<a-entity>`s and just use the `visible` component to do the toggling. It's not ideal, but you can achieve some pretty compelling effects using that.

Hope that helps :smile: 
 Yeah, I've implemented this before using hashes.

So you'd have `http://localhost:8080/panoviewer/#paris`, `http://localhost:8080/panoviewer/#tokyo`, `http://localhost:8080/panoviewer/#boston` which would just toggle the visibility so only the one defined in the hash gets disabled. That's one way to go about it.
 Also, if you're curious, here are how we've achieved (hacky) "link traversal" in Firefox before:

https://github.com/cvan/vrloader/blob/master/VRLoader.js
https://github.com/MozVR/hiro/blob/a6498dd/js/vrtab.js
https://github.com/MozVR/hiro/blob/a6498dd/js/vrmanager.js

Chrome will let you fullscreen only the canvas, so these hacks won't work there (that is, you'll be dropped out of fullscreen mode).
 User input is needed to request full screen. That's a security constraint of the requestFullscreen API so websites cannot take control of the display without the user being aware of it.
 @tbalouet: we would have an "Enter VR" button which would trigger a fullscreen for the first scene. and then as long as you have `<iframe allowfullscreen>`, you'll be able to fullscreen the iframe (i.e., enter VR mode).
 This will have to wait for the next WebVR API which we will have a separate issue for when it comes time. Thanks for filing!
  If you have an Oculus or Cardboard you can use it with a-frame. Does this answer your question?
 Documentation on using A-Frame sites with VR devices is here: https://aframe.io/docs/guide/entering-vr.html
 Kindly closing as the question was answered. If there's anything else you need, please do let us know. Thanks!
  Material is undefined unless it's explicitly added by a component. We can do it through the DOM. Here's an encapsulated approach.

``` js
init: function () {
  el.setAttribute('material', 'map', fontMap);
  el.setAttribute('material', 'side', 'double');
  el.addEventListener('componentchanged', function (evt) {
    if (evt.detail.name === 'material' && 'color' in diff(evt.detail.oldData, evt.detail.newData)) {
      updateSDFShader()  
    }
  });
}
```

I think it's up to you whether you want that in a new separate material component or within the font component, depending on use cases.
- A-Frame Core has Promise polyfills in the bundle.
- The `update()` called after `init()` is intended. The no `oldData` parameter is expected, but I'm up for suggestions to improve the API there.
- Nesting within another Object3D and internally scale sounds good.
 Nice! Two things:

-Components can declare dependencies. We use the mechanism on the cursor component:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/blob/master/src/components/cursor.js#L11

-I think we should open a new repo `aframe-components` with a curated list of cool components that people can contribute to. The BMFont component could be a good first candidate
 We have an API to register custom materials and shaders now!
  thanks!
  the rest looks great. let me know. thanks!
 many thanks!
  Sorry, was out for the holidays. This looks good, thanks!
  :+1: Yes, we need to allow customisable keyboard mappings.

Specifically, https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/blob/1d07db6/src/components/wasd-controls.js#L83-L89 and https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/blob/a3855a3/src/core/a-scene.js#L539-L551 need to be developer-overridable (and possibly user-overridable, though that could be left as an exercise for the developer to do with JS; we'll have to make a call there).

We handled keyboard bindings with [simple language in Horizon](https://gist.github.com/cvan/a1e1a2ea9fb341dd6ad3). A popular library folks use is [Mousetrap.js](https://craig.is/killing/mice). I wrote a ["polyfill" for `KeyboardEvent.prototype.key`](https://github.com/cvan/keyboardevent-key-polyfill) (which lets you listen for `e.key == 'ArrowRight` instead of `e.keyCode === 39`). Open to alternatives.
 Not sure about the DSL at the component property level. Those things get out of control pretty quickly and are very difficult to debug.

A more centralized way for components to listen to input events that adds some sugar (listening for a key name instead of using codes) could be cool. I thinks something at the `a-scene` level might work.  A keyboard-input module that the scene uses to broadcast keyboard events. 
 Don's new keyboard controls will help in the short-term, but I recommend against using FPS keyboard controls for VR. 
 I'm going to close this in favor of https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1490 to map the controls to the arrows so we don't have to consider every single keyboard layout
  @staus: Unfortunately, we changed the cylinder geometry to no longer accept `radiusTop` and `radiusBottom` - so you need to use `geometry: cone` instead of `geometry: cylinder` if you want a cone shape.

https://aframe.io/docs/components/geometry.html#Cone

> <a-entity geometry="primitive: cone; radiusBottom: 1; radiusTop: 0.1"></a-entity>

if you do that, it works fine (also [confirmed](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/332#issuecomment-166773700) by @fernandojsg):

We need to make a `<a-cone>` primitive, and that work will be done soon in aframevr/aframe#330 (also see https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/issues/741#issuecomment-166498744).

That should clear up things. But let us know if you have any other problems. Thanks!
 Cone template was added in PR #337 - :smile: thanks @cemkod!
  You can do el.addEventListener('componentchanged') and check the event is on wasd-controls.

 Is there a still an issue here?
 okay, I signed in through FB and checked this out. pretty neat grid!

all the images initially appear at `1.5` scale.
when I hover over an image, it appears at `2` scale.
when I stop hovering that image, it appears at `1` scale. _(shouldn't this be `1.5`?)_

also, I see `target="#shadow"`, but I don't see a `#shadow` element anywhere. _is this dead code?_
  You can use https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-text-component for now.

Download the `dist` files in the repository. Include it after `aframe` JS file. Then:

``` html
<a-entity text="text: HELLO"></a-entity>
```

We'll have official support for this soon. Thanks!
  first off, woo thanks!

we haven't mentioned it in the Contributing doc yet (#241), but no need to run `dist` when pushing changes. also, see #320 that uses the `build/` when serving the local server (instead of `dist/`).

also, looks like `a-ring.html` is missing in this branch
 > So is doing npm start after changing the files enough to test the changes I made?

until #320 lands, the best way to test is to
1. run `npm start`
2. change `../../dist/aframe.js` to `../../build/aframe.js` in `examples/template-ring/index.html`
3. make changes, load the page, etc.

it'd probably be easier to do a new branch to remove the `dist/` changes. also, something we (I) haven't done a good job of communicating yet (again: apologies, will address in #241) is that PRs should be made against `dev` (unstable, under "development") instead of `master` (stable).

so you'll likely want to close this PR, commit only `examples/` and `elements/` files, and open a new one PR against `dev` instead of `master`.

thanks for your understanding - and thanks for contributing!
  seems to work well - thanks for cleaning things up :+1: 
 let me know about the above harcoded `watch` above and we can merge (we can do address that as an issue against `budo` later as well)

heh, that was quick. amazing. :tada: 

> The only file that isn't triggering a live-reload now is `VRLoader.js`, but I can't find any require references to it.

yeah, we aren't using it anymore. will be revisiting the loader likely with aframevr/aframe-core#16.
 can you pull `dev` and rebase when you get a chance?
 thanks, this works great.

p.s. I like keeping everything in this script, but it's interesting to me that now actually most of the stuff we're doing in this budo script can be done via the budo CLI except the middleware. :+1: 
 > The env vars are a bit clunky. Maybe just enable live reload by default and move the live/open flags to a new PR. I think `--` is a cleaner approach and also easier to type.

:+1: let's do that. thanks.
 :shipit: awesome, everything looks + works well
 thanks, @mattdesl!
  ah, I added the `npm` and `node` versions required in `aframe-core`'s [`package.json`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/blob/master/package.json#L80-L83), but I forgot to do it here for `aframe` proper's. will do. thanks, @mattdesl, @cemkod!
  You can pass a selector as `src` parameter of the material. Example:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/blob/dev/examples/video/index.html#L19
 Yes. I think it should just work.
  Custom shaders are coming soon. Top in the features list.
 We have work tracking at https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/861 and we will iterate on it over time. We are using shadertoy as inspiration.

For applying a shader to the entire scene, maybe try making a component that hooks into the renderer?
  Thanks for filing. I think this was reported on the Slack but not filed here. Playing videos on mobile requires a user-initiated event (e.g., click). It's on the "roadmap" (TBD in #299) to design and expose video controls for videos.
 @gtk2k made a workaround using a component: https://gtk2k.github.io/aframe_videosphere/ (source: https://github.com/gtk2k/gtk2k.github.io/tree/master/aframe_videosphere)

I'll likely be implementing something similar in the interim.
 Investigate http://krpano.com/plugins/videoplayer/#iphonepanovideo
 For iOS, need to set `webkit-playsinline` or else the video will open in a separate window.

For `webkit-playsinline` to work, need to pin the website to the homescreen.
 If a VR page is pinned and launched from the homescreen (i.e., `navigator.standalone`), we can play inline videos.

To encourage users to do that, I want to show instructions in a modal/toaster similar to http://forecast.io/'s:

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/203725/13092874/20247910-d4b7-11e5-9e81-3bafe5c500ea.png" width="50%">

 @mattdesl brings us https://github.com/jam3/ios-video-test!
 @mobiwu Have any more details than that? That might be a result of trying to do cross-origin videos on Safari, which I haven't found a way to support.
 Summary from the docs:

```
iOS has a lot of restrictions on playing videos in the browser. To play an inline video texture, we must:

- Set the `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"` metatag.
- Set the `webkit-playsinline` attribute to the video element.
- Pin the webpage to the iOS homescreen.
```
 Android needs user action to trigger video. We have work-in-progress to improve the UX for this.
 More info https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/6606
 We're spread thin. If people can figure out reliable patches, let us know :+1: 
 > From further testing I have discovered that video textures work as expected on Android using the latest Firefox mobile browser (45.0.1) in non-VR mode but when you switch to VR it crashes the browser after 1 second. Nexus 5 (Android 6.0.1). Video textures in Chrome still show black screens for me.

Which version of Chrome are you running? And can you provide the video source?
 >  Do you know when Chrome will get fixed for this?

I would track https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=178297 - no time soon it seems
 @SonarSystems if you can connect your device using USB to use remote debugging in Firefox or Chrome for Android, you get the console logs/warnings. if you have those, paste them here and those will be super helpful.
 @SonarSystems whoa, very odd. I'm not sure. @caseyyee, do you know? I know you're good with mobile debugging.
 @Chocap Safari for iOS provides an option to pin a web page to the iOS homescreen; [see this comment above for an image showing it](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/316#issuecomment-184896858)

There's actually a whole open-source library that adds a modal that makes it more obvious:

http://cubiq.org/add-to-home-screen
https://github.com/cubiq/add-to-homescreen

I considered it, but I'm thinking it'd be overkill to add to A-Frame. Someone could create a third-party A-[Frame component](https://aframe.io/docs/core/component.html) ([see this curated list of community components](https://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe#components)).
 > Does somebody know the code to implement the webkit-playsinline?

Since #1179, with the latest version of A-Frame (`0.2.0` or `master`), we automatically add this to all videos.

(I've filed #1373 to clarify the docs.)

you have to pass the video element or a canvas texture to WebGL. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Animating_textures_in_WebGL so that means this iOS trick, which actually just `seek`s the `currentTime`, doesn't do anything.

https://github.com/bfred-it/iphone-inline-video ([demo](http://bfred-it.github.io/iphone-inline-video/demo/)) works for only 2D/3D CSS stuff, not WebGL stuff. it's a sweet trick nonetheless.

 @ngokevin this is awesome. great work, @mayognaise - thanks!

I'm glad we now have a (third-party) component for iOS video now. now, we just need a component to enable video `autoplay` playback (via a user gesture such as a `click`) for Chrome for Android. since I added support for `webkit-playsinline` in c6aad59, and we've filed #1008 for adding a help message for "Add to Homescreen" for iOS, IMO we ought to now close this issue.

I could be convinced to add to A-Frame support for `autoplay` playback for Chrome for Android via some "Play" button if we detect any videos in the scenes on the page. But, iOS inline playback? The hacks (such as [this one](https://github.com/mayognaise/aframe-video-shader)) work, but the performance leaves a lot to be desired. And I would not want to ship A-Frame with suboptimal workarounds that degrade video performance.

I am almost done with [a PR](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ios/pull/1651) for [Firefox for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ios) that will enable inline video playback: https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ios/pull/1651

When it merges and is shipped in the release version of the browser, I'll be so happy :smile:! And we can talk to Apple and Google to try to get them to do the same with their Safari and Chrome browsers for iOS. But, that's the best we can do.

**This is not an A-Frame problem. It's a restriction with Safari/Chrome for iOS.** (And, although it's less than ideal, having users pin a site/webapp to the homescreen is not the end of the world.)

I understand the desire for out-of-the-box inline video playback for iOS, but A-Frame should not bend over backwards for this.
 http://bfred-it.github.io/iphone-inline-video/demo/
This is nice! I'll look into it so that it will solve any issue with the current `video-shader`.
right now it won't show if the video is big or something.
Also hope FF will be the best browser for iOS 👯

  The screen is black, although the googles icon shows up. I built a scene with a sky myself, same result, black screen. Other examples work, eg. Anime etc.
 Hey thanks for reporting, we're currently resolving issues with some Android devices by bumping to a later version of three.js, look for it soon.
 Ok!
 I believe we have it fixed on our `dev` branches where we upgraded three.js to a more recent commit. We'll have to wait until we release the next version of A-Frame where we'll be shipping a lot of changes.
 We haven't run a dist on the dev branch yet. Did you build aframe-core?
 Glad to know :)
 That's great!
  @Dogfalo thanks for filing. I think this behaviour is similar to the behaviour described in #293 - can you confirm if that's the same issue you're seeing?
  awesome, thanks! will take a look in a bit
 everything looks great except for the MozVR text. In the shopping example, it looks a bit low-res. Can we upscale rather than downscale that one?
 first off, many thanks or taking this on! much appreciated :+1:

could you change your commit message from `Make textures POT (Issue: #300)` to `Make textures POT (fixes issue #300)` - so that issue #300 gets automatically closed when this PR gets closed?

also per @ngokevin, these in particular I noticed the images are upscaled (with degradation) and there is padding around the increased images:
- [`examples/_images/mozvr.png`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/312/files#diff-02a70a894c5875f35c6a967f36a64524)

most of the rest of them (e.g., [`examples/showcase-anime-UI/images/glow1.png`](https://github.com/cemkod/aframe/blob/make-textures-pot/examples/showcase-anime-UI/images/glow1.png)) look downscaled okay without excess padding created.
 fwiw the increased padding seems accounted for by changing positions.
 thanks!
  Nah, it's something we should have. I'm working on an example text component implementation using TextGeometry at https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-text-component

  Yep, we need to fix this limitation. It may happen with an updated primitives implementation that we are currently exploring. @cvan 
 For people running into this issue, for now I recommend falling back to using raw entities and components. This is a bug on an abstraction layer.

  @caseyyee have you encountered this one?
 All Android phones have back buttons.  In some cases, you may have to swipe up from the bottom to expose the soft-keys.    This could be the case with the MotoX?

We could put a Exit VR button as we have with IOS for, though I figure this would be a common UX for similar apps (ie: Gallery).
 Yeah OK, I agree, adding a back button will help for this.
 After more than 8 months I haven't heard many complains about this being an issue? Do you this this is something we should tackle? @ngokevin 
 Rotating to portrait and pressing the X works for now. That would satisfy case on both fullscreen scenes (where you could also just navigate away), and embedded.
  Yep, check out the model component: https://aframe.io/docs/primitives/a-model.html

It supports OBJ and Collada (DAE) files. With intent to add support for GLTF as soon as the Three.js importer and workflows are a bit more robust.
 We try to use GitHub for bug reports, feature requests, etc. In the future the best way to ping the team with questions is [@aframevr](http://twitter.com/aframevr) on Twitter, or via the A-Frame [Slack channel](https://aframevr-slack.herokuapp.com/)
  @thelucre do you have an example scene/site somewhere we can take a look at?
 @ngokevin @dmarcos is this possible now in `dev`?
 For now as a workaround, you can add `<a-node>` to your scene, and then when you are ready, call `document.querySelector('a-node').load()`. This should work because the scene blocks on all nodes loading before rendering.
 heh, that's a beautiful hack. we ought to properly support this, but I like that.
 It's fine enough, or inject the A-Frame scene into your app when you're ready. I know there are several projects using Vue.js without much issue.  All images we use in the examples should be of power of two (for pef reasons):

> - `browserify-css` should now emit file events (https://github.com/cheton/browserify-css/issues/20), so it should be picked up by watchify and trigger a hard live-reload. However it seems like all the browserify-css stuff is legacy, I am not seeing much CSS in this repo.

the CSS has since been moved to [`aframe-core`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/blob/master/style/aframe-core.css), so, yeah, can remove.

> - The HTML inside `examples/` are not live-reloading

this seemed to work with [my original patch](https://github.com/cvan/budo/commit/81c9e336). I gave up on using my fork because while I could get one example to work, loading multiple documents proved problematic (which I filed as mattdesl/budo#79). also, we used to use HTML imports in all the examples, which we removed but it's still a supported use case for folks who want to define templates in external HTML imports (I filed an issue against budo to address/discuss: mattdesl/budo#119).

now if I point to the latest budo, and enable the `.live()` line in `scripts/budo.js` (or using your branch here, with the `host` changes too), I no longer can get the examples to live reload.

Useful for when you want to `<iframe>` an A-Frame scene and perhaps want to enable some other method of entering VR - or you may not not even want the user to view the scene in VR.
 I have pending work to move VR Mode UI to `vr-mode-ui` component where they can do

`<a-scene vr-mode-ui="enabled: false">`

But I can make it check querystring too.

 We now hide the ui via the component configuration. Is this still an issue?
 Depends on the iframe use case if it's possible to have the button within the iframe be able to trigger VR, or whether we would need an outside button postmessage into the iframe. I don't know much about the constraints of iframe + entering VR to say for sure

  This is not meant to be merged. It's just me trying to get rid of the root node. @cvan Do you think we really need it? Is there a way we can get rid of it? This PR seems to work but probably my approach is simplistic
 the original source is

``` html
<a-cube color="blue">
  <a-plane color="green">
    <a-entity primitive="type: plane" material="color: purple"></a-entity>
  </a-plane>

  <a-cylinder color="red">
  </a-cylinder>
</a-cube>
```

becomes

``` html
<a-cube color="blue">
  <a-root>
    <a-entity primitive="type: plane" material="color: blue"></a-entity>
  </a-root>

  <a-plane color="green">
    <a-root>
      <a-entity primitive="type: plane" material="color: green"></a-entity>
    </a-root>

    <a-entity primitive="type: plane" material="color: purple"></a-entity>
  </a-plane>

  <a-cylinder color="red">
    <a-root>
      <a-entity primitive="type: cylinder" material="color: red"></a-entity>
    </a-root>
  </a-cylinder>
</a-cube>
```

now say if we got rid of the `<a-root>` elements:

``` html
<a-cube color="blue">
  <a-entity primitive="type: plane" material="color: blue"></a-entity>

  <a-plane color="green">
    <a-entity primitive="type: plane" material="color: green"></a-entity>

    <a-entity primitive="type: plane" material="color: purple"></a-entity>
  </a-plane>

  <a-cylinder color="red">
    <a-entity primitive="type: cylinder" material="color: red"></a-entity>
  </a-cylinder>
</a-cube>
```

it now becomes unclear which elements (`<a-entity>`s) correspond to the actual template instance. so if we want to change an element, such as `$('a-plane[color=green]').setAttribute('color', 'blue')`, then we need to know which of the potentially several child `<a-entity>` elements to update. that's why `<a-root>` exists.
 Can you store the elements somewhere before applying the template? In my PR I have two variables lightHTML and shadowHTML. You have shadowEls and lightEls to know what elements to update
 > Can you store the elements somewhere before applying the template? In my PR I have two variables lightHTML and shadowHTML. You have shadowEls and lightEls to know what elements to update

yes, but what if the attrs change?
 As I understand the reason for having `a-root` is to have all the template content within a single node so it can be easily replaced if one of the attributes of the template changes. We can can get rid of the `a-root` if we implement a binding between the attributes of the template and it's content elements. We need to do it also for performance reasons. Currently, for each template attribute change template we destroy all entities and recreate the whole sub tree. 

By **binding** templates and entities I mean a list that associates each template attribute to the entities and component attributes affected by them. This way you just update the relevant entities on `attributeChangedCallback` instead of recreating the whole tree.
 :+1: to what you've said, @dmarcos. we need to do it regardless. I was investigating using [Virtual DOM](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) for this, but it's not necessary at themoment.

> We can can get rid of the `a-root` if we implement a binding between the attributes of the template and it's content elements. We need to do it also for performance reasons.

How would you imagine we could implement this? Shadow DOM kind of solves this, but using the [polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/tree/master/src/ShadowDOM) is out of the question (it's incredibly slow and not spec-compliant).
 I have an idea but it might be silly. It involves making your [template formatter](https://github.com/MozVR/aframe/blob/master/elements/lib/utils.js#L104) a bit smarter. It would not only replace `$XXX` with the template values but also annotate the entities with special attributes that you will use later to create the bindings. We have the following template:

``` html
<template is="a-template"
          element="a-cube"
          color="gray">
  <a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 5; height: 5; depth: 5"
                 material="color: ${color};"></a-entity>
</template>
```

It would generate this markup:

``` html
<vr-cube color="gray">
  <a-entity material="color: gray;" data-bind-color="material.color" geometry="primitive: box; width: 5; height: 5; depth: 5" ></a-entity>
</vr-cube>
```

Note the attribute **data-bind-color="material.color"**.  It means that the `color` attribute of the template is bound to the `material.color` attribute of the entity.

Once the `shadow` entities are initialized your template code will do a second pass of processing. It will take all the entities with data-bind-XXX attributes and create bindings for them. I would keep a list `this.bindings[attrName] = [bindings to specific entities]` that you will traverse in the `attributeChangedCallback` of the template node to update the `shadow` entities. Once you create those bindings you can remove the `data-bind-XXX` attributes from the entity elements. 

This will give us what we want. Granular update of entities each time the template attributes change and we can also get rid of the `a-root` node. Additionally we can mark all the `shadow` entities with the `shadow` attribute if we want to make a clear distinction from the `light` ones. This could be used for instance by the editor to hide the `shadow` DOM. And as a stretch we could think about wrapping `querySelector` native method to filter out the `shadow` nodes.

@cvan What do you think?
 I think we can close this PR. We plan on moving to use primitives, which extend entities rather than template entities.
 There are some good points raised in here. Primitives are for wrapping and extending single entities. Templates serve a different use case: grouping multiple elements (and potentially some more advanced templating logic beyond the current variable string interpolation). Templates ought to continue to exist, but perf-wise there are some good ideas @dmarcos had that we ought to implement. In due time, yeah. I think they'll need to happen outside of this PR though.

 @gasolin thanks - updated the links in the first comment
 also filed #1420 for other images that could use some compression. (many others have already been crushed/compressed.)
  it's working in https://mozvr.github.io/aframe/kit/docs/

Looks to be an issue only with template objects (eg. vr-cube)

Works fine on standard vr-object entities.
 oops, yeah. for now just do `setAttribute('position', '0 0 5')`
 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/883
  https://github.com/MozVR/aframe-core/blob/93f1bdc/src/components/geometry.js#L88-L92
 Yep. We already have a torus
 Reopening. We do have a torus primitive geometry but this issue refers to a primitive `<`a-torus></a-torus>``
  Users should not have to manually specify the file format of a model (eg obj, collada, etc). 

In the current model template we provide a format attribute, defaulted to `format="collada"`. That's good enough for View Source, where we'll only be using Collada files, but we can't make that assumption for release. Novice users may very well try to drop obj files into their scenes, and shouldn't have to know about format="obj" for them to work.

A potential implementation:
- Maintain a format attribute
- If no format is specified, automatically apply the correct format based on src file extension
- If format is defined use that instead.
 We have separate components for `obj-model` and `collada-model`. Will have separate primitives as well `a-obj-model` and `a-collada-model`
  We like the simplicity of a `<a-sky>` template over separate (and more abstract) `<a-skysphere>` and `<a-skycube>` templates. However a combined approach will necessitate a way for devs to specify which type they want to use.

We envision something like the following:
- `type=""` Options are `sphere` or `cube`. Default is `sphere`.
- Other attributes then depend on the type.
- If sphere, user can specify `segments-width`, `segments-height`, `radius`, etc.
- If cube, user can specify `size`
- In both cases, user can specify `src`. 
  - For `sphere`, it must be the path to an image asset. 
  - For `cube`, it must be the path to a directory containing top, bottom, left, right, front, back images.
    - Note: this is subject to change, depending on what we do in core for cube map handling.

JS inside the template then handles the switching between types. 
 Will stick to https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/45  change these too:

  Enables the dev to add a grid to their scenes.

Dev can specify:
- Color (default is gray)
- Size (width and height of grid in meters. Default is 10)
- Density (number of horizontal and vertical segments in the grid. Default is 10).
 Removing blocker label for launch
 You could also write a fragment shader for the grid: https://aframe.io/docs/core/shaders.html#Creating-a-Custom-Shader
 What is the state of that issue?
 Not sure if we need to add to core, but can point to Don's which is on the Registry:

  Enables devs to create 360° video players.

Features should be in line with what we had in pre-refactor `<vr-video>` and `<vr-video360>` components, and with the HTML5 `<video>` [spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).  

Dev can specify:
- Video source
- Autoplay boolean
- Looping boolean
- Height
- Width
- Muted boolean
- Controls boolean (shows or hides controls for playback)

Please add anything missing from the above. Looking at the `<video>` element spec, I'm not sure how important `autobuffer`, `crossorigin`, and `poster` are, for example.

While the image is loading, nothing is visible. Should look at adding preloaders and/or placeholders in the future.
 Controls can be limited to a play/pause toggle initially. Longer term we can imagine adding:
- Time indicator
- Volume control
 Dependent on https://github.com/MozVR/vr-markup/issues/249
 This is done.
  In the [`vr-hemispherelight` component](https://github.com/MozVR/vr-components/blob/master/core/vr-hemispherelight.js), there's only a `createdCallback`, not a `attributeChangedCallback`.
 nice!
 it's gone
   is this clear to folks?
 and perhaps I should add a comment about `npm unlink`
 > Besides that, I would also document that the user should run both dev servers for `vr-components` and `vr-markup`, and they should use the bundle served in memory at `http://localhost:9001/build/vr-components.js` rather than the one on the filesystem so they don't have to re-run build all the time.

Even if just `vr-components`'s dev server is running, the bundle gets recompiled automatically actually when the files change. Does that not happen for you?
 @ngokevin: thanks for the good feedback. I've addressed everything except the most recent comment, which I just responded to.

let me know what you think.

- A-Frame Version 0-8-0: example showcase helloworld screenshot https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/introduction/html-and-primitives.html
I've updated the JPG to PNG as JPEG has lower quality by larger file size.:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/A-Frame_Hello_World_example.png
So it would be good if it could updated.
I could handle any small improvement suggestion, as I have the graphic with text-layers.
 Oh* ok, done, but it doesn't include a Github link, instead a Wikimedia link!?  Hello,

I'm using A-Frame 0.8.2 with Vue.js 2.5.13 on Chrome 69.

In my scene, I have entities using gltf-model component, and an a-sky to have a 360 image as a background. In various cases (like having 10 entities at the same time, destroying/creating entities with v-for, destroying/creating the scene with v-if ), I get this error : 
 `THREE.WebGLRenderer: Context Lost`

The scene is broken, even reloading the tab doesn't help. Only opening a new tab allows recovering.

I had a look at https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/11435 and tried to apply this to my case, with no success : 

- listening to the `webglcontextlost` event on the `canvas` property of A-Frame scene object : it is fired properly.
- calling `forceContextRestore` on the `renderer` property of A-Frame scene object. Sometimes the scene object is `undefined`.
- listening to the `webglcontextrestored` event on the `canvas` property of A-Frame scene object : it is never fired.
- calling `reload` on the  A-Frame scene object : I get the `not a function` error.


Do you plan to manage this error at A-Frame level ? 
Anyway, how can I handle this problem which makes the experience very unstable ? 
Thanks in advance :)

- A-Frame Version: 0.8.2
- Platform / Device: Windows 10 on a laptop with a second display (which may trigger the error, as stated in the three.js issue mentionned above)
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:

 I actually see two problems : 
- there is an "amount" of entities which triggers the error;
- destroying entities with vue.js reactive features (v-if, v-for) doesn't free the entities from the total amount : when new ones are created, the error is triggered. The problematic number of entities is actually around 30, 20 MB each. The error occurs when the RAM gets around 90% (my laptop GUI uses shared memory). 

I changed the code so that entities aren't destroyed/created, I rather have all the entities loaded at once, and I make each visible or not during the experience. This way, the RAM is constant. Another workaround is necessary :  after the experience is finished, I reload the page to free the RAM for the next experience.

Previously, I tried to set/remove `gltf-model` attribute on the pool of entities, but the problem still occured. I looked at `gltf-model` code : on `remove`, it performs `removeObject3D('mesh')`, which doesn't cause the RAM to be freed. The loader works like a charm, but we're missing an unloader, I guess :) This is a problem, because in a database-oriented SPA, you want to be able to dynamically load entities without getting closer and closer to a crash :) 

To sum-up, I see the following issues : 
- the gltf loader doesn't free the RAM at remove
- the _context lost error_ isn't managed

All that being said, thank you very much for this excellent piece of technology, which makes VR so accessible :) 




  Hello all, when I go to the A-Frame site or any glitch project, if I try dragging my mouse on the scene to look around the camera starts spinning and points downwards. If I stop dragging the mouse it stays pointed down. If I try to readjust the camera view it starts spinning again.

I have tried disabling Tracking Protection, Privacy Badger, and HTTPS Everywhere, as those sometimes give me issues on other sites, but it doesn't seem to change anything here. 

It doesn't seem to happen on other WebVR things (such as [React's 360 here](https://github.com/facebook/react-360)). It also seems fine on Edge.

Let me know if there is anything else I can provide to help.

- A-Frame Version: Looking at the source for some of the A-Frame examples: 0.5.0, 0.7.1, and 0.8.2
- Platform / Device: Kubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10 on Firefox 62.0.2

 I think I found the cause. It was happening on other computer's if I had signed into Firefox. So I looked through my `about:config` settings to see if anything I had set might be causing it. Turns out the `privacy.resistFingerprinting` was set to true. Once I set it to false (which is default) it stopped behaving that way. 

Not sure exactly what part of `privacy.resistFingerprinting` was affecting it, but here is the [list of things it does](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Fingerprinting). Ideally both would work (considering other WebVR things seemed fine), but at least there is a workaround for now.  Unless my understanding of basic geometry is incorrect (I always reserve the right to be incorrect), a hexagon has ~7~  **6** segments.

  **Camera component componentchanged no longer fire**

- A-Frame Version: 0.8.2
- Platform / Device: macOS all browsers
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: https://codepen.io/squaretone/full/WgqaqQ

This worked in versions prior to 0.8.2. In the above pen, we subscribe to the `componentchanged` event of the camera and write the rotation output to the a-text when the event fires.  The `componentchanged` event is never emitted. If you change the referenced version of A-Frame back to 0.8.0 the example works.

Are event listeners no longer supported on the camera or is there a possible bug?

Thanks.
  @ngokevin i would like test this change, how do you generate the memory statistics?
  Hello! 
Can I use fisheye projection with A-frame instead of equirectangular? If you use UV maps laid out according to the fisheye projection it should work.  But that would involve creating your own UV map in a 3d program.  It would not work on a default primitive sphere in aframe.

These geometries may be of use to you.

this mesh is laid out for thetaS  as an example.  https://github.com/AndrewHazelden/Panoramic_Geometry_Collection/blob/master/meshes/ricoh_theta_s_mesh.obj  I use state event bubbling quite a lot for advanced interactions using super hands. For example, a selectable component which listens for state end events coming from the grabbed or clicked states of any if its children to keep track of the last selected child. I assume it is performance, but if we're not going to bubble them (which is kinda the point of using events for that IMO), then maybe you want to consider removing and reimplementing...  **Description:**
In the console, I get this:
```
core:schema:warn 
Unknown property `color` for component/system `material`.

I have a couple times that I mention color in material, but I don't know which one. About what?  Hmm. Appears to be working for me in `0.8.2`.

I forked the boilerplate, added a click listener, and disabled movement and look controls and it is logging every click.

The sphere is the clickable entity, not that you'll have much choice in the matter. :D

  I think the original experiments with simpler shader had other artifacts that were font specific.
If those are gone now (either no one uses the broken fonts anymore, or something else fixed it) then I am all for simplifying, +1 from me  Equivalent to reverseMouseDrag for mobile and tablet.

**Description:** added a reverseTouchDrag parameter

**Changes proposed:**
- using direction as it was used for reverseMouseDrag  Probably better especially since I can't imagine situations where one would want to have the opposite behavior on mouse vs touch. Still being curious about "creative" or artistic usages and wanted to preserve compatibility I didn't want to "take the risk". Up to you.   Im trying to make an gltf object,

 Hello it's about the component from https://github.com/mayognaise/aframe-mouse-cursor-component.

Here is the example. https://glitch.com/edit/#!/lapis-girdle?path=index.html:27:7

Click the cube using the mouse and it will turn to blue then click it again to turn it back to pink that was what I expecting but when I changed the version of  Aframe to 0.8.2 it will not work anymore. Thanks The `aframe-mouse-cursor-component` is outdated and no longer necessary. Use the `cursor` component setting the `rayOrigin` to `mouse`:

```
<a-entity cursor="rayOrigin: mouse;" raycaster="objects: .clickable;">
  <!-- Add any cursor geometry here -->

 Hi @dsinni I have tried the demo in android Chrome  version 68.0.3440.91 in Huawei GR3 2017 Android version 7 and I can't change the color of the cube by touching or tapping it. I also inspect the Demo in Chrome Version 68.0.3440.106 in my laptop and I saw some warnings and errors. 
![touchissue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22828729/44942564-03f15b80-ade7-11e8-94b7-b88646714641.png)
 @jayson04  I can confirm that I'm experiencing an extreme lag (it does sometimes change) when clicking on Android in that demo, but I only forked your code and updated the cursor entity as an example of how to use `rayOrigin`.

I suspect the issue lies within some of the surrounding code, e.g., code not being properly encapsulated within components or systems, or placed in the wrong part of the document, etc.

I recommend wrapping your code in a component to see if you have better results.  

There's also a strange button script at the bottom of the body, which I'm not sure of its purpose. 

If I have time, I'll make another demo from scratch to see if I can reproduce the issue.  @dmarcos: I can confirm that this is currently an issue in every Android browser that I've tested using both A-Frame `0.8.2` and the current `master` branch `d611e70`.

I created a simplified demo and tested in the current versions of Samsung Internet, Chrome, Chrome Dev, Canary, Firefox, Edge all with the same results. Touching only works sporadically and is either non-responsive or extremely laggy.

It works perfectly on PC, even on my touch screen, but no good on Android. I just tested with Safari on iOS as well with the same results as Android.

 Thanks, @ngokevin. I removed the cursor from camera and fixed the typo, and the issue persists. I'll open a new issue with a more accurate title. @ngokevin @dmarcos Scratch that. It appears the cursor needs to be at the bottom of the scene. Simply removing it from the camera wasn't enough. I'm not sure if that's something that needs to be either addressed or documented.

After moving it to the bottom of the scene, it functions as expected: https://abrupt-donkey.glitch.me/
  **Description:**
This fixes controllers not being able to reconnect on Oculus Go and GearVR. The bug seems to just be due to a copy/paste error. This brings these 2 in line with the otehr controller components, keeping the `controllersupdated` event bound solong as the entity is playing. This is particularly important on Oculus Go as exiting VR causes the controller to disconnect (as far as the gamepad API is concenred) and the controller will reconnect when entering VR.

**Changes proposed:**
- Support disconnecting and reconnecting Oculus Go and GearVR controllers
  Currently the default to `preserveDrawingBuffer` is `false` when setting up `THREE.WebGLRenderer`. Can we provide users with an option to set this to `true` to allow them to mirror their scene on the desktop after entering VR?

A similar issue was discussed in [issue 926](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/926). According to this thread however, re-initializing the renderer did not succeed for the user unless they modified this parameter directly in aframe.js.

This issue was prompted by the following [tweet](https://twitter.com/thomasbalou/status/1030719598407110656).
  **Description:**

Expanding the commit-ish to the full hash doesn't harm us (and is good practice anyway,) and by doing so it lets us far more easily resolve the dependency and actually be able to install the package under, for example, PNPM. 

See pnpm/pnpm#1127

**Changes proposed:**
- Expand the commit-ish for document-register-element to the full hash
 Thank you!  This appears to be completely breaking the experience on Oculus Go, the camera appears significantly higher up than expected, and the arm model seems to no longer line up.

Also narrowed down another issue I was seeing in `aframe-physics-extras` to this commit. Not 100% sure what the cause was but it seems something about initialization order has changed. The issue was a race condition in `aframe-physics-extras` and not actually an aframe bug, but interesting to note that this triggered the issue, as it might also cause similar issues elsewhere. i have still some problems after the  d404990  

reverting e0c8ff7 solve my problem with my avatar loading and physics 

what exactly should e0c8ff7 solve? @ngokevin  plz reopen the bug (i will try to make a simple sample showing the problem)  **How to perform an event in JS when a Videosphere reaches a particular instant in its time duration**

e.g. 
I want an alert when 360 video is at 8th second. Now this is significantly different than this :
```
AFRAME.registerComponent('foo',{
    init:function(){
    setTimeout(function(){
    alert("8 seconds reached");
    },8000);
```
Because I believe that in this case the time for downloading the ASSET(**video**) is not counted.
It will **just get executed in 8 seconds** whether or not video has loaded to play.
**Am I thinking correct** ?

Adding in utils.bindEvent like you suggested. I had to make a small change to component.js to execute each decorator when a new component is instantiated.. In my own version I was just monkey patching this in by wrapping some core A-frame functions.

Should this also go in the A-frame documentation? I'm happy to add it in just let me know where you think it should go.

 hmm I'm not sure that failure is related to the event decorators. Looks like its one of the a-animation tests. Understood, it is quite a high level abstraction. Now that I know that this complexity is definitely not what you want I can simplify the code a great deal if that can change your mind? Atm its written a lot more generally then is needed to handle the specific case of binding event listeners in init/remove and defaulting to the property name. Unfortunately it would still need that call to executeDecorators (or something thereto) in component.js.

I came up with this because I wanted event handling in A-Frame to look and feel more like in Unity 3D. In Unity common GameObject events like 'OnCollisionEnter', 'OnEnable' etc are mapped functions on components with the same name. Compared to addEventListener/removeEventListener/function.bind() I think its a more declarative, easier on the eyes way of managing events. Although there needs to be a bit of magic in the background to make it work. I'm rewriting it now, it can be way waaayy more simple. With all jargon fluff removed.
 New version is much simpler. No more jargon fluff about decorator functors. It should be more clear how it actually works now. I'm still not sure how to avoid that change in component.js, any suggestions for what you had in mind?  **Description:**
Minor grammar edits to docs page.
**Changes proposed:**
- changed "that with" to "that have" on line 30
- fixed blocky sentences on line 44  I could see this happening as a result of mixing different community components add a console warning on setAttribute for position, rotation, scale (depreciation) ?   **Description:**

I'm thinking of using Motion JPEG stream served via http as a source of 360 deg images, for example [mjpeg-streamer](https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer) which can capture JPEG frames from a web cam and streams via HTTP. However, currently `<a-sky src=...>` shows only the first frame of streaming. Is it possible to show Motion JPEG streams using aframe?

### Example
Tried streaming JPEG frames using mjpeg-streamer as described [here](https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer/blob/master/mjpg-streamer-experimental/plugins/output_http/README.md).

This html shows only the first frame of JPEG streams while `<img src="/?action=stream">` works fine.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.8.2/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
        <a-sky src="/?action=stream"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```
 Thank you for your comment. I created a component like this and it worked. (this is the first time for me to use both aframe and three.js so it may not be an ideal code though).

```javascript
AFRAME.registerComponent('box', {
    schema: {
        width: { type: 'number', default: 1 },
        height: { type: 'number', default: 1 },
        depth: { type: 'number', default: 1 },
        color: { type: 'color', default: '#AAA' }
    },

    init: function () {
        var data = this.data;
        var el = this.el;

        this.loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

        this.geometry = new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry(data.width, data.height, data.depth);
        this.material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({
            map: this.getImage()
        });
        this.material.needsUpdate = true;
        this.mesh = new THREE.Mesh(this.geometry, this.material);
        el.setObject3D('mesh', this.mesh);
    },

    tick: function (time, timeDelta) {
        this.mesh.material.map.img = this.getImage();
        this.mesh.material.map.needsUpdate = true;
    },

    getImage: function() {
        return this.loader.load("/?action=stream");
    }
});
```  Include source files in the installed A-Frame package to allow developers to reference individual files and debug easier.

See discussion on https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3712 Of course do whatever you want but just be aware using `src` directly from npm is an anti-pattern.

the package.json file lists the entry point into the library. Other than that nothing about any npm package is required to stay the same. Every version could rename or move every single file. If you're linking directly to src then you're basically making a very brittle build for yourself and/or binding the developers hands as it means they aren't free to refactor as they see fit if they don't want to break your project. Not that I expect them to rename or move files but projects do do that from time to time and if you use npm as it's meant to be used going through the package.json's entry point then nothing should break.  **Description:**

Most modern browsers now support [EcmaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#Browser_compatibility) with `import` / `export` syntax.

This means that people could start importing and using modules on the web without having to use something like Webpack or Browserify to make bundles which IMO makes it a lot easier to experiment with these things.

ESM also gives us an obvious way to import and publish complicated dependencies. If somebody has a cool a-frame plugin that they built, users can make use of it by simply `import`ing it from the URL it's published at without doing the CommonJS compiling dance or requiring authors to pre-compile their plugins.

Ultimately, I think this will make it easier for people to create small bits of reusable aframe code and reduce the barrier to entry for new users and help grow the ecosystem while promoting modern JavaScript practices.

 Saw the same problem. Sometimes, instead of this, I have the same problem as #3476 which was supposed to be fixed by using the latest version of A-Frame and Polyfill on Chrome 66. Nevertheless, I have Chrome 68 with latest versions of both A-Frame and Polyfill. On some web VR apps, I have the same problem. Take, for example, https://vivid.unit9.com which on Android 8 it freezes position on Firefox latest version, and on (mobile) Chrome latest it's extremely sensitive (as mentioned in #3476). https://konterball.com works fine on Firefox Android, but the A-Frame camera goes crazy when running on Chrome Android. Also double-checked, I presumed something was wrong with these sites instead of my client. However, not even https://aframe.io examples work for me. When I run most of them on Android Chrome, I still get the error mentioned in #3476. Should I comment there? Or open a new issue? @dmarcos Yeah I double checked it.
Chrome version : 68.0.3440.91
And I am facing this issue on Lenovo Android 6.0 
and Moto g5 android 7.1.2
 I only have this two devices for testing. https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/anime-UI/
This also appears to be frozen. @dmarcos One more thing if I host a scene locally on http server it works fine but if I change it to https I need to drag  to interact with it. Yeah https://webvr.info/samples/03-vr-presentation.html?polyfill=1 is working. Yeah https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr-polyfill/examples/ is also working So what does that mean that the webvr-polyfill examples are working?  By accident in my [commit](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/6c593aafea5f0eee59b5f673cfa679ed0da8cba1), I've deleted `---` which seem to be necessary for the docs creator.

  **Description:**

When using "laser-controls" on the currently-in-development version of aframe with an Oculus Go, the OGO model is shown on the screen as expected, but it is much too low - like our arms extend to our thighs and we hold the controller there instead of having the arm folded in a more natural pose.

In contrast, the GearVR controller model in version 0.8.0 is higher, in a more natural pose. That version doesn't have the Oculus Go controller model, though.

I haven't been able to test other controllers, so I don't know whether the problem is specific to the Oculus Go.

demo at:
https://aframe-laser-controls.glitch.me/ Is there some way to raise it, a workaround? Sounds like something may be causing issues with the arm model, in src/components/tracked-controls.js
Question, if you explicitly add a camera e.g. using <a-camera>, does the observed behavior change?
 I'm sorry @machenmusik, using what ? It looks like github ate your tags. I've noticed this also when testing with Vive Focus for our incoming vive-focus-controls component. In the laser controls example scene on master, the controller is located correctly, but the camera is far too tall. 

When using the focus in our project, on 0.8.2 with a camera rig structure, the location of the camera and controller are correct. That was supposed to be using a-camera, I think.  I am guessing that changes to the way position and user height are now managed by aframe may have messed up arm model behavior when not in a camera rig It's not limited to the arm model, though. The camera cursor appears pretty low as well (you have to look down to see it), since the camera Y is too high. The height of the arm model is quite possibly accurate when placed within the rig. I think this may be #3748 I can only confirm this. Been trying to messa round with the armModel parameter. It actually just makes it worse. I also encountered the same problem.
It seems that both of A-Frame and Three.js(WebVRManager) are adding user height.

three.js: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/3148b9e3783ecf2eeaa3d1ca7242d6bcf082fac5/src/renderers/webvr/WebVRManager.js#L262
 Would this also be why the "cursor" doesn't work with the oculus go? It's always to low and won't track the camera at all.  **Description:**

https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/cursor.html

At the bottom in the section on Adding Visual Feedback the animation triggers
on the `cursor-fusing` event. The correct event is `fusing`. (perhaps it was different in the past)?

The current example will not work correctly if the reader copy and pastes.  Documenation for `a-entity` `stateadded` and `stateremoved` event says `evt.detail.state` contains the state that was added/removed, and the example shows the same: 
```
entity.addEventListener('stateadded', function (evt) {
  if (evt.detail.state === 'selected') {
    console.log('Entity now selected!');
  }
});
```
but  `state` is not actually defined on detail. Instead `evt.detail` is set directly to the state. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/030023f5aab128ce0cbe7aa24b83de5ec248cc04/src/core/a-entity.js#L750

Either the documentation is wrong or `a-entity` should be updated to emit `{state: state}`. A third option would be to imply that `addState` should be passed an object, but given nothing in a-frame does that, it is probably not correct.

Hello, I was hoping to create a loading screen in Aframe. I found the page below, it's about object loading but I couldn't figure out how to use it...
https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/core/asset-management-system.html#lt-a-asset-item-gt

```
var models = document.getElementsByClassName("model");

/*trial 1*/
for(var i in models){
    models[i].addEventListener("loaded",()=>{console.log("loaded!")});//CAN'T FIND addEventListener
}

function OnLoaded(){
console.log("loaded!");
}

/*trial 2*/
for(var i in models){
    models[i].loaded  = OnLoaded;
}
```

On the html file, I have some `<a-asset-item class="model" id="mainModel" src="./models/mainModel.obj"></a-assets-item>` ,

I stored all of models that has `model` class. And I tried to add event listener to its child but it said `"addEventListenr is not a function"` I don't think there is addEventListener to this element. 

So I console.logeed the children and I saw some events like variables in it (onclick, onmousedown etc..)
and added the variable, "loaded" and "model-loaded" to the children. This time no error but nothing happened.

I also tried with the event name "model-loaded" but also didn't work...
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/obj-model.js#L51

Can someone give me some examples of how to use `loaded` event for`<a-assets-item>`?
Thanks in advance.

  **Description:**
I have ran into an issue while experimenting with AR.js (https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/issues/146) that required me to enable [logarithmicDepthBuffer](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=log#webgl_camera_logarithmicdepthbuffer). AFrame does not include this option, so I thought that I would include it myself. 

**Changes proposed:**
- added logarithmicDepthBuffer option to the scene as an attribute.
- added logarithmicDepthBuffer option to renderer component (not able to modify after scene initialization)
 I don't think the component version of this actually works.

`<a-scene renderer="logarithmicDepthBuffer: true">`
When setting logarithmicDepthBuffer on [the renderer component](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/scene/renderer.js#L47), the property is checked to make sure it's not being changed after initialization, but it's never actually set on the renderer, nor is it [used by a-scene](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/scene/a-scene.js#L529). I think it needs to be treated just like antialias [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/scene/a-scene.js#L533).

`<a-scene logarithmicDepthBuffer="true">`
The attribute on the primitive works fine. Yes @andreyrd you're exactly right. `logarithmicDepthBuffer` is a property that can only be set on the renderer's creation just like `antialias`.  The renderer component only allows you to modify the renderer's settings after initialization, limiting you to only a few different properties to modify.

I noticed a note made in the code [here](https://github.com/Tino-F/aframe/blob/d210a212d5666c7e5e5b36e557073e674df85f86/src/components/scene/renderer.js#L31) to enable modification of `antialias` in the renderer component for v0.0.9. Of course when this gets implemented, doing the same for logarithmicDepthBuffer will more than likely be a matter of copying and pasting Not sure if this is a bug but using logarithmicDepthBuffer, rendering text is problematic. In fact, no text is rendered. 

JSFiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/7aLh69gq/17/

You can toggle the logarithmicDepthBuffer setting from false to true and see the effects of it on the text. Moving the text forwards or backwards has no effect.   **Description:**

I found that the click event will not trigger again seem like the 'a-element' still focused
on mobile. I need to click the sky or other 'a-element' than the same 'a-element' can trigger the click event again.

I'm using the 0.8.2 version and it works if I back to use 0.7.0 version. So I believe that's the 0.8.x version bug.

Click the same `a-element` second time will not trigger alert again.

If you click another `a-element` after clicking the first `a-element`, it works.

  Hello everyone. It seems since version 0.7.1 you can't click on objects wrapped in an a-entity tag.
[See fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/9ex5Ljgp/22/) Hey @dmarcos 
I was using the most recent version. I need it for the canvas bounds scroll fix.
https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/5d5590d/dist/aframe-master.min.js So I guess this problem is newer than 0.8.0. Similarly, I need the fix that is in master for 0.9.0 for this sound bug: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3631 , but it is disabling all my click events.  How should a proceed adding the asset-sound-test branch to v0.8.2?
I tried this:

    git checkout v0.8.2
    git checkout -b asset-sound-test
    git cherry-pick 2a899cfcad336b
    npm run dist

Now some audio is working, some click events are working, but it's still is kind of broken.

Maybe because I'm getting an error that is looping very quickly:
THREE.WebGLRenderer: .animate() is now .setAnimationLoop().  a-frame.master.js:52009

      Also, I have click events to play the sound. Now they play even if the object is not visible, which wasn't the case before.  **Description:**

I understand that @greggman 's motivation behind this commit is to make it faster to install A-Frame as dependency:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/53f58fee02783e366ba8ecf3ec6a360f28c8a65a#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2

However, I've been using A-Frame since day 1, and in all larger projects I've always included from source, ie. `require('aframe/src')` rather than  `require('aframe')`. Why? Because A-Frame is constantly evolving, and I often see the need to debug my way deep into A-Frame's code base to resolve issues both in my own code and in A-Frame's code base.

I also use some of A-Frame utilities and components independently of the A-Frame build, and again I do that by including the relevant file directly  from source.

After the change in the commit above, such things are no longer possible, and I can see that it already causes issues, so ie. this commit had to be made:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/123102167dc4981c9ec24b36e47a0e8f746a0ecf#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2

**Changes proposed:**
- Let's rollback this change, since there's harm in installing all the files, but there's a big problem for developers such as me if we don't install all the files.

 Hasn't been fragile at all for me, and I've included from source since version 0.1.0. Plenty of things break in A-Frame, but I've never had any build-related issues.

If I'm the only who sees this change as a problem, I understand why we cannot merge this PR, I just find the whole "change package.json and npm link"-dance annoying when I'm debugging. That would work for me, want me to submit a PR for that?  All right, new PR here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3733  **Description:**

PR #3095, which fixed #3092 wherein default values for array types were not being used, introduced cloning of array properties by converting them to JSON and back. For me, this means calling setAttribute for a component (when the array property itself is not being updated) converts an array of Date objects to an array of strings and also breaks any existing references to that array property value.

Perhaps #3092 could be solved in the schema parser instead by taking an empty string to mean "use the default" and #3095 could then be reverted. I will create this PR if you agree or if a better solution arises.  @dmarcos the behavior previous to #3095 was indeed to treat arrays differently in the clone function. Wouldn't that just reintroduce #3092? If you're OK with that, I'll send the PR (perhaps with a documentation note that arrays can't have default values) Ah I did misunderstand. Thank you. This would solve the type changing, but it would still break the references. Preserving the array object became the behavior in 0.4.0 and discussion in #2227 determined this would be the desired behavior, which was subsequently documented and tested in #2434.

I will prepare a PR that preserves this behavior and keeps array default values functional.   **Description:**

      </a-entity>
```
^ Using a sample image and the `change-color-on-hover` component from the docs.

Originally I filed #3692 when having trouble getting point/click to work, but then tracked it down to using `curved-image`. Basically the pointer coordinates do not correctly map to curved surface.

The math to fix this issue might be difficult as there are a number of variables to consider:

1. Position, rotation, `radius`, `theta-length` and `theta-start` of curved image
2. Position and rotation of parent entities, as shown in the above example
3. Raycaster position offset
    (I haven't been able to change the oculus go controller model position from origin but noticed that it is possible to change the beam origin, so that might come into play here)

By tinkering I was able to set the image into odd positions where the `mouseenter` would partially register in a segment of the image, but not the entire thing.

I was also not able to find an easy solve by simplifying the example as much as possible (removing the wrapper entity, removing rotation and position, etc.). i testing this with aframe master and see some problems not intersection in the a-sphere
ah works fine on the box   raycaster="objects: .box" so all looks good 
https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VBLqgY/?editors=1111

(original code from https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1841)  @dmarcos Right, the ray does not intersect with the curved-image correctly. Depending on target position sometimes it will get partial intersection (like the highlight will work on a portion of the curved surface but not all of it). Sorry that I didn't have time to create a full example, but our team switched to Unity after we dropped a bunch of time on this problem. Should be fairly easy to spin up a scene with a curved image, drop the change-color-on-hover script on it, and validate.   when i use aframe load .obj models ,there is an error occur, any .obj model can not load. who can help me,thanks !!

 Of course! Thank you.  I have a scene with aframe 0.8.2 in Chrome 67 and in Firefox Quantum 60. I have an a-ring element within a a-sphere element.
````
 <a-sphere radius='2' color='${color}'>
      <a-ring radius-inner='0.9' radius-outer='1' color='black' position='0 0 -1.8'></a-ring>
 </a-sphere>
````
If I set the position to ``0 0 1.8`` all is fine, but when I position the ring on the other side of the sphere and then rotate the sphere 180 degrees the ring is invisible. If I rotate the ring by 180 degrees, then it become visible again.

So it seems the ring is invisible from behind. Is this intentional or is it a bug?
 Clear, thank you  **Description:** the docs about oculus-go-controls are missing.

  A `line` component will not update if using a cached `THREE.Vector3` to call `setAttribute`. I believe this is because `deepEqual` is used in component to determine if an attribute was actually updated or not. As such, this probably affects other components that similarly allow (or at least don't explicitly disallow) the use of THREE vectors. 

Aside from updating the `deepEqual` method, another option may be to allow forcing an update via another attribute like `needsUpdate`. 

```
        init() {
          this.end = new THREE.Vector3();
        },
        
        tick() {
          this.end.set(Math.random(),  Math.random(),  Math.random());
          this.el.setAttribute("line", {end: this.end}); //will not update after the first tick
        }

 @InfiniteLee Another alternative is to save the object you get from `getAttribute`, change the value of `end`, and then use `setAttribute` with `clobber` set to `true`. e.g. https://github.com/mozilla/hubs/commit/4d5559d2cd57d82631d4308400265017b9eed1ef#diff-bafcf688d672a56b722fa967f5b16acbR51  Fixes #3531

 I fixed, with a-assets tag and i've loaded the img on a-sky from javascript. I've read an old issue about double download of img on load, so i tried and works.  Sure! I'll be happy to get on this. Sure thing, will look into this within the next few days! Thanks for the clarification of where to put it.  three.js r93 includes experimental & incomplete [WebXR support](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/13978/files#diff-c0e88b98497597a015ecf238e91ac3a0R292), but it's incompatible with [code in `AScene.setupRenderer`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/scene/a-scene.js#L508) that expects `renderer.vr.setPoseTarget` to exist (since `renderer.vr` may be a brand-new `WebXRManager` that doesn't have `setPoseTarget`.) This will throw an exception if it runs in a browser with WebXR support. For example, you can reproduce this problem in desktop Chrome if you turn on "WebXR Device API" in chrome://flags and load more or less any A-Frame scene you like.

It seems to me that a proper fix would be for three to support `setPoseTarget` on `WebXRManager`, but in the meantime, if we wanted to, we could effectively disable three's WebXR support in A-Frame by manually forcing the `WebGLRenderer` to use a `WebVRManager`.

 it shouldn't happen. We enumerate the Oculus Touch with Oculus runtime. The amount of gamepads is according to the controllers that are turning on currently. https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component/issues/140#issuecomment-401458291

In this issue you have pictures showing the issue  Previously, this would just fail silently. This branch is running a lot of user code (i.e. component `init`) so it's frustrating not to get any console output if it fails.

An easy way to test is to open one of the examples and throw an error during `init`.  When trying to detect the movement of the camera's position, the only change I can detect is the camera's rotation.  To move the camera around, I'm using the [A-Frame Extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras) library.

  Hello! I am experiencing a gyro problem on 2 phones except they are accessing the gyro but with either random input, or very very sensitive input. If i keep my hand still and don't move it is almost still but i can see the micromovements on screen with my hand's micro shaking.

Thanks!

P.S I noticed a different thread had a "No gyro working issue" that was fixed recently, with aframe.io 8.0.2, chrome 65 Samsung S8 so I believe this is a different problem. 
 I also wanted to confirm that non of the examples using AFrame 0.8.2 are working on my Pixel with Chrome 67. Gyro does not work at all. Oddly enough, my own project that uses AFrame 0.7 and this example: https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/animation/ which uses AFrame 0.5 work great.

I upgraded my project to AFrame 0.8.2 to work around the Android m65 issue, seems like 0.8.2 has its own problems.  **Description:**
adding workshop resources  When I try to view the 360 video example on the a-frame website with my Oculus Go, it works until I click the VR icon to go into true 360 format, and then all I get is a black screen. It was working this morning, so I am unsure what could have changed. same issue with stereo 360 
bit.ly/test-stereo
this link show a correction of the stereo component and worked well in vr few days ago. I have seen this as well (working, then not working), wondered if the change might be caused by an update to the Go browser.

But it still works in some scenes even after emptying the Go browser cache, so I have some investigating to do. Known issue. Fixed in 4.6.2. Caused by some issues when introducing foveated rendering.  As workaround - disable Fixed foveation in chrome://flags (set it to None). the workaround works, thanks!
Is there a way to fix it in production? Definitely, it will be fixed in the next release. Indeed, disabling foveation works. Had the same problem with simple photosphere. @Utopiah @WellanDraco  Where can disable foveation on Oculus Go (Oculus Browser) or A-Frame? on the browser via the flags page... that's why I asked for a fix in production (cant ask every user to modify their flags) @VasuBhog  On the browser, the reason why i asked for a fix for production (cant ask every GO user to set flags before accessing vr)...  I tried to play a video when marker is detected but in aframe the video started to play when the page loads. Due to this, when marker is detected the video is not playing from beginning. And also the auto play is not working in IOS safari (mobile). I also want to hide and stop the video when marker goes out of the screen.
Is there any working event listener when the marker is detected?

@jhsu  @RSpace  @arpu @bnolan  @andygill  Yes @dmarcos   This resolves #3276.  Perhaps worth noting/documenting that it also changes the behavior when recursive is true such that it no longer traverses the entity hierarchy.  I think I just ran into this issue. Using the latest from master recursive:true no longer works. I can target the nested elements by using a class but if they don't have a class there is no way to target them.  This pretty much breaks the default behavior.  **Description:**

The initial/default camera rotation seems to be wrong since an update to Chrome/Android. As seen in the example, the camera should face the logo at the start (which it does on desktop). However on the device specified below the camera faces 180 degrees.

Side note - is there a 'look at' type method for the camera that would correct this for me in the short term?

Honor 6x | Android 7.0 EMUI 5.0.2 / Google Chrome 67.0.3396.87 / aframe 0.8.2 Hi @Xrispy7 thanks for testing. Yep still a problem, just to help clarify the first image is what you should see on entry to the site, the second is what you actually see...

 I suspect you are correct. I've attempted to raise an issue for OnePlus as that seems more likely. Leaving open for now until I get clarity. Same issue in Canary. I suppose this would indicate a device/sensor problem? FWIW this also happens on the A-Frame examples. I have now filed a report with OnePlus.

In the meantime if anyone has any ideas for a workaround (I can detect a OnePlus device using user agent) that'd be appreciated. I'm wondering if I can somehow offset the devices accelerometer Y rotation - not sure at what stage I need to do this though - Browser/Three.JS/WebVR Polyfill/A-Frame?? I think I have tracked down where the offset needs to go: https://github.com/immersive-web/cardboard-vr-display/blob/d97e0ec3e4144bd227b498bd7afa6f6270f712d2/src/sensor-fusion/fusion-pose-sensor.js#L183 Due to the sensors being incorrect on specific devices, not sure how this is something the polyfill can detect and handle, and should most likely be handled after receiving an updated pose -- can probably be handled by nudging the A-Frame camera on every frame; more info: https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill/issues/310#issuecomment-417356998  **Description:**

- A-Frame Version: 0.8.2
- Platform / Device: Chrome
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: Any with timeout

Currently setting timeout to 1 will cause a WebGL error for video about non-power of two textures, because the texture isn't loaded yet. onloadeddata should at least be called once before play and resolve() can be called on first onloadeddata callback.

Next to that, the buffer might never reach 100% of the video length, and thus the user might have to wait -say- 2.5 seconds out of 3 seconds (when timeout = 3). This is expected behaviour because most browsers only buffer a very small portion of the video. Also this is very browser dependent and will lead to different behaviours across browsers.

An alternative could be to update the timeout when onprogress is called, with -say- 1 second instead. Each progress call grants another 1s timeout. This way the user only waits a max of 1 second after buffer loading ends. But this could also behave differently across browsers.

What usually is done to fix the buffer loading ending early, is to play through the entire audio/video first, which will ensure the entire clip is loaded in cache. However, with cubemap videos the filesize will be so large it might very well be cleared from cache again anyway.

It's probably better to at least disable timeout functionality by default (instead of 3000ms). Right now, most browsers will wait 3 seconds while actual loading ends very early. If you set timeout to 1 you may get that error once but for me videos still work once you get through user gesture click to play etc.

I thought that if you didn't want to wait you can stop putting your videos within a-assets, but that was a long time ago and maybe that has changed since then.  `THREE.Object3D.getWorldPosition` [already internally calls](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/12e7e072a595dfba6374a36c76da308ec0a04cf4/src/core/Object3D.js#L446) `updateMatrixWorld` in order to always produce an up-to-date position, so we don't want to call it ourselves first -- that's just doing the work twice. By the way, I would be interested to understand why `raycaster.checkIntersections` calls `setTimeout(updateLine)` at the end. Why can't it just call `updateLine` directly? Alternatively, can `drawLine` happen in the next `tick`, instead of in a separate timeout? I ask because the raycaster code is fairly performance-sensitive for our team and `setTimeout` is relatively slow.  > I would love to hear what effects people want to see first.

Santa is coming! :D My wish list, in order: SSAO, Screen space reflections, Chromatic Aberration, Noise/grain. This is awesome and will give webVR visuals a much needed push! feiss's list is pretty much it, I think those are the most needed (SSAO above all). As a super low-priority one I'd suggest a glitch/digital distortion effect. I would love to see effects related to simulations of how people would see aframe experiences with various vision problems. Filters for viewing red/green color blindness would be the first one I would appreciate! [Reference: Be Kind to the Color Blind](http://www.particletree.com/features/interfaces-and-color-blindness/)   THANK YOU!!!!! SSAO, Screen Space Reflections, Chromatic Abberation, Motion Blur would definitely be wanted. PLEASE PLEASE ADD DoF for 2D!!!!!  Looks great, color grading/tonemapping/color curves or however you like to call it would be high on the list for me. Based on some basic paint.net effects I like, my favorites are:

Artistic - Ink, Oil, and Pencil
Blurs - Gaussian, Motion, Radial
Distortion - Crystalize, Tile Reflection, Dents
Style - Edge Detect, Emboss

All should be animatable! :) looks very nice but why not use the soucecode from Threejs examples as import ? 
like the https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/js/postprocessing/UnrealBloomPass.js 


 it would be possible with the webpack three plugin 
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/9562#issuecomment-415022483 or maybe using this threejs https://github.com/vanruesc/postprocessing

Android WebView using Chrome Canary (Chrome 69) breaks devicemotion event for aframe.io samples.

We are seeing this with our own app that uses android WebView, but testing it with an app called WebView from the play store shows the same issue. Get chrome canary. Go to your developer settings on your phone and set webviews to use chrome canary. finally use the webview app to go to aframe.io. looks like the device motion event is broken?

  **Description:**
Adding an attribute to the scene component which allows you to set a maximum height/width.
Currently, you get some big frame drops on high-density screens in a full width window – especially on iMacs & Macbooks with retina screens and slightly less powerful GPUs.

Was just a first stab.
Would it be more useful with a separate width and height attribute?
Tried this rather than a pixel ratio attribute, as you can make the most of the high-density screen at smaller sizes. Great!

I've implemented the two separate attributes, and added them to the renderer schema to stop the warning. Though the default doesn't do anything. 

Size caps are ignored in VR mode.

I'll update the documentation also, if that's all okay?

EDIT: Will figure out what's going wrong with the test failing Ahh, of course.

Let's say your screen was 1920x1080 at pixel ratio of 3 – and the cap is set to 2560 x 2560. If the pixel ratio was then set to 1 but a size larger than the screen, would it cause any problems? Agreed that would be much simpler – but maybe there's value in the max size, since it means you can make the most of the pixel ratio at smaller window sizes where it wouldn't be a frame rate issue?
Perhaps we could add an option for pixel ratio also?

I've just pushed a change that should hopefully fix the sizing on retina screens.  Hi,
I have draco compressed GLTF images which needs to be loaded using aframe. When trying to load it using the new gltf-model component I am getting "components:gltf-model:warn THREE.GLTFLoader: No DRACOLoader instance provided." error. I hope this is because there is no option to specify the dracoloader which can be passed as argument to the threejs GLTFLoader -> setDRACOLoader function. Please help... Tried to check the above solution by hardcoding the decoder path instead of passing as a parameter. Now getting "defs.map is not a function" error in GLTFParser.prototype.getDependencies function. Seems like defs is an Object but the map function is available only for Array in javascript..Can some one help me to identify a solution for this? Thanks for the suggestion. The model I had did not work in GLTF viewer as well. 
After some analysis, I came to know the information in the model was lost when using the gltf-pipeline master branch. 
Now I have used the 2.0 branch of the Gltf-pipeline with draco compression option and it worked fine. Once again thanks a lot for your guidance. Hi @ainian 

Could you by any chance outline the steps you followed to get your gltf-pipeline optimised model working in the current version of a-frame?

My model loads in the gltf-viewer but isn't loading in my own test...

```
components:gltf-model:warn Cannot read property 'byteStride' of undefined 
aframe-master.js:55211 Timer 'GLTFLoader' already exists

I'm looking for a portable VR headset which is supported by aframe.  So does anybody know if the Oculus Go can show the 360 image gallery example?

https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/360-image-gallery/

If yes, how can you upload the aframe code to the Oculus Go? Do you need a Wireless connection to the PC? Or must it be accessed by a browser - if so does Oculus Go have a inbuilt browser and internet connection?

Are there also any other portable VR headsets like Oculus Go (no cardboards, no smartphones) in the market which can be used with aframe? Any proposals?
 The 360 image gallery example is not working on the Oculus Go (Version 88830.2550.0). Screen stays grey, selecting the VR button has no effect.
![com oculus vrshell-20180726-213451](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3518808/43284507-4ee363fa-911c-11e8-9b96-9fa44404d94d.jpg)
 This example uses aframe Version 0.3.2. Could you try to use any other aframe html site with newer build 0.8.0. Also would it be possible to save aframe code local to oculus go and load it with the in-built broswer from the internal storage? (This would be required if there was no internet connection for any reason) A-frame 0.8.0 works fine on the oculus go. I just wanted to inform that the example discussed here doesn't work. Thanks for pointing out that the 360 image gallery is based on an older aframe version, so that should be the reason why it's not working on the oculus go. 

Probably it would be good to update the example.  **Description:**

Thank for your time @dmarcos.   This test makes sure that sound component can load the same audio resource more than once. A test for #3623. This test fails now. I will recreate this PR.  **Description:**

Running `AFRAME.utils.styleParse.stringify` on attributes with coordinates outputs `[object Object]` instead of correct coordinates.

Example:

```js
AFRAME.utils.styleParse.stringify({
	"depth": 1,
	"distance": {"x": 1, "y": 0}
})
// "depth: 1; distance: [object Object]"
```

Shouldn't it use the `AFRAME.utils.coordinates.stringify` by default on coordinate type attributes? @dmarcos how do I get the changes that A-Frame Inspector does to the scene? I see there is an external `generateHtml` function. Shouldn't it be accessible?  Events `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` (from `cursor` component) are triggered each time on parent element when moving cursor between child and parent element. 

Shouldn't `mouseleave` be triggered only if cursor is moved away from parent and it's descendants? If no, maybe this beaviour should be documented?

  If I use an audio resource(sound.mp3 for example) in an entity only, then it works, but if I use it in more than two entities, then only the first entity can load that resource and the other entities fail to load it. That is because AudioContext.decodeAudioData() is a destructive function, once an ArrayBuffer is given to that function, that ArrayBuffer becomes empty. An empty ArrayBuffer remains in THREE.Cache. Then if the next sound component uses the same audio resource(the same asset or the same url), since that ArrayBuffer is already empty, decodeAudioData fails to load, so other sound components can't load the audio.

AFAIK this is a problem of THREE.AudioLoader. But I would like to fix it in aframe's sound component because it is a basic feature of aframe and beginners like me must be confused by this bug. Could you advise me something? My idea is to implement a custom audio loader based on THREE.AudioLoader. I will make a pull request.

a) if numbers, don't reverse the characters
b) if in the alphabet, likewise
otherwise reverse characters. 
Keep the line order intact.

`npm test` passes, and I ran all tests and examples in localhost:9000/examples on Ubuntu Firefox, without VR, and fixed a few simple warnings that flew out related to recent three.js API deprecations. Everything looks good at a glance.

It would probably be nice to test VR.

(Actually, the "Generic Logo" example doesn't work for me. But it doesn't seem related -- it also doesn't work for me on the [live site](https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/animation/generic-logo/). Tried Firefox and Chrome both.)  text elements render hebrew text in reverse string order.
simply reversing the string is not sufficient because it will introduce errors for multilingual text, multi-digit numbers, and multi-line wrappings  Hi there,

I need to delay the loading with webpack. I'm using vuejs with axios to get my media url on mouted, and I get an unrecoverable components:texture:warn Video element was defined without `src` nor `srcObject` attributes.   Test out a fix for #3603

I believe @jsantell landed a PR in that upstream-upstream repo that fixes this: https://github.com/immersive-web/cardboard-vr-display/pull/28 

Not sure if it has made it into a webvr-polyfill release (ie what is actually consumed by aframe) yet, though The change has landed downstream in webvr-polyfill `0.10.7` which no longer uses `screen`  honestly I think you only need aframe-master.js

see #3600  I'm curious why do docs need to be installed with npm?

Does the aframe library reference the docs directly? Is there some place where it says if you want to read the docs to go to `<currentfolder>/node_modules/aframe/docs`? 

npm's point is to install code libraries. Those packages then often get bundled into apps. Anything in those folders get included into those apps. For example if someone makes an electron app or a phonegap app and includes aframe those docs will then be embedded in their app.

It seems like if people want docs locally they should clone the repo. npm packages are not for docs they are for code. Generally docs should appear somewhere else.

Just trying to understand why docs should be included. > The Markdown files (just flat files) shouldn't be included in applications if they aren't required. 

Unfortunately that's not true. The app has no way of knowing what files are needed. Require is not enough to tell. Some libraries have files the code references either by loading directly (node, electron) or by XHR/Fetch (browser) whether it's images, fonts, svgs, icons etc so they always have to include everything included in whatever npm downloads.
  this will probably work but it seems like the [canvas-texture](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/examples/test/canvas-texture/components/draw-canvas-rectangles.js) example will need to do something to set `needsUpdate` for the texture inside its `tick` handler  Awesome work with Aframe, really appreciates it!

I want to ask about performance on the Oculus Go, I am with the stats module only getting 46 fps for what is a really simple scene, also without the anti-alias attribute.

The image taken inside the Oculus weirdly says 63, must be the way it takes a screenshot that gives the browser more cpu time as the screen goes black while it does it, but the raf says correctly 24,5 which would be 1000/24,5=40,8 fps

I know it is probably premature optimization, but shouldn't it be able to get 60 fps and a raf of 16? Will this make the animation stutter if the scene just get a little more complicated? In my experience, the perf tool itself has some overhead. Does it feel much smoother when you disable it?  **Description:**

Hi, I'm a beginner in this world!
I have a problem with rotation right-left only huawei mobile device with Chrome 66.
I've already solved the problem of hypersensitivity after the last update of Chrome, but I did not find the solution for this bug.

Can you help me, please?
 I am also having problems with rotation on "Huawei P8 Lite - 2017"  Yeah, that is what I thought you and Don meant while discussing #3129 Right, but if you are already doing that yourself programmatically, the raycaster component doesn't really help because (unlike intersections) I don't think new and cleared are saved on the component.
 I think the use cases that were discussed were things like "I'm manipulating something, and don't care about others until no longer intersecting" which can be programmatic calls to getIntersection for the entity (or entities) of interest. Are the intersect**ed** events commonly used in practice? I've always just used on the inersect**ion** events as `super-hands` does its own version of communicating to the affected entities. Could save even more performance if these were removed. Would it be simpler to just include a reference to the raycaster component in the event detail, instead of a reference to its `getIntersection` function?  **Description:**

What is really the issue here? It seems to work at the bottom. I'd think a-frame would scan the DOM on startup. Is there an example of a concrete issue that putting the script at the top solves? Just trying to both make sure it's not voodoo that it should be at the top and also understand the issues for my own knowledge of custom elements. Hmm, ok, well, putting at the bottom works just fine so I think maybe it's not doing what you think it's doing.

It would be good to know a concrete reason why I needs to be at the top vs just voodoo since it's working just fine at the bottom.

Others work perfectly fine:

- how to play video
 can update more methods should this be useful Updated the PR to add the link, am uncertain if the link is to the right location.

Is it a common issue in github where we are unable to test the linking accuracy since the preview of links are stored in a hosting URL?

Thank you @ngokevin for the learning experience !   **Description:**

I have been searching for a while now through the various documentations, but I have yet to find if there is a way to obtain the real time position information for the controllers in the VR environment. Once the controllers are loaded and in the scene I have tried to obtain position data from

controller_left.getAttribute('position')

as well as

controller_left.object3D.position

However both always say that the controllers are at (0,0,0) even when I move them. It would seem the components I am using know where the controllers are so that sphere-collider and things like that work, however I would like to get the real time position data myself to see where the controllers are in the VR environment.

I have created a normal (bump) map in Substance Painter using a hard surface decal of a vent. When viewed in Painter with a light shining from above, it appears seemingly correct. This is further validated when exporting the map and viewing the same scene in Maya (StingrayPBR material). Lastly, when converting to a glTF (using the Facebook FBX2glTF converter) and viewing the scene in Don McCurdy's glTF viewer, it also appears correct. However, when loading that glTF into A-Frame and adding lights, the normal map appears reversed. (see attached images)
I have replicated this with a handful of normal maps, hand-painted or otherwise.

 Actually, the FBX exported from Maya had its textures embedded before converting to glTF. And again, the glTF file appears correct— it’s only when it gets added to A-Frame that the normal gets flipped. Unless I’m misunderstanding what you mean by ‘textures included in the model’. Are you perhaps referring to a .glb vs .glTF? what does this look like with 0.8.2 / latest master?

 Upon further investigation, it appears that this bug is only occurring on Mozilla Hubs. Still troubleshooting what's causing it, but it's not an a-frame specific bug.  `coordinates.parse` winds up accounting for a moderate amount of time if you do per-frame updates of attributes containing new string or object coordinates. (In our project, an example was a raycaster component which we updated with a new direction and origin each frame.) This change makes it between 2x and 10x faster in both the string-input and object-input cases in Firefox and Chrome (depending on input characteristics) while being more or less equally straightforward.

[Here's a JSPerf comparing the old and new versions](https://jsperf.com/a-frame-coordinates-parsing/8).

There's one edge case I'm worried about. In the old version, if you gave the input `{x: 1, y: "2", splatoon: "42", "whiz": "bang"}`, it would return `{x: 1, y: 2, splatoon: 42, whiz: NaN}`. That is, it would parse any string keys at all in the input, even ones that it didn't know anything about, and even ones that aren't floats. That behavior seems strange to me, it didn't seem documented anywhere, and no test was exercising it, but it's true. If that behavior is important, then let me know and I'll hack it back in. I made the style changes you suggested. The test failure was a real bug; it was the new version doing a bad job of handling the empty string or a string with all spaces as input. It should line up now. Performance still seems equally good.

Thanks for the advice about reusing the same object, that advice could really be worth its weight in gold for us -- if not here, in other places. I'm not sure anyone on our team realized that!  **Description:**

It appears that the cones of spotlights, when seen shining on a surface, are rendering to the opposite eye. This is most obvious when setting a spotlight's penumbra to zero, pointing it downward near a wall. This seems unrelated to cast shadows as it is observable with or without them.

 @dmarcos I haven't-- but it's tricky to find examples that have HMD support. Curious if there's been any progress on this... This is very easy to reproduce. Just add a box with full roughness (so as not to get confused by specular highlight) and place a downward-facing spotlight next to it. It helps if the box has a texture on it, or at least place another geometry right near the wall surface so you can compare your eyes' focus. I've tried this in an earlier version of a-frame-- I think it was 0.7.0-- and it did NOT occur. So perhaps this bug got introduced somewhere later.  I have tested out Aframe with Oculus Go and the experience is not as great in terms of resolution compared to React 360. I am not sure what it can be?

https://github.com/facebook/react-360

It is pretty difficult to debug since you can't see the developer toolbar in the Oculus Go webbrowser.

I have searched the docs and the issues and it seems to be something with similar to mobile devices asking about the resolution, but I am creating a new issue because I have not seen it compared to React360 (prev. ReactVR) where the resolution is good. @dmarcos Thanks for replying

It is the aframe example with the 3 red, yellow, blue objects, where the straight lines on particular the blue square is really rought.

There is no anti-alias on that line as you can see the line drop down as if the pixels where that huge, but they aren't they are just rendered double the pixels and with no anti-alias

 Also the grey background is suddenly white when VR is activated down in the corner, which makes it super bright and unconfortable to look at, compared to the grey color. @dmarcos I could not see that in the documentation, therefore I thought it did not exist anymore.

Should it exist on this page?

 Using A-Frame teleport controls with A-Frame 0.7.0 is fine but since 0.8.x it is not possible to teleport any more: hands and teleportation sphere are still shown but no teleportation any more.
Since all A-Frame applications which also support mobile devices are forced to upgrade to 0.8.2 because of the recent mobile Chrome update a quick solution for using A-Frame teleport controls with 0.8.2 would be great.

 You're right, now it's working. Many thanks from Germany! :-)  Hi, I am having trouble on-boarding A-Frame at my company because the security review process requires that all dependencies be downloaded from http://npmjs.com but the [package.json](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/package.json) includes two dependency libraries from Github.

```
"debug": "ngokevin/debug#noTimestamp",
"document-register-element": "dmarcos/document-register-element#8ccc532b7",
```

Is there any reason these two libraries are being pulled in from Github instead of traditional NPM?

It seems they are also available on NPM:

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/document-register-element

I can make a fork and change that myself, but I'm worried there is some reason _these versions_ of `debug` and `document-register-element` are being used. Will it break something if I switch to the NPM versions? What's so special about these anyway?

Thanks for any advice. That's a great idea! I would really appreciate if you would consider making the official A-Frame npm dependencies include scoped npm packages for those currently existing as github repos. I work at a very large firm and intend to expose thousands of users to A-Frame (already have lots of working demos) when I can finally get through this security review.

If you also include the devDependencies I personally pledge to contribute in a meaningful way (on company time!) to the project and rally similar support from developers on my visualisation team. Specifically, we are working on displaying infrastructure metrics and virtual representations of data centres in A-Frame's 3D environments, so I hope to on-board the library internally and come back with some interesting examples/contributions to this community. Thank you! I have made the same arguments (anyone can publish to NPM so why would that be more 'secure' than Github?). The answer seems to be more about process than security. I've escalated/complained about this situation but I'm not optimistic about being granted an exception.

I acknowledge this isn't really your problem, but just to explain more about the company I work for and to tell you about a few others I've been asking around with this same situation; I don't think I'm the only one who is being denied usage of A-Frame because of this silly situation.

Basically we have an internal NPM. As a developer I ask to get a new library on-boarded, and so they assign somebody to do the review and copy the library + dependencies to the in-house version of NPM. Then once it's on-boarded I can use it with company tools like a regular NPM, but the links will all refer to the vetted dependencies coming from the internally hosted copies. In this case, since the package.json refers to a few Github repos, they don't have the architecture setup to handle the distribution of those non-NPM packages. Furthermore, the person responsible for doing the copy to internal NPM, is not a developer and it's considered a kind of grunt-work, so they don't really accept my complaints or reasoning behind how to package the bundled release. I work in a highly government regulated environment where external resources are completely blocked to production applications, forcing everyone to go through this 'security process.' It's terrible!

So I'm kind of stuck appealing to you to help me get it all working with NPM from the official A-Frame repo so I can complete the on-boarding and distribute my 3D environments to other employees. Even if I make my own package.json including the scoped packages, I have to provide them with an NPM link and ultimately republish a scoped version of A-Frame. Then I'm stuck convincing the company to on-board a library from my personally-maintained version instead of the "real" one. It's so annoying, we work for these huge corporations who want to try out the latest stuff but they really don't offer much flexibility when it comes to actually getting those tools into the environment.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge your concern/opposition to the forked scoped packages, even though I don't have a better suggestion. Ok so in conclusion it looks like I will have to re-publish A-Frame, while either making scoped packages from those Github repos or I might just take the release version and throw it into a package to publish it myself.

Thank you all for taking the time to learn about this rather silly corner-case of corporate development using A-Frame, I really appreciate it. I have uploaded scoped copies of the required branches/commits from the github repositories, updated package.json + relevant imports, and re-uploaded a scoped version of A-Frame. Additionally, I copied roboto.css font into the package so there are no external downloads necessary whatsoever. 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ajwest/aframe

I will try to maintain any updates in my "captive" branch:
https://github.com/IntegersOfK/aframe/tree/captive

Thank you all for the suggestions, I hope this will help other people like me who need all dependencies to be contained within NPM directly.  **Description:**

please help   **Description:**

The camera position in mobile updates its angles when devicecmotion or touchmove events are fired. But in the case of touchmove only the theta (and thus the horizontal axis) is updated and the user cannot view up in the scene using touch events.

TouchPanner.prototype.getOrientation only uses theta.

How could we do to enable vertical and horizontal move with touch events like in the devicemotion events.

I know that combining devicemotion and touchpanner (both directions) at the same time can be a mess if not well implemented (I saw viewers that have implemented it with a very good user experience). 
Can I use touch panner in both directions and disable devicemotion? It would be perfect for people that is looking in an scene from a mobile and don't want to move the hand all around and want to see the scene (rotate the camera) only touching the mobile and not moving the arm and hand around.

Helppp

Thank you :)
 I only use webvr polyfill, do I have to modifiy the touchpanner and posesensor objects? I use the aframevr fork webvr-polyfill from immversive  Hi everyone,

One thing that has running in the back of my mind using this framework (and other javascript libraries) is why are all events, types, etc. left to the developer to type properly?

Could a framework like Aframe benefit from having all this string types saved as consts somewhere like (very rough implementation):

```javascript
//aframe.constants.js

const EVENT
{
    LOADED = 'loaded',
    MESHLOADED = 'object3DSet';
};

const SCHEMA_TYPE
{
    ASSET = 'asset',
    BOOLEAN = 'boolean'
    STRING = 'string'
};

module.exports = { 
    EVENT,
    SCHEMA_TYPE
 };
```
```javascript
//myComponent.js

AFRAME.registerComponent('mdmu-cutout-material', {
    schema: {
        property0:     {type:AFRAME.SCHEMA_TYPE.ASSET, default:''},
        property2:     {type:AFRAME.SCHEMA_TYPE.BOOLEAN, default:false},
        property3:     {type:AFRAME.SCHEMA_TYPE.STRING, default:''}
    },
    init: function() {
        this.el.addEventListener( AFRAME.EVENT.MESHLOADED, () => { console.log('loaded!'); });
    }
};
```

I know it is definitely more verbose but it may be helpful for beginners to have one place to see all functionality that could be "hidden" or "scattered across several pages of documentation (e.g. one place to see all events we can listen to aid async functionality). It will also make sure we reduce typing errors (something I am huge proponent of in C languages as compile and run-time errors are much better than invisible ones).

Thoughts?
 Thanks for the thoughtful considerations Diego.  **Description:**

Not sure if this topic belongs here but I have an a-entity text inside an a-box element and the text looks blurred out

</a-box>
```
I suspect the problem may be with the anti aliasing but I have already manually turned it on in my a-scene Also having this problem. Any opacity < 1 on the container behind it seems to cause a lot of the issue. The second I make the opacity 1 again the clarity improves dramatically Looks to me as if it is trying to antialias against black... but it also looks as though the the text is behind the svg texture on the box?  Unless the camera has been flipped around...  This is a great discussion. Thanks for starting it.

I have run into similar issues; though admittedly it may be due to my coding style not completely being moved over to the appropriate style of js. I find the "loaded" event is a bit of a misnomer as it doesn't account for the actual content within the entity being loaded (i.e. a model and its associated textures/materials are not necessarily loaded as well). This may be where these issues are stemming from because any advanced functionality is diving into three.js/webgl layer and everything may not be set just yet.

When building a couple of components that accessed materials/meshes I had to approach similarly to Don's tick method. I see there is an "object3Dset" event I can listen to but that also doesn't necessarily mean the material is set correct?

Also, what about use cases where there are multiple dependencies within the ThreeJS layer. I am just getting to understand promises in js but how would we approach this within an asynchronous event-driven model (without having to resort to a bunch of questionable booleans in a tick)?

**Question**: Are some of these issues related to trying to maintain two areas where setting properties can take place: setAttribute(...) as position/scale/rotation as attributes vs. setting them directly to the object3D.position.set(...)?

_e.g. of a rough component attempt I have been having troubles with (replacing the standard material with a basic material for my boundary wireframes). Sometimes shadows pop up (or not) depending on whether the parent entity (an avatar head with shadows enabled) loads before or after this child element (facial texture cutout material)._

``` Thanks for the response @ngokevin. And thanks for pointing to the 'materialtextureloaded' event - I must have missed that in the documentation. I suppose it gets a bit hairy trying to track down what events exist and what I can listen to before doing something - and if I need multiple things to exist/be set before doing something else.

I really like the idea of forcing some sort of synch on entity. It would be really handy, at least from those of us just jumping in and without the years of experience of knowing what hooks exist. Well perhaps it is my own idiosyncrasies as it doesn't seem too far out of reach at all.  A-Frame is adding grey border around the opaque part of png image. Unable to figure out why this is happening. I would be glad to know if anyone has solved this issue.

 @deckewandboden Maybe try adjusting the `material.alphaTest` property: https://aframe.io/docs/master/components/material.html#properties_alphatest  Can we get the link back up to date so it matches the latest version e.g. https://aframe.io/releases/0.8.0/aframe.min.js -
Was this deliberate or is that just a publishing bug?  **Description:**

According to the A-Frame docs (https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/material.html#properties_visible), raycasters should ignore entities with `material="visible: false;"` rather than those with `visible="false"`.

It appears that the opposite is happening.

  **Description:**

According to the A-Frame docs (https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/material.html#properties_visible), raycasters should ignore entities that have `material="visible: false;"`. This doesn't seem to be the case when `raycaster="objects: ... ;"` is defined. In this case, all qualifying objects are raycasted regardless of visibility.

Should `material.visible` not still affect raycasting on these entities?

 I had the problem few days ago and `material="visible: false;"` didn't work neither.

My solution today is to set a class `.interactible` on my visible entities which should interact with the  raycaster.

On my cursor I setted 
``` 
<a-entity id='myCursor'
    cursor="fuse: true;"
    raycaster="interval: 200; objects: .interactible"
      ...
```

Then, after each interactible objects update I launch 
```AFRAME.scenes[0].querySelector('[raycaster]').components.raycaster.refreshObjects();```

Hope it can help. Thanks, @ArnaudRemi @ngokevin @donmccurdy . I typically use the same practices you outlined, @ArnaudRemi , however the `material.visible` functionality doesn't work as documented, hence the issue.

I may be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure I still had to manually refresh the objects when adding/removing classes for raycaster objects. I'll have to test this again to be sure.

I have a somewhat related issue open (#3552), also with a demo illustrating that `material="visible: false;"` doesn't appear to affect the raycaster regardless of whether or not raycaster objects are defined. The only difference between this issue and #3552 is that, in the latter, `visible="false"` is ignored by the raycaster rather than `material="visible: false;"`. This seems to be the opposite of what is documented. I hit this issue recently and found the following three.js change log item from r72: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/6758

This behavior matches what @dsinni describes and seems like a conscious design decision on three.js's part that's been around for a couple years.

The "Raycasters will ignore invisible materials." line in the documentation has been there since 0.3.0, which used r76.1.  But I was able to reproduce the raycaster intersecting an object with `material="visible: false;"` in 0.3.0 (gaze to the right of the yellow box):

```html
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.3.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        // Component to change to random color on click.
        AFRAME.registerComponent('cursor-listener', {
            init: function () {
                var COLORS = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
                this.el.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
                    var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * COLORS.length);
                    this.setAttribute('material', 'color', COLORS[randomIndex]);
                    this.setAttribute('material', 'visible', true);
                    console.log('I was clicked!', e);
                });
            }
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
<a-scene>
    <a-entity camera="userHeight: 1.6" look-controls wasd-controls>
        <a-entity raycaster="objects: .clickable" cursor="fuse: true" position="0 0 -1" scale="0.05 0.05 0.05" geometry="primitive: ring" ></a-entity>
    </a-entity>

``` So, while it seems that the documentation is the inverse of what is true between `material="visible: false;"` and `visible="false"`, would it still not make the most sense for the raycaster to ignore an entity with `visible="false"` regardless of whether or not it qualifies as a raycaster object? That, to me, seems like the most consistent way of handling it.

If it's desired for the entity to not be visible while also being raycastable, `material="visible: false;"` can still be used. This seems cleaner to me than having to add/remove/replace query selectors.

Out of curiosity, if this method were to be used, would raycaster objects still need to be refreshed manually?  Thanks for the reply @ngokevin. I'm sure you have it all figured out, because you're the dude. haha. But it seems rather complex for something somewhat trivial.

If the raycaster ignores `visible="false"` but not `material="visible: false;"` then the latter could be used for invisible, raycastable entities. The problem is that, _when_ using raycaster objects, _both_ are raycastable.

I'm wondering if it's possible to still follow the former paradigm _even when_ raycaster objects are defined, since there are two workable options to choose from already without needing to use external components.

Essentially, I think it would be beneficial to have a way (right out of the box) to make a qualifying raycaster object _not_ be raycastable due to its invisibility.

Is this something that could even be done in A-Frame, or would it need to be implemented in THREE.js? Don't be modest, @ngokevin; you are a wizard.

I feel like I may not be communicating my thoughts very well, though. I'm not suggesting solely depending on visibility, but more a combination of raycaster objects _and_ visibility, i.e., the raycaster handling visibility the same way regardless of whether or not raycaster objects are defined. This is not currently the case. Both `material.visible` and `visible` are completely disregarded (the entity is still raycastable) if raycaster objects are defined. This is inconsistent with how the raycaster behaves when they are _not_ defined.

I agree that a better system can be utilized to keep track (for those who are savvy enough), but the inconsistency has potential to cause confusion when a simple approach could be possible.  On Android devices, the camera is not moving when rotating the device. If you tilt it, its moving correctly. Same functionality works without a problem on iOS devices.

Camera doesn't rotate until you get into VR mode. Similar to the symptoms of #3731

  **Description:** Adds support for using / displaying the Oculus Go controller. Addresses #3390.

**Changes proposed:**
- Adds a new component and tests for `oculus-go-controls`, which is pretty close in functionality to the GearVR controller. A lot of this is duplicated code right now, which can likely be consolidated.
- Sets up the Oculus Go controller model from the CDN to support button highlighting.
- Removes workaround from `tracked-controls` to have multiple gamepad id prefixes in one string (since we now have a separate component for Oculus Go controllers) @dmliao Is there somewhere I can test this easily? Would love to test it out! @dmliao @dmarcos I tried it and it works! Really great!

However it works different from the normal in-game Oculus Go controller in that it follows the heads rotation where the Oculus Go controller normally follows a certain circle on the radius on that, eg. does not follow your heads rotation.

I think I like the default behavior as when I move my head, I don't my move hands at the same time, but with Aframe it looks like I move my hand which I don't.

Can the Oculus Go controller be made fixed as an option? I think the basic arm model A-Frame uses is different than what other native apps use... @dmliao @DigiTec is more information on the standard Go arm model available?

Not using any arm model at all could be somewhat problematic as the controller would be rooted at the wrong spot it you turn 180 degrees and start interacting @machenmusik 

> Not using any arm model at all could be somewhat problematic as the controller would be rooted at the wrong spot it you turn 180 degrees and start interacting

There are several things that makes it works without arm:
- You will still have the ray
- The controller runs on its own circle, so it can go all around but on either your right and left side from a start
- The Oculus button pressing it resets the direction, but looking and pointing the same direction.

But doing the arm model, it will be more confusing as with WebVR you just came from the default and then into a weird Aframe arm model. It feels really weird. I am not sure what you are suggesting would be providing the positional update for the Go controller with no arm model, as it is not a 6DOF controller and the Go doesn't know where it is.  If you are saying that the browser is providing a full 6DOF pose using the native arm model, that would be great, but I would like to get some level of confirmation from the committers, as I expect they would have disabled the arm model if it was not required. That being said, it looks as though there is a simple flag to disable arm model if you like, see
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/961ba488d68e04eb1880e2988e53846279ed9b70/src/components/oculus-go-controls.js#L29 @machenmusik The oculus controller turns in the black radius where the red circle is the head

 @kevinsimper right, but if you turn around (turn your head 180 degrees), without any arm model, your right hand would then become your left hand... the arm model is what keeps your right hand on the right.  Also you can turn it off if you don't like it, as described above. @machenmusik We can't change how it works inside the Oculus Go, so shouldn't it work the same inside Aframe so that people don't get confused?

It also works that way inside games: https://www.facebook.com/kevinsimper/videos/10157280187933539/

Edit: Also thought, you arm and hand does not move when your head do. That is why it feels weird when I tried it. @kevinsimper actually there is a native arm model for Oculus Go, and here is how to prove it... find a swivel chair and sit in it; put on your Oculus Go, go to the Home screen, center the controller and hold it out in front of you with your right hand; spin in the swivel chair slowly clockwise.  You'll notice at first the controller doesn't move in space, as you mention in your diagram above.  But as you keep spinning, you will notice that the controller starts to move in space to follow your rotation as well; it's the native arm model that is doing that.  Without any arm model, the controller would stay in the same position and would no longer be visible once you had trotted far enough.

The Oculus Go native arm model is almost certainly more sophisticated than the current basic arm model in A-Frame; pull requests with better arm model are certainly welcome, as are suggestions on how it could be improved even without implementation, as you have been doing (thank you BTW!)... and if the behavior with `armModel:false` is more to your liking, that is already a built-in A-Frame option. https://judicious-random.glitch.me seems fine on Oculus Go
(https://glitch.com/edit/#!/judicious-random?path=index.html:3:2)

If all the other 3DOF combinations apply native arm model, maybe we can default to `armModel:false`

 oh, I am wrong, armModel doesn't pass through `laser-controls`.  ewww.  will keep trying with that Glitch So the current state of https://judicious-random.glitch.me is coded for the Go only, and there is apparently no position provided when the arm model is disabled; the controller stays put in the floor. :-/  **Description:**

Using look-controls component on first load, I am able to swipe to change the y rotation of the camera. After enter vr is called, the rotation doesn't change with swipe anymore. Also when you exit vr the rotation doesn't change. The swipe functionality use to work in 0.7.1, regardless if you were in VR or not.

In look-controls.js, debugging shows that the touchmove handler is still firing, but it seems when you try to set the object3d rotation, it doesn't have any effect. 

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/429591a7d3034f471ea01c4232246aca0fb90b6b/src/components/look-controls.js#L198

```
    el.object3D.rotation.x = hmdEuler.x + pitchObject.rotation.x;
    el.object3D.rotation.y = hmdEuler.y + yawObject.rotation.y;
    el.object3D.rotation.z = 0;

```
 I believe in previous discussions, the typical use case is to apply an orientation offset, not to entirely override which would cause discomfort; currently three.js does not allow such an offset, which is why the recommendation is to use a wrapping entity for that purpose. Thanks for your reply @dmarcos. I agree, after entering vr the accelerometer should override any swipe to control the rotation. However, after exiting vr mode, I would imagine that the user regains swipe control, which doesn't seem to be the case.  I believe it is because the camera continues to ignore any programmatic changes to rotation.

In my scenario, I'm allowing x and y rotation through swipe, so the camera wrapper approach causes strange gimbal lock areas. @dmarcos I modified the look-controls component to implement x-axis rotation. But my tests were using the original look-controls component. 

In #3450, @ngokevin mentions "now threejs controls camera rotation in VR mode." Do you know where we can find that code? @dmarcos having the same issue on Sumsang S7, Huawei P9, XIaomi 6. look-controls no longer works after exit VR mode(works before entering VR mode). Tested with "Hello WebVR" example on Aframe.io.
Browser Chrome 66.0.3359.158
 I have the same issue on Samsung S8 ( Chrome 66.0.3359.158) with Aframe 0.8.2.
Accelerometer doesn't work before to enter on VR Mode
Swipe doesn't work after exit VR mode

Everything works with Aframe 0.7.1  Accelerometer works for me without entering VR on S8 with Samsung Internet, but not Chrome Yes, it works with Samsung Internet but not in Chrome Hello world example does not work... did not try the rest it’s the same (http or https)... it’s does not work.
I tried without iframe .
Anyway the accelerometer works when you Enter in VR @dmarcos 

> "When using a headset you want to honor the user head rotation or it will cause disconfort. It’s a design decision"

Could anyone point me to where this is being done in the code?

I'm trying to do swipe controls on mobile with a separate VR mode where device orientation then takes over.

To do this, I'm firstly removing the default look-controls on load, and then adding a different component to handle rotation which only uses touch/drag. (I'm using  removeAttribute, and setAtrribute to remove and add the components).

(I need look-controls on desktop, so I'm only doing the above on mobile)

That works fine initially, but on entering VR on mobile and then returning from VR,  then trying to do the same again as described above, it no longer works - instead the device rotation is controlling the camera rotation as would be expected from the default look-controls even though I've removed them on exit.

I'm trying on S7 Android. This problem only pertains to mobile, I've no problem on desktop.

I believe this is some way related to the issue above, but if anyone thinks this would be better posed as a a Stack Overflow question or a separate issue, let me know and I'll remove this and try that.

There's something happening in aframe when the device is returning from VR mode, but I can't find where or what is going on. 
  **Description:**
Images with transparency that are placed within a-camera will completely obstruct other images and objects placed elsewhere, only the skybox is shown through the transparent parts of an image and not other images.

This shows an image in the a-camera making parts of other objects invisible if they're within the transparent part of the image:

 Could you please send me an example so that I can check that, too? I also have S6 & Gear VR. What kind of example do you mean? A video example? If so, it gets stuck even in the "aframe video example" online, provided in the docs page. There was an issue with viewing WebVR videos in Oculus Browser 4.4.0, which was fixed in 4.4.1. Does this issue still persist if you update the browser? @dmliao  thx for the advice, it's working now :)   **Description:**
Add `blending` property to Aframe Material component
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3502

**Changes proposed:**
- Add blending prop to Material component
- Add test

====

I think I've done this right. There's one thing I didn't understand though. If anyone could clarify it would help my understanding of the code.

As i understand it these lines are checking if certain props change, and if they do, we set `needsUpdate` to true
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/material.js#L127

As explained in the threejs docs this is only needed for certain properties: (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/25f4534a5609f55a9d13cff47b1e535b4b109659/docs/manual/introduction/How-to-update-things.html#L175)
 and blending is not one of these.

My question is that I noticed (when writing the tests) that `material.needsUpdate` was true after setting the material.blending attribute. Why is this? I thought it would only be true if we manually set it when we want to trigger a re-render in webGL because e.g. vertex-colors changed.

Thanks Ah yes! Sure will do

 @ngokevin line added to docs. thanks Thanks @samrae7! My hero! :) +1  https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/ROADMAP.md  Originally orientation offset was for vive-tracker, did we want to put that back in now? Wait, I thought rotation offset was for hand-controls - if you changed hand-controls to use orientationOffset should be fine though Shouldn't the orientation Euler be applied in order YXZ like elsewhere in A-Frame?  **Description:**

  I just created a function to enable Oculus Go detection.

Opened up a pull-request here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3685

This has been merged.  It would be useful to get the new intersection position of the ray in the same intersected object among frames.

For example: imagine a single plane for a wall, and the user has a laser sabre in his hand, and we want to show the burn in the wall as he hits and moves the sabre on the wall. 

Right now this is impossible with current `raycaster`, because we only get one event `raycaster-intersected` on the first intersection, but on next frames we don't get any more events because the intersected object is the same as in the previous frames. It would be cool to have a `raycaster.getCurrentIntersection(obj)` to get the intersection data on that object *in current frame*.

Performance would not suffer too much, since right now `intersectObjects` is called with all raycastable objects. It would be just a matter of updating the new intersection data. (This behaviour could be enabled/disabled with a parameter in the component, too)

  Per discussion on Slack:

In version 0.8.x, `look-controls` was changed to ignore the `rotation` component and directly override `object3d.rotation` -- which appears to have broken some use cases.

This PR modifies `updateOrientation()` in `look-controls` to also take into account the value of the `rotation` component, if present. @ngokevin is that a theoretical concern, or a finding from using supermedium?  Agreed obviously that if it doesn't work in VR then an alternative implementation is needed Ok makes sense to close until we can get accommodation in Three   The trigger on a Cardboard V2 causes a screen touch, so it's common to listen for an click on the scene element or window.  This changes prevents a tap on the a-enter-vr button from propagating to the scene and window, so the other listener doesn't have to disentangle an "enter vr" tap from the Cardboard button.

On Android 7.1.2 (LineageOS Guava) all objects are displayed in solid black color. Tested with different browsers (Mozilla and Firefox).
Tested on a Motorolla Moto G3. The same device works fine with Android 6 and the problem appears
once it switches to the latest updates of LineageOS 7.1.2.

The problem does not exist on Android 5 and 6.

 I don't think this is specific LineageOS -- I'm seeing this using Chrome 66.0.3359.158 with LG's stock Android 7.0  (version M21010v; January 1, 2018 security update) with on both my LG Aristo (LG-M210) and my LG Fiesta (LG L63BL)

Edit: Looks like the same issue is reported here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48156560/all-shapes-entities-showing-up-as-black-in-a-frame-scenes 
@gabrielgrant It is not browser specific as well, because I tried with the default Android browser, Firefox and a beta version of Chrome.

@dmarcos It is not specific to the device, because I have two completely identical  Motorolla Moto G3 handsets (well, the only difference between them is their color - white and black). One is running LineageOS 7.1.2 and one is running stock Android 6.0.1. The one, equipped with 6.0.1 version renders correctly. The "blacked objects" issue appears only on the LineageOS-equipped handset. Yet, as far as I remember, first my code ran fine on that handset as well and the problem appeared after one of the updates.

 @dmarcos The only errors I see are are two instances of `Failed to recalculate device parameters.` being logged out

This is coming from here:

This seems to be (trying) to load some sort of device parameters from https://dpdb.webvr.rocks/dpdb.json and isn't finding an entry for this device (my device's model number -- LG-M210 -- does not appear in that database). I'm not sure what these parameters are used for, but if this is actually the problem, it seems like this might explain why it is device-specific (though not, afaict, why it would be Android-version specific: the User-Agent string only seems to be matched against device ID). 

![screenshot from 2018-05-24 02 09 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/493968/40476324-9e734486-5ef8-11e8-84c5-61b8f937a97c.png)


This DB's info seems to mostly be about display size, though. AFAICS the canvas, at least, seems to be getting set up correctly, so it's totally possible this is a red herring. OTOH it's also possible the black models are coming from some problem with a texture buffer being improperly allocated (perhaps because of this exact missing resolution info).

In either case, I'm a bit out of my depth. Looks like both you and @ngokevin are in the bay area. I'm in SF too and have several of these devices for testing. I'd be happy to get you one of them, or can just supply you with more info if that's easier.
 @dmarcos no, it does not render the graphic object at all.

 Hmmm...it certainly isn't a problem with all WebGL texturing, though -- https://fltr.world/ (simple texture demo implemented with three.js shaders) works fine, as does https://webglsamples.org/aquarium/aquarium.html

As for https://threejs.org/docs/scenes/material-browser.html#MeshStandardMaterial -- it doesn't work with the default settings (colored material), but changing the material to have an emissive color seems to work fine so to clarify: you don't think that device parameter DB issue is related, right? @dmarcos Yup, was just in the process of searching their issue tracker for anything related before doing so :) Makes sense, just wanted to confirm if it doesn't ruin the experience, maybe you could try different shader
like `flat` as a workaround?  (`material="shader:flat"`)

 Filed here: mrdoob/three.js#14137 @machenmusik thanks, should have thought of using other non-flat shaders. Tried a few and posted the results here: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/14137#issuecomment-391880854

In particular, MeshLambertMaterial seems like a good alternative. Are all the default three.js materials already registered in A-frame? I only see "standard" and "flat" mentioned on the material page: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/components/material.md (I know this isn't really the appropriate venue for that question, but seems like useful context to have here for people trying to work around this issue) I think only standard and flat are built in at the moment.  But @dmarcos @ngokevin @donmccurdy is there any particular reason?  Request for Lambert sounds reasonable, for example... And THREE includes all of them either way. Nope: 
`<a-entity geometry="primitive: box" material="flatShading: true; color: blue"></a-entity>` just renders as black

`<a-entity geometry="primitive: box" material="shader: flat; color: blue"></a-entity>` renders as blue, but (obviously) flat @dmarcos yes, that certainly sounds like the issue is a problem with the shader using something unsupported. Though if it is, in fact, the same problem as the previously-closed related issue, it doesn't sound particularly specific to any given device: we have repros on 15 different devices from 7 manufacturers, and @EerikKivistik [says they "are getting a few hundred reports a week from our users"](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/12679#issuecomment-380071840)

My guess is the issue is something to do with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425/Adreno 308 GPU -- I believe that's the (extremely common) low-/mid-range chip used in most (all?) of the devices reporting this issue (as well as most other common low-/mid-range Android devices available in the market these days) @teodorg would you be able to confirm that the two test cases we've isolated in [the three.js issue](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/14137#issuecomment-396514995) are reproducible on your Moto G3?

(note: the second issue causes the phone to crash completely and hard-restart, so make sure you don't have anything important open that you'll lose, and I'd recommend testing it in an incognito tab to avoid getting stuck in [the same restart loop I did](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/14137#issuecomment-396348889))

https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=851870
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=851873 FWIW it seems this issue is specific to high precision, and so is avoidable in three.js by forcing rendering with `mediump`. Is there any way to do that in AFrame? @gabrielgrant I sent out test builds to some of our users who are having this issue and will report back if "mediump" solves the problem out in the wild. Any ideas on how to detect devices that need to be forced to "mediump" that does not involve doing an offscreen canvas render test on startup? @gabrielgrant So far, all the Android 7.0+ devices are rendering on "mediump" with the expected artifacts, but at least materials work. As for older devices running Android 5.0, it seems to make no difference, with everything still rendering completely black. @EerikKivistik Oh, interesting -- didn't know this issue affected anything earlier than Android 7.0

In terms of detecting affected devices -- that depends on whether you want to actually test for the failure, or just check for devices that are known to exhibit the issue. AFAIK this fails on devices if, and only if, they have an Adreno 308 GPU.

I think you need to create a canvas to get the webgl context, but i think once you have that canvas, you should be able to do detection on the device params without actually having to render anything. Something like this should do the trick:

```
let canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
let gl = canvas.getContext('webgl');
let dbgRenderInfo = gl.getExtension("WEBGL_debug_renderer_info");
let unmaskedRenderer = gl.getParameter(dbgRenderInfo.UNMASKED_RENDERER_WEBGL);
let unmaskedVendor = gl.getParameter(dbgRenderInfo.UNMASKED_VENDOR_WEBGL);
```
My devices report the vendor as `Qualcomm` and the renderer as `Adreno (TM) 308`:  https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/14137#issuecomment-392877172

but I don't know if that is the case for all affected devices. So actually testing the feature is probably safer.

What is the specific rendering test you're using? If you have access to (or have users who have) other affected devices and are able to test, it would be useful to know whether these params (and others; screenshots from webglreport.com would be awesome) are consistent @EerikKivistik Looking back at [your original list of devices on which you'd seen the failure](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/12679#issuecomment-375980801), they were all Android 7+ (except for the one Android 4.4 device, that i assumed was probably a red herring). Are there other devices you know of now that weren't listed there?

Also curious what artifacts you're seeing? There was some @bhouston had said he thought they "fixed the majority of the issues" with `mediump`: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/14137#issuecomment-396390858

Edit: actually, looking again, he links to a number of still-unfixed precision issues here: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/14137#issuecomment-396562870 @gabrielgrant One example I recently discovered is XiaoMi MiPad 2 (Android version 5.1). The medium precision workaround has no effect there.  

As for the artifacts I will include a screenshot taken from an Android 7.0 device.
![screenshot_2018-06-14-22-55-57-765_com android browser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5612934/41525396-8407ffd8-72e9-11e8-8524-38f456258801.png)

 @EerikKivistik it seems the XiaoMi MiPad 2 has an Intel Atom X5-Z8500 (with an Intel HD Graphics GPU), whereas this issue appears to be specific to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425, so it sounds like the issue(s) you're seeing with older devices is/are likely some other problem(s) that just happens to have the same symptom. May want to open another issue about those devices (probably against three.js rather than aframe). And in any case, probably best to continue this discussion in https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/14137 I think this issue is complex and what we need is a set of reproduction cases that we add as three.js examples - maybe webgl_material_precision_varants.html.  It would be the same shader but with highp and mediump in the same scene right beside each other.  Maybe modify the weblg_materials_physical_varants.html to do this.

Maybe even use the webgl debug API to get the GPU name and also display the browser string and display it on screen.  Then eveyone can screenshot their devices once and you can see the GPU, the OS version, the browser version and also whether it works with mediump and/or highp.

I think this is a complex problem and we need to approach it systematically. WE here at Exocortex/Clara.io have more than 25 mobile devices.  Once we have a consistent test bed, we can test on each device and share a screenshot.  If everyone else does this we can likely pinpoint the issues and we can then work to fix them in a systematic way.

The trick is that each error should be reproducible at once in a single example without modifying any DAT-GUI settings.  Thus we only need a single screenshot for each device to know exactly where it stands with regards to bugs.

We do not even have to wait for this to be in the next release, we can use rawgit to view the example in either a PR state or once it is merged into master.  related to https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3519#issuecomment-378822221

 maybe there is a three Release r92 soon? https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Migration-Guide  @dmarcos  i still have the problem on codesandbox.io with the github:supermedium/three.js#r90fixPoseAndRaycaster on 0.8.x  (filesize problem) 0.7.x works fine 
i ask the codesandbox dev to solve this, but they think aframe should fix this 
 @dmarcos  sure, the only idea was to have this,  working in the point release ...  how can i add this to  https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/milestone/8 ? with commit https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/d5bb456c9a23b955b157b671cd5f5d08daea85e2 
 i think this can be closed 
  Currently, laser-controls uses trackpad button for both Daydream (which has no trigger) and for GearVR.  However, the GearVR controller does have a trigger, and A-Frame should use that by default for consistency with native usage.

For example, at the moment one uses the trigger to click the enter VR button when on an A-Frame laser-controls page in Oculus Browser on GearVR, but then one needs to start using the trackpad instead once in VR, which seems / feels odd. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/laser-controls.js#L73 "help wanted" you mean test it on GearVR? @dmarcos  I have GearVR with controller, what should i change in my code to test this? I think "help wanted" means looking for folks to submit the fix as a pull request to this A-Frame source code repository... and "(easy)" means the required change is simple / straightforward so it is ideal for first-time participants.

Basically, just need to make the GearVR line mentioned above that specifies trackpad down and up
look like the other lines that specify trigger down and up instead. Thank you so much for explaining @machenmusik  done :) hopefully i did it correctly sure @dmarcos that's a great idea. although it's my 4th contribution on github ever :) many thanks @payamspot for your patience and understanding! The trackpad on the Controller corresponds to the trackpad on the headset. Has this been tested to ensure users with only a headset can still use laser-controls, with the trackpad button? I am not sure that would have worked in the first place actually, unless you have both controller and trackpad, since the GearVR trackpad on the side of the headset does not have a pose, and therefore will not be utilized by `tracked-controls` which `laser-controls` builds upon... The description of laser-controls implies that it downgrades to a gaze cursor when no 3DOF or 6DOF controller is available. However, you're right, it does not actually do so. :-(

Proceed! I'd like to warn, that Right Trigger AND Touchpad on the Gear VR controller map to the same thing. For this reason we would expect that if using laser-controls either input would be allowed. We originally did not want the trigger to be activation because we wanted it to be grab, but its like a 50/50 split as to whether or not people use the touchpad or Trigger when activating something, so we wound up just mapping both to the same action and giving up on having the extra button be used for something else. Thanks @DigiTec - so for native consistency it should have both sets of events rather than one or the other

  The new RS4 update for HoloLens enables WebVR in Edge, but Aframe does not correctly present immersive view. The basic three.js examples such as "cubes" (https://threejs.org/examples/webvr_cubes.html) work on HoloLens, however Aframe 8.0 examples enter full screen click/drag mode instead of vr presentation. With Aframe 7.0, "Enter VR" button does nothing in Hololens.

- A-Frame Version: 8.0
- Platform / Device: HoloLens Edge Browser
- Reproducible with basic Aframe 8.0 example: https://aframe.glitch.me/

 I am closing this issue; Aframe works correctly once the "Enable WebVR" experimental flag is checked in Edge for HoloLens under "about:flags." WebVR is not an experimental feature for Windows 10 desktop Edge browser so I forgot to check this. Is it by design of the hololens that there is no click event in immersive view? If there is a possibility to click can you please document that? I was unable to figure this out yet.

Thanks @DominicBoettger I haven't been able to figure out the click event, but I did receive the following information from a Microsoft contact: 

> Currently both spatial controllers (for the WinMR on Desktop case) and hands (for HoloLens) are exposed via the standard W3C gamepad spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/  
Here is documentation on how to use the gamepad API with WebVR:

With regards to HoloLens – you will be able to listen to gamepadconnected and gamepaddisconnected events, and check the button pressed state (on HoloLens – the select action via finger tap will come through as a button pressed state at index 1). This is similar to what you’ll have available with the HoloLens clicker. Wow. Thanks a lot!
I will test this next week. Very interesting!
  Modify oculus-touch-controls to accommodate current model and semi-recent browser / SDK behavioral changes in Touch controller pose.  See discussion in #2965.

Note that the model pose changes are made conditionally to the default Touch model only, and that the positional offset are not exactly perfect still, but IMO slightly better aligned with real-life than previous suggestions.
 (Could use some additional opinions on the pose offsets...) I previously left the pivot offset in there in case others tried it and determined that pivot offset of zero was wrong - I am interpreting the comments as if you've tried it and it looks fine, thus removed that stuff now.

UPDATE: got a chance to check, and the traversal is in fact necessary.  For example, in laser-controls example, the element's Object3D has two children, a Line (for the laser, presumably) and a Group... which implies that other components could pile on in there, and we want to make sure we only rotate the specific model in question.

TL;DR I think we're down to minimal fix at the moment.  This makes it hard to disambiguate between a situation where you just have one GearVR controller vs. whether you have two Oculus Touch controllers. However it could be desirable behavior since it'll make sure a lot of GearVR-oriented experiences work with Oculus Touch. Maybe this should be an explicit option?

 :+1: looks good to me. Thanks having some sort of latest-stable tag might be useful here I agree with that, but the original comment was that they were useful for catching breakage / incompatibilities between versions, meaning the desire was in fact to see the breakage as canary.  I suppose there is the question of whether examples to be copied as you suggest should be moved to glitch or similar in general, and those should be locked to versions as they usually are now.  Relative path would probably work fine for example folders actually, like https://aframe.io/0.8.0/aframe/examples/animation/aframe-logo/  https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/videosphere/

same using A-Frame Version: 0.6.1 (Date 19-07-2017, Commit #a4b91bc)
  **Description:** When applying multiple sound components to an entity (e.g., `sound__click`), there doesn't seem to be an obvious way (or possibly any way) to identify the sound component's `name` and/or `id` (e.g., `sound__click` and `click`, respectively).

This makes listening for the `sound-loaded` and `sound-ended` events somewhat ineffective as the source component and audio are unknown.

 Sounds good, @koganei. I only mentioned `e.target` because I couldn't figure for the life of me how to access that data. `e.detail` definitely seems more appropriate. Thanks.  Hi,
I have the 2d images with different frames. Can i use this library to show the rotation of objects with the frame? if not then how can i change my 2d image for this library to show the rotation. Please help asap. Thanks in advance.   Here is my code 

`<a-scene>
    <a-camera position="0 0 10" cursor-visible="false"></a-camera>
    <a-entity geometry="primitive: sphere;
                radius: 100;
                segmentsWidth: 64;
                segmentsHeight: 64;"
        material="shader: flat; src:#image;"
        scale="-1 1 1" side="double" opacity=".5">
    </a-entity>
</a-scene>`

With A-Frame v 0.8.0 the img materiel is rendered outside the sphere, I tried using side property to change it to inside but never worked. With the same code without using side attribute the materiel is rendered as expected inside the sphere with 0.7.1  Threejs' Material class has the `blending` property which is really useful for faking materials that emit light or other effects. (For example, see the disco lights in [saturday night](https://aframe.io/a-saturday-night))

https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/Material.blending

It would be nice to have it available in A-Frame material directly, without having to make a custom component just for changing its value. I would like to have a crack at this. As far as I can see it just means creating a `blending` component that passes the property to three.js in the sme way that e.g. the position component works. Does that make sense? Thanks  @donmccurdy yup, that is exactly what I was asking for :) @donmccurdy @feiss thanks. I'm working on this. Seems straightforward so will be done soon. thanks!    **Description:**

  I think I am running 7. I will try on 8 and see if it works differently. I would love to show you a demo, but I have managed to create a rather fragmented node project that I don't know how to share without giving you 153 MB worth of files. Forgive me. I'm still super new at this. I can send you just the html file if that helps?  As seen in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/shaders/standard.js , the default value for metalness is 0, not 0.5  **Description:**
As described on #3449 if you want to build project which depends on aframe it fails because of ES6 syntax on `aframe-master.js:75038`. This code comes from `a-register-element.js:62`

**Changes proposed:**
I have changed for..of loop:
```javascript
for (var propName of Object.getOwnPropertyNames(newObj.prototype)){}
```
to forEach function call:
```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(newObj.prototype).forEach(function(propName){})
```
 `npm run test:firefox -- --single-run` crashes for me also on master branch without any changes Yeah, I ran into that while doing #3489 as well.  Maybe you can try forcing an empty commit to get it to try again? yay tests passed  On 0.8.0 the `vive-controls` component no longer works. The controllers are not present on the scene. Code (tested on Nightly 60 with HTC vive):

```html
<a-entity vive-controls="hand: left"></a-entity>
<a-entity vive-controls="hand: right"></a-entity>
```

Thanks! I am also experiencing this same error—controllers are active (events fire) but models are not visible on screen. The suggested changes to Three.js in #3441 do not fix the error. I found instead that by saving the object models locally and manually attaching them to the controllers is the only way to get them to appear. try super-hands!  **Description:**

I'm experiencing an issue with the node package. It keeps freezing when I run `npm install aframe`. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19154356/37822071-15ecd464-2e8e-11e8-9e12-97eb4e614327.png)

Any advice?
 Are you sure it doesn't simply take time to download the dependencies? I noticed several weeks ago that the git version of three that aframe currently use took time to download. You can look at the running processes to see if you have a git command. `ps aux|grep git` on linux, on Windows I don't know. Thank you @vincentfretin the internet at my office is rather slow so will try again at home tonight where I have a much faster line.  Hi,

Earlier on I was having the same freezing issue. I cleared the npm cache and deleted the node_modules folder and was having the same issue afterwards.

In trying to screencap the issue the behaviour changed and I'm now receiving this error

It seems like the frustum used for frustum culling isn't set right? In VR mode, no matter where I turn my head, I always see objects flicking in and out of existence along the right edge of my field of view. (The example I've linked is a room built out of individual colored tiles, to show the problem clearly.) ah, fair enough!

Probably worth leaving open here too until it's resolved there and pulled in (if only for the next person to come along and try to report it here) actually wait, I just realised, it looks like that thread says the issue is fixed in r91? When is A-Frame planning on targeting that version? Very noticeable after upgrading to A-Frame 0.8.x. Going back to 0.7.x not really an option either, as VR has become very unstable in the newest version of Firefox with 0.7.x. Anything I can do to help move this forward? I've looked into this, and the offending line of code is https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/renderers/webvr/WebVRManager.js#L195.

Fixing this seem be stuck on the WebXR API exposing a combined frustum for both eyes, as described in https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/203. However, this issue has seen no activity for nearly a year.

I think this is too big of an issue to just wait for something to happen in the WebXR API, which Three.js can then adapt to the benefit of A-Frame. I don't know enough about frustum calculations, but if I did I would submit a PR to Three.js that applied a combined frustum of both eyes at least until it can be fixed in the WebXR API.

Anyone know how to do this?  **Description:**

I have a scene where I'm using a second camera that draws a separate scene into its own WebGLRenderTarget, to make a live flat texture in my scene with GLSL. The scene works perfectly in 2D mode; the big circle accumulates spots forever, in a way that has nothing to do with where the viewer is standing.

However, the moment that I enter VR, the second scene's camera starts following the user's head just like the main camera is. (The big circle will likely immediately become the color of the second scene's clear color, and if you wiggle your head around just right, you can eventually get a distorted view of the surface that the shader is running on.) 

Is there something I'm meant to do to indicate to A-Frame that a secondary camera is not meant to be driven by the user's head in VR mode? That works around it perfectly! Thanks so much!

(Unsure whether I should close the issue now, or leave it open until the workaround isn't needed? Up to you.)  The use case is as follow:

There are multiple objects in the scene some partially hidden. If click events have been placed on all objects, one would expect that the front-most object picks up the click. However, in `0.8.0` this was not happening consistently. When I tried on glitch with a simple 2 objects, it works. But when there are say 10-15 objects it at times picks up and at times fails.

However, changing the aframe ver to `0.7.1` always picks the front-most object.  **Description:**

 If I use the same code in the version 0.7.1 the joystick works. If you for example click without glasses the button icon to go to VR you will see that after if you try to move the camera touching it doesn't work with 0.8.1 but it works in 0.7.1. The joystick just rotate it. FYI -- I ran into something on another experiment where previous code that directly manipulated the camera Object3D rotation don't work anymore with look-controls in 0.8.x, because look-controls now uses its own internal pitchObject and yawObject and overwrites the Object3D... so whatever code the joystick was previously using may need to modify the pitchObject and yawObject rotation instead snippet from relevant tick handler:
```
tick: function (t, dt) {
    if (!this.data.enabled) { return; }
    // With latest master, it is recommended to manipulate object3D rotation directly.
    var rotation = this.el.object3D.rotation;
    // FIX: with A-Frame 0.8.x, need to modify pitchObject and yawObject of look-controls, if present.
    var lookControls = this.el.components['look-controls'];
    if (lookControls) { rotation = lookControls.pitchObject.rotation; }
    if (!rotation) { return; }
    if (this.directionX || this.directionY) {
      // Remember, object3D rotation is in radians!
      rotation.x += this.data.dx * THREE.Math.DEG2RAD * this.directionY;
      if (lookControls) { rotation = lookControls.yawObject.rotation; }
      rotation.y += this.data.dy * THREE.Math.DEG2RAD * this.directionX;
    }
  }
``` @machenmusik then is it a bug to fix or I have to implement the above code? sorry but I don't understand very well, it is right that I'm really beginner with this library. None of us have the hardware you do, so part of the complication here is that we don't understand the mechanism that was working previously, but no longer does with 0.8.x - if it was using aframe-extras, I don't think @donmccurdy has updated for 0.8.x, so that is expected; if it was using some other component that directly modified rotation, at present that needs modifications similar to what is posted above.  (Plain A-Frame does not, to my understanding, support joystick input without other components, so not sure if that hardware is generating other events when the joystick moves, for example...) Then in my case I will continue to use the 0.7.1 version until aframe-extra is updated. If I have time I will look into the commits if I can understand which changes broke it. If I discover then I will create a PR OK - then perhaps the right thing to do here is to create an issue in aframe-extras repository referencing this one, then close this one here and await resolution from aframe-extras. @machenmusik this is not regarding with aframe-extras, in the version 0.7.1 it works without use aframes-extra.
@donmccurdy I have to test aframe-extra if my joystick works and I can move around the scenery, it would be great :+1:     **Description:**

i already tried another alternatives but it's resulting impossible to me


  A typed array is no longer passed correctly to a component when setting a property in version 0.8. 

In version 0.7 for  schema: { vert: {type: 'array', default: []} }

console.log(this.data.vert) resulted in:

Float32Array [ 0.058115072548389435, 1.987938124548116e-20, ...

if the incoming array was a typed array. In version 0.8  this same sequence results in :

Object [ 0.058115072548389435, 1.987938124548116e-20, ...

Will this be the default behavior going forward? Passing in typed arrays made the creation of buffer geometry more convenient. 


 I had only been setting the array via a setAttribute call. While not a huge
deal to recast/recreate the typed array it seems unnecessarily waste full
for large arrays like I am passing in (I am dynamically creating complex
buffer geometries).  Adding a custom property definition such as,
"arrayTyped", would probably be a good solution.

I assume this issue is related to issue [#3458](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3458) but instead of the camera moving slowly it moves far too quickly.

Here is a video showing the issue, the video was recorded with the phone held with stable hands.

- A-Frame Version: 0.8.0
- Platform / Device: Chrome Beta 66 / Oneplus 5 (Android 8.0.0)
 Updating to the latest A-Frame contains an updated webvr-polyfill which fixes these issues -- not sure what A-Frame release contains these changes, though (but introduced after 0.8.0) Any idea when this will be solved? Thanks in advance. yeah, m65 will be replaced with m66 soon and polyfill has been updated with all issues Thanks man! It works 👍 . @dmarcos Is there any way to modify web-polyfill to newest version in Aframe 0.5.0? Since I have already built an large AFrame project with 0.5.0, a lot of thing need to change if i swap to new version of aframe. Thanks in advance. I am using A-frame 0.6.1. How can I fix this without updating to 0.8.0.  What @ngokevin said is the only way, using the 0.6.1 tag:

> You can try to build yourself. Clone the repo, checkout v0.5.0 tag, update package.json, npm run dist. YMMV I've been away for a while from A-Frame. Wanted to test some of my older experiments, but saw this issue. I went to the homepage of A-Frame and noticed the same issue with some of the examples there.
Using Chrome on a new ZTE Axon 7. I noticed this on my Samsung s8 + last night. Aframe .8.2 and chrome m66.  You can modify the web-vr at previous version of Aframe (just need to add a
if condition). Look at the source code of the latest web vr, search keyword
'chrome'. It has a variable corresponding to version of chrome.

 Hi @ngokevin I am beginner in git. Do you have a video instruction on how to make my own build like what you commented on May 3. Thank you.  The DayDream controls were missing menu and system button tests to make sure that they get remapped and reemitted properly given their remapped names.

Additionally was able to fix up the trackpadchanged to use the deep object check for event state and then copy this across the two new tests.

Found one test that had a leading space in the description, fixed and then changed one assert.ok -> assert.fail which is more appropriate given the context.  This change delinks these event streams so that they can fire independenty of one another. I've also added a sufficiently complete number of tests for the new behaior to make sure all events that should be firing are, looking for negative events (ensuring some events don't fire when they should not) and that the values all come through as expected.

As part of the fix I've supplied some helpers that are now consistently used in tracked-controls.test.js for verifying individual events and streams of events in a more concise way to avoid duplicating a lot of code.

I've also made consistent the use of sinon's spy asserts, which were previously using the ".called" property which reaches into the abstraction further than it should. This also allows us to upgrade certain spy verification's to look for a specific number of calls (calledOnce) which is an overall improvement.

This change cascaded into the oculus-touch-controls.test.js and gearvr-controls.test.js as well. For the oculus-touch-controls, this is mostly assert fixups, but also does some additional deep object verification.

For the gearvr-controls.test.js this included some bug fixes (using wrong event names) when I was trying to make the test fail and could not, only to realize it wasn't sniffing for the right event names. This is in preparation for creation of the oculus-go-controls component and test suite.

- A-Frame Version: v0.8.0
- Platform / Device: Android
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: 

in the last version it does not work
 When not in VR mode, that is. While in VR, everything works perfectly. The issue is made worse by the look-controls touch mode not allowing vertical rotation, thus making zenith and nadir areas inaccessible on Android devices while not in VR.  In my case, in VR mode in Chrome only the gyroscope works vertically.   The standard `setAttribute()` function on DOM elements is defined to accept a string for both the attribute name and value. A-Frame breaks this standard by allowing the value passed in to be an arbitrary object. 

This could be brushed away as inconsequential, except Elm's fantastic HTML library and virtual DOM expects attributes to be strings, and thus offers no way to take advantage of A-Frame's more efficient object-passing approach.

Browsers provide another interface to set attributes: through JS properties. Mutating A-Frame components this way would change the interface from:
`entity.setAttribute('position', {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3})`

to:
`entity.position = {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}`

Apart from it being more concise and maintaining consistency with regular HTML, adding such an interface would enable object assignment to be used in Elm, since Elm provides a means to specify DOM element properties.

This interface to set properties might also provide the opportunity to alleviate some of the overhead associated with the current `setAttribute()`. Thanks for the responses. I think I need to clarify further: Elm is its own programming language, and you can't write JavaScript as part of an Elm program. For manipulating web pages, Elm provides bindings to the DOM API. Since A-Frame is supposed to be HTML-based, we should be able to use it solely through the DOM API. And we can, if we use the standard string-based `setAttribute()` function that is part of the API. Apart from this being clunky to use programmatically, stringifying every value and having A-Frame immediately parse it again adds unnecessary overhead to every call. This is why A-Frame provides other overloads of `setAttribute()`.

However, the overloads defined by A-Frame are not part of the DOM API: Elm doesn't know these overloads exist, and provides no way to call them. A different approach to setting attributes that _is_ part of the API is DOM element properties. DOM element properties are not defined to be solely strings, and so we are allowed to assign arbitrary objects. Elm consequently provides a mechanism to set both standard properties and custom ("[expando](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Expando)") properties.

In the case of the example given above, `object3D` is an expando property:
`entityEl.object3D.position.x = 5;`

Unfortunately this is a direct exposure of a Three.js object, and thus I can't create my own "object3D" or my own "position" to assign as a property without using Three.js constructors. I can only mutate the objects that currently exist.

However, I can already assign my own position using the attribute-based interface:
`entity.setAttribute('position', {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3})`

The equivalent functionality I'm proposing is to use standard DOM API properties to achieve this direct value assignment without breaking the HTML/DOM-based abstraction that A-Frame champions:
`entity.position = {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}`

...where `position` is an expando property backed by a [setter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) that redirects the assigned object to the same place `setAttribute()` does.

If the objects assigned via this property interface remain Plain Old Data as attributes currently are, then this solution will work really well with Elm, and of course JS too. If there’s a reason why this API is not reasonable, then that’s fine. But
you don’t seemed to have justified why you couldn’t use properties.

 @ngokevin I'm also interested in why this wouldn't be possible.

Elm isn't built for just the 2D web; there's even [a WebGL package for Elm](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/webgl/latest). 

Elm's killer feature is its declarative app architecture which lets you map Model -> View without the usual mess of glue code. Elm's declarative app architecture paired with A-Frame's rock-solid VR and WebGL abstractions would be **insanely cool**. The cherry on top is that A-Frame is already *declarative* and *DOM-based*, which means Elm is tantalizingly close to working with A-Frame *out of the box* ([and kind of did up to 412d162](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3460)).

Their names even pun together ;) It would be an absolute tragedy if Elm and A-Frame couldn't play well together.

PS: Thanks for creating A-Frame. It's awesome by itself! @ngokevin I also want to support this, Elm provides a wonderful way for building complex, interactive A-Frame scenes and it feels extremely natural to use the combination of the two. It would be great if this would work again.  Correct handling of post processing when using three's internal webvr support
 @dmarcos I redid the PR cause the rebase didn't went well  **Description:**

The example code should be placing objects so that they appear to be at the location clicked.

The intersection location given seems to have something to do with the location of the last object to have a `mouseleave` event, as if you set `raycaster: "objects: a-sky"` then the location never changes.  **Description:**

 @tomegz what rate does this website report for you on that device? http://deviceorientation-rate.glitch.me Related: #3458  @jsantell it oscillates around 15.0 @tomegz that's unfortunately an issue in Chromium 65 -- there may be a patch before the next release, and I've noticed sometimes after restarting Chrome I'm able to get 55hz; other times, around 10.

Chromium bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=819413 @jsantell the camera is moving even if I'm not moving the device at all, is that caused by this exact bug? @tomegz there are [two issues](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill/releases/tag/v0.10.3) with Chrome m65, one with devicemotion events lacking rotationRate requiring a deviceorientation fallback in the polyfill for only m65, and another of low rate of updates (~10hz) for both events  2 minor changes
**Changes proposed:**
- default camera height changed to 1.6
- table cells format corrected
  A-frame is not cleaning up after itself when it is removed from the DOM. And as far as I can tell there is no API to destroy the scene manually?

I'm using an embeded a-frame scene in a nuxtjs spa and have noticed when I navigate to different page components the requestAnimationFrame continues to fire (there's also a memory leak I can't figure out but that is a separate issue).

 In case it's useful for anybody [here is a component](https://gist.github.com/homerjam/56bddc8979e958af2ce0cda03903a185) I'm using to help with renderer management/performance in my use case. Indeed - but in my (overcomplicated) use case I'm manipulating the scene with events from the parent page/window, running this all through postmessage would be a real headache!

For some reason, using `setAttribute`  will no longer allow me to programmatically rotate the camera via a component's `init`.

Please view the glitch above, view the non-working example, then uncomment the 0.7.1 CDN version to see it work.

I've scoured the API, but can't see any updates to method signatures or the like for this version. This is hard to manage dynamically for no particular benefit that I can see.

Particularly if you're setting camera positions based on HMDs connected, mobile or desktop because now initial rotation needs to be managed on a parent entity, but initial position needs to be managed on the camera (else I get offset problems). It's also difficult to manage inside the Inspector if you want to make quick adjustments.

Also breaks some contrib modules I'm using (camera fence, travel-node). Is there any other way around it? Trying to avoid long churn on upgrading an existing experience.


 I understand the reasons now, however, this doesn't really help with my particular situation unless I'm missing something in those comments.

For instance, to restore basic camera fencing capability, I now need to figure out some way to merge the 'camera rig' angle with the room angle so it makes sense for the user. Unfortunate as I don't particularly have time to wait for contribs to be updated.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/236984/37690723-095b0ef2-2d01-11e8-89d9-33e27eb02042.png)

Can I suggest documenting this change so others don't proceed down the v0.8.x route without understanding the breaking changes for existing projects?





 The look-at component / billboarding is also broken by this change. Anything that requires access to or polling the camera rotation. Is there a way to easily calculate the difference in angle between the parent entity and the camera object? see https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3484#issuecomment-375425307 @donmccurdy Yeah, I'm talking about effectively billboarding, where an entity orients to face the camera. I know that's a common enough feature used in VR experiences. 

It's broken in 0.8 with this change, but I think I've solved it with some quaternion math (which I'm a novice in). 

e.g: in the tick function of the element I need to face the camera, I did this:
```javascript
let q = new THREE.Quaternion().multiplyQuaternions(self.camera.object3D.quaternion, self.cameraRig.object3D.quaternion)
return this.el.object3D.quaternion.copy( q )
```

Probably a bit of a stretch to ask non-devs to discover if they are starting on v0.8 and install an updated `look-at` contrib or other contrib that requires camera rotation, but I'm not sure how to handle that.

AFrame doesn't use the gyros anymore, and behaves as the non-gyro-equipped phones.
It impacts every Android app using Cordova (the webview is based on Chrome) I checked the master, and the #3453 fixes in part the issue.
**Now, the camera have a low refresh rate.**
It's linked to an issue of Chromium : https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=819413&desc=3

**Moreover, the VR view is and moves in the wrong way when using aframe master and Chrome 65.0.3325.109.**
It's OK with the old version of Chrome and aframe master. More information on the workarounds and Chrome regressions can be found in the polyfill's [v0.10.3](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill/releases/tag/v0.10.3) release notes @jeanmatthieud the camera moving the wrong way, is this only when you start in landscape? I believe https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3466 will fix this if that's the issue you're running into No, it's not fixed. What's the result? If it's stuttering on rotation updates, that's a [platform regression on Chrome m65](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill/releases/tag/v0.10.3) and not much we can do to fix in JS land. It's stuck on some random axis, and mobile device movement doesn't do anything anymore on Android Chrome. @dirkk0 what version of the polyfill (or commit of A-Frame build) is being used on that site? @jsantell thanks for looking into this!
it was:
//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/aframe/0.7.1/aframe.min.js
and is now:
//rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/4d90df5/dist/aframe-master.min.js
(because we hoped the latest version would somehow mitigate the problem) Do you have a link to the site anywhere where you can reproduce?
 my apologies:
it is indeed stuttering on rotation updates, as you said. I was probably looking at a cached version.
So we need to wait for m66, hoping there is a fix, right?
 There's a fix in m66 for the stuttering, correct -- there may be a m65 update with a fix, but at this point seems unlikely Hi, can anyone tell me if the problem with the VR camera has been solved?

In earlier versions of Chrome it works perfectly. [This webvr-polyfill release](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill/releases/tag/v0.10.3) details what issues are on latest Chrome, and the workarounds employed Having no luck with our site [The Union Project](http://apps.tlt.stonybrook.edu/unionProject/matrix.html) A-Frame 0.8 fixes issues we've been having on mobile with one click causing two click events, but the Gyroscope is totally disabled on chrome Android 65 & beta 66. We are using the dist above with the latest Polyfill version, also clicking is kinda weird and insensitive at times on mobile and in the mobile emulator; but I think the lack of Gyro is more severe.  Hello, I'm new to this and found this thread because I've got no gyroscope in chrome...but i have sound...while in Firefox I have gyroscope but no sound....any suggestions for the best browser to test my projects on that will allow both sound and head movement? Using Galaxy note 4, for now.
Thanks @chngngclrs gyroscope issue fixed (mostly) in latest aframe; audio issue sounds like a codec that Firefox does not support I got the same issue on Samsung S6. When I move right to left or up and down, it moves slowly. I tested on every browser on Samsung S6. But same thing I have found. It's really slow.  Updated the Samsung browser late last night and I get full gyroscope and my
sound is working. So I’ll use this browser for a bit.

 I checked some aframe example on Samsung S6 even on Samsung S6 edge some times. But I have found same problem. It's moving very slow. 
I checked with these examples:
https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/performance/cubes/
https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/performance/entity-count/
https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/performance/animation/
https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/test/geometry-gallery/
And some other. What can I do for this lagging issue? I wonder why the Threejs examples still work on m65?
https://threejs.org/examples/webvr_cubes.html @sabbir420 w/r/t lagging issue: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3458#issuecomment-375915490
@dirkk0 three.js examples use an origin trial, so using native WebVR most likely rather than the polyfill, which uses devicemotion/orientation which is the source of issues in Chrome m65 Any news about this? nothing to update on until m66 Can someone tell me if the problem has been solved? Thanks Nope, but hope is m66 is to be released very soon:
https://www.chromestatus.com/features/schedule
I can also confirm that it is fixed in Chrome Canary already. Looks like it's gotten worse with m66 - camera is now moving on it's own: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CeFykDjUC9GkZxLFqRnhQiROQ_lO1qDl/view?usp=drivesdk are you sure you are on m66? I think so! https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bd_TmtKUqXrTnM79Ls1d4cF8jHC7SGRx/view?usp=drivesdk ok, I have m66 too, now. 
Switching through the example section of aframe.io, I can confirm that some examples work, while others look weird.
I think this is because some of the examples are not on the latest version.
@FeralRizvi what aframe version did you import? I'm on 0.8.0 @dirkk0  Works now!!! Thank you so much @dmarcos ! People my Chrome updated to 66 but the gyroscope bug continues, any solution? Thanks @dmarcos  Yes in the browser only it works, in the phonegap app no longer works. @dmarcos  I understand, but when I come back to the version of my Chrome it works. @dmarcos I understood, thanks, I'll wait for an update. Gyroscope doesn't work before to enter on VR Mode!
I have this issue on Samsung S8 ( Chrome 66.0.3359.158) with Aframe 0.8.2.

It works with Aframe 0.7.1  Gyroscope doesn't work in fullscreen and VR
Android 6 / Chrome 67 /aframe 0.8.2 Indeed, same here. Samsung S8, Android 8, Aframe 0.8.2, Chrome 67. No gyros in the non-vr mode, just the one axis touch movement. I am also experiencing a gyro problem on 2 phones except they are accessing the gyro but with either random input, or very very sensitive input. If i keep my hand still and don't move it is almost still but i can see the micromovements on screen with my hand's micro shaking. 

The Gyro works 100% fine with this link:

https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/sky/

but not the image gallery:
https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/360-image-gallery/

Honor 6x  | Android 7.0 EMUI 5.0.2 / Google Chrome 67.0.3396.87 / aframe 0.8.2
&
Samsung S8 |Google Chrome 67.0.3396.87 / aframe 0.8.2

Thanks! https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/sky/ is using 0.8.2
https://aframe.io/360-image-gallery-boilerplate/ is using Aframe 0.3.2

Older versions of aframe will not work on the latest versions of Chrome Gyro was finally working good with 0.8.2 and Chrome m66.
Now on Chrome m67 it is not working again (not shaking this time, but completely still I can just rotate on one axis swiping with my finger) is it expected? Same problem here: 0.8.2 and Chrome m67: camera not shaking, but no gyro active until entering VR-mode. ~~same issue with Chrome m68 using  0.8.2~~
fixed (update): I got issue with aframe-layout and no error with version 0.8.2 and m68 just the other library causing the issue.

update (issue): there is a slight movement to the left when I intend to focus or stand still (no movement). This slow movement keeping me as a user to notice that my view has been automatically rotating. Is there are quick fix to this issue?

thanks,  two bottom rows of the table were misplaced. Thank you so much :-)
  0 0 0 changed to 0 1.6 0 Thanks :)
  On this section of camera doc: https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/camera.html#default-camera
position is written as `position="0 0 0"`
I guess it should be `position="0 1.6 0"`
 I added a pull request. 
Hope i did it right, since it's my first time to commit like this :) Thanks @dmarcos Diego  **Description:**

When multiple entities utilize the `sound` component, and use the same audio asset source, only one instance of audio is created in `0.8.*`.

This does work as expected in `0.7.*` as long as an `<audio>` element is used rather than an `<a-asset-item>`.

In `0.8.*`, only the first entity of its kind in the code emits audio and `TypeError: Argument of AudioContext.decodeAudioData can't be a detached buffer - three.js:37939:18` is thrown.

As I expected, `poolSize` has no effect, I'm assuming due to the fact that this is across multiple instances of the `sound` component and not contained within one component.

 looks like the three positional audio works normal
https://threejs.org/examples/#webaudio_sandbox

could it be this only happend if there are more than one  sounds?  @arpu Thanks for the reply. Yeah, it's not so much the positional audio that's not working; it's more specific to when you have multiple entities using the same audio asset, which is pretty common in my work, so this has been a blocking issue for me. It works well in `0.7.*`, just not in `0.8.0`. Hoping this is addressed soon so I can use `0.8.*` in production. we've resolved the issue on a local branch and will be getting a PR up in the next few hours. Rad. Thanks, @meatwallace. @dsinni - sorry, jumped the gun a little - we'll be opening a PR, but the issue is in Three.js, so not certain what that means for A-Frame exactly as it's using a fork. regardless, i'll post back as soon as I open the PR. Ah, bummer. Okay. Thanks, @meatwallace. Appreciate it. Hoping it can be resolved without too much hassle. It may not be a breaking issue, but it really is an important bug, IMO; I'm surprised more people haven't noticed/reported it (or maybe they have on `three.js`). @dsinni - the PR can be found [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/13710). Not certain it'll be accepted, as it might be more of a workaround rather than a fix.

We fork A-Frame to hack in some fixes specific to our project's implementation, and have temporarily modified the `build/aframe-master.js` with those changes just to get up and running. Given that A-Frame uses a fork of three, this seemed like the best (temporary) approach for us as we don't want to fork of that too.

@ngokevin - is there any information/advice/direction you can offer here? thanks @dmarcos. there's actually an [existing issue](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/10706) already tracking it. I don't think my fix will land, so hopefully someone with more knowledge of three can solve it. This issue is still blocking me from using `0.8.*` in production. 😢  @dsinni - fork A-Frame & edit the dist code directly to reflect the changes made in [this PR](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/13710)

if you're importing it as a node module, be sure to update `dist/aframe-master.js`.

if you want 0.8.2, i'd branch from commit `#46b1362` to play it safe, as the commit log around the release looks a little messy.

for what it's worth, we're using commit `#d5bb456` (A-Frame 0.8.2 + Three.js R92) in production without any issues, but we're only targeting the Oculus Browser with the GearVR so I can't verify other platforms. 

additionally, it seems like my PR will be part of Three.js R93, but I don't know when that will be wrapped up into A-Frame. Thanks, @meatwallace. I appreciate the info and will look into what you suggested. I'd just really love to see this in an official release since I often use the CDN version for prototypes.

This is pretty much crucial to doing anything with reusable audio assets, which I think is a pretty big deal, even more so because it's on the Web. I cannot stress this enough.

Does the PR allow for more than two instances of a sound? Yessssssss! Thank you, @dmarcos! Going to check it out right now. Nope, still not working, @dmarcos  :(

I switched to the master in the demo and the issue persists: https://codepen.io/dansinni/pen/yKOjem

Only the rear, left entity is emitting the audio. If you don't hear _any_ audio, you may need to refresh cache (Ctrl + F5, etc.).

Man, was really excited, too. I'm not entirely sure which issue it is in THREE, but the ones I have seen still appear to be open. @meatwallace 's patch appears to be awaiting merge. :/

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/10706
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/13710
 I just wanted to say that I bit the bullet and employed the changes outlined by @meatwallace and I can confirm that they are working with no noticeable side effects as of yet. A credit to you, sir. Thank you. I'm just trying to be patient as I wait for this to be merged in THREE and A-Frame so we can all move on with our lives. :) looks like it's been pushed out to R94.

i'm pretty naive in this space so I may be incorrect, but I believe my fix introduces potentially non-trivial memory overhead if your app is loading a large audio asset in multiple places at the same time. it's a naive work around to the the loader 'race condition' described in [this issue](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/10706), which really needs to be fixed by rearchitecting the entire loader, coming with it's own set of considerations and is well beyond my capacity right now.

@dsinni - it might be worth profiling your app's memory consumption when your reused assets are loaded to see if it's significant in your use case. Looks like this is working in `master` now after bumping three to `r94`, so that's promising! Looking forward to seeing in an official release.

@meatwallace, I hadn't noticed any crippling side effects. Honestly, I'd rather have the the ability to reuse the audio at the cost of performance than not have the option; it's just too important of a feature to not have it.

Thanks to everyone for getting this closer to resolved.

  **Description:**

This also handles Chrome changes in devicemotion in m65-m67. More information can be found in the [0.10.3](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill/releases/tag/v0.10.3) release notes of the issues, but as of now, this is necessary for A-Frame to work in current versions of Chrome.

I'd suggest checking out the [0.10.0](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill/releases/tag/v0.10.0) the release notes as well to confirm there hasn't been any feature changes that is necessary for A-Frame.

I use camera rotation to start looking at a specific direction when starting my scene. 
I just updated to 0.8 and the rotation option is no longer available.

If this is by design, what is the correct way to handle initial camera rotation?

Thanks
 Worked like a charm! thank you.
Maybe we should put a note in the docs about this?  **Description:**

The `vrdisplayactivate` event can sometimes cause A-Frame to enter VR prematurely. This PR delays `setPoseTarget` until the camera is available.

This may be difficult to repro. It usually occurs in development scenarios, when you're refreshing an app frequently. I've been able to so relatively often with these steps:

1. `git checkout v0.8.0`
1. `npx serve` (use a simple web server instead of `npm start`)
1. visit http://localhost:5000/examples/showcase/anime-UI/
1. make sure your cache is fresh
1. do not leave dev tools open (it causes timing delays)
1. add the example to your bookmark bar
1. enter vr with the button
1. click the bookmark button until it fails

In the failure cases, after you click on the bookmark button, you'll notice that the example fails to enter VR with `vrdisplayactivate` and an error appears in the console `TypeError: this.camera is undefined`. As a side effect, when you click on the "enter vr" button after you've reached this state, the `poseTarget` is uninitialized and you start seeing culling issues.

In the success cases, after you click on the bookmark button, the app re-enters VR with `vrdisplayactivate`.


**Changes proposed:**
- If `vrdisplayactivate` fires before the camera is initialized, delay `setPoseTarget` until the camera is available. Viewing this from another perspective, it means that A-Frame occasionally fails to initialize in time to respond to a `vrdisplayactivate` event. This may be problematic for link transitions and general UX. 

In trying to fix this bug, I attempted to delay entering VR until the camera was ready, however that doesn't work since it breaks the "use gesture" origin if you use a promise or setTimeout/Interval to delay enterVR.

A better fix would be to ensure that the camera is ready as early as possible, but that might require a large-ish refactor. This PR aims to fix the immediate error case. @dmarcos did you commit what we were working on some time ago? (which at the time was mostly early vrdisplayactivate from Oculus Browser, IIRC) @ngokevin Enter VR can't wait because `requestPresent` needs to invoked in a stack that was initiated by a user gesture or by the `vrdisplayactivate` event (which typically happens if you were previously in VR and then refreshed the page or traversed to a new VR app). 
AFAIK, the only methods we have to wait for the camera (Promise, setTimeout, setInterval) will create a new stack that does not retain the original initiator. Ah, good point. It does look like setPoseTarget can be delayed. I'll try it out. You were right! Delaying `setPoseTarget` works. This way we get to enter VR and avoid the culling regression as well.  I've been sitting on this problem for a couple of hours now and can't put my finger on what exactly is going on under the hood to cause the issue but the symptoms are easy to reproduce:

https://codepen.io/PButcher/pen/PRZGRr

Move the mouse cursor down over the blue plane (which sits behind the red plane), on to the red plane, then move the cursor left across the face of the red plane until the raycaster is not intersecting with the blue plane, then move the cursor back to the right. The raycaster emits a `mouseleave` and `mouseenter` event on the red plane as well as a `mouseenter` and `raycaster-intersected` event on the blue plane even though it is not the closest intersection. Furthermore, when you move the cursor upwards over the blue again, the raycaster emits a `raycaster-intersected-cleared` event but not a `mouseleave` event on the red plane.

Here's a terrible GIF of one of my apps that I was upgrading to 0.8.0 from 0.7.x that alerted me to the bug: https://streamable.com/ntaum

I know a lot of work went into optimising the raycaster for 0.8.0, but it looks like some logic was removed that stops events being emitted on new intersections that are further along the ray while there are currently other foreground intersections.

Cheers!

  **Description:** origin of the framework name

**Changes proposed:**
- short version of https://twitter.com/joshcarpenter/status/960555753588383749
  **Description:** Controllers activated via `vive-controls` component do not appear, but are otherwise fully functional. The models appear to be present, but fully transparent, as seen in the screenshot below where the transparency sorting issue causes them to make vive controller shaped holes in the torus knot behind them

![20180311211348_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10034859/37263227-1da7da18-2575-11e8-9ad5-25616722e706.jpg)

 Narrowed it down to the `obj-model` rather than the controller component

https://glitch.com/edit/#!/reflective-stone Also having this issue with some other `obj` files, but not all.  I also have issues with some obj files, namely those using mtl files. Are you seeing this error in the console?

``
THREE.WebGLRenderer: .shadowMap.renderReverseSided has been removed. Set Material.shadowSide instead.
aframe-v0.8.0.js:50683:5
THREE.WebGLRenderer: .shadowMap.renderSingleSided has been removed. Set Material.shadowSide instead.
``

Then it's probably related to the issue described here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3428 - although it's currently not clear to me what the fix  for obj models is. Hm this `.shadowMap.renderReverseSided` warning seems to have nothing to do with transparent objs after all. Still there without any objs. A general issue in A-Frame 0.8.0 it would seem. Seems be a pretty bad bug in Three.js recently introduced by this commit: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/commit/ad9093801bbb48c919b82e8514a175d8c26c537d#diff-5f35124cf2254142299033b1b52ef2b8L465

Now any obj model using a material file with `Tr` specified for a material, will get the reverse effect - in most cases a completely transparent or "invisible" material.

It's fairly easy to fix, but this has to happen in Three.js. See my comment here:
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/12862#issuecomment-375260770 For anyone that need a quick work around while this is being fixed in Three.js and then rolled into A-Frame, you can add this to your `package.json`:

```
  "resolutions": {
    "three": "github:RSpace/three.js#fixMtlLoader"
  }
```

(This is forked off the Three.js repo and branch A-Frame is currently using, with a single change to fix the mtl loader bug) I think this issue and https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3488 are two very critical issues in the current version of A-Frame. This issue at least have a work around by forcefully upgrading Three.js version, but the other one breaks many VR experiences quite badly. Getting out an 0.8.3 with those two issues fixed would certainly by worth it in my opinion. Any news on when this Obj transparent issue will be fixed?

I was just wrapping up a project when this bug hit, and now it's sitting in limbo with a deadline approaching. @donmccurdy @dmarcos would you accept a PR to [cherry-pick the mtl loader fix](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/13685/files) into the THREE fork you're using and then update A-Frame with that for 0.8.x? @dmarcos it works. Thank you! Can someone verify if cutout transparency works with this patch?

I have exported an obj and mtl file from blender and uploaded it into a-frame. 
But I am still getting either full transparency, or a white background where it should be transparent.

The error messages are now gone. But there doesn't seem to be a change to the models themselves now. After a long time research, and trial and error. I found a solution.

It involves using gltf exporter from Blender and the PBR (material node editor) in Blender with the Cycles Render.

The solution can be found here:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3234  Aframe 0.8.0 switched to using the webvr support provided by three's webglrenderer. The problem is that the renderer submits the frame as part of its render() operations so by the time the tock methods are called the frame is already submitted. This breaks post processing.

To facilitate this case, this PR was submitted in three https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/11582 . This PR utilizes this functionality to fix post proc Variable name changed, console.log fixed @dmarcos camera is now passed as a third argument to tock which does look much cleaner Fscked up rebase closing this to submit a clean PR  a-animation refers `evt.detail.state` in `onStateAdded` and `onStateRemoved`.
`addState` always sets a state value to `detail` of `emit` and it passed to onStateXXX as `evt.detail`.
So, the state is set to `evt.detail` and `evt.detail.state` is seemed always `undefined`.
This isn't an expected behavior, is it?

- A-Frame Version: master
 This topic was closed but the issue hasn't been fixed yet in master e3d8975.
a-animation still checks `evt.detail.state` which is `undefined`.
Would you like me to make a pull request?  **Description:**

I have a very simple scene with an `a-plane`. When I add an `a-camera`, the plane is not shown (or I cannot see it). The HTML page below (reproducible snippet), shows nothing, but shows a plane if the `a-camera` element is removed. Besides, it worked with 0.7.0.

For example on `<a-box>`, the `position` component (which is always added to `<a-entity>`) is available immediately, but `material` and `geometry` are not.

My Glitch snippet shows an example of this. Open the console to see the output.

My output is the following in both Chrome and Firefox:
```

The `intersection` property in the event details for `raycaster` is not documented. From looking at the code, they appear to be the raw [three.js intersectObjects results](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/core/Raycaster.intersectObject).  Without documentation it's impossible to know which fields are intended to be part of the supported API. About documentation of 0.8.0, it should be noted the intersection behavior has changed significantly in 0.8.0, the raycaster only emit the start of intersections, so if you previously used in 0.7.1 the event to show a ring on a plane like it's done in https://urish.github.io/web-ar-experiment/ you apparently need something like this https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3129#issuecomment-334779820 now. I didn't test this code yet. @ngokevin This probably should be referenced in the 0.8.0 changelog.  as discussed in #3423, 
use RegExp and update multi-prefix syntax; remove GearVR
(might be best to merge *after* the Oculus Browser fix is deployed next Tuesday) @digitec can you confirm whether the Oculus Browser fix has been deployed yet? From #gearvr slack channel today by 
```
DigiTec [3 h 51]
Update, Oculus Browser 4.3.1 is now rolling out and has fixed the GearVR -> Gear VR naming on the controllers. It’s at 10% and on the PTC (public test channel) and will ramp up to 100% between now and Thursday assuming no new issues are uncovered.

If you aren’t familiar with the PTC it is a channel you can get on to get Oculus software a bit earlier (usually a few days in advance) and test it and provide feedback before we launch to public.

Chrome 65 (latest stable)
Version 0.8.0

Basic Example also same kind of slow camera https://aframe.io/examples/ This is due to a change in Chrome m65 which breaks the Polyfill. See here for more info:

https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill/issues/307
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=819413
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=796518
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=805146

The fix was merged a day late to make the M65 stable release, and unfortunately the fix ends up causing further issues ([819413](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=819413)).  @dmarcos That's correct. It's a Chrome platform issue that was caused by an incomplete merge (796518 depends on 805146 but it wasn't originally planned for m65).  Also experiencing this on Oneplus 5. 
Vertical movement is extremely slow, horizontal barely works.

Aframe Version 0.8.0 Some more info on a separate but similar (and much more impactful) issue in Chrome M66: 

They are changing the rotationRate units in the deviceMotion API from radians -> degrees to be in line with the actual spec. This is a good thing in the long term, but unfortunately, this is going break all existing Polyfilled sites on Chrome (including all A-Frame sites using a locally hosted library). It's already been addressed in the dev version of the Polyfill, which should find it's way into A-Frame soon, but it's going to be a bit of a mess once M66 goes stable. Here are the tickets where this change is currently being tracked:

Chromium - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=541607
Polyfill / cardboard-vr-display - https://github.com/immersive-web/cardboard-vr-display/issues/18

There's a tiny bit of hope that they decide to tweak how they implement this change (there's a suggestion about changing the spec so that it provides a "units" parameter) but most likely all Polyfill dependent sites will need to upgrade to support Chrome M66+.  With iOS 9.2 WebKit now blocks deviceorientation and devicemotion event access from cross-origin iframes. [bug link](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152299)

- A-Frame Version: latest
- Platform / Device: Ios webkit >= 9.2

as a dirty solution I was thinking about using the iframe postMessage to send devicemotions to the child iframe
something like this:

Father page 
```javascript
if (window.DeviceMotionEvent) {

        /* Add a listener for the devicemotion event */
        window.ondevicemotion = function (deviceMotionEvent) {

            /* Get acceleration on x, y and z axis */
            var x = deviceMotionEvent.accelerationIncludingGravity.x;
            var y = deviceMotionEvent.accelerationIncludingGravity.y;
            var z = deviceMotionEvent.accelerationIncludingGravity.z;
            
             var coordinates = deviceMotionEvent.accelerationIncludingGravity;
            console.log(coordinates)
            /* Get the interval (ms) at which data is obtained from the underlying hardware */
            
            //send the accleration coordinates from parent to child iframe 
            //"*" used to avoid cors protection
            jQuery("#myChildIframe")[0].contentWindow.postMessage(coordinates, '*');
}
```

Children iframe 
```javascript
window.onload = function () {
    window
        .addEventListener('message', function (e) {
           //e.data are the accelerometer from father
           //now how to pass the devicemotions coordinates to aframe??
           
        })
}
```
but how to send the father devicemotion coordinates to the child iframe aframe?




 You could try something like the following and see if it works for you.
```
...

.addEventListener('message', function (e) {
    var event = document.createEvent('Event');
    event.initEvent('ondevicemotion', true, true);

    event.accelerationIncludingGravity = e.data;

    window.dispatchEvent(event);
});

...
```  For example three.js Box Geometry Constructor has some additional arguments to control the number of vertices which comes in handy when using displacement maps. It would be great if the geometry component could reflect the overall constructor options from three.js
 I'm aware that i can register my own custom components. Creating primitives this way is no problem so far. 

We are working on a collaborative online editor/viewer based on aframe and meteor. The user needs to be able to changes various settings of the primitives on the fly. If we need to drop the current mesh and create a new one, the material drops too. I didn't found any hint in the docs how update custom geometries correctly. Ok thanks this is eventually working

```` I just saw it was just missing in the docs (geometry.md) see #3426.  Adding an envMap to a gLTF in aframe is currently counterintuitive and involved, which is a blow to PBR workflows. Currently, one can't use the material component to overwrite attributes of materials imported from gLTF, or .obj with .mtl files.

I've been teaching with a-frame a lot, and this is becoming a common point of confusion with my students (they wonder why their low-roughness materials don't reflect anything, then learn about envMaps and try to add one by setting the attribute with materials, and are confused why it doesn't work)

Some ways this could be approached, not mutually exclusive: 

**1) Allow gLTF & obj+mtl material overwrites from the material component** 
This seems most intuitive to me, is what I tried the first time, and is what some of my students have told me they tried. One would just selectively overwrite attributes (like envMap) using the material component. Curious to understand why this currently isn't allowed. Many circumstances where one might want to overwrite attributes of a material on a gLTF. I can see how it is unintuitive when a gltf gets used to store a whole scene.. but for envMap, a very common use is to apply the same envMap to all scene objects

**2) Ship a-frame with an env-map component (w/sphericalEnvMap support) and have the material component continue to ignore attribute changes on gltf & obj+mtl** 
This makes sense in some ways — the logic being that any attributes not imported via gLTF files can can then be set via aframe components. Is maybe premature [given talk of this possible extension](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/issues/946). 

**3) Leave as is. Expect users to write a component, traverse the three object graph, and modify materials, and/or let community components fill the need and hope users know (where) to look**  

[gLTF-part](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/gltf-part/) is one partial answer, but this is still trouble when: 
a) using a .glb where it is harder to know the (sometimes auto-generated) keynames that correspond to gltf pieces
b) a gltf contains a single highpoly object that is broken into tons of sub meshes (Unbound's export currently does this.. tho likely something of an edge case).

The problem is solved for me: I've made a simple component that can be attached to gLTFs to inject envMaps and spericalEnvMaps, and I'm thinking about making it work with all entities (to be attached to a scene and propagate to all models that have materials, for example)... I'll publish this shortly, but I wanted to bring it into discussion more broadly as I've seen several newcomers bump into it with the core library. 

ps: <3 <3 <3 a-frame, one of the most important projects going right now Another option would be to build this into a-sky or an a-skybox entity. With an option to source external envmap images, or dynamically make a cubemap screenshot of the scene itself at the start of the sketch. Just thinking out loud here, curious what others think ! Yeah I agree on this. Would be nice if A-Frame had built in functionality for directly setting any material's envMap. Perhaps even better would be a global scene setting that traverses all models and sets it?

For GLTF I actually had to create another GLTF component to support it. An example below (probably rough as I am still wrapping my head around writing components - OT but would be nice if there was a "component extension model" :)

``` Thanks @donmccurdy. Is this the preferred pathway for extending functionality of any component in A-Frame? (via events and adding more components?) Ah I see. This is some great info. to chew on. Thanks again.  I have created a 3d animated model, which I managed to run in threejs

It works perfectly on threejs, but how can I use it in aframe, I am trying to create AR app.
I am not getting enough documentation, in AFrame I can display obj model on marker but aframe-extras doesn't seem to work, but Threejs FBX loader works fine. I need help display Threejs object or scene on a-scene or a-entity

I have asked here, hope someone can help here too  **Description:** lot of people get confused on why the camera "doesn't move" once they add it to be able to add the reticle

**Changes proposed:**
- Added look-controls to avoid that.  @dmarcos Looks like the builds aren't updated on the branch that aframe/master is currently pointing to: 
https://github.com/dmarcos/three.js/tree/r90vrfix/build Looks like this is resolved now?   Calling `document.querySelector('a-scene').enterVR()` from within `setTimeout` does not work on Chrome for Android . Throws:

and aframe does not enter in VR mode.

Actual code:

```
setTimeout(function(){

Although, if I type `document.querySelector('a-scene').enterVR();` from console, it works as expected.  

On Chrome (version 64.0.3282.186) for Linux (Elementary OS 0.4.1 based on Ubuntu 16.04): If I try this from `setTimeout`, aframe does enter in VR mode but not in fullscreen, from console without `setTimeout` it works as expected

Thanks, a lot for this library. Hi,  
Is it possible to delay entering vr moding after user clicks on enter-vr button?  
Thanks...  A-frame examples do not render in Chrome, because the examples are loaded through an iframe. Chrome does not allow child frames to receive focus for retrieving device information through the WebVR APIs. However, you can explicitly give focus to a child frame (ie. iframe.focus()) to get focus and start rendering the scene. 

The Chrome team discusses their reasoning here (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=817454).

 This may be solved by using the message passing mentioned in the [CardboardVRDisplay docs](https://github.com/immersive-web/cardboard-vr-display#iframes) I just want to let you know Chrome won't fix this. And with the webvr flag enabled in Chrome, the scene renders, but the magic window feature does not work. Are there any plans on this issue?

@jsantell The allowvr attribute is present, but doesn't fix this issue, because the chromium engine specifically disallows iframes to render VR without focus.  I'm afraid that with all the latest optimizations to improve performance we could end up losing consistency if things don't work as expected depending on the type of component (eg: As for pos/rot/sca https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector/issues/534).
I honestly would prefer consistency over performance, as you will always have the option to go deep and use the object3D anyway.
Not sure if it could be even needed something similar to `debug=true` to ensure that the `setAttribute/getAttribute` works as you could expect even if you will lose some performance.
 @dmarcos @ngokevin I believe with this change everything should be fine now. Although I'm not sure about how the getAttribute works, I would expect that If I'm modifying the value accessing directly to the `object3D` that won't get me the expected value, but if I'm setting attributes using `setAttribute` it will always return the same value when I'll call `getAttribute` is that correct?
I totally understand that performance is a top priority here but I was afraid to have edge cases because of the performance optimizations that didn't work as you could expect or as they used to work before these optimizations. I believe we must ensure that the whole api regarding `set/get Attributes` is consistent but expose optimizations to the user knowing that they could lead to inconsistent results if you don't know what you're doing.
  **Description:**
#3327 changed the way we calculate tracked controller pose:
- As a side effect, the code no longer updated the individual `position` and `quaternion` properties of the controller object. This prevents users and libraries (like `networked-aframe`) from reading those properties.
- It also removed use of `tracked-control`'s `rotationOffset` property, this lead to `hand-controls` with incorrectly rotated hand models when using the Oculus Rift and Touch, as evident in the tracked-controls example.
- Lastly, it regressed standing matrix application for 3DoF controls -- i.e. standing matrix should only be applied for 6DoF controls, since the controller position is controlled by the arm model, which bases it off the head position.

**Changes proposed:**
- Decompose the tracked object's matrix in to its individual components
- Reintroduce use of the `rotationOffset` property.
- Only apply the standing matrix if the controller is 6DoF
- Add tests to cover these changes.

I am having problems developing collision systems between a sphere and plane. I have tried many different work arroumds, including generating a hitbox from points and dimensions without any luck.

There seems to be no docs on collision either.

The first time through, it creates the alert box "0 0 0" as it should (the default camera rotation).
Then it will start returning "[object Object]"

I seem to be the only person on the internet to have this problem. I made this conclusion after many hours of tinkering, and searching the web.

It doesn't work as expected, but If I add `debug: true` to the scene, it works.

I guess it's something related to the latest changes to optimize the set/getAttribute?

I can't recall where exactly, but I think that current master has an issue where the camera position in VR is not getting the correct height value (missing the standing matrix offset?) when you read back its position via getAttribute('position') or .object3D.position?

dmarcos [5:55 PM]
@mchen those issues should be gone

mchen [6:02 PM]
https://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/oEQbab
1. run Firefox and go to that codepen
2. enter VR and put on your Rift
3. look for the Y label, look down, and notice it's negative

dmarcos [6:03 PM]
It is the rendered height wrong?

mchen [6:03 PM]
the text should be headlocked, as a child of entity with active camera.
both the head sphere and the headlocked text are displayed below where they should be, which is why I had to look down
(the headsphere should be rendered where the HMD is, but since you're inside it, you may only see the nose cone)
the value appears to be off by roughly 1.6 :confused:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3327#issuecomment-360019236
The HMD height assertion in (1) is not correct, as demonstrated by this example.

 from https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3327#issuecomment-360019236
```The "floor" is essentially at y=100, so if my height is 1.51 meters in a 6DOF device the #cameraRig position will be left alone, but the #head position will change to 0 1.51 0, for a cumulative world position of 25 101.51 25.```

What actually seems to be happening is that regardless of camera entity's position originally,
(1) the value gets overridden according to HMD (good)
(2) the Y value is negative, and appears to be off by roughly 1.6, so if I am sitting down and my HMD is about a meter off the floor, the Y position reads back (incorrectly) as between -0.5 and -0.6 -- per our discussion on that prior PR, I expect the Y position to read back as about 1   The hud text is positioned correctly with respect to the headsphere (good),
but the headsphere is in the floor (bad) The headlocked hud text is not locked correctly to the camera, although it is a child of the element containing the camera component.
The headlocked hud text is positioned correctly relative to its headsphere sibling, but both of them are positioned well below the camera, as described earlier.

The scene does appear to be rendered with the camera at the correct height, and the controllers seem correct as well... but the entity with the camera component seems to be getting the wrong Y position value.

For convenience, the scene:
```
<a-scene>
  <a-sky color="#3cf"></a-sky>
  <a-entity id="player">
    
    <a-entity id="hmd" camera position="0 1.6 0">

    </a-entity>

     <a-text rotation="-90 0 0" wrap-count="80" align="center" value="L"></a-text> 
      <a-sphere opacity="0.5" scale="0.025 0.02 0.1">
        <a-cone opacity="0.5" color="red" position="0 -0.25 -1" scale="0.5 2 0.5" rotation="-90 0 0"></a-cone>
      </a-sphere>
    </a-entity>
    
    <a-entity id="right-hand" laser-controls="hand:right">

      <a-sphere opacity="0.5" scale="0.025 0.02 0.1">
        <a-cone opacity="0.5" color="blue" position="0 -0.25 -1" scale="0.5 2 0.5" rotation="-90 0 0"></a-cone>
      </a-sphere>
    </a-entity>
    
  </a-entity>
</a-scene>
``` Let me know if these expectations are incorrect:
1 - the player rig position essentially defines the floor
2 - its child entity with camera component should receive the HMD's position, including standing offset from the floor (so if I told Oculus I am 1.5 meters, and the HMD Y position is currently reading 0.5 meters below that point, the child entity should have .getAttribute('position').y = .object3D.position.y = 1
3 - its child entities with controller components should receive the controller's positions, including standing offset from the floor
4- so the relative Y position of controllers and HMD should thus be correct.

At the moment, 1 and 3 are true, but 2 is not, so 4 is not. the strange thing is, the camera *rendering* appears to be done from the correct Y position, but the entities that are supposed to be placed at the position of that entity with the camera are instead being placed in the floor.  Which is why you find yourself looking down at the headsphere rendered beneath the camera vantage point. Working with master last week, I observed an issue which appears to be the same.  Specifically, on desktop (FF &Chrome under OS X) the camera position is correct, but in VR mode in Gear Vr (Oculus & Samsung) the camera appears slightly more than 1.5 m above where it should.

There's an attitude indicator which should appear as triangle 1.5m above the user's head, outlined in black. On desktop and Android FF, it appears correctly. In this screenshot taken in VR mode in Gear VR Oculus, you can see the outline (or at least half of it) below the camera: https://hominidsoftware.com/non-public/bug-GearVR.jpg

(There's also a square of random color that appears where the avatar's waist should be.) and stranger yet, today it is working as expected (camera and headsphere are always locked so you see the nose cone properly, headlocked text appears properly) ok, now I am seeing a weirder state - camera Y position shows as correct, and controllers are displayed at the right height, but the controller y positions are in the floor
https://gainful-pirate.glitch.me/ I modified the codepen to show HMD and controller Y positions, and I see the weirder state I was just describing... #3407 may fix this? Yup, I believe #3407 should fix the controller y position. As of Mar 2, I'm still observing this issue in my code.

It should look like https://hominidsoftware.com/non-public/correct.png

For the AnimeUI example, initially in flat mode the camera is at the centerline:
![animeui-normal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378430/36931925-550db2e0-1e8e-11e8-84c1-cf63e8537a11.jpg)

When I go to VR mode the camera is above the centerline:
![animeui-bug-vrmode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378430/36931932-889f2c9c-1e8e-11e8-94fb-74f576cecc04.jpg)

When I return to flat mode, the camera is still above the centerline:
![animeui-bug-flatmode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378430/36931935-9c446ae6-1e8e-11e8-8b37-4db24b04069c.jpg)

 Happens for me with the latest (March 23 right) master dist, but only on mobile. Firefox on Mac and Windows and with the Vive appear all fine, but on Android the (non-headlocked) UI objects are suddenly way down when entering VR-mode. Can work-around by increasing the distance between the objects and the camera, but this does of course mess with the sense of depth (and ideally would have consistent results across all platforms). enterVR()

How to fix this? @donmccurdy HTC vive and aframe 0.8.2  If a intersection has already been processed in clearCurrentIntersection, it isn't necessary to process it any more.
 Yeah, I agree that making `setIntersection` and `clearCurrentIntersection` checking these inside of them. It makes sense from point of view of capsuling roles, I guess.  **Description:**

 a simple translate:
1. How do aframe create a custom thing like a building or something, I can only render a 3d model to aframe from maya or Blender. Can I just use aframe code to get a model directly?
2. Is aframe's click event only match a simulate click event? How do I use aframe to get a physical dom, to combine with event? Thanks!  I added the laser component to my right hand and it points about 45deg to the left of where it should.

[A-frame Laser pointing 45deg to the left](https://i.stack.imgur.com/R5PVh.jpg)

In this image I am pointing at the blue box above the tower using an Oculus Touch controller. As you can see the hand is pointing correctly and feels like it matches my real life hand position quite well but the laser is going about 45deg to the left.

If I rebuild the functionality of the laser component using a raycaster and a cursor component it works fine so I believe it to be a bug with the laser component itself.

 Tried manually setting the raycast direction like this and it had no effect (tried a few different vectors, nothing changed):
`<a-entity id="pointerHand" hand-controls="right" laser-controls raycaster="direction: 0 0 0"></a-entity>`

I also tried the laser-control on it's own which fixes this issue (the laser points in the correct direction in relation to the controller model) but the Oculus controller models rotation doesnt match it's position in reality making you feel like you're waving around a broken wrist which you have to contort to select things.  I believe thats been well documented by other here in this issue: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2965

I've managed to recreate the functionality I need by combining hand-controls, curors and raycaster together although I only get mouseenter/mouseleave on this pointer but I can work around that.

  There doesn't appear to be any documentation for the `pivot` component. I actually just stumbled upon it today while inspecting the examples more closely. I thought maybe it was a custom component since I didn't recall ever seeing it in the docs, but nope. Seems to be a native component.
 @dmarcos: Ah, okay. My mistake then. Thanks. @dmarcos is there an alternative that should be used, or are there no out-of-the-box solutions for rotating an object around a point other than its own center?  **Description:**
Addresses issue: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3351 
This allows wasd-controls to be placed in a parent entity around camera and motion controllers and have the motion controllers move with the player

```
<a-entity id="player" wasd-controls="">
	<a-camera wasd-controls-enabled="false"></a-camera>
	<a-entity id="leftHand" teleport-controls="cameraRig: #player" laser-controls="hand: left" raycaster="far:100; objects:.button"></a-entity>
	<a-entity id="rightHand" teleport-controls="cameraRig: #player" laser-controls="hand: right" raycaster="far:100; objects:.button"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

**Changes proposed:**
Adds logic to use an independent element for orientation when calculating movement vector. 
cameraRig can be specified explicitly. Falling back from that the control will search child elements for a camera element to use. Falling back from there, the existing behavior is used

 I am still working on my git kung fu, but I think I got the package-lock.json pulled out of the pull request now.  Does the pull request look kosher now?  Just want to make sure you aren't waiting for me to fix anything. Damn. Where can I see the comments? I don't see them in this thread.  I must be blind, but I dont see anything over there except the file changes. You can tell whether you need to do (3) once and trivially, right?  
So it would know when using world rotation was needed? thanks @donmccurdy -- if you think it will be too slow beyond direct descendant, then +1 from me for warnings or errors when the assumption is violated - but please not every frame :-) What if we use object3D's worldToLocal and localToWorld functions (which do not force updates to the matrices) to transform the velocity vector between coordinate spaces? This should allow the orientationEl to be at any position in the scene graph without any penalty for recursing the graph.  **Description:**

in chrome and firefox on fedora 
  A-Frame controller experiences do not work on Oculus Browser 4.3.0+ on an Oculus Go device.

Previously, the Oculus Go controllers identified themselves as GearVR controllers. However, they are now properly identified as Go controllers, and so now all of the A-Frame controller experiences no longer work; the A-Frame controller code only works on a known set of named controllers. 

In Oculus Browser 4.3.0 and newer - on Oculus Go devices only - the Gamepad.id property now returns "Oculus Go Controller". 

Before Oculus Browser 4.3.0, GamePad.id always returned "Gear VR Controller" on Oculus Go.

On Gear VR devices, Gamepad.id will still be "Gear VR Controller".

Oculus Go controllers have the same functionality as Gear VR controllers:
https://www.oculus.com/blog/pioneering-the-frontier-of-vr-introducing-oculus-go-plus-santa-cruz-updates/

- A-Frame Version: 0.7.1
- Platform / Device: Oculus Browser on Oculus Go
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: See https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/a-blast/ - the various A-Frame 'universal' controls components (such as super-hands: https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component) also do not work.

 If possible it would be nice to remove looking at these strings. Also in WebXR API they won't be available.  I would counter with: when the strings are available, it is much more intuitive for the user to have a representation that matches what they would see from their system outside Web context (e.g. to avoid "hey why does my browser think my Touch controller looks like that" as well as "which button means what in this Web thing") - perhaps you are arguing for a generic controller representation, but we basically started with that in A-Frame and quickly evolved to understanding specific controllers instead.  Still being debated in WebXR API discussions from what I see Should be same (or else they would not have been able to function properly as Gear VR Controller)

We should probably keep this issue limited to current Gamepad API, and discuss WebXR future in https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/319

Send me one and I will fix however we decide ;-) @Marcos, yes, Oculus Go controller has the same buttons as GearVR one. Can someone either test results of 
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3423
with Oculus Go, 
or send me one so I can do so? We will verify. If it still doesn’t work we will follow up with a patch.

 Any update on this?  The A-Blast example doesn't work at all on my Go; it just shows a big white screen.  The A-Painter example just shows a big black screen.  And the Tracked Controllers example isn't even listed on https://aframe.io/examples/, when viewed on the Oculus Go browser.  Is all that expected? I thought there was a way to see the examples using the latest master A-Frame build, maybe via rawgit - but not sure if that is true for A-Painter, A-Blast, etc. ? Is it intended that mousedown/mouseup are fired not by the trigger, but by the thumb disc on the top of the controller?

That's not what I expected... most native games with any sort of point/click interface (e.g. Pet Lab, Fail Factory, and the Go home UI) all use the trigger as the functional equivalent of clicking a mouse.  Pressing the touch disc is rarely used.  It seems like A-Frame would be better served by mapping the trigger to mouse down/up. I made an example that works on the Oculus Go with the controller for easy test

https://lunar-stealer.glitch.me/ @dmarcos The laser controls example was AWESOME!!! Thank you for that. Is there any example of the camera moving back and forth like a WASD controller with the oculus go?   The Oculus Go controller freezes when re-entering VR. If someone can point me in the right direction, I'd be glad to fix it myself and submit a PR.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Enter VR on the Go in a scene with oculus-go-controls (e.g. https://lunar-stealer.glitch.me/)
2. Press the back button to exit VR
3. Enter VR again
4. The controller appears but is not responsive. Buttons are not highlighted.

This bug also appears (inconsistently) when going through a-link portals. Forgot to add: Version 0.8.2. Will try with master. Also happens with master. For now, my workaround will be to refresh the page when exiting VR. Hi everyone, in my tests the thumb gesture highlight the shape of the trackpad in the 3d model; however, i don't understand how to create addEventListeners with trackpaddown/trackpadup. Any indication is more than welcome. @spleennooname Hi, it can look something like this:

`
this.el.addEventListener('trackpaddown', function(event) {
    /* Your code here */
});
`

This code would go inside of a [custom component](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/core/component.html) which you include in your HTML. `this.el` refers to the same element that your oculus-go-controls is on:

`<a-entity your-controller oculus-go-controls></a-entity>`

Hope this helps! @spleennooname, I created a sample for Oculus Go on Glitch that uses event listeners:
https://glitch.com/edit/#!/amino-go?path=index.html:1:0  // <a-entity "name"></a-entity> 
that should be the same

@ngokevin i think this this bug can be closed  Nice!  Maybe we should regenerate the older default font with the new tool, and default negate to false (at least for msdf)  so all new msdf fonts we create will work without the flag?  https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/666#issuecomment-302831463

I am trying to apply wireframe material to a obj-model. However, when I do this, the look controls don't work any more.
- A-Frame Version:0.7.0
- Platform / Device:Chrome/Firefox on windows 10
          

 here is an example code : 

    <a-scene>
        <a-assets>
	    <a-asset-item id="sample-model-obj" src="sample-model.obj "></a-asset-item>
	    <a-asset-item id="sample-model-mtl" src="sample-model.mtl"></a-asset-item>	
	</a-assets>
	<a-obj-model  src="#sample-model-obj"  material="wireframe:true"></a-obj-model>
    </a-scene>


but anyway I managed to fix it by adding a geometry primitive box attribute to the obj model.  I think that pause/play can be changed to make the feature more useful. At the moment if I pause an entity and then open the inspector and close it again then the entity will be played. There's lots of cases where I might pause only part of the scene, such as pausing enemy spawners while the main menu is open, pausing entities in a pool, etc. In fact the current poolable component gets around this issue by wrapping the play() function and ignoring it.

If we took inspiration from Unity then each element could have a flag called: pausedSelf. When this is set true then it and all its children are paused. They remain paused even if their parents are played. Only by setting pausedSelf of that specific element to false will cause it and its children to be played.

It would be simple to create a 'paused' component implemented in a similar way to the poolable component. Any thoughts? I'm happy to pick this up Ok will do, Ill just release my pause component to the registry  **Description:**
It took me a long time to realise that the Gamepad extensions had to be enabled in order to use the controller.

**Changes proposed:**
This is a documentation change. I hope it is clear enough. Yes, I thought about that and the info is up to date on webvr.rocks.
We can then add a link to https://webvr.rocks/chrome_for_android#android, that contains the steps required to make it work.

Another way around would be to inform the developers. For example if a Daydream controller is detected but it doesn't have a `pose` property, then we can emit an event or a warning in the console asking to enable the Gamepad extensions.

Clearly the latter is what is being used in the A-frame registry.

I guess the Template component could be installed manually from the correct location, but this is a beginner guide, so either the instructions need to be fixed (don't use `angle`?) or the registry needs to be updated?
 Great, thank you!  We have several "Samsung Galaxy J3 Mission" phones.

Simple reproduction: camera entity with a cursor/raycaster as a child entity

- When VR isn't presenting, with or without a `position.y` set on the camera at all, the camera & child renders at the expected position
- When presenting, `position.y` on the camera entity appears to have no effect at all on the camera itself or the child entities
- Tested `position.x` and confirmed the child follows the correct Y axis

Basically, if you explicitly set the camera Y pos to 1.6 so that it matches the environment like Oculus, child entities drop to the floor when presenting. Might be the same issue reported in [this comment](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3342#issuecomment-358795710), as if your cursor isn't far enough from the camera, it disappears from sight + your raycaster height is off.

 @dmarcos my project is reporting `github:dmarcos/three.js#r89fix` and `2d651b7`, and the CodeSandbox repro the same three version with `5243a56` (latest patch). Issue exists on both.

Is the likely cause of this clear / is there a particular place I should start looking? I'm happy to spend some time investigating myself, although i'm not all that familiar with A-Frame/three.js source.

edit: after reading and fiddling with `WebVRManager#render` and `WebVRManager#getCamera` code for an hour or two I have determined I have no idea what I'm doing 🆘  I have also some difficulties with attaching enteties to my VR camera. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if it is a bug. It was working before with v0.7.0.

I have a sphere as a child of my VR camera (simulating the players head). As soon as I enter VR mode (Vive) the children of my camera stay at position 0 0 0, while the viewport (camera jumps to the the relative coordinates within my real room). From there I can see the Sphere follow the movements of my headset but at the position of the scene origin.

I also tried to wrap the sphere and all my head meshes within a single entity wrapper. Still the same behaviour. I may have fixed this in https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/13350 Er, I meant https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/13414 I'm not sure about the oculus y-axis issue, but if anyone is interested about the strange behaviour I was discovering on my project: I found a workaround and figured out that I can fix my problem by NOT using the "active: true" option for the camera (maybe I should open a seperate issue for this - but I'm not sure if this is a real issue - or my lack of knowlege about aframe).

In my project The player camera gets initialized later on when the info is pushed by the server. So A-Frame has already created the default camera. So I create a new camera for the player with `<a-entity camera="active: true">` once I received the order by the server.

Now there are two things happening when I enter VRmode (as mentioned it's fixed when I leave out the `active: true` part):

1. the y-position of the camera children (using a sphere with radius 0.3) is exactly off by the height of the sphere (0.6) - which I think should not be the case, as the origin of a sphere should be in the center.

2. The rotation of my camera seems not to be synchronized with the initial headset ratation what makes the children move in the wrong direction. So if the headset for ex. moves forward, the children also move farward but in the direction of their own forward axis which is not the same as the headset anymore. This leads to the strange effect, that you can watch the children dancing around like a mirror of youself from a different position.

As I figured out it seems that I do not have to use the `active: true` option to tell A-Frame to make the new camera the active one. So I can just leave it out and it's then working correctly. Still I feel this looks like a bug to me, right? Yes, I think so, but I will doulbe check when I have time in a couple of days. I'll try to create a stripped down version of my code and see if I can create a simple test case that reproduces the behaviour. @dmarcos @ngokevin master appears to have resolved the issue.

 Dear mate,
I am sooo sorry about that. 
My aim is to increase the performance.
1. As far as I know, the scene will go into infinity rendering loop (ie. keep updating 60 times per second) after loaded. 
2. Instead of doing that, I want it only render for 1 frame after loaded.
3. After that, the scene only update when I tell it to update (such as after changing the rotation or position of  an object).
Thank you soooo much for helping me.  I asked this on the slack channel and @dmarcos advised me to open an issue.

When viewing a basic scene on a Microsoft Windows tablet (with no keyboard attached) or a Samsung tablet, I can scroll horizontally in Chrome and Firefox (but not vertically). In Edge, there is no scrolling allowed at all.

And there is no motion detection on these devices. 

If no vertical scrolling can be achieved is it possible to add a directional button to reproduce the movement?

Can this be rectified or is it just not able to work in these tablets like on an iPad at the moment?

 Yes, I've tried that as well. No luck. The model still looks bad in VR on latest version while it looks fine on 0.5.0. With or without the setting.  I try to force antialias with `<a-scene antialias="true />`  in VR (GEAR - samsung S7) antialias is disabled. No way to force it ?

Before enter VR mode, edges are perfect

On A-Frame home page, When I turn back from VR mode, the aliases appears on the edges of shapes. Why that happened?
 I think i've found a solution to this problem...
After manually setting `antialias="true"` in `a-scene`, there still appears to be some rough edges on the shapes.
It appears that after turning VR-mode on and off again, the `pixel ratio` has changed in the renderer of the scene (WebGLRenderer.getPixelRatio()).
This is why this problem only appears to be on mobile devices where the device pixel ratio is higher than 1.

A manual fix (that worked for me) would be:
- Add an eventlistener to the scene for when you exit VR-mode
- Set the renderers pixel ratio to the correct pixel ratio:  `document.querySelector('a-scene').renderer.setPixelRatio( window.devicePixelRatio );`

I hope this fix will be implemented soon.  **Description:**

 Hi, I've encountered a similar behavior when I activate _embedded_ component in my vue/vue-router/quasar/webpack app (a-frame 0.8.0): 
- case 1 (OK): going directly to the scene url => the scene is visible (canvas width and size have normal values).  
- case 2 (NOT OK) : navigating from one url to the scene url (with vue-router programmatic navigation) => the scene is not visible (canvas width and size are equal to 0). If I resize the browser window,  the scene becomes visible (canvas width and size now have normal values).   Erratum : "canvas width and **height**". In my case, I finally found out that the problem had something to do with quasar modal : if modal shows up before the scene is initialized, the scene is rendered correctly.  Some thoughts
- I think you want to move the rig, and let local roomspace offsets apply to the rig children
- I think you want wasd-controls attached to what it is moving, and it would be good to have a selector reference if you want to also take into account the orientation of a child (like HMD camera)
- when implementing wasd-controls steered by another element like HMD camera, a little care may be required to ensure the proper orientation to move in (as the rig may itself be rotated) LGTM with some possible naming nits...

- there's no reason why the wasd-controls direction source needs to be a camera, so might want a more generic parameter name.

- there's no reason why the teleport-controls movement target needs to be a cameraRig, so might want a more generic parameter name.

- teleportOrigin seems a little verbose given that it's teleport-controls, but not a big deal Sanity check - if you force camera position to `0 1.6 0` will that cause problems in 6DOF VR? Great, confirming - no more user height parameter, entity with active camera will forcibly have position overridden in VR?  (E.g. if there is separate spectator camera, that one will NOT be overridden?) I created pull request to address this issue:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3394
  Entering VR with WinMR crashes Edge browser window.

To reproduce:
0. Set up your WinMR environment and confirm it works fine.
1. Open an Edge window and go to aframe.io Hello WebVR -- or directly to https://aframe-360-video-example.glitch.me/
2. Notice that 360 video plays fine in browser window -- either inside or outside VR.
3. Click the goggles button to enter VR with WinMR.
4. Notice that you get the correct transition animation into WebVR, but that it drops you back to the Cliff House scene (perhaps with a dormant Edge window).  If you started outside VR, notice the Edge window is gone / has crashed.

FYI, that 360 video example is using A-Frame 0.7.1 but this can be reproduced with master as well.

And the good news is that the fix exists in 17074 - so let me know how you go! For completeness -

One cannot use HTML to re-order pool objects, so this adds a backToFront param to pool.requestEntity(). If true, the available object created *last* is returned.  This is useful when each entity pulled from the pool is placed *farther* from the camera than previous entity, as when the player is flying through clouds.

For an example of use, see https://github.com/DougReeder/elfland-glider/tree/master/ginnungagap/index.html#L41

If it would work better as a parameter when creating the pool, I can rework this.

I agree to license my contributions under the MIT License. Setting the position of entities works fine.

The end goal is transparency working properly.  The renderOrder property does exist on the meshes, but setting it does not appear to have any effect on transparency.  Transparency *does* depend on the order in which objects are created.   See [this glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/trail-cause).  The second cloud is created after the first cloud and is nearer the camera. Transparency works properly for these two entities.  The third cloud is created after the first two, but is further away. The first two entities completely occlude the third, instead of being transparent.

 I'd prefer that transparency be independent of object allocation. However, *renderOrder does not* appear to have an effect, but the *order of allocation does*.  Can you show me an example like [this glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/trail-cause) where transparency works properly, without using the order of allocation?  After pointer lock reached master, i do some testing, it "feels" not good for me, so i revert back to mouse drag ( maybe its only for me because i working a lot with 360 videos) 

 Another vote against pointer lock being on by default, it breaks basic functions like click to play... https://aframevr.slack.com/archives/C0GG937RN/p1516719309000891?thread_ts=1516719309.000891&cid=C0GG937RN The standard way to distinguish between click and drag is to capture position on down, and check to see whether position has changed beyond tolerance on move and/or up... if yes then it's drag, if always no then it's click.  Not sure why that should be any different here? I prefer 'false' by default because with Edge on Mixed Reality portal, when you are in 2D mode (into a 6DoF room but showing your webVR content on a 2D floating window on Edge) if the webpage is trying to lock the cursor, a confirm dialog appears to allow or not to hide the pointer, and if you click Yes, the controllers disappear and is hard to know where are you pointing.  **Description:**

- A-Frame Version: 0.7.0 and 0.7.1
- Platform / Device: Firefox/Chrome
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:

I have a-frame scene with a menu that toggles visible/invisible, regardless of its visibility the raycaster always triggers though. So I edited the raycaster to only register .link objects, and I now change the objects classes when toggling the menu, and I also do a manual refresh of the raycaster. Still triggers. My controls:

```
<a-entity camera look-controls>
      <a-entity position="0 0 -3"
                geometry="primitive: ring; radiusOuter: 0.08;
                          radiusInner: 0.05; thetaLength: 360; thetaStart: 90;"
                material="color: cyan; shader: flat"
				        raycaster="objects: .link; recursive: false; autoRefresh: false"
                cursor="maxDistance: 500; fuse: true; timeout: 3000;">

      </a-entity>
    </a-entity>
``` So, ah, for whatever terrifying reason my cursor stops working completely on master... @wmurphyrd Possibly, though I don't believe so because I'm updating both the object's class and the template object's class (and I can see this in the inspector), the raycast just doesn't seem to acknowledge the change?  **Description:**

The default value of `THREE.Material.needsUpdate` is `true`. (It's set to `false` in `renderer.render()`)

Then  we need to set `false` to `material.needsUpdate` before `component.update()` call in shadow component's "sets needsUpdate on material" test to check if `.needsUpdate` is set to `true` in the component.

**Changes proposed:**
- sets `false` to `mesh.material.needsUpdate` before `component.update()` call in the "sets needsUpdate on material" test  **Description:**

 Yes -- if you look in the middle of my photo, you can see mini bamboo shoots and white particles from the particle system. I am not actively using the environment component, so that shouldn't be the issue. The particle system always causes the problem, but those bamboo shoots are just cylinders and shouldn't cause problem. Any thoughts? I'm not the only one experiencing this it seems.  I would like to be able to load an json file <Geometry export >from threejs editor. This json file only include BufferGeometry (a box)     A-Frame support  registerGeometry  such as  THREE.BoxBufferGeometry into frame entity.     but  THREE.BufferGeometryLoader   doesn't work,  Thanks!



  AFRAME.registerGeometry('box_loader', {
               init: function (data) {
                var loader,
             loader = new THREE.BufferGeometryLoader();
              this.geometry=loader.load('box.json',

You say I have been using the object - model method, because the import object with  materials, can't in aframe scene manually modify the material inside, this is very easy to modify in THREE ,so I want to import the geometry alone, without the import material method, custom geometry components in a - frame, then add <material - override> this component.

In this case I was some inspiration
https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/issues/167

I think if we can make this custom geometry components, is of great convenience to many of the specific project, looking forward to


 Thank you again for your reply
Often encounter such a situation, import operators or aframe objects with production softwares 3 dmax, Maya, Blender these modeling software to see the display of the different of the scene, these may be the problem of the export plug-in, you said so designers prefer real time adding color material in the scene, so that the final effect is you need.

In THREE load object is usually only a object  json  file, because it is at the time of loading can be defined to replace the material.If  object -model  loading time A-frame can also modify the material   is pretty good, of course only load the geometry file without material, less data, the speed will be faster.

Think there is such a vr scene, a car inside, if you want to be a key to replace the wheel parts, or   a key to replace body material, no matter use what format loaded geometry, must use the geometry of the custom components.Of course the json as the default format of three, I think is the most appropriate.Continue to look forward to you and the community as early as possible for this function, thanks!  Added a Glitch example to the docs, to demonstrate how to allow mouse clicks on entities with A-Frame.
 Sounds good. Just updated the Glitch project with basic hover effects for interaction feedback.
Decided to use the event-set component for those feedback interactions, since it's simpler to demonstrate than writing custom components in this context. But let me know if you think it should use a custom component with addEventListerer. Awesome, thanks!  **Description:**

- A-Frame Version: 0.7.0 and 6019885
- Platform / Device: Gear VR + Galaxy S6 running Android 7.0
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:

1. In Gear VR, launch Oculus browser
2. Navigate to https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/helloworld/
3. Focus reticle on enter-VR button and tap touchpad. Device enters VR mode normally
4. Tap or swipe touchpad
    * expected result: no effect, as no click hander is set
    * actual result: scene crashes w/ toast: "Page has crashed and been recovered"

A tap or swipe on a paired Gear VR Controller does *not* crash the scene

(Samsung Internet VR doesn't properly go to VR mode, so it's unclear whether it has a similar problem) We encountered the same issue while preparing our most recent production release and have determined it was an issue in `uglify-es`. We haven't worked out the exact version that introduced the issue, but we are having success building with `3.2.2`, and were facing the issue when using `3.3.5`. We haven't tested later versions.

We use `yarn`, have `uglify-es@^3.1.8` in our `package.json`, and although we enforce `frozen-lockfile` via `.yarnrc`, through a recent upgrade of `@storybook/react` we bumped our `uglify-es` version unintentionally. We solved it by using [yarn's selective dependency resolution](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/).

I'll update this later when we take a bit deeper of a look at what exactly was going wrong with uglification. Thanks! It's good to know there's a path to getting it working. - `uglify-es@3.3.7` (latest) has the same issue.
- When our page first renders we are seeing `components:text:error ReferenceError: nek is not defined` twice, presumably once for each of our 2 entities with the `text` component.Uglify is butchering [this function](https://github.com/mattdesl/word-wrapper/blob/master/index.js#L32), renaming it's args to something normal like `(a, b, c)` then where you'd expect `a.indexOf`, it puts `nek.indexOf`. Seems to be gracefully handled by A-Frame.
- Other functionality of our app is broken in Desktop Chrome with those versions of UglifyES due to things being `undefined`
- As per this issue, tapping the button immediately causes a crash. Can only speculate as to why, but presumably something similar.

The issue appears to be in UglifyES itself. It's affecting our entire app, not just A-Frame related code. It may be some specific configuration, but for now, we're settling for locking our version to `3.2.2` as we don't have the bandwidth to investigate further.

If someone has time, it'd be worth opening an issue on the Uglify repo. I couldn't see any related issues, but then again, I'm not really sure what I'm looking for.
  I turned a nested entity invisible by using `visible="false"`, the console returned an error that the `shader couldn't compile`. Error coming from `aframe.js`.

If I set it visible to true, the error is not thrown.

A-Frame doesn't seem to render background (whether it's a-sky or cubemap sky, it doesn't matter) when there are no other entities present to render. It happens only on mobile. You can reproduce it in the given URL on mobile device (I use Chrome on mobile). Steps to reproduce:

1.  Drag to a view where no boxes are present
2.  Enter VR Mode
3.  Exit VR Mode

If you exit VR with entities present on screen, everything will render as expected.
If you enter and exit VR when no boxes are present, it will show white screen - no backround. If the screen is white you can drag to a place where entity should be shown, it will finally render everything.
No demos from [https://aframe.io/](url) have this issue since there is always default cursor present on screen. 

Temporary fix I use for my demos is very distant, small entitity as a child of camera.

    **Description:**
Expected behavior: boxes scale up on click/touch.
  First example uses solely cursor="rayOrigin: mouse" - after i touch the box i expect the click to be emitted immediately, instead it emits after about 1500ms which might be fuseTimeout ( i didn't expect it to fuse after setting rayOrigin to mouse - i thought fuse is only for gaze based ). 
  The second examply uses cursor="rayOrigin: mouse; fuse: false". Again expected behavior is that click fires immediately on touch. Actual behavior: click fires after quick double tap, or tap once and then touchstart/drag anywhere on screen.

In both examples first box seems to be somehow initially selected - after touchmove anywhere on the screen it acts as clicked.

 about tomegz's [Example 2](https://private-scent.glitch.me/), i  got same issue in v0.7.1.

then i added log code for mouse event to a testing page   :  [mouse cursor example in codepen ](https://codepen.io/xiongbinsh/pen/vprMRK) something like:

`sceneEl.addEventListener("mousedown",function(e){ console.log(e) ;
console.log(this.components.raycaster.raycaster.ray.direction);
}) ` 

reproducing step:
- in mobile chrome browser(or from desktop chrome "shortcut  Ctrl-Shift-I, Ctrl-Shift-M" to mobile simulator )

- reload the codepen page metioned above and prepare to see logs in chrome dev console.

- tap anywhere in mobile (chrome simulator) screen and check the mouse event and ray direction data in the console outputs.

issue:
on the first time of tap, the ray direction in log is always {x: 0, y: 0, z: -1} 
then tap more times , each time the cursor ray 's direction( Vector3 object )  is not the data of current cursor direction, but the data of previous touch internally.

only found in mobile mode,  it seems  no same issue found in desktop mode of chrome.

 @wmurphyrd  many thanks for the update @wmurphyrd should this issue be closed?  @mkungla yes @aframevr/a-team can you close it!  **Description:**
Environment example not entirely working.

**Changes proposed:**
Fix environment component property (numDressing -> dressingAmount).
  I wanted to raise a question - would there be any drawbacks to updating the glTF-Model to have the ability to pass in a custom THREE.LoadingManager? This thought was brought up because I'm currently trying to handle relative paths in glTF files, and the best way I've found is using the @donmccurdy 's method in his custom glTF-Viewer which uses `THREE.LoadingManager.setURLModifier()` . 
Is there a reason that the LoadingManager is not available by default in Aframe? 

On a related note - @donmccurdy do you see any drawbacks to adding your relative URL interceptor code from your glTF-Viewer library into the official glTF-Model component directly (I could make a pull request depending on what you think)? I'm talking about this method: 
```
       //Intercept and override relative URLs.
        const manager = new THREE.LoadingManager();
        manager.setURLModifier((url, path) => {
          const normalizedURL = rootPath + url
            .replace(baseURL, '')
            .replace(/^(\.?\/)/, '');
          if (assetMap.has(normalizedURL)) {
            const blob = assetMap.get(normalizedURL);
            const blobURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
            blobURLs.push(blobURL);
            return blobURL;
          }
          return (path || '') + url;

        });
        const blobURLs = [];

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 this was more difficult than I initially thought - I think a custom component will have to be written that can parse a map of files, rewrite their relative paths, and add them to <a-assets> .. I'll try and bring this up on Slack and see what people have to say.   Nice! I do think that as best practice for 6DOF we could use example that use a player rig and teleport (even if we only do the shoot-the-floor version with laser-controls) The gaze cursor  is now disappearing when in VR mode on mobile devices. See related issue  #3375  I can't seem to get self-shadowing working on GLTF models. I can on the same model, using the .obj format instead though.

I'll test by exporting an object myself later today in Blender, and report back. Yeah looks like that was it thanks. Using the MetalRoughness node in export lead to no issues in rendering. Thanks!

Some brief research into the gltf export shows specGloss is not part of the GLTF 2.0 core anyhow which may explain some things (ext. 'KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness' required).  **Description:**
It's not obvious that component data is meant to be readonly. This can lead to confusion if a developer modifies data directly and it is later clobbered by a-frame.

**Changes proposed:**
- Add a note to the docs to clarify that component data is readonly and that `setAttribute` should be used instead.
  I can't seem to figure out why the mobile view of a-frame camera aspect ratio (a-marker-camera) is completely off. it's scaled so everything looks skinny in portrait mode, and wide in landscape. I am also getting this error in console:

dpdb.js:79 Failed to recalculate device parameters.

I've adjusted the css, and set the canvas width/height on a settimeout after it renders. Any way around this issue?

The body gets crazy high dimensions on mobile: width: 3557.33px; height: 2668px; margin-left: -1028.67px; margin-top: 0px; 

a-frame 0.7.1 Yes, they work great. I'm on ios 11.2.1, safari, iphone x

After https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/3d188db12742d162b2c9e60ffd0222f75acaffa1#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2 it seems that userHeight is not applied in devices using null stageParameters and the camera is on ground level. 

Should this be fixed on A-frame or do we need to fix this in Three.js? https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/11619

I have a wip in the Three.js WebVRManager class to to handle standingTransform and could make a PR if you want the code to be there.

What do you think?
 BTW where is stageParameters.sittingToStandingTransform used now for the headset camera? I only see references in tracked-controls.js file for handling gamepads   **Description:**
Currently most functions in an A-Frame call stack are named "value" due to the way elements are defined and registered.
This change makes use of the [displayName](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/displayName) property on functions to improve call stack readability.

Before:

After:

**Changes proposed:**
- Name functions on registered elements using the displayName property. The `test.only` was removed in `829dcc0`. Sweet, thanks.  **Description:**

  In Cordova/PhoneGap using WKWebview, it does not enter the conditional "if (this.isIOS) ", so the issue remains. If I remove the conditional, it fixes it

  I'm a total rookie so I'm probably making a mistake but it seems this line may be missing a '</video>' tag?

   On touch enabled devices, tapping the screen causes the click event to be called twice - once due to a TouchEvent and once due to a MouseEvent. Need a mechanism to fire only 1 event.

click/touch the red sphere in -
http://asc-702-ubuntuvm.main.ad.rit.edu/VR/electrostatics/index.html

Click causes single change of color. Touch causes 2 changes. So I don't foresee this being 'fixed' anytime soon, thankfully with a little user patience it can be avoided~

So if you have control over the listener method, like if you register a `cursor-listener` method yourself you can make a boolean globally for the dom's overall click method to have it wait a few seconds before setting that boolean to true and allowing your methods to execute:
```javascript
var isDelayed = false;
  $("html").on("click", function() {
    setTimeout(function() {
      isDelayed = true;
    }, 1000)
if (isDelayed) {
 //execute
}
```

In other circumstances, like on a page where we use the A-Frame Link component you can affect object attributes such that they won't double click and misbehave. Link has an `on` prop which defaults to `click`:
```javascript
link.setAttribute('link', {
 "href": "#",
 "title": marker,
 'image': preview,
 'on': "blah"
 });
setTimeout(function() {
 link.setAttribute('link', {
 'on': "click"
 });
 }, 1000);
```

Users who like to click frantically might panic, but most won't notice the subtle delay that waits just long enough to prevent A-Frame Mobile's invisible thumb from clicking on it
 @kezzsim you're seeing this still in 0.8.0? I thought I had fixed this one Oh, Gyro is still broken in 0.8.0 on Mobile Chrome 65 with the current release (`https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/c4aa63e/dist/aframe-master.min.js`)
So we had to roll back to 0.7.1 to get that functionality.

If you have a more elegant solution that can be implemented in 0.7.1 for the time being it would be greatly appreciated, as currently with links this only works a small portion of the time - it appears mobile chrome has a really hard time adding the on click attribute after the object is initialized.

You can see what I've been working on [here](http://apps.tlt.stonybrook.edu/unionProject/matrix.html) to get an idea, I want it to spawn a link entity after clicking on one of those rectangles - but on mobile it normally clicks twice and doesn't give the user any time to look at the preview link, for now I've added the interval which prevents that from happening but now most times on Mobile I can't get it to click at all... Any progress? Or new ideas for a workarounds?  please update the default value in the documentation as well  **Description:**

https://a-frobot.github.io/aframe/examples/boilerplate/360-video/ only shows black. https://a-frobot.github.io/aframe/examples/test/videosphere/ is also broken and only shows black. duplicate of #3287  @mkungla it's not a duplicate in the sense that text being broken is separate from 360 video being broken, right?  although the root cause may be the same.  @ngokevin hmm, so that isn't great... hadn't seen any reason for that to break with newer three.js? So what did we decide to do here, change videosphere to use `side:back`, or make negative scale work again?  (If the former, we probably want to note negative scale change as potentially breaking) (Sadly, yes) I found this issue when trying to use aframe master on my project.
I confirm the issue is related to mrdoob/three.js#12787
I have lots of the following warnings too:
`
THREE.Matrix4: .getInverse() can't invert matrix, determinant is 0
`
`
THREE.Matrix3: .getInverse() can't invert matrix, determinant is 0
`
because of `frontFaceCW` calculation in mrdoob/three.js#12787 (I tested to set it to false and do my own aframe build, the warnings and the black texture issue are gone)

You need `material="side:back; ..."` and a negative scale like scale="-1 1 1" otherwise the texture is flipped. But I still have warnings `.getInverse() can't invert matrix, determinant is 0`.

 My recollection is that changes are needed to `a-sky`, `a-videosphere`, and `a-curvedimage` although I haven't had time yet for PR.  But I haven't seen that matrix error yet The matrix warnings are probably related to other entities in my scene, may not be related to a sphere geometry. @dmarcos @machenmusik

  I have a problem in how VR mode is generated in A-Frame 0.7.0 in my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It worked good with A-Frame 0.3.2. Now, with A-Frame 0.7.0, it appears in this way:

When I put mobile phone inside a cardboard I see everything doubled. Screen is divided in bad way.
  I've just downloaded Chrome Canary, enabled WebVR flags, and tried A-Frame samples, but although pose seems to work, it doesn't present on the headset, it just goes fullscreen. I tried webvr.info and threejs examples (https://threejs.org/examples/?q=vr#webvr_cubes) and they work.

 (Even when the OpenVR flag is thrown?) I wonder if this is A-Frame taking too long to set up like the vr2vr traversal issues earlier? I have also been experiencing this problem over the last several months.  I just assumed it was a chrome canary issue since firefox worked fine.  However, I was testing with a native three.js app and realized that chrome canary worked fine.   Then I searched google and found this ticket.

Anyway, as of 2018-02-20, I did a git pull, and using 'dist/aframe-master.js', I am now able to enter VR with aframe and chrome canary (not the 'aframe-v0.7.1.js though).   I have problems with either the enter-vr button not showing or not working, so I have to press the "f" key to enter VR.  I also don't seem to get split-screen console tracking in the browser.  But when I put on the HMD, I see everything with tracking.  I have an oculus, but I see the characteristic "steam/vive vr circle", which indicates to me it's  probably doing Vive emulation of some sort.  Also, the default orientation is off (I have to look to the side to see the image) but aside from these issues everything seems to work.  Does the padding handle the various align settings e.g. if you right align, does the padding work correctly, or does it act as left padding and the text goes outside the plane?  If center align, does it pad both sides? Oh ok, so literally just offset, not actually padding.  Nice!   **Description:**

https://mozvr.com/webvr-demos/demos/nepal/  The latest three.js release corrected how handling gamma output with sRGB colorspace images: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/12554

Can we have a build which is bundled with Three.js r88+ release? Even if it's in own branch or not named as `aframe-master.min.js`? A vote for `renderer.gammaOutput = true` and `encoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding` as defaults from me!  **Description:**
The events mouseenter, mouseleve and click are only triggered if the two rays of the controllers meet on the element. A single controller's ray does not emit any of these events.

 Yes, it reproduces in master and the ray of the right controller is truncated. Using v0.6.0 either the left or right ray is truncated. It seems to be changing during a session. The controller which has not a truncated ray correctly triggers the events on the elements.

 If It add objects: [test] to the raycasters, it works. Like in the laser-controls example by A-Frame. But it should work if collisions are tested on everything as well, or? Thanks a lot! Using `near:1` worked, without setting the `object` parameter. I know that using `object` would be best practice for performance reasons. 

I am not sure if we should mention this solution in the docs.  What's the policy for cases when multiple cameras have the "active" attribute set to true? Does A-Frame have a way of guaranteeing that one camera will be the winner based on some criteria? Or will the winner simply be the camera who had active set to true last after all others? The reason I was curious is because in creating an HTML spec (f.e. if w3c were to take ideas from A-Frame) I think there'd need to be a guaranteed definition for "if multiple cameras have the active attribute, which camera is deterministically chosen to be active?" so that multiple implementations reading the HTML can all be spec'd to behave the same way. The answer could possibly be something simple like "the first camera found in pre-order traversal" or something guaranteed. This example answer would require an extra tree traversal before rendering, unless the Three WebGLRenderer is forked and the camera is detected during the render traversal, in which case the renderer call would be just `renderer.render(scene)` without the `camera` arg and would require scenes to contain cameras unlike current Three scenes.

The reason I ask is because I'm thinking about it at [trusktr/infamous](https://github.com/trusktr/infamous/tree/threejs) which is similar to A-Frame in some ways (i.e. using Three.js behind the scenes for WebGL rendering). [Basic Demo](https://codepen.io/trusktr/pen/bYKXLd) Given that A-Frame uses virtual DOM, I would be hesitant to adopt anything that requires updating / relying on full DOM for consistent behavior due to performance considerations.

At the moment, I've done spectator implementation using separate WebGLRenderer (for a traditional 2D spectator view on the PC while rendering to connected HMD, for example) - not sure where @dmarcos has gotten with his latest  **Description:**

On Master:
When using laser-controls the ray of the right controller is truncated. No entities are attached to the controller (no intersection). The left controller is working (click event as well) and the ray has its full length. The right controller's ray is not going far enough to reach an element to click on.

On 0.7.0 both rays have the right length, but clicking on elements does not work. If there is only one controller, then clicking works as well.

 Yes this example works in 0.7.0. It uses the mousedown event instead of click. But click should work too, or? Ok, thanks. But on current master the ray of one controller is truncated.  Hi
I have a moving box with a camera on top of it. I want to switch to a different camera on the scene. I'm using jquery doubleclick to switch cameras. But when the camera switches, the object stops moving. Any ideas?

 Never mind. I can circumvent this using the custom events.  If you try to update offset or repeat parameter of a material don't update correctly.

```` I think this also applies to this issue #3387 here too.  Adds a short explainer and links to the animation-mixer component from aframe-extras to help people use animations in their glTF models

**Description:**

I was asked how to get animations for a glTF model to work and I was surprised to find that the documentation mentions nothing about that.

**Changes proposed:**
- Explain that animations are supported via the `animation-mixer` component
- link to aframe-extras docs for the `animation-mixer` component
 @donmccurdy docs fixed :)  @donmccurdy  I modified your example a little bit [codepen](https://codepen.io/mkungla/pen/OOZjjy).
I do agree that expected would be to see `system play` when `scene.play()` is called. 
 
However I never have seen actual usage `.play()` and `.pause()` in systems.  
Using `init()` or `update()` for setting up the system and adding custom methods which can be then called by different components like `this.system.doSomething()` has been more than enough for me and I have a feeling that `.play()` and `.pause()` in system context don not make much sense actually.

  We love AFrame and were looking to create an AFrame-[Mavo](https://mavo.io) demo, because we think it's a match made in heaven.

Sadly, it looks like AFrame components do not behave like normal HTML elements. We'd rather avoid having AFrame-specific code, and I suspect other libraries would have similar concerns.
The whole point of Web Components is that they’re supposed to work like normal HTML elements, and libraries that are element-agnostic should work with them out of the box.

Thankfully, it looks like we can still use `element.attributes[attrName]` and that works as expected.
However, the fact that `element.getAttribute()` returns an object will likely break a lot of code out there that assumes string or null.
Why not use the existing convention where `element.property` returns the object and `element.getAttribute()` the actual string (valid or not)? I can understand why you'd need object-based access instead of string-based for performance, but I don't understand why it's important to provide that object-based access by overwriting a standard method that is supposed to return a string.  If you're going to break the standard, why not do so by adding your own non-standard method so that the original one still works as advertised?  hi
I import model to a-fram with obj and mtl type  like this :  

`<a-obj-model src="models/ladybug.obj" mtl="models/ladybug.mtl" scale="0.03 0.03 0.03"></a-obj-model>
`

How Can I  render this model in a-fram with realistic quality like vray in c4d or similar render engin  Hi Kevin,

my components are kind of relying on this behavior. May we have an API on the raycaster to clear the current selected intersections, so that a new gets thrown each timeout?

Thx @ngokevin, using the method mentioned above would I be able to get the point of intersection aswell?  How to change line width or radius??

As title, if I use ```camera.setAttribute('rotation', '0 180 0')```, it changed and successfully triggered componentchanged event; But in case that I change by ```<a-camera :rotation="`${x} ${y} ${z}"></a-camera>```, it won't happen trigger anything. I remember it worked with v0.5.0. Could it possible fixed?  Hello, 

We experience an issue when we preview aframe scenes through Webview in Android apps after Chrome/Webview update to version 62.0 (was working fine on previous versions). The aframe scene initializes and works fine but it does not respond to the device movements (seems like it doesn't communicate with gyroscope to update vr camera's rotation), although rotation using touch events works fine.

We have this problem embedding our project, that uses aframe version 0.5, also had the same result when we tried to embed examples from aframe's website (including https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/helloworld/ which uses version 0.7)

  When you download a file, at least on mac, by default the disk permissions of an unzipped directory is 700 instead of 755. This will give you a 403 error if you try to load it via a local webserver.  However, when using the GLTF loader the console never shows this 403 error. Instead you just get a timeout.

Looking at the code to the GLTF loader:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/gltf-model.js

The error handling code is not printing the error message to the console. I'm not sure it's even being called. Does 'warn' need to be upgraded to something stronger?

Also, by default, the model is only visible below the user. Is it being placed at 0,0,0?  It's not clear how to move it once loaded.


 if you set position='0 0 -3' on the same entity that i'm loading the model for, then i can see it. so a-assets is hiding the underlying XHR error?

 Hi guys,

FWIW, I'm using Cesium's obj2gltf to convert obj to gltf 2.0. I've been trying to load an object into aframe locally but I cannot properly diagnose what's wrong with the scene because `components:gltf-model:warn THREE.GLTFLoader: Unable to parse model. `. I've tried `chmod 755 model.gtlf` and that doesn't work either.

Just to sanity check the model, I used @donmccurdy gltf 2.0 loader and the model loads correctly with textures.

Yes, I'm using `live-server`.

  I think there's a issue with text transparency/opacity in the lastest master build. I see a text through a plain with opacity=1.
In 0.7.0 seems fine.

 @dmarcos is right. By removing the changes in c1403a27c6ad465ff337c9399365e0da67903112, text renders behind objects again. Tested with latest master 21cc89169a36. @ngokevin @dmarcos I hear the 0.8.0 release is soon. I think you will get a lot of issues filled from this if it remains. I'm on holiday, but I have a long train journey tomorrow when I think I could tackle it. @wmurphyrd my project is full of text and these problems so let me know if you want me to help test anything.  Looks like this was fixed in ff24dbdccd97c798033c2005c521009b4ae55196

Should be OK to close this issue  **Description:**
a-frame elements with src attribute are download twice. The devTools show that the two requests are initiated by src-loader.js:102 and three.js:30486. This occurs with aframe.min.js versions 0.7.0 and 0.7.1


- A-Frame Version: 0.7.0 and 0.7.1
- Platform / Device: OSX El Capitan using Chrome 62, Firefox Quantum 57, and Opera 48 browsers
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: If you open https://www.utkarshgoel.in/webvr/test1.html or https://www.utkarshgoel.in/webvr/test.html and check the resources requested by the browser in the network tab in devTools, you will see that images PIA15482.jpg and earth_atmos_4096.jpg are requested twice. Further, if you observe the page load process closely, you will onserve that the image doesn't display until both requests for that image are completed.

From the chrome devTools, it appears that for the second request, the browser or the code is adding an "origin" header in the request, which is making the browser believe that the second request is different from the first one.

I'd appreciate if someone can investigate as to why aframe.min.js is causing two requests. Thanks @dmarcos @ngokevin : I tried using a-assets and the browser did not make two requests. Thank you! This works for img and video assets, but not for audio. Can you suggest how to prevent loading audio files twice?  When .dae / .obj / .json models used, the PNG textures transparency applied on those models is not presented, as in other viewers.

 @donmccurdy Done  I have a bug with the a-plane tag and it is visible only on fullscreen (VR mode), I am using it to display informations on it with the material attribute ( i am using the library https://unpkg.com/aframe-html-shader@0.2.0 for the html-shader).The a-planes are created dynamically with js and not html (static) and it's visible attribute is changed when a click is made in a obj-model. I am sure the change of the visible attribute is made because we can see the plane on fullscreen (VR mode).  Also even if i'm not on fullscreen the events i have added to the a-plane (click and mouseenter) still work : when i click on the area the a-plane is supposed to be the click and mouseenter event are trigered (even though they are not visible).

 i'm not sure what you mean, but in the click event the only thing we're doing is changing the visible attribute of the plane. So we are already doing nothing after. Do you have any others test ideas for me to try and find the source of the problem?   This PR is related to issue #3230.

**Description:**
In iOS, orientation changes firing `AScene.resize` may erroneously set the canvas size, reducing the visible area by half:
![portrait](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2229853/32746853-93e734fe-c87c-11e7-9df9-6f8694b5b669.PNG)

This occurs only in non-embedded scenes because the values in `window.innerHeight` and `window.innerWidth` (used by `getCanvasSize()`) are incorrect mid-transition in some browsers. Affected (so far): iOS Chrome, and Safari when the page is launched full-screen via a home screen bookmark.

**Changes proposed:**
- Modify `AScene.resize` to institute a 100ms delay before resizing via `getCanvasSize()` for non-embedded scenes on iOS devices.

Created  experimental repository [mkungla/aframe-lite](https://github.com/mkungla/aframe-lite) where all the excessive noise has been removed reducing repository size **50** times and improving commit log readability. 

**Results**

|  repository  |   commits  | size | 
| -------------- | ------------- | ---- |
| [aframevr/aframe](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe) | 3986 | 233M |
| [mkungla/aframe-lite](https://github.com/mkungla/aframe-lite) | 2644 | 4.4 M |

**Conclusion**

Rewriting Git's history at this stage of the project is rather challenging, but not impossible. I think, in addition to reducing the size of the repository, attention should also be drawn to the readability of Git's history. As @a-frobot already has over 600 commits in less than a year, which is relatively verbose and has created a disturbing noise to track the actual development of A-Frame.

-  `./dist` could be in [aframevr/releases](https://github.com/aframevr/releases) repository
which would not require much effort to update links and references and besides @a-robot could do its job there.
- `./examples` are one of the most biggest git objects in the git object database so it would be reasonable to move these to own repository to avoid repository growth over GB's near future.
- `./docs` and `gh-pages`  could also be painlessly moved to other repository together with A-Frame site content e.g.
- `npm package` could be built by CI/CD where "aframe.js" could be created including injection of package data wanted like version etc. Or better with git annotated / signed tags. Instead of having new commit :ref updating [src/index.js](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/index.js#L86) upon every change.

What are your thoughts? Do you see this as a potential issue, or can this become a issue in the near future?


 really it would be better for any assets that may be under `./examples` to be in aframevr/assets to go on CDN, but that probably implies that Safari CORS fixes would need to be widely deployed for that to work

the rest of it is (comparatively speaking) noise floor, isn't it? looks like .git  using 213M
is it possible to reduce this? 
868K	./tests
40K	./scripts

 @arpu basically yes take a look at test repo where I did that [mkungla/aframe-lite](https://github.com/mkungla/aframe-lite) I rewrote the history and removed the noise which makes repo so big. Resulting size I got from ca 200 MB to 4.5 MB

However there will be challenges to do such rewrite. It will impact all forks and devs having to migrate to rewrited history. However that procedure could be written out clearly and easy to follow. @mkungla looks like the --depth  is the best practice here 

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe

 yes in many cases it is the way to go. @ngokevin  what help is here needed? i think this can be closed?  **Description:**
As mentioned [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1346#issuecomment-340851877) the Samsung Internet VR Browser does not correctly display aframe, instead showing the game through two eyeholes. This pull request was intended to fix that but instead it simply shows the aframe game on a screen (like a watching it on a cinema screen). So this is an improvement but not a fix.

**Changes proposed:**
- Make _isMobile false if on gearvr.
- See [this](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1346#issuecomment-340861743) comment made by @dbradleyfl
 I don't understand what is the issue here.
I'm using GearVR with Oculus browser and Samsung Internet VR with no issue with the S8 phone.
Unless you have this issue https://twitter.com/fernandojsg/status/924985106372100096 ?
@fernandojsg was this with a S6 phone and Samsung Internet? Do you still have this issue?
@Marchhill what phone do you use? @vincentfretin sorry forgot to mention I am using S7 Here is a comparison of before and after the pr:
![before](http://i.cubeupload.com/pNn1q4.jpg)
![after](http://i.cubeupload.com/PCCOyh.jpg) This PR is not a fix. A-Frame and other VR Content works fine with Oculus Browser.
Issue described here is latest problem with Samsung Internet it self that no VR content works correctly with that so therefore nothing to do with A-Frame.  GearVR Users have to make sure that their Oculus Software on GearVR is up to date and use shipped Oculus Browser instead of Samsung Internet until last one has solved their bugs.  OK then why don't we suggest that an issue be filed against https://github.com/SamsungInternet/support
similar to 
https://github.com/SamsungInternet/support/issues/22
and close this one here? @dmarcos aha yes that is it  **Description:**

- Latest version of A-frame
- Android

After some testing, i found the issue which i am getting when i try to use [I Am cardboard headset](https://www.imcardboard.com/cardboard-vr-v2-box-132.html) with [Samsung Note 3](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_note_3-5665.php) .

The problem is that objects are duplicated, while it perfectly works with other devices having screen size under 5.7 in.

Any suggestions?

When I try to run this test snippet, the gearvr controller model does not show up and the 'trackpaddown' event is not being fired, I have tried this with multiple aframe versions but to no avail. I have posted this as an issue rather than a support question because [this](https://chenzlabs.github.io/gearvr-controls/) example (that the gearvr component came from) does not seem to work either.

When I try to open any aframe scene with an S8 device, I get double vision and blurry effects. If the lenses are moved far apart, the stereo view gets a little better, but you see everything blurry because the images do not align with the focus centre of the eyes.

So my assumption is that te weird aspect ratio of the S8 (18.5:9 instead of 16:9)  is causing problems with the two vr cameras and the 3d stereo view. The eye centers are not correct because the whole screen is being used for VR.

 Are you receiving the "No DPDB device match" warning in the console? Which browser are you using? More importantly, are you using the WebVR polyfill? (can test quickly by checking the output of `navigator.getVRDisplays().then(console.log)`)

We've experienced similar issues when no or incorrect device data was found while using the WebVR Polyfill. It has fallback dimensions which vary in inaccuracy, and it can also calculate the wrong dimensions even on a successful device match if your device uses non-default resolution and the match's data doesn't include resolution specific PPI.

Sorry if this is off base; I don't have an S8 at the moment but we're currently testing across a broad range of devices prior to a product launch and I'm curious if this is related to what we've experienced. My recollection is that S8 forces full resolution for GearVR mode (actually never checked Daydream) but if you are invoking as Cardboard and not Daydream, the phone may use current resolution, which differs if in power saving mode for example (which I personally use whenever out of VR), and that may cause polyfill mismatch.  @mkeblx thoughts? - WebVR Polyfill Version: ^0.9.36

Thanks for leading me trough this, for some reason I did not think about debugging the phone remotely. First time, yeey.
Please let me know if you need more information The same problem occurs with these samples Seems like WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb#25 is related Currently, I have the same problem with Samsung S7 Edge Thank you! Thank you very much.  Yes! With the workaround it works perfectly. So, isn't there a possibility to solve this issue without setting maximum resolution? Thanks a lot everyone. I am in brussels now at the w3c webvr authoring workshop and will try to have a talk with someone that works on the polyfill This was an issue with webvr-polyfil, so it should be fixed with this PR: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3492

I think it's safe to close this issue. I'm afraid this seems to still be a problem - I'm using the `master` version of aframe with the latest polyfill and I am still having this issue on a Galaxy S8 when the display resolution is not set to maximum.

``` I'm also getting the double-vision problem on a Samsung S8, with a Cardboard viewer and a standard WebVR sample (https://webvr.info/samples/03-vr-presentation.html?polyfill=1), with the resolution turned all the way up to 2960x1440. (I've tried all 3 available resolutions.)

By comparison, the same headset and scene align perfectly on an iPhone 6s.

Is there any other workaround besides changing the screen resolution?

EDIT: Here's the console output from the WebVR polyfill sample. This displays regardless of the resolution the Samsung phone is set to.

 @naftalibeder I had success setting the camera offset value for S8.

Can try looking at the phi-start attribute for the stereo cam component.

```html
      <!-- aframe-stereo-component enabled a-sky -->
      <a-sky id="sky1" src="#left" stereo="eye:left" phi-start="0"></a-sky>
      <a-sky id="sky2" src="#right" stereo="eye:right" phi-start="0"></a-sky>
```

javascript method to find the value to offset.
to find the height value from a 16:9 ratio of the screen width
and calculating the radian value from the height difference
and setting the camera offset based on the radian value.
```javascript
    var screenwidth = window.screen.width;
    var screenheight = window.screen.height;

    // screen height with 16/9 ratio
    var screenheightratiovalue = screenwidth * 16 / 9; 
    var screenoffsetheight = screenheight - screenheightratiovalue;

   // radian offset for screen's actual ratio difference from screen's 16/9 ratio
   // this part still a little iffy, the *2 might be because of the split screen, though it worked on my test phone for this value so hope to get some feedback
   // maybe there is a much more accurate formula
    var radiansoffset = (screenoffsetheight / screenheight) * 180 / Math.PI * 2;
    if(radiansoffset < 0) { radiansoffset = 0; } 
    var sky1 = document.querySelector('#sky1');
    sky1.setAttribute("phi-start", radiansoffset);
```

Actually am quite looking forward to see if such a fix will solve yours as well or it has only fixed my specific device. I am having serious issues with this! What is the clear fix for it?  Per discussion on #3210. re: clicking - I can remove the toggling and just make click trigger play, to fix that.
re: first time DOM timing issue and WebGL errors - can you say more about your configuration / browser at the time?  always, or intermittent?  main page, or detail? OK I think those issues are addressed now
- click to play only, no toggling to avoid pause on mouse drag, etc.
- for main page, which uses MP4 and may not be streaming, don't shorten the a-assets timeout

When you try to manually set rotation on camera it works fine on desktop, but has no affect on mobile devices, e.g.:
`  camera.setAttribute('rotation', {x:0, y:0, z:0});` wouldn't work @dmarcos
Thank you, i know that it is bad practice to manually set rotation, but i make it when user does not see anything and seems that is the only possible way in my situation. The idea is to make it possible for user to look at the object closer in special scene and communicate with it using rotation controls. So when user entering this scene his camera should be rotated straight  on the object despite in what direction he was looking before. So this is workflow for interaction: User goes throw scene A -> User clicks on object -> Scene switching animation starts -> User and object got moved to some specific place (scene B) -> Camera rotations sets straight to new object position -> animation ends, user is watching closely on the object.
The problem is that even if I use `cameraEl.setAttribute('look-controls', 'enabled', false);` and the user moves a phone just a little bit camera rotation would be set to its previous rotation from scene A. I think that's because our device is still physically in position looking on object in scene A. Maybe there are some ways to reset initial gyroscope values? So after switching to scene B '0 0 0' values for gyroscope would be set for physical position in which the phone is.  **Description:**

I could not find a reliable way to reliably disable default lights on an `a-scene` which is inserted from JavaScript rather than already present in the HTML. The closest I could get is https://glitch.com/edit/#!/substantial-latex?path=index.html:14:0 , and that does not seem to work on Chrome.

 That does not work for dynamically inserted elements, which is why I opened this ticket. It only works for elements which are already in the HTML. "Whenever we add any lights, A-Frame removes the default lights from the scene." - Could you add your own ambient and directional lights with intensity 0 by default, then in JS remove them on page load?  Per discussion on #2830, this PR replaces the previous example of 360 video in the repo to redirect to an example Glitch.  The example takes advantage of recently-merged #3176 to show how a video can be specified as HLS and MP4.  The primary usage I saw was the sidebar link for 360 video, and rather than changing all of those links to point at Glitch directly (which is not versioned, so potential issues if we change things later), I changed the target to be a stub.  That also allows previous links to the destination from external sites or personal bookmarks to be redirected to the new Glitch.

Is there a list of all the other places to change?  Happy to change those to direct Glitch links where it makes sense As an example of the kind of concerns I have:

- The docs/primitive/videosphere.md page links to the edit page for a Glitch example.  It is unclear to me whether this example link should be changed or not.

- The Glitch example, when you go and look at it, is referencing an older version of A-Frame (0.6.1).  If there were breaking changes between 0.6.1 and now, the same Glitch would be stuck failing for one or the other, as the Glitch itself is not versioned.

- The Glitch example, when you go and look at it, has been edited (probably unintentionally) so that it is rotated 80 degrees instead of 180 degrees.  We need a way to make the Glitch viewable, but require remix to edit.

 ok - anywhere else? ok, so yes there is some confusion.

isn't the A-Frame homepage sidebar this?  (when you click it, currently goes to the boilerplate 360-video example not its source; this changes to go to glitch not its source, but could easily go to its source if that is what you wanted)
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3210/commits/7309eca64660e6c7e494afdf7c031fd4e7b23b1a

and you'd simply like to revert this, leaving the previous example unchanged but no longer linked?

 I did specifically ask about the existing documentation but no answer, only about site sidebar:
```
The docs/primitive/videosphere.md page links to the edit page for a Glitch example. It is unclear to me whether this example link should be changed or not.
``` got it, thanks!

The branch for this PR now has just the docs example link change.  Did you want to reopen this one, or have me do another PR?

The homepage link is in a different repo I presume, will find it and address there.  Using latest versions of A-Frame on Android Mobile and iPhone iOS 11

Im using a-frame and a-video with videos in webm and mp4 formats, android and iphone.
With webm all good. With mp4 all good in both platforms also except for one thing that is causing me trouble. When I put the video in loop mode, loop is true, then when the video arrives to the end, and before restarting, the video texture goes black, black rectangle for like 1 frame and then restarts again from the beginning normally. Also when the video gets activated for the first time following the click on a button by a user, again for like half a second the video appears like a black rectangle and then starts playing well and normally. 

What happens when playing the video the first time I can understand as maybe after the button click the video is still loading and that´s why it appears black for half a second. If that´s the case how can prevent the video to show until it is fully loaded?

But the second  case I don´t understand. When the mp4 is set to loop, between end of video and beginning again, it  appears black for a frame or so. Why is that happening and how can I prevent it?
By the way I have noticed that these issues seem to happen more with the iphones than the android, although it happens in both. Thank you for any help

  I've added a click and mouseenter listener on my cursor but it seems to only work after i open the aframe inspector ( ctrl + alt + i ), it also works using my mouse instead of the cursor (but then not compatible with phone or VR glases) .Any ideas why this could be happening ? I am facing the same problem. Did you find a fix for this? I noticed that with primitives it will work. Objects with custom models will have their size not matching the object size. This will cause the raycaster to not register the clicks. Try using the "geometry='primivitve: box'" on your custom model and you'll notice a tiny box on loading the scene. After opening the inspector it seems like it recalculates the width and height of the objects so the raycaster intersects properly with the objects. Thank you it worked ! I hope they get the problem fixed Sure. 
Here is the code i use for the cursor (when the users on mobile)
cursor.setAttribute('id', 'cursor');
cursor.setAttribute('fuse', 'true');
cursor.setAttribute('fuseTimeout', '500');
cursor.setAttribute('raycaster','objects: .collidable');
camera.appendChild(cursor);	

and then the only thing i do is i create an a-obj-model tag that uses a .obj file to "render" ( not sure for the use of the word) like : 
-var b=document.createElement('a-obj-model');
b.setAttribute('class','collidable');
b.setAttribute ('src','media/pininfo.obj'); //src of my 3D object
// then i added it to the scenes (there are others attributes I set like scale, position, rotation, look-at and maybe some others). And also click event (that trigers with the fuse time out) 
The funny things is i just put an invisble cube in front of one my 3D obj to do the first interaction (with the click event) and then all 3D objects seem to work normally (there is maximum 10 3D obj in average in my scene). Hope it helps !  Ah sorry i'm affraid i can't  I had the same problem and spend the last two days finding out what is going on. It seems that the internal array of the objects the raycaster tries to intersect with only gets populated once on startup. After that, the custom models are loaded, but the internal array of the raycaster does not get updated. My solution was to call raycaster.refreshObjects() AFTER the models had loaded.  **Description:**

Currently, one of the barriers to supporting multiple scenes (see #916) on the same page is that components and systems do not interact correctly when multiple scenes exist.

Each scene contains its own systems, but the last scene to initialise always overwrites the global `Component.__proto__.system` property of its components. This means that systems and components for earlier scenes no longer function correctly (for instance lights don't attach themselves to their correct lights system, meaning default lighting isn't disabled).

This fixes that by initialising components _after_ they have been attached to the scene, and setting their `Component.system` instance property to the correct scene system. Any attempts to update component properties before this happens are queued and then processed after attachment and initialisation; However DOM updates still occur as expected, to ensure DOM manipulation and debug serialisation still all work as expected.

**Changes proposed:**
- `Component.__proto__.system` is now longer set by systems upon system initialisation
- Component initialisation now occurs as a result of the `load()` callback and `updateComponents()` once the entity has been attached to a scene
- Component initialisation sets its local `system` by accessing its local `el.sceneEl.systems`. This occurs immediately within the `Component` base ctor, before local construction and `init` occurs.
- Attempts to update the properties of components before initialisation occurs succeed successfully and update the DOM where expected. The actual component update, however, is queued and only executed once `updateComponents()` has been called on the attached parent entity. I also started clearing sceneEl on entity detach, but this was breaking unit tests, so I undid that.

This feels like a dependency on broken behaviour?

The docs simply say "An entity has a reference to its scene element.". Which would indicate to me it would be null if an entity was no longer attached a scene.

But if it's cleared on detach things break, so I set it back to lingering on whatever it used to be :S Okay, there's also a few tests that intentionally try and access the raw component objects of entities before they're attached to a scene, or attach entities to a `<body>` instead of an `<a-scene>`. These fail :S

I'd be in favour of adding a caveat rule to the first (that the entity must be in a scene before the component objects can be accessed), in order to support multiple scenes, and changing the latter as it feels like incorrect/undefined behaviour.  Currently using the latest versions on PC/Mac/Android/iPhone
My issue is about video formats.
Webm works great but it's not accepted by Apple/iOS.
So I'm looking for an alternative video format that supports Alpha Channel for Apple.
I have tried MOV but it is not playing with aFrame.
What video format does aFrame accept that has alpha channel and is accepted by iOS devices?

It also seems impossible to find anywhere which are the video formats supported by a-Frame. 

The only alternative I found for apple was to use animated gifs with the plugin from mayognaise, but that has a big issue, flickering caused when clearing the canvas in between each frame. 

It would really be great if you actually told me that there is a alpha channel capable video format supported that works on iOS, as I say documentation about the video formats seems impossible to find

Thank you at the end of the day what I need is with a very short video, use alpha transparency that works on both android and iOS,  I Can use a video format , I can use animated GIFS, I can use mp4 and mask out the background color which is constant if that's a possibility, but there must be a way, in android it's so easy with Webm, but ive been all day researching and I cannot find anywhere any way in Safari iOS to put in A-Frame a video with alpha transparency that is recognized by A-Frame and Safari/iOS, 

Video formats: Webm for Android, for safari iOS?
Animated GIFS: The animated gif component has unsolved issues with flickering after clearing canvas in between each frame
Masking out the background of an mp4: no idea if this is possible

any tips? than you again Is this an A-Frame issue, or a question?  IIRC, questions should usually be directed to stackoverflow.com; it sounds as though you are looking for a specific answer on Safari browser video support.

As I understand it, the usual technique is to use a custom shader to make the desired color from the video transparent / not visible. Thank you machenmusik, I will redirect this to slack or other forums then, btw I did exactly that now and it works, an mp4 video with a chromakey shader and that works, however the mp4 video shows well on desktop but shows black rectangle on android

I just checked that mp4 works all well in both desktop and android mobile, it is the addition of the chromakey material that fails on android mobile but works on desktop

 <a-video javi1 class="video" src="#video" webkit-playsinline playsinline width=1 height=1 position="0 0 0" rotation="0 0 2" material="shader: chromakey; src: #video; color: 0 0 1" autoplay="true" loop="true"></a-video>

 You may need to  check the shader for assumed features  or extensions unavailable on mobile.  A codepen / gist / jsfiddle / glitch example can help others examine  thank  you dmarcos, I just raised the issue, and I also discovered something very key:

If i use the chromakey material within the `<a-video>` element, the problem happens
If i use it within a `<a-entity`> element, then  the problem does not happen.

So with `<a-entity>` all works well, but with `<a-video>` it fails.

I would prefer to use it with `<a-video>` it would be better for me for a few reasons, any idea why it works with a-entity but fails with a-video?

This works on both android mobile and desktop:
`<a-entity material="shader: chromakey; src: #video; color: 0 0 1" geometry="primitive: box"></a-entity> `

This works on desktop but fails on android mobile:
`<a-video class="video" src="#video" webkit-playsinline playsinline width=1 height=1 position="0 0 0" rotation="0 0 2" material="shader: chromakey; src: #video; color: 0 0 1" autoplay="true" loop="true"></a-video>
` ok now I know whats going on , I just need help to fix it.

The problem is not a-video or a-entity, it should work ok with a-video.

reason is that in mobile the video is not being started and that's why it shows black,

```
when I use a-video, I start the video on user click like this:
 var els = document.querySelectorAll('.video')
    Array.prototype.slice.call(els).forEach(function(el) {
      el.components.material.material.map.image.play()
    })

```
and this works perfect on both desktop and mobile, when I dont use the shader material
`<a-video id="vidactivate" class="video"  src="#video"></a-video>`

but when i add the shader material:

`<a-video id="vidactivate" class="video" material="shader: chromakey; color: 0 0 1" src="#video"></a-video>`

now the same code to start the video on user click fails, maybe because I have two src="#video"?

how should I change the following code to start the video correctly when I have the chromakey material embedded in a-video?

```
 var els = document.querySelectorAll('.video')
    Array.prototype.slice.call(els).forEach(function(el) {
      el.components.material.material.map.image.play()
    })

```


 I could not test on iOS yet, im sure the same problem happens. But listen, I found the reason now, the last stuff I wrote. It's just that when I embed the material in the a-video

`<a-video id="vidactivate" class="video" material="shader: chromakey; color: 0 0 1" src="#video"></a-video>`

my code to start playing the video fails. That's why it works on desktop (where autoplay works), but not on mobile because on mobile user has to click and the play has to be done manually, and that code to manually play the video is failing  `<a-video id="vidactivate" class="video" material="shader: chromakey; src: #video; color: 0 0 1" src="#video"></a-video> , the correct line` i further simplified the line 
 ` <a-video id="vidactivate" class="video" material="shader: chromakey; src: #video; color: 0 0 1"></a-video>`

and i confirmed it, when  i leave autoplay on it all works, when  i remove it it fails, thats why it works on desktop and not on mobile, my code to manually trigger the video works all great when the chromakey stuff is not embedded in a-video but when i embed it then that code to manually start the video fails What is the javascript code you are using to manually start the video file?  A very common mistake to make is that the `a-video` element does not have the API for media control, that's on the `video` element.  So here you would do something like `document.querySelector('#video').play()` not `#vidactivate` Thank you machenmusik, 
I fixed it now, the keys here were two, first to have a single src parameter and to have it within the material, and second to correct the trigger to adapt to that, this second one connects with what you just described,
`<a-video class="video" material="shader: chromakey; src: #video; color: 0 0 1" webkit-playsinline playsinline></a-video>`

`var videoEl = document.querySelector('#video');videoEl.play();
`
thank you for your support and i will close this issue now, all best ;) Hello @javismiles 
Good that you have found a solution, alternatively have you evaluated APNG?

APNG support is increasing:
https://caniuse.com/#feat=apng

By the way I'm trying to test video ( without alpha) with iOs® using `webkit-playsinline` and `playsinline`but the video does not start, do you have a working example ( with and without alpha)?
Thank you.  **Description:**

I'm sure I'm missing something, but I'm seeing something strange happen. In the glitch project linked above, the gltf model fails to load and the `a-assets` event `loaded` fires. However, if I change the `a-asset-item` tag to `a-asset`, the model loads and displays just fine, but the `a-assets` event `loaded` never fires.

To be clear, based on the documentation I would expect to be able to use the `a-asset-item` tag and have the `a-assets` event `loaded` fire after the page has loaded the model.

Thanks! Thanks both for the fast replies! Good to know about the `response-type="arraybuffer"` bit. That solves this, and makes everything behave as I expected. It doesn't appear to matter what the tag name of the glb asset file is. I suppose that's known, though it was news to me.  Nevermind about `a-asset-item` working with any tag name. The model does load just fine with a different tag name (e.g. `<asdf-item>`), but the `loaded` event then never fires on `<a-assets>`.  Less ambiguous date format.

**Description:**
Fixes #3202 

**Changes proposed:**
- Use ISO8601 Format
- Dates will be YYYY-MM-DD

 As I mentioned in #3202, the current format is ambiguous - both for humans and machines.

I'm European, and often find it confusing working out whether 05-10-2017 is in October (as we would write it) or May as Americans would write it.

Similarly, computers parsing log messages will find it easier to ingest the standard ISO8601 format - which is used all over the web. ISO8601 goes largest element to smallest element. Year-Month-Day Hour Minutes Seconds.

I would expect most JS programmers reading the logs to be familiar with it.

* It's the [HTML standard way of representing time](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/infrastructure.html#dates-and-times)
* [Schema.org](https://schema.org/Date) uses it
* [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) is functionally identical and commonly used.
* As noted in the PR, JavaScript uses it as [`toISOString()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString)
* [Keep A Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) also recommend that format.


If you want reduce confusion, you could use [RFC 822](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-profile#data-types-datetime) which looks like `Mon, 15 Oct 2007 14:10:00 GMT` - but that will be confusing to people who don't speak English as the month names will be different.

As I said, I found the logs confusing. I think this simple change would improve things. So I do think there is confusion between mm-dd-yyyy and dd-mm-yyyy, the most common occurrence for me (as I am not European) being travel documentation... but when year comes first it is understood to be yyyy-mm-dd since no one appears to use yyyy-dd-mm (thanks ISO8601 and friends)

> In computer world I personally always assume that month goes first.

If the vast majority of programmers agree with the personal assumption, then agreed not much impetus to change; however if there is significant confusion, this seems like a simple enough change to make

 Thank you 😀  **Description:**
The IIFE in the example code is supposed to be the outer function, not the inner function.
**Changes proposed:**
- Fixed the typo
 Aren't we finding ourselves replacing IIFE and closure variables due to issues like #3200?  are these related #594  Can not play video, only sound no video，why？ `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" `content="yes">`

When using version 0.6.1 and earlier, everything works fine.

Based on a simple diff between the two versions shows some changes in the look-controls.js file regarding Rotation calculation.

Maybe you can let me know what I have to change (setting properties or similar) to get the basic functionality back. 

many thanks

 Tracing the console output of the device shows that with the original 0.6.1. aframe-master.js (working version) a warning + error + waring was thrown:
 aframe-master.js:63176  No DPDB device match. 
 aframe-master.js:63111 Failed to recalculate device parameters.
 aframe-master.js:61110 Using fallback Android device measurements.

Corresponding functions:
Dpdb.prototype.calcDeviceParams_
Dpdb.prototype.recalculateDeviceParams_
DeviceInfo.prototype.determineDevice_

In the latest 0.7.0 version, this is no longer the case - no error and no warning. 
I also recompiled the 0.6.1 version myself (npm run dist) and now even with this new version I do get the same behaviour as with 0.7.0. 
So it looks like this error/warning have been fixed there already but was not in the aframe-master.js

This part of the code seems no longer be executed with 0.7.0 (and also the recompile).


 More tests did show that navigator.getVRDisplays() does not return any thing in the newer versions while in 0.6.1 master it returns a CardboardVRDisplay.

What can be the reason for this? Hi, I took a copy of the repository and tried to run it locally but I only receive a black screen with the menu on the top right (Fullscreen | VR(WebVR/Mobile only) | Reset). No errors in the console during the initial load.

I also tried the mentioned examples in the Readme.md file "https://webvr.info/samples/" but they all mention that no VR display can be found.
I wonder what was overwriting the navigator.getDisplays() function as it works with 0.6.1 and do not with later versions? Thanks a lot for your response! Question is why was it working in older versions? Did A-Frame not use Webvr-polyfill? How, where and on which criteria does webvr-polyfill check if a device is supported? 
Three.js deviceorientation examples are working fine on the device, so shouldn't this than be de-coupled anyway from the Display? 
In the older version it was recognized as CardboardVRDisplay. Is this not/no longer supported in webvr-polyfill? many thanks! Many, many thanks for your advice. This solved at least my issue. 
Changed aframe-master/package.json file, dependencies from "webvr-polyfill": "^0.9.36" to  "webvr-polyfill": "0.9.36" and generated a new js file (npm run dist) - and it works again. 
This proofs that version 0.9.40 (which was used due to the compatibility marker) is eliminating several devices. This is maybe also the solution for #3087.
How to proceed with this? should we open an issue on webvr-polyfill for this?
Thanks!! This issue still exists in aframe@0.8.2 & webvr-polyfill@0.10.5. Any ideas/suggestions how to fix this? When I add a single entity (just a box) with a camera of look-controls, as per docs, on mouse drag, entity should get rotated but the camera is rotating & view angle is getting changed.

Device: Google Chrome is up to date, Version 68.0.3435.0 (Official Build) canary (64-bit)
I'm trying to host the example. I will revert with the link very soon Thanks for your reply. So, here is my [glitch](https://grandiose-gong.glitch.me/) which is very basic one. If you look at the HTML, the camera entity has got only look-controls. So as per docs mentioned [here](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/components/look-controls.html), on mouse drag, the box entity should get rotated, instead, camera angle is moving. May I know how to make the box-entity rotate?

I remember this use to happen before.


      <a-scene>
            <a-entity position="0 0 5">
              <a-entity camera look-controls></a-entity>

      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9" shadow></a-box>
      <a-sky color="#ECECEC"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>

 oh now I understood. Appologies to bother you & thanks a ton.  nice catch There is a this.everGotGamepadEvent variable in gearvr-controls.js that seems unused, you may want to remove it too.  
- A-Frame Version: 0.7.0
- Platform / Device: Windows 10, Firefox 56 (64 bit), Oculus HMD and Oculus Touch Controllers
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: see attached file - index.txt

In 0.7.0 (this does not happen in 0.6.1) if an a-entity has a hand-controls component AND a laser-controls component then the Oculus touch model is displayed instead of the hand model.
[index.txt](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/files/1406944/index.txt)

[Incidentally I originally created this example with the angle tool. However that is still generating files using version 0.6.1]  This may well be me misunderstanding something, but it seems that from version 0.6 onwards, removing an `a-entity`'s attribute does not cause a component update. Its internal data caches the previous set value. I believe previous versions fell back to the default value if an attribute was removed. 
This makes it difficult to manage dynamic state components with optional props. Unless there is another way to signal/detect that change to the component?

i tried also the 'add' function but i receive the same message. how is possible?  **Description:**
If you use a template and inject offline AFrame components, these won't ever be initialized in the live DOM world once appended.

```js
var scene = '<a-scene><a-box color="red" position="0 2 -5" rotation="0 45 45" scale="2 2 2"></a-box></a-scene>';

var template = document.createElement('template'); // use 'div' in Chrome
template.innerHTML = scene;
document.body.appendChild((template.content || template).firstElementChild);
```
However, if you change `template` with `div`, as example, you'll see that once appended everything is fine.

This makes AFrame component not suitable for any library that creates them via modern template.

Please note this is a **Chrome** bug only, and I'm not sure if I can fix it via document-register-element polyfill because apparently you are using your own fork.

- A-Frame Version: 0.7.0
- Platform / Device: Chrome (V0 native)
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: https://codepen.io/WebReflection/pen/xXMxEO?editors=0010

 OK, without using any library, I can confirm this is an issue with Chrome and native V0 API

If you try this code, you'll see only V1 on the page. Change the string `template` with `div` or any non template element, and it works for both V0 and V1.

```js
document.registerElement(
  'a-test',
  {
    prototype: Object.create(
      HTMLElement.prototype,
      {
        attachedCallback: {value() {
          this.textContent = this.getAttribute('test');
        }}
      }
    )
  }
);
customElements.define('b-test', class extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.textContent = this.getAttribute('test');
  }
});
var template = document.createElement('template');
template.innerHTML = [
  '<a-test test="V0"></a-test>',
  '<b-test test="V1"></b-test>'
].join('');
document.body.appendChild(template.content || template);
```

Is AFrame planning to migrate to the V1 part of this polyfill ?

I am not sure I should try to patch a death API, please let me know what are the plans.

If you were on V1 already, every browser would work without any issue with templates.

Best Regards > I have not seen the need for them in my own work either

both [hyper](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML) and [lit](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/lit-html) HTML, to name just two, use templates to smart-render DOM.

People then [blame the library](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46797635/aframe-content-not-rendering-on-chrome-with-hyperhtml/46817370) ignoring the V0 vs V1 eternal battle when it comes to Custom Elements, hence I'm here to offer help because I want _hyperHTML_ to work with A-Frame too, it'd be a shame if it cannot.

But there's more to that ... let me explain

> Any other benefits of migrating to V1?

V1 is the only API that has been approved and adopted by all browsers.
By moving to V1 you automatically have:
  * a future proof code that at some point would not need any polyfill at all (with V0 you are stuck with my poly forever but I won't necessarily patch a death API, it's unsustainable work for me)
  * a native hook within the browser, instead of JavaScript hacks provided by my lib
  * classes to develop components instead of the ugly V0 API ... classes can be safely transpiled thanks to [my babel helper](https://github.com/WebReflection/babel-plugin-transform-builtin-classes)
  * better primitives and performance, every attribute triggers changes in V0, only explicit attributes per class trigger changes on V1
  * compatibility with modern templates hence all new libraries that will use the same hyperHTML template-once pattern

Alternatively I'd need to force V0 polyfill even on Chrome, since it might also ditch V0 at any time soon, making AFrame lose its only native supporter at this time.

**So** ... what are the issue you need to patch in V0 ? > The reason we moved to a fork is WebReflection/document-register-element#55

that's a bug report without any answer ... last message is this one:
https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element/pull/55#issuecomment-234586837

are you sure you still need that fork? your version might be behind various other fixes/changes

> It has served us well, bug free for more than a year now. 

yeah, DRE is battle tested since about ever: Google AMP, StencilJS and others use it too, happy it works

> if it ain't broke, don't fix it

by definition, Software needs updates/maintenance though ... in this case you have a little issue ... 

> When can we expect V0 to be dropped?

V0 has never landed anywhere, it's dropped since ever.

V1 though, is native in Safari for mac/iOS and Chrome, mobile and Desktop.
That's 70% of the Desktop + 90% of the Mobile Web ... V0 is only and maybe Chrome

If you care about even more robust code and better performance for the majority of the Web, keeping AFrame in V0 is the wrong choice.

If you could tell me what exactly you need/why and how V1 does not work already, I'd be happy to try speeding up needed fixes.

Regards > in case you're interested in volunteering/contributing in testing A-Frame with CEv1

unfortunately I don't have much extra time these days, but if you need any help at any point ping me.

I'll leave this open since it's still a bug to me, feel free to close it though. **FYI** and FWIW [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML) now supports AFrame elements (hacked around the issue in core) as you can see in this [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/WebReflection/pen/xXMxEO?editors=0010) at this point I also wonder if you'd be interested in this new polyfill I've just backed, fully based on document-register-element code (but it weights 2.9K instead)
https://github.com/WebReflection/ce-v0

### Features:
  * it's V0 only, no code and issues related to V1
  * it uses V1 when available to mimic V0 behavior. You go native on Safari/WebKit browsers doing nothing on your code
  * it uses exact same code DRE uses for every other browser. No compatibility issues (but I need to validate this putting in same tests DRE has)
  * even if based on V1, it notifies about every attributes like V0 does
  * it's easier to maintain, it doesn't lock you in its V0+V1 logic as it is for DRE
  * it does NOT bring in built-in extends (AFAIK you don't need them) so it still promotes V1 good practices

thoughts ? P.S. [live tests](https://webreflection.github.io/ce-v0/) works on every DRE target browser including IE9

You could also define AFrame components via the Component utility (actually, this independently of the rest of the slimmed down polyfill).

Example:
```js
var MyElement = new Component({
  // the Custom Element name
  name: 'my-element',
  // one or more static property
  static: {
    TEST: 123,
    method() {}
  },
  // alias for createdCallback
  constructor() {},
  // alias for attributeChangedCallback
  onattribute() {},
  // alias for attachedCallback
  onconnected() {},
  // alias for detachedCallback
  ondisconnected() {}
  // any other prototype definition is allowed
  // including getters and setters
});
``` hyperHTML V2 is landing tomorrow and every issue here has been solved.

I still suggest you drop my old poly and use ce-v0 for your components, you'll reduce bundle size and improve performance, but ... hey, it's your call. Just so you have the feedback - I was bitten by this as well. Jumped in to a-frame, new to the webvr space, but very experienced with web components v1.

Created my project with my normal workflow, created custom elements wrapping a-frame scene, etc...

Nothing worked.

I love a-frame, you guys are doing an amazing job, but v1 is the future, looking forward to when I can use a-frame in the modern web components ecosystem.

Also happy to help with porting.  **WebXR bindings**

**Changes proposed:**
- add XREffect
- add XRControls
- add xr-anchor component
  Fixes #3173.  Added test and converted 360 video examples to ensure visibility of correct behavior. > Is it awkward since while videos can be loaded, the a-assets doesn't match the support?

Well, given that the source element for video is often used when the browser should pick from given alternatives, I'm not sure how a-assets should work, which one should it load and wait for, and what if it doesn't match the browser?  I think a note that video using source elements can't be preloaded via a-assets would be fine.  Perhaps that warning should still fire if no src/srcObject attributes (i.e. eliminate that querySelector addition).

For media assets of considerable size, I don't think that preloading every possible variant because we don't know which will be used is a good idea.  Also, streaming assets may not be preloadable, since they may not terminate.  But having a generic way for `a-asset-item` to specify multiple explicit URLs to load would be OK in my book, and might also help the gilt plus associated files problem, if a component could be used on `a-asset-item` to generate the srcs list. Streaming plays like any other video texture.

You don't need to use a-assets unless you want to block the entire UI to load (large) video files, which IMO is actually a bad thing to do in general even with existing src-attribute MP4 files.  (Or giant model files, etc.) IMO, using inline URL tends to be part of the problem, because no one can figure out where the actual media element is to be controlled (which is a FAQ) -- better to append a child video element with whatever you want to scene (outside a-assets) and reference by id/selector it's A-Frame that creates it
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/systems/material.js#L144 True, but that's kinda gross.  (Maybe an accessor function on the material component would be nicer.)

Are you requesting more changes here (e.g. reinstate a-assets warning) ?

I think the value of being able to play videos that use source elements, even though they won't be preloaded, is worth the small disconnect (especially if the warning is reinstated and/or tweaked to explain) > is there a common need to support multiple video formats?

Sadly, yes at the moment, as there is not quite a common set of codecs and formats that are supported by all browsers.  For example, no one seemed to notice that examples/test/videosphere is using webm which apparently fails in Safari.  H.264 and MP4 is probably closest at the moment for video, but even then there are outliers like experimental Chromium which do not support. So A-Frame and THREE are perfectly capable of supporting video that does not appear in a-assets, and as we have discussed a significant number of video use cases really don't want to incur preload for hundreds of megabytes or more of video, especially inadvertently on mobile.

My suggestion is to continue to document how to use video with src attribute as has been common A-Frame practice for a while, but also to point out that non-preloaded video elements also work (once we merge this PR) with examples including WebRTC and videos with source elements.

I would also suggest we think about whether we want to continue encouraging use of a-video and a-videosphere components, or would rather discourage in favor of something else like a third party component. @cvan brought up audio, i agree that is different, as preload mistakes are in the single to double digits of megabytes which is less fatal.  Multiple video source support is useful and often needed, it's not about Chromium specifically.

Question, do we find browser caching (often on mass storage and not purely RAM) to be unreliable so we want to use THREE caching (which is in RAM by necessity and thus bloats footprint) ? There is no video.src provided when you use source elements.  That being said, we can require use of element id in those cases @ngokevin yup. The problem with MP4 is that it doesn't do live.  (But that's the other discussion) Latest version correctly gives a-assets warning for examples/test/videosphere (which still works anyway if you're not using Safari), and also correctly gives no warnings for examples/test/video. Can not play VR video on ios[#3192](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3192)  ios11 Can not play VR video, m3u8 format Yes, there appears to be a regression in iOS 11 Safari behavior unfortunately, see discussion here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2830#issuecomment-338946580  So can you guys clarify whether video playback actually doesn't work in these scenarios, or whether it's just preload and/or caching? I do understand @dmarcos @ngokevin viewpoint that if it can be done without explicit core support, it is useful to allow external components to provide the functionality unless/until there is a clear candidate to integrate into core.

My understanding, correct me if I'm wrong, is that those playing video on the web are often using something like video.js or other player frameworks.  So maybe the use case to consider is, can A-Frame support the video element usage of the most common player frameworks?  If not, then there are presumably gaps worth addressing in core. > I think it's simpler to prescribe not using a video player framework, it adds a lot more uncertainty.

IMO, that's a little like prescribing not using frameworks atop WebGL.  Simpler, but perhaps less useful. Yes, my point is that useful frameworks distinguish themselves over time, and to stipulate that you can't use them makes the overall solution less useful.  I think we are all hoping that any of the WebVR frameworks proves as useful as THREE has for WebGL, or as others have for video. The basis for video support in A-Frame is (a) the THREE standard and flat shaders accepting src texture, and (b) helper code that lets one specify the media element and the combination of A-Frame and THREE take care of the rest.

Supporting source elements requires no work for (a), AFAIK, and some very specific but clear changes @cvan identified for (b) - several of which are actually cleaner like using properties directly rather than via getAttribute.

Is there a specific objection?  I think most of the complexity around video is around (1) user gesture requirements on mobile, which A-Frame can't solve (2) unsupported codecs and formats, which source element support was specifically designed to mitigate (3) browser quirks especially Safari and iOS which we are considering dropping.

Why not support the intended solution for (2) as @cvan asks?  The browsers will already have done the heavy lifting. From 
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/propertyTypes.js#L87

```
// Pass through media elements. If we have the elements, we don't have to call
// three.js loaders which would re-request the assets.
```

Maybe we should just be taking the media elements, which the browsers cache as they see fit or are instructed (and thus never having three.js loaders re-request) - inline video urls would then need to be specified as video elements, so it becomes simple to answer the question of how to control the video.... widespread usage of inline forms of `a-video` and `a-videosphere` may be the root of many FAQs on video. @cvan can you confirm it's just cleaning up getAttribute / hasAttribute usage?

@ngokevin I share concerns over complexity for caching etc. and also unwitting preload of giant video files that exacerbate memory constraints, do you think we should take specific steps to avoid? Let's move from abstract to concrete discussion on #3176.  Only slightly more than getAttribute / hasAttribute, have a look.  **Description:**

 Ok. Thanks for the reply, but what I really want to do is to spawn a ply-model. I have been looking into this [aincraft ](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/blob/master/scenes/aincraft/components/intersection-spawn.js)example done by kevin. And for the intersection-spawn.js script, it uses mixin, and I do not know how to modify it to spawn ply-model.  **Description:**

  Hi,

I think the documentation needs to be updated here https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/core/entity.html#event-detail 

As far as I can tell the ``newData`` and ``oldData`` properties are no longer present on the ``componentchanged`` event.
 Wait. So now to get the new data for position, for example, we do this?
evt.target.getAttribute('position') I updated two days ago and my code stopped working. I couldn't quickly find any documentation saying that now I have to do this: `event.target.getAttribute(event.detail.name)`. Anyways, thanks! @ngokevin I wonder if we should add a warning message into the static evt.detail object for oldName or newName so that if this change breaks code relying on newData or oldData, and you look at the value you are getting, it tells you what you should do instead in human-readable form? Something along these lines maybe:
`warn('event.detail.newData is deprecated. Use event.target.getAttribute(event.detail.name) instead.');`  This looks like a good start and addresses a lot of the issues with mapping lots of input types to higher level semantic events.

A few notes:

When I wrote a similar input manager for Spaciblō (classes here: https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo-core/blob/master/docroot/js/spaciblo-input.js and default schema here: https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo-core/blob/master/docroot/js/spaciblo-default-input-schema.js) it became quickly apparent when making apps that I needed  to know how the higher level event was triggered. So, the app might treat differently events from left- or right-handed controller or from gaze control.

One of my working theories is that a MR app framework needs to keep track of global app state (type of pose data, type of display, type of controllers, etc) so that the input mapping can be entirely swapped out. For example, if a handset is in flat page mode then it needs a different input map handling touch inputs than it would in magic window pass-through AR mode which is also different from when in a HMD doing VR.  So, the same lower level inputs lead to different higher level events, depending on MR mode.

Diego, I suspect that this is related to the conversation that you're having with @blairmacintyre about the use of "presenting" to indicate global app state. It seems like we need state with more info, like a data structure that represents the current display, the UI mode (flat, overlay, in-scene), the reality (pass-through AR, see-through AR, VR), and the input schema.

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 For some reason, it's slightly different to the geometry version.
You need to use vertex-a, vertex-b & vertex-c instead.  Does it apply a scale to `Object3D.scale` based on the initial size of the mesh?  (this is just a complete guess)

I tried searching the source, but it wasn't easy to find.  It appears that A-Frame doesn't allow to create properties that may not exist (or may have null values). For example, an integer or float value will always have a default numeric value, which may not always be appropriate. If I create a numeric property with a `{default: null}` it gets parsed as NaN. Strings with `{default: null}` work seemingly ok but issue a warning (though, inexistent string value may be designated by an empty string, this is not always appropriate).

Apparently, the problem stems from that every property type is made to be serializable to and parsable from a string. But A-Frame usage scenarios are surely not limited to creating an html with string-only attributes. `getAttribute`/`setAttribute` API allows to pass any javascript expression to aframe component properties. The aframe-react library provides a convenient way to pass javascript expressions directly from React components jsx code.

Is there a chance that A-Frame component schema will be extended to accommodate these use cases?

- A-Frame Version: 0.7.0

 I have several use cases. For example, I have a component that creates a carousel out of some given entities. It has a notion of a currently active element index, so it is an integer property, but it can also be a null (no active slide). I couldn't find a way to describe this in a schema without getting a warning from A-Frame. Currently, I use `{active: {default: null}}` but it gives a `core:schema:warn Default value `null` does not match type 'string' in component 'rotator'`

Another use case is for the second part of my original request. I need to pass a callback to a component: 

`<Entity camera look-controls roll-tracker={{callback: cameraRollCallback, threshold: 15}}>
...
</Entity>`

This component tracks camera roll angle and reports it back to the callback. A callback is of an object javascript type and there's no such equivalent in aframe compoenent prop types.

Surely there can be other use cases, but even in those, I find A-Frame component property type list is too restrictive to support these use cases. I don't need to pass the event somewhere else in an aframe ecosystem. Callback passing is an integration point with the outside world: I'm using React and Redux and the callback dispatches the Redux action. If I will emit the event to be subscribed somewhere else I will just move the problem to the other component, this will not solve the problem.

I think you miss the whole point. The point is that aframe component property types apparently are designed around the string representation of their values. And in the reality, no one will use just a string properties for an app bigger than a hello world. One will use React or Angular or anything else and this will require passing native javascript objects around to tie these two worlds. Why restrict that? Ok, what if data is a multidimensional array? Thinking in the "data not logic" paradigm callback could be a design smell. I think I can subscribe to an event in a React component, this solves callback problem. Thank you for the hint.

Still, I think nullable properties and object/array data should be supported. There can be ways to overcome that, but this is the data, I don't see why restrict some forms of it. For example, I have a component that duplicates the model in the desired positions. A column model that gets duplicated around the scene still being a single geometry to optimize a number of render calls.

The component gets passed an array of positions, this is not a permitted data type. 

Of course this is not a single use case. Custom property type is surely a solution, I somehow missed that. Thank you! I would say that one thing that is missing is the ability to declare a custom value on a component level. I can create a custom component property type, but something like this (jsx): `instantiate-geometries={[{position: "1 0 0"}, {position: "2 0 0"}]}` is unsupported I guess.  Is that really the expected behavior?  Shouldn't the canvas stay the correct size for the VR headset's resolution? Hi @cvan,

My fix in #3031 was addressing a specific problem. When the user is in an immersive HMD the priority is for HMD resolution (which is set by the page), since the same canvas object is used both for HMD and desktop rendering. If the page does not use mirroring when presenting (preserveDrawingBuffer=false) then the canvas is not visible on desktop. This is preferred as it also reduces rendering costs.
You shared the video of a mobile example. Do you expect the same behavior on mobile and desktop? I am not quite following, what is the expected behavior.
Do you agree that the canvas on desktop should be resized after exiPresent? 
The behavior is correct with MS Edge (mirroring is off): 
	1. Enter VR
	2. Resize the window
	3. Exit VR
The canvas size is updated. @dmarcos Thank you for fixing this!  **Description:**

 Hi @donmccurdy. I've tested all my gltf models, and they all work fine with your online viewer. But I have a more complicated problem - I try to use aframe (v.0.7.0) as the top level layer, which is located above the openslayers map element in [DOM](https://nedol.ru/infodesk/alpha/dist/?mode=id&lat=48.858226&lon=2.294554&zoom=16). And in this case some 3d models (.dae, .json) work without problems, but loading the glTF 2.0 model I get an error ("Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'color' of undefined"). @donmccurdy That is my model - https://nedol.ru/infodesk/alpha/src/ddd/kolobot.2.gltf. Now I can see the model on the map, but for unknown reason it looks translucent. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2842644/31623342-c97ebb90-b2a7-11e7-9073-e74f4cf1e534.png)
 I use gltf 2.0 exporter for Blender with the settings that that doesn't give .bin file. This is another [example]( https://nedol.ru/infodesk/alpha/src/ddd/kolobot.flying.gltf) of model with the same problem.  After adding animation to blender's project I couldn't open [new gltf ](https://nedol.ru/infodesk/alpha/src/ddd/kolobot.2.gltf)in the viewer ('Invalid typed array length: 240'). But new [.glb file](https://nedol.ru/infodesk/alpha/src/ddd/kolobot.walking.glb) it seems works fine in the viewer exept some texture problems.

  Per Slack discussion

We may want the `material` component to act after `object3dset` or `model-loaded`, and to optionally traverse the model and its children, or apply recursively to the object hierarchy.  (Though we should consider whether to traverse into child A-frame entities then) Maybe some interaction with #2408?  Fix #3151. OK so -

We seem to agree these docs are an improvement.

Both the examples (grid and displacement) are done both as registered shader and custom component, so we actually have @donmccurdy's comment `whynotboth` already.

Ok to merge while working #3155? @dmarcos added that example OK, I think this looks good now, unless someone has a real example to contribute of a custom shader that uses a type that `registerShader` doesn't support  I know it's a WIP, just giving my feedback.
On GearVR, Oculus browser and Samsung Internet, in or out vr mode, the eyes stay at y:0. In vr mode, the controller model appears at configured user-height.
With Samsung Internet, not in vr mode, the camera doesn't move anymore. In Oculus browser, this never worked. I tested on GearVR. For the user height stuff, it's ok now. But there is really something wrong with the camera, it seems that it's the ground that move, not my head. I really want to throw up right now, seriously. :) With a cursor on camera, the cursor doesn't follow my head, it stays where it was initially. @fernandojsg If you want to throw up, you can test that branch with GearVR. :) On my project actually https://github.com/vincentfretin/aframe-sandbox
On which example are you testing? So we can test the same thing. I use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) with yarn workspaces in my project. If you want to test it with your branch:
```
git clone git@github.com:vincentfretin/aframe-sandbox.git
cd aframe-sandbox
./workspaces-install.sh

``` I tried to understand the changes of this PR, but this is too advanced for me to say what could be the issue. Can you see what I describe at least? AFAIK at the moment, they still need to add Rift support to Chrome Canary - but soon experimental Chromium may not be necessary at all Ok, I tested latest master, works great now on GearVR.  Per discussion at https://aframevr.slack.com/archives/C0GG937RN/p1507678947000225
The functionality of `AFRAME.registerShader()` has improved to the point where it is pretty useful, but the documentation for shaders is buried inside `material`, and the documentation for `registerShader()` does not have an example of recent changes which allow very straightforward usage without dipping down into `THREE` materials:
```
/* global AFRAME */
// Grid along X and Z (horizontal planes).

AFRAME.registerShader('grid', {
  schema: {
    color: {type: 'color', is: 'uniform', default: 'white'},
    opacity: {type: 'number', is: 'uniform', default: 1.0},
    thickness: {type: 'number', is: 'uniform', default: 1.0},
    interval: {type: 'number', is: 'uniform', default: 0.01}
  },

  raw: true,

  vertexShader: [
    'precision mediump float;',
    'attribute vec2 uv;',
    'attribute vec3 position;',
    'uniform mat4 projectionMatrix;',
    'uniform mat4 modelViewMatrix;',
    'uniform float interval;',
    'varying vec2 coord;',
    'void main(void) {',
    '  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);',
    '  coord = vec2(position.x / interval, position.z / interval);',
    '}'
  ].join('\n'),

  fragmentShader: [
    '#extension GL_OES_standard_derivatives: enable',
    'precision mediump float;',
    'uniform vec3 color;',
    'uniform float opacity;',
    'uniform float thickness;',
    'varying vec2 coord;',
    'void main() {',
    '  vec2 grid = abs(fract(coord - 0.5) - 0.5) / fwidth(coord);',
    '  float line = min(grid.x, grid.y);',
    '  if (line > thickness) { discard; } else',
    '  gl_FragColor = vec4(color, opacity);',
    '}'
  ].join('\n')
});
``` Awesome!
Couple of assorted thoughts for useful info in that regard, some rehashed from the Slack debate:

- A general overview of how registerShader wraps around THREE.ShaderMaterial
- A quick explanation about the relationship between Schema and Uniforms, or at least an example
- An example or mention of tock() logic to demonstrate time-based shader code
- (Perhaps a nontrivial example showing how uniforms can be derived from dynamic data like mouse pos, etc.?)
- Best practices?


-useful, external links - depending on the type of service you want the docs to fulfill, but since A-frame is beginner-facing I think mentioning these would do a great service to many who encounter shaders for the first time through Aframe and the docs: 
[THREE.ShaderMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/ShaderMaterial),
[The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/)
[The Cg Tutorial](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/CgTutorial/cg_tutorial_chapter01.html) ("Cg" is a bit of a misnomer - 99% of it is applicable to GLSL and despite its age it is still one of the best introductions to gpu programming. It's also free:) Thanks @MichaelHazani - how does the current PR match up?  I think the time-varying one may be the most interesting of current examples.  Can you say more about `derived from dynamic data`?  Feel free to make a PR on my fork to include here, which may be easier. So several discussions later, I am still leaning toward partitioning shader functionality into shader, and material functionality into the material component rather than continually requiring one-off replacements (see #3154 and #3155).

#3154 still includes the documentation on custom shader plus material component.  Note that both examples (grid-glitch and displacement) don't need a tick handler actually. See https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aframe-displacement-registershader
Seems cleaner to me.

#3155 will be useful even without custom shaders, assuming that we proceed.
 Re: time reference - first line in vertex shader main computes time from time1000, so I think it still works?

Re: partitioning meaning registerShader and material component changes, yes I am still leaning that way.  The shader data schema makes it easy to change values for the shader, even if you want to make a separate component to do it, works the same as rest of a-frame Just had a chance to catch up on the new suggested docs - I agree, much better, thank you.
In terms of feedback, I think there's still ambiguity in time vs. tick - and the fact the regsiterShader() and registerComponent() examples are next to one another makes the distinction even murkier and less obvious. 

So in other words the one thing I'd love to see is a clearer distinction of when to use each. In that way, I think the docs reflect this ongoing discussion in that the answer to that question is not really obvious, some are doubting the actual need for "registerShader", and the whole thing is a bit up in the air...

For now I'm slightly leaning towards the "why have registerShader() to begin with when it's not fully implemented and this area relies so heavily on exposing threejs/glsl to begin with", but in terms of the docs, I think an opinionated example of when and why to use each would be a welcome clarification. @donmccurdy thanks for heads up on the glitch error.
Duh, forgot to use `type:'time'` instead of `'number'` @michaelhazani ok, updated with opinionated section and removed duplication. @donmccurdy that means I blew away the prior custom component examples, but hopefully you will see why... if not, we can always revert Great stuff - thanks for doing all that. I think this is a huge step up and the examples are excellent and nontrivial. This is the kind of doc I'll be forwarding to beginners / onboarding devs for reference. Thank you!  The changes here use an updated version 0.9.40 of the polyfill that make the accelerometer / gyroscope based sensor fusion work properly on the latest Web Browser for the ODG R-7, which is a landscape-primary device, as well as making A-Frame realize that it should be using it for R-7. ahead of you, https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/pull/286 once @jsantell merges into polyfill, if we are using latest master of polyfill in general, then the package.json change can be reverted understood.  looks like it just merged, let me retry without package.json, hang tight just published webvr-polyfill v0.9.40 with the changes to support the R7 :metal:  nice!  OK so now the latest ODG R-7 Web Browser can use polyfill with correct accelerometer/gyro behavior, so you can load up https://r7-aframe.glitch.me/ and look at the boxes to select them.  (Although the display is still monoscopic at the moment.) @dmarcos OK to merge, thx @jsantell ! those github: changes shouldn't have been necessary, I undid by checking out an older version, let me fix ok, package.json fixed looks correct now:
- bump polyfill to 0.9.40, which has R-7 changes
- make A-Frame use accelerometer and gyro for R-7 (with polyfill fixes), like mobile phones
- tweak landscape utils call to work for R-7  Memory is not released after a scene is removed from DOM.

Fixed the docs. The documentation is correct. Nonetheless if you're using non positional tracking device with aframe 0.7.0, and you add a `<a-camera/>` yourself in the scene, your eyes will be at 1.6 because of the following issue https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3111 Any suggestions how to re-word this? It indeed is confusing 😄  @ngokevin thx I updated the PR, but changed the wording `is not in the ground` to `is not on ground level`

I still don't understand what is said here due the fact: I don't understand the difference between the camer when no in VR and default camera. Can you elaborate the difference? @ngokevin ohhh, now after reading this new section everything makes sense! thanks for the explaination  **from my point of sight, it would be interesting for you to:**

- *including supercollider.js in your framework;*
- *porting libpd to javascript (perharps using emscripten)*
- *compiling csound for aframe*
- *including a Lisp Algorithmic composition framework in a framework such as PWGL*

---

**furthermore:**

- *using an implementation of fft in opencl (i have forked some in case you may want to take a look);*
- *use that to make an implementation of higher order ambisonics/emulating wave field synthesis in stereo;*  The idea was to provide my own model instead, yeah. Something relevant to the scene, that would be used instead of either Vive or Touch controllers. In my case, I had a user who was on a satellite link, and the laser was not showing up at all.  I thought for a while that it was the controller model geometry needed to be downloaded in order for laser controls to work, so I was looking for ways to disable the model-loading, since the laser itself was more important.

I think I was wrong about the reason it wasn't showing up, though, but I did feel limited by needing to load extra geometry for low-bandwidth cases. Having articles explaining how to make custom components sounds like a great idea! For better or worse, I think the examples like `laser-controls` work well enough that folks don't try to clone it and make their own versions like a-blast... so if that a-blast example will show how easy it is (and expose some of the annoyances like having to keep your own list of the higher level controls you need to prospectively add) there will probably be less questions / requests here going forward @ngokevin Ooh yeah, I guess I meant specific examples for a few use cases to see it in action. Even though they are discoverable in the a-frame source, it's not usually my first impulse to check there.  **Description:**

A loaded model (gltf-model) doesn't unload from memory after it removed from DOM.

- A-Frame Version: 0.7.0
- Platform / Device: At least Windows/Chrome (possibly all platforms)
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: https://pterko.github.io/aframe/memory_bug_demo/test.html

How to reproduce:
 - Wait until page loads
 - When page loads, take a memory snapshot
 - Wait 10-15s before model will appear and loaded, take a snapshot
 - Wait until model will be deleted, take memory snapshot again

Expected behavior: amount of used memory decreases
Real behavior: amount of used memory don't change

 I've noticed this in my project as well, though I use a sllightly different version of the gltf loader. When I unmount/unload any gltf object, I run it through a function as below to make sure to dispose of any material/geometry/textures.

Could add this somewhere to the a-frame source but not sure where would be appropriate or if there is a simpler way of doing it.

```
export const disposeObject3D = object => {
  object.traverse(obj => {
    if(obj.material){
      obj.material.dispose();
      if(obj.material.map){
        obj.material.map.dispose();
      }
      if(obj.material.lightMap){
        obj.material.lightMap.dispose();
      }
      if(obj.material.aoMap){
        obj.material.aoMap.dispose();
      }
      if(obj.material.emissiveMap){
        obj.material.emissiveMap.dispose();
      }
      if(obj.material.bumpMap){
        obj.material.bumpMap.dispose();
      }
      if(obj.material.normalMap){
        obj.material.normalMap.dispose();
      }
      if(obj.material.displacementMap){
        obj.material.displacementMap.dispose();
      }
      if(obj.material.roughnessMap){
        obj.material.roughnessMap.dispose();
      }
      if(obj.material.metalnessMap){
        obj.material.metalnessMap.dispose();
      }
      if(obj.material.alphaMap){
        obj.material.alphaMap.dispose();
      }
    }
    if(obj.geometry){
      obj.geometry.dispose();
    }
  });
}
```
 @donmccurdy Yeah this resolved memory leaks when swapping/removing gltf models often.

I'm not exactly sure how the dispose functions work, they emit the following: `this.dispatchEvent( { type: 'dispose' } );` in ThreeJS which triggers events on the renderers to make sure the assets are fully cleared up and deallocated the resources to them.

Otherwise I believe that even if you clear your cache and your local variables, there is still references to those variables on the renderer which it keeps for performance optimisations until you clear them up. Hmm, just taking a look at the code. It looks like `GLTFLoader` uses `GLTFRegistry` not `THREE.Cache` like you mentioned. This means each model would load its own resources and they would be safe to remove, but means that the resources get loaded and allocated separately each time. So if a user detached the object and reattached it to another, all the resources would get reloaded using a different instance of the `GLTFLoader/GLTFRegistry`?

I thought that it was using `THREE.Cache` but maybe that is just the `a-asset-item` that gets cached, not the actual loaded geometries/materials? Correct me if I'm wrong...

I'm not sure of any existing way to check how many objects are referencing a resource. The only way I could think of doing it is traversing the whole scene graph and checking against UUIDs, but that might be a bit much? I think it should be disposed of automatically as its assumed that when a node is removed, the memory it takes up should be removed to but would leave that call to someone else. I see... I mostly use `.gltf`s with separate binaries and textures, so that's why the code works fine for me. If you have multiple `.glb`s then yes it would cause issues if you disposed of resources that are in use elsewhere.

I can't think of a clean way that doesn't require a lot of changes. Maybe if it were something like `THREE.Scene.Clear()/THREE.Renderer.Clear()` that goes through all the resources and clears any that are not being used, but thats probably quite a big task. I think the `dispose-on-detach` is good but not an obvious solution for people to use, would an attribute on the `a-gltf-model` make more sense?  **Description:**

...

This is semi-pseudo because I can't link to an actual file without also triggering CORS issues. To repro please try serving a local mp4 (or presumably any other format - I've tried .flv to confirm).

On loading the simplest video file in a-frame Safari throws the same error mentioned [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/9716) on iOS as well as desktop. There is no issue if:

1. the file is loaded as a <video> outside of a-frame
2. the file is loaded on Chrome (iOS/OSX)
3. the file is loaded on FF (iOS/OSX)

So, I believe, it really comes down to a Safari webgl issue.

Not sure this can be fixed at the a-frame level but at the very least I wanted to leave a pointer to the original threejs error. I'd also love to know if anyone else is able to create a simple video texture (per the above code) in a-frame and have it work without a hitch on Safari (either iOS or OSX). Oops - can't believe I never encountered it before, thanks. That said, this is bigger than mobile - I'm able to repro on OSX as well. Safari just doesn't play nice across the board. (Unlike the original bug, I'm able to make it work in FF) There are a few issues that could be in play here with Safari.  Longstanding CORS bugs, HW acceleration related shader interactions, HLS quirks vs. usual MP4, codec profile/resolution support just to focus the problem, as I'd mentioned before, the file plays fine in safari without WebGL so I don't think there's some inherent non-gl-related problem in Safari. I suspect this pertains to the  implementation of that particular shader per the detailed debate in the bug I referred to. oh, interesting - autoplay muted works in other browsers (and requires "muted" due to similar restrictions), but you think the problem is related to autoplay rather than that shader error?

Worth a try, anyway - thanks. I'll report back. Update: @mayognaise 's [module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-video-shader) saved the day - playing on Safari/OSX, stuttering but probably improvable on Safari iOS. Gonna dig under the hood a bit to see how it does it. Does this codepen work if you click?
https://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/gRPZqd Can you clarify what you mean by "work"? That codepen video is a single frame so there's no way to test whether Safari (or any other browser for that matter) would run into the same issues. The main problem - also evident in this [AFrame Videos example](https://altspacevr.github.io/aframe/examples/test/video/) - is that Safari freezes on the first frame and won't play. OK, how about https://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/boLZKQ which works for me in Safari on MacOS? Works on safari/iOS! Very interesting, thanks for the example. I’ll take a
closer look on Monday.

 No problem - the usual culprits with video not working are:
- hosting of the particular media files and either CORS headers, content-type settings, or both
- the particular video settings used to encode don't match what the device/OS will play
- mobile autoplay restrictions
 Very useful, thanks. I had ruled out CORS because it was locally served and
mobile encoding / auto play issues because it worked on FF and Chrome on
iOS, and because it threw this strange old shader warning. But per usual
with Safari all bets are off - and it helps to have a working example.

 This weekend I have found that videos with sound won't play on iPhone. They will play if they have no audio tracks, or if the muted attribute is added to the video element.

This happens using Firefox , Chrome and Safari, and when pinned to home screen. iOS 11.01 and 11.02 Yeah, that’s a known restriction - can only auto play muted.

@machenmusik Thank you for the working example! Our splash screen click event wasn't enough for mobile Safari, it needed the window click. No problem, glad it helped you!  From the comment https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/0b60c12bd48de67c5e82eb1c19159800a07f1ca1#commitcomment-24807425
we changed the `return` to a `break`, but it should really be a `continue`.

I tested with two overlapping cubes, and with the break, sometime I had a cube that stayed in a hover state and the ray wasn't on it. I couldn't reproduce the issue by replacing `break` with `continue`.

#3131 is maybe related to this?
  I've seen the Blender community suggest [this Youtube tutorial series a lot](https://www.blenderguru.com/tutorials/blender-beginner-tutorial-series) for beginners. Maybe, pertaining to texturing, docs should point people to [the video about material nodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5Gb1VK98Wc)?

Also, @donmccurdy, a bug in your example above, `event.details` should be `event.detail`  **Description:**
For example: color=" #FF0000" throws an "THREE.Color: Unknown color  #FFFFFF" error. Would it make sense to trim the string?

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 https://codepen.io/anon/pen/wryJxK ok will do.  Is there a better way to understand when and how the intersection point changes?  I think that is the primary value of the subsequent events.  Use case - drawing a dot / placing an object on a plane or box where the intersection point is.  Maybe emit the first intersection, and then the recipient should register on the raycaster for further updates for that element?  At the moment, I don't think the intersections are objects that survive across raycasts and update live. I'm thinking use cases like - raycaster detects ground plane and also other objects in environment; if ground plane is first hit, you want live updates to highlight where you want the object placed, but if other objects, you don't highlight (and don't care where until).  For that use case, you want a property that will throttle the intersection count for which events are emitted (e.g. to 1, or 2 if you want to be able to point through objects if required) I thought we wanted to discourage code from reaching into component internals directly (so the implementations can evolve as needed) - if we want this to happen more often, should accessor methods be defined to provide a clean API? OK.  Maybe the JS you're describing can be wrapped in a legacy-helper component as well, if needed. actually, why not 
```
groundEl.addEventListener('raycaster-intersected', el => {
  this.intersectingRaycaster = evt.detail.el.components.raycaster;
});

groundEl.addEventListener('raycaster-intersected-cleared', () => {
  this.intersectingRaycaster = null;
});

...

tick: () => {
  if (!this.intersectingRaycaster) {  return; }
  var intersectionIndex = this.intersectingRaycaster.intersectedEls.indexOf(this.el);
  var intersection = this.intersectedRaycaster.intersections[intersectionIndex];
}
``` ohhhh wait, neither of our JS solutions are quite the same, because raycaster interval is not the same as tick frequency...  IMO biggest raycaster perf boost is throttling raycasts to use appropriate interval. @dmarcos exactly.

@ngokevin so you're thinking not worth making a subscribe per https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3129#issuecomment-334773254 ?  I actually thought that was cleaner, and is a step toward knowing when no one is interested and avoiding emit entirely @ngokevin ok - or maybe just add a method like getElementIntersection(el) on the raycaster that does the lookup. @machenmusik FYI, in trying to port planes detection of aframe-ar to aframe 0.8.2, I tried some of the proposed code, this is fine to intersect only one object, groundEl in your example @ngokevin but in practice you have several planes, destroying and recreating during the session, and other objects in your scene you want to interact with. I'll give you an example that clearly is difficult to do with the current raycaster code in aframe 0.8.2. With a plane and a cube on the plane, the two are raycastable.
- you have the ray on the plane, raycaster-intersected on the plane, raycaster-intersection with the plane, fine
- then you hover on the cube, the ray intersects both the cube and the plane, raycaster-intersected on the cube, raycaster-intersection with the cube, good
- now you hover on the plane, raycaster-intersected-cleared on the cube good,  raycaster-intersection-cleared with the cube, but no other events for other existing intersections (the plane), how do I move a cursor along the plane now?
I even tried to do this to have a raycaster-intersected event again on the plane:

```
const cursor = document.getElementById("cursor");
const raycaster = document.querySelector("[raycaster]");
raycaster.addEventListener(
    "raycaster-intersection",
    (evt) => {
      var point = evt.detail.intersections[0].point;
      cursor.setAttribute("position", point);
      const el = evt.detail.els[0];
      el.setAttribute("follow-intersection", "follow:true");
});

  raycaster.addEventListener(
    "raycaster-intersection-cleared",
    (evt) => {
      evt.detail.clearedEls.forEach(el => {
        el.setAttribute("follow-intersection", "follow:false");
      });

      // if we still intersect an element, it becomes the one where we follow the reticle
      if (raycaster.components.raycaster.intersections.length > 0) {
        raycaster.components.raycaster.intersectionDetail.els =
          raycaster.components.raycaster.intersectedEls;
        raycaster.components.raycaster.intersectionDetail.intersections =
          raycaster.components.raycaster.intersections;
         raycaster.emit(
           "raycaster-intersection",
           raycaster.components.raycaster.intersectionDetail
         );
      }
  );
```
It did work, but sometime my cursor froze because the plane is destroyed and another one is created I guess, I'm not sure.
And I created a component like this:
```
AFRAME.registerComponent("follow-intersection", {
  schema: {
    follow: { default: false }
  },
  init: function() {
    this.el.addEventListener("raycaster-intersected", evt => {
      this.intersectingRaycaster = evt.detail.el.components.raycaster;
    });
    this.el.addEventListener("raycaster-intersected-cleared", () => {
      this.intersectingRaycaster = null;
    });
    this.cursor = document.getElementById("cursor");
  },
  tick: function() {
    if (!this.intersectingRaycaster) {
      return;
    }
    if (!this.data.follow) {
      return;
    }
    const intersection = this.intersectingRaycaster.getIntersection(this.el);
    if (intersection) {
      this.cursor.setAttribute("position", intersection.point);
    }
  }
});

```
In practice, you have several objects intersected, not only one, so I introduced a follow attribute to only enable the follow intersection behavior for only one intersected object. because updating the cursor from several components is not good at all. :)

So in the end, I gave up, too complex and I'm still having issues with cursor sometime not following on a plane.
I ended up removing all the code above and reintroducing the raycaster-intersection event for all intersections, not only newIntersections.

So what do you folks think about this? Do I keep my custom aframe build? Do we add back the raycaster-intersection event for all intersections like I did? An option to select this behavior? @vincentfretin I'm not sure I fully grasp your use case, but I've had success using something similar to your follow component to keep the intersection position updated combined with `super-hands` to address the issue in the third bullet point and re-target the follow component (because you would get a new `hover-start` on the plane after the cube intersection was lost) @wmurphyrd You're right super-hands seems to actually do exactly what I want for my third bullet point. You maintain an array of this.hoverEls, and on unhover on say the cube, you look at next target in this.hoverEls to start the hover on the plane. It appears I'm trying to reimplement what you did in super-hands indeed.
I'm just finding it unfortunate that I now need to add much complexity to my code or add an extra dependency to my project to do what used to work in aframe 0.7.1. I know all those changes are for performance reasons, and I appreciate all your work in this area.
I'll maybe retry this by looking at the super-hands code or using it as a new dependency on my project. But for now, I'll use my custom aframe build. In the original plane-cube example, the problem is that the intersection is
being cleared on the cube but not being started on the plane reliably,
right?

nothing -> plane; plane fires
plane -> cube and plane; cube fires
cube and plane -> plane; cube fires, but plane does not

I don't think we want to fire redundant events per raycaster interval; it
does seem to me, however, that a consistent "intersection-set-has-changed"
event might be worth having, and the default behavior in response could be
to fire off the individual intersection-cleared and intersection events
that are deemed appropriate.

Maybe there should be a "closest" event, which would fire for plane after
cube is no longer intersected, which would solve this?

 The aframe-ar-plane Glitch has a slightly different solution @ngokevin I don't think two raycasters will work well, but YMMV

@donmccurdy yes I know but if we're going to do that manual processing then why not move more complicated event emission out of raycaster?  The one by one for intersection is inefficient compared to the all in one for cleared, and when using the one by one paradigm I do think it is reasonable for folks to expect cleared events to be symmetrical, which they are not Yeah, I'm thinking maybe we should have an option that turns off all the event emitting (except maybe one when intersections change) so if you want to customize by reading the internals, you don't have to incur the garbage and overhead from the rest. looking at things starting from https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/raycaster.js#L204
I can see that we want to filter out some data up to line 222.
But in cases where we're going to check things by ourselves later, especially the case where we are only interested with intersection with a single entity via getIntersection, there is a bunch of superfluous work and/or garbage from lines 224 through 260; I still think having a single emit would be helpful then (e.g. to avoid having to monkey-patch checkIntersections to match raycaster interval)  I implemented the solution proposed in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3124#issuecomment-334589365
 I just rebased because #3127 was merged.  This breaks everything using raycaster, right?  As there is no way AFAIK to detect the behavior change, if we’re going to break the existing contract, maybe better to change event name so compatibility can be achieved by supporting both old and new event names... Maybe it would be nicer to have a helper component that adds a listener that calls the prior contract, so if you need the old behavior you can add raycaster-legacy-events or sonething I completely agree that small breaking changes are allowed, but now that the framework has more traction and wider usage, correspondingly small affordances to ease migration seem more worthwhile to consider. Along the lines of gltf next and legacy, having legacy helper components that throw deprecation warnings once for a point release might be a reasonable approach?  (This may break existing code, right?) Yes definitely, this will break super-hands for GearVR. super-hands is already broken with the merge of #3126 
https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component/issues/79 This is one of those features where it is rarely used, but for any that do, the event detail is always used at the moment. Would it be feasible to determine if there was anything listening and if not just don’t emit at all? Nice! @dmarcos @ngokevin I made a small PR to super-hands https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component/pull/80  **Description:**
The line component that is part of laser-controls does not change its length to the intersection distance as determined by the raycaster component.  What should happen is the line component shortens itself to not extend past the nearest intersection point.  What ends up happening is the line component remains at the raycaster's far value.

- A-Frame Version: 0.7.0
- Platform / Device: Tested with Vive on Firefox 56.0, and GearVR with GearVR controller using Oculus' browser
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: May be seen in link-traversal showcase example

Spent a long time trying to figure out why the laser-controls component wasn't correctly changing its laser line length in my own project.  But then I found that the link-traversal example also exhibits the same issue: its laser lines go right through the link portals.

I've found a couple of reasons for this.  One I solved, and the other I worked around.

The first issue I found was that the raycaster stopped calling its drawLine() method as soon as there was a valid intersection.  The reason for this is due to a _return_ call in its tick() method.  Change the _return_ in this code block starting at line 218 in raycaster.js from:

```
// Emit intersection cleared on both entities per formerly intersected entity.
for (i = 0; i < prevIntersectedEls.length; i++) {
  if (intersectedEls.indexOf(prevIntersectedEls[i]) !== -1) { return; }
  el.emit('raycaster-intersection-cleared', {el: prevIntersectedEls[i]});
  prevIntersectedEls[i].emit('raycaster-intersected-cleared', {el: el});
}
```

to a _break_:

```
// Emit intersection cleared on both entities per formerly intersected entity.
for (i = 0; i < prevIntersectedEls.length; i++) {
  if (intersectedEls.indexOf(prevIntersectedEls[i]) !== -1) { break; }
  el.emit('raycaster-intersection-cleared', {el: prevIntersectedEls[i]});
  prevIntersectedEls[i].emit('raycaster-intersected-cleared', {el: el});
}
```

This allows for drawLine() to be properly called with the correct length, which should have been it.  Unfortunately, there appears to be a deeper issue with A-Frame for the next reason.

Within raycaster's drawLine() method there is the following at line 307:

    el.setAttribute('line', lineData);

As far as I can tell, this is perfectly fine.  The trouble is that the line component's update() method never gets called after this.  I've tried splitting out the _start_ and _end_ attributes into their own calls.  I saw someone mention in an issue calling setAttribute() twice to force an update.  I was never able to get the line component's update() method to trigger, so the line always ended up being the same length no matter what was sent to it.

My current work around to fix this is to modify the raycaster's tick() method to remove the line component just before calling drawLine():

```
      // Update line length.
      if (data.showLine) {
        if (intersections.length) {
          if (intersections[0].object.el === el && intersections[1]) {
            lineLength = intersections[1].distance;
          } else {
            lineLength = intersections[0].distance;
          }
        }
	el.removeAttribute('line'); // DAW: Heavy handed change to force a new line as a test
        this.drawLine(lineLength);
      }
```

This forces the line component to be rebuilt within drawLine(), and its attributes end up being correctly set.  I don't like the idea of having to rebuild the line component every tick, so hopefully this issue with setAttribute() can be resolved.
 @DavidWyand Thanks for investigating! I continued your work on this.
@ngokevin adding clone() indeed fixed the issue.
I created PR #3127 with the break and using two vectors to avoid unnecessary clone. It is working great. Thanks for taking care of this guys before I could get to it.  All of the changes are working at my end.
  I've been trying to make [my project](https://github.com/trusktr/infamous) work in Edge, and it's been a pain because v1 works with native classes, and it's a mess trying to transpile/not transpile. I've had no luck with Polymer's (Justin Fagnani's) shim yet. I'm going to also give Andrea's [babel-plugin-transform-builtin-classes](https://github.com/WebReflection/babel-plugin-transform-builtin-classes) a shot.

What are your guys plans, if any, on v1? Have you tried it? Maybe you don't want to. For me it's too late, I'm already settled on using native classes and not turning back, at least not right now. > Good luck

Yeah, it's been tough couple days with nothing working. No matter what I try (transpilation, no transpilation, document-register-element, @webcomponents/custom-elements with and without Justin Fagnani's native-shim, and every permutation of those, I simply always get the `HTMLElement can not be called without 'new'` error.

Well, except I've gotten it to work where CE v1 is natively supported, but that's about it.

@dmarcos made some changes to document-register-element. Do you know what for? With some tinkering, I've gotten v1 to work in IE and up (IE 10+, Edge 12+, Chrome, etc).

---

> so we can have a hierarchy of classes that pretty much call super()

What do you mean? In my cases I have hierarchy of classes using vanilla `document-register-element` where these classes call `super.attributeChangedCallback`, `super.connectedCallback`, etc. Haven't had any problems with that yet.  Thanks @donmccurdy! I wonder if this is a threejs issue - gonna try to break it in three when I get home.  (I thought those wanted to be THREE.Vector3 for performance efficiency)  **Description:**

- A-Frame Version: 0.7.0
- Platform / Device: Chrome on Android phone

I have a scene with "a-camera" placed in the default position. When I enter VR mode on a mobile browser on different Android smartphones the camera automatically goes up of 1.6, while upon exiting VR mode the height doesn't return to the previous value. So the height increases everytime the user enters VR. I have tried to manually set the position of the camera and change the userHeight parameter but the problem remains.

I managed to solve this problem by resetting the camera to the default height -1.6 upon entering VR, but I don't think this is how the camera should work. I have the same issue in Chrome version 62 on Android phone with A-frame Version 0.7.1.  **Description:**

When using a touchscreen the 'click' event does not register properly. 
In above url try clicking the blue box on a touch screen.
Following would be expected:
 - When clicked the blue box should change to a random hue.
What actually happens:
- the 'touch'/'click' does not register on first touch.
- It registers second time but this time I can trigger the click event on the box by clicking anywhere on the screen. Even besides the box.
 Awesome. You are a star. 
let me know if you need anything from me.  **Description:**
- A-Frame Version: 0.7.0
- Platform / Device: MobileVR - Cardboard, Daydream, GearVR
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:
`<a-entity camera="userHeight: 1.6" look-controls></a-entity>`
The same happens in an official exmaple:
https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/helloworld/

Every time I enter and exit VR mode on mobile device userHeight offset is added multiple times to camera Y position. I used a quick fix, as follows:
`<a-entity position="0 1.6 0" camera="userHeight: 0.01" look-controls></a-entity>`
This helped, as a very small offset is added to camera height, but I assume it will break things on Vive, Oculus and Windows Mixed Reality headsets. :/
Edit: My quick fix also breaks controller position on Daydream and GearVR.


 In the "enter-vr" event listener I set the userHeight to 0 as a workaround. Works in Cardboard and Gear VR with controllers and I guess in the other HMDs as well.

I am not sure if this actually *is* a bug... Is this the same as #3051 / #3111 (now closed) ? Thanks guys for your comments. Until PR referenced in #3111 is merged to master, I will check out the fix suggested by @weddingdj.  Make sure you test chrome rift/vive/daydream here, as @dmarcos notes we have encountered quirks or issues.  (Actually I am not sure whether we characterized Edge once we realized that we broke Chrome) Yeah, we started down this avenue of approach but backed off at the time with #2984.  One suggestion is to make the interval a system configurable parameter, as for some apps 500ms may be slower than desired (as this impacts all tracked controls, and we no longer have the event listeners which would fire immediately when available) I suspect that if we changed the throttle once we have seen 1 (for 3DOF) or 2 (for 6DOF) tracked controls, we could reduce the interval to almost never. (We should test recent support for Edge as well) It seems to be working fine on GearVR with Oculus browser. I don't see any difference. With or without the patch, the controller motion is smooth. I don't see any difference. Nice - for completeness I think we need to confirm
chromium/Rift+Touch and chrome/daydream - the former being what stopped us before IIRC.

 I thought we merged this already, apparently I was wrong.  Is anything blocking, or just haven't gotten to it yet?  This definitely fix issue #3051 
I don't know how to write a test for this, this seems bound to the VRControls and how it renders in the browser... @dmarcos There is already a hasPositionalTracking check in camera to save the pose (position and rotation of the camera) yes. So you mean saving userHeight? But this is set on the VRControls object, not the camera. I'm really lost with this, and I don't have any positional tracking device to test this, only GearVR. 

What I know it that before #3000, there was no `this.controls.userHeight = this.getUserHeight();` line in look-controls, so the `this.controls.userHeight` stayed at 0.0. Adding a condition to it solved the issue for GearVR. It feels to me as though we are trying to bake too many smarts into the `camera` -- when it comes to uses for render textures and spectator views, the `camera` is just that - not meant to be a stand-in for the user and presumed HMD positioning.  I thought that (in current incarnation) `look-controls` was intended to contain the latter, and that from prior discussions we thought this area might need some refactoring.  My recollection is that recent changes have handed to use absolute positioning not relative positioning for room scale etc., and this repeated application of relative offset may be a vestige of doing things the old way that should not be re-introduced regardless of where? One other thing that seems to differ between positional and non positional tracking devices is that with positional tracking you are placed to z -2 or something like that, and with GearVR you are probably at z: 0. So there are some examples, notably https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component/issues/89 where you are too close to the object, here with the big cube. I just wanted to add that this fix works for me.  It allows my project to work on GearVR with the Oculus browser, and the Vive using Firefox 56.0, without having to make any camera changes.  Thanks!
 @dmarcos Maybe we can merge this and you folks work eventually on a refactoring in another branch? @vincentfretin sorry for breaking GearVR and thank you for issuing the fix. I verified that it works as expected with Window Mixed Reality.  FYI, super-hands currently uses this feature. Until we don't need to do `.is('vr-mode')` that way, we still need states, right?  **Description:**

- Updates docs accordingly
 @ngokevin thanks and sorry about the weird spaces - working through some linting issues in my local dev env. Won't happen next time;)  This fixes issue #3051
 If `el.getAttribute('camera').userHeight` returned 0, `getUserHeight()` always returned DEFAULT_CAMERA_HEIGHT instead of 0.

` <a-entity camera look-controls />` now renders again userHeight to 0 like it's supposed to. But maybe this fix introduces a regression for #3000, @olga-microsoft can you please verify? Ah, I just looked at it again. It doesn't fix the issue with `<a-camera />` which set camera.userHeight to 1.6 by default". I still have an increasing offset. This fixes only the case where you really want a camera on the floor.  **Description:**

With Gear VR, when I press touchpad or trigger on the controller, the button is not highlighted like the code in gearvr-controls.js suggests.

In gearvr-controls.js, we get the mesh by name `controllerObject3D.getObjectByName('Trigger')` and `controllerObject3D.getObjectByName('Touchpad')` to be able to highlight the buttons when the button is pressed, but the three meshes in https://cdn.aframe.io/controllers/samsung/gear_vr_controller.obj are all called Default when you `console.log(controllerObject3D)`.
To fix it, simply edit in gear_vr_controller.obj the three lines `g Default` in the file to `g Base`, `g Trigger` and `g Touchpad` in this order. Can someone please edit the file on the cdn?

 Hi, I 'll be using aframe this fall and it would be amazing to try it with my cardboard and on Edge mobile, but unfortunately as reported it doesn't do it anymore. So I guess I am sending some encouragement here ✨ And I would be excited to see an update 😳 😊 
I am also working for Microsoft but not in Edge team 😅 . (Maybe I can still help somehow? At least for testing...) 💜 
 @dmarcos I will have a look 🤓  @dmarcos, getVRDisplays() in Edge on Windows Mobile returns 0 displays. The recommendation is to use Device Orientation API, whenever available, not only for phones.
@Malwine I tried the polyfill link, the scene is jumping around. Our team will investigate, what causes the problem. Let me know if you have a different result. @olga-microsoft Thank you for investigating!! 💛 ❤️ 
I had exactly the same experience with my Lumia 950(Win 10) trying the polyfill link the boxes where jumping around and would only calm a bit when I put the phone on a stable ground (like a table). 😰  
But I had the feeling that it would react on rotating.
When I tried an aframe example I could not rotate(look to the side) with the Windows phone. @dmarcos The [spec](https://w3c.github.io/deviceorientation/spec-source-orientation.html#deviceorientation) mentions that degrees are expected:
"The rotationRate attribute must be ... expressed in degrees per second (deg/s)."
Would it be better to invert the if-clause instead?
 I opened another request which seems to be related after some further research #3190
I work on an android device (Epson Moverio BT-300) which will no longer be detected as a VRDevice since 0.7.0. However, in 0.6.1 it works. Also the Three.js misc_controls_deviceorientation example works fine. When loading the 0.6.1 aframe-master.js the getVRDisplays returns a valid display. with 0.7.0 it does no longer return a display.  thank you! it was fun to build.  **Description:**

In A-Frame 0.6.1 (No code was modified when upgrading to 0.7.0), the oculus rift touch controller used to work with the hands-controller component. In addition, I wasn't receiving this r.mixer is undefined.

If I use the raycaster with the mouse, there isn't any issue.  Any ideas?

@donmccurdy Well, you're right in that by removing laser-controls, hand-controls start working! I know it may look kind of iffy... Do you have any recommendations how would I switch between selecting and grabbing without resorting to a lot of menus (switching the laser-control on and off in a intuitive manner - UX wise).  **Description:**

  Renderer size should only be updated on desktop in fullscreen mode.
Resizing the browser window while presenting leads to the canvas being resized accordingly, which updates resolution in the headset, causing a bad experience. Since Aframe does not rely on Three.js built-in mechanism for resizing the canvas this needs to be handled explicitly in a-scene.js.

I'm currently working on an application, which will support both Daydream and GearVR controllers.
I've noticed that in official source code method addEventListeners() for both Daydream https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/34d1988430c7541f8e28978b31bb6278ca2b7df7/src/components/daydream-controls.js#L66 and GearVR https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/34d1988430c7541f8e28978b31bb6278ca2b7df7/src/components/gearvr-controls.js#L67 is never invoked. As I understand that's the method, which should emit `trackpad` or `trigger` events to the component.

For now, to solve my issue I've ended up writing my own component, which setups those events for daydream and gearvr controllers, but I think it requires an open discussion on how we should map trackpad/trigger events to raycaster/cursor intersection clicks.

 Here's a video if that makes it clearer:
https://youtu.be/awjY0GMPox8 Confirmed. It's happening to me too:

![increasinf-offset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/757942/30964996-ed1239e0-a453-11e7-9b95-59c9c77bf4e4.gif) I can confirm there is an issue with 0.7.0 with GearVR and Oculus brower. No issue with 0.6.0 and 0.6.1.
In 0.7.0, no issue with `<a-camera user-height="0" />`, there is an issue with `<a-camera user-height="1" />` (or any value > 0), it increases each time by user-height when you enter, exit, enter vr. The regression should be in a commit between 19 july (post 0.6.1 release) and 14 september (date of this issue) I guess. issue with https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/4487c28/dist/aframe-master.min.js 29 Aug
no issue with https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/ba7d108/dist/aframe-master.min.js 25 Aug #3000 introduced the regression.
If I remove this line https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3000/files#diff-6285039eee70ed830f70f7d2f7b7dfa5R60 in the look-controls component, I don't have the issue anymore. Please reopen. The fix I did only fixed it for a camera set to userHeight 0. See my comment https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3105#issuecomment-333461108 I really fixed the issue in #3111 I am getting this same issue as of today in aframe 0.7.0. I am using
```
<a-entity camera="userHeight: 1.6" look-controls>
</a-entity>
```
Edit - sorry it seems to be fixed if I use this instead
```
<a-entity position="0 1.6 0">
    <a-entity camera look-controls>
```  The documentation isn't very clear about how to specify screenshot size.

If I'm using this code:
`document.querySelector('a-scene').components.screenshot.capture('perspective')`
How do I specify a 200x200px screenshot?
  I have read "create with ar.js and aframe",I just find pattern & barcode marker, don't support nft?  it should be create ar with ar.js and aframe,im sorry  Tried out laser controls with WMR. Works much smoother and connect/disconnect is handled correctly  Thanks for the visibility change!

Regarding the other issues, it takes sometimes 5-10 seconds for a controller to be removed from the gamepads array after it is powered off. To determine if the not appearing issue is A-frame or edge, perhaps try the WebVR.info controller sample? https://webvr.info/samples/XX-vr-controllers.html  **Description:**
In a-scene there are 2 disconnect listeners registered, I believe one of them is supposed to be 'connect':
// Exit VR on `vrdisplaydisconnect` (e.g. unplugging Rift headset).
window.addEventListener('vrdisplaydisconnect', this.exitVRTrueBound);
// Exit VR on `vrdisplaydisconnect` (e.g. unplugging Rift headset).
window.addEventListener('vrdisplaydisconnect', this.exitVRTrueBound);

- A-Frame Version: master (4e984156f2f160015008e3f72adc09b71ba59d4c)
 Thanks!
Below vrdisplayconnect listener is removed, but never added, remove too:
window.removeEventListener('vrdisplayconnect', this.enterVRBound);

  **Description:**
Updates to be compliant with final assets (https://github.com/aframevr/assets/pull/30)

**Changes proposed:**
- Updated pointing pose node name
- Fixed pointing pose being incorrect when the controller is not at origin on initialization (calculating transforms from glTF root, not parent world position)
- Fixed laser-controls not showing pointing ray on controller reconnection
- Removed erroneous debug code.
  Fix #3041 

To be consistent with the A-Frame API, the patch allows the use of an `<audio>`
tag with a `MediaStream` object in the `srcObject` attribute. E.g.:

```js
// <a-assets></a-assets>
// <a-entity id="speaker"></a-entity>
const speaker = document.getElementById('speaker');
const assets = document.querySelector('a-assets');
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
.then(stream => {
  const voice = new Audio();
  voice.id = 'speaker-voice';
  voice.srcObject = stream;
  assets.appendChild(voice);
  speaker.setAttribute('sound', `src:${voice.id}`);
});
```
 Though I can see the argument for not bundling streaming sources into `sound` I think the change to allow audio elements to get passed through untouched is still probably a good idea as it allows one to write a `stream-sound` component without having to do anything hacky. Thank you all for the feedback. Working on it. Hello @cvan, next version is ready for review.

@ngokevin, @netpro2k Despite I understand the argument against `sound` component dealing with streams, I think the patch gives you support for a very simple but common use case in a consistent and straightforward way. Furthermore, the source code might serve as a model for more complex implementations. As I mentioned above, I can totally see the argument for not adding this feature to the `sound` component, but I think the change in this PR to propertyTypes.js that allow audio elements to get passed through untouched is still probably a good idea, otherwise its difficult for people to write a component that handles MediaStreams themselves. Even if "preloading only" was the original intention, `<a-assets>` is also the place for mixins and, as far as I know, mixins can be generated dynamically. From the semantic perspective, it makes sense to contain all the experience assets inside the `<a-assets>` tag. From an API perspective, it is more homogeneous if media elements are treated equally (if the core sound component only needs the URL, that's perfectly fine).

Finally, considering the argument of providing only basic functionality in the core, I'm wondering why #3176 got merged. Yes the `sound` component only needs the url, which it can get from the audio element, other componets that may want an `type: 'audio'` property might need more, so it makes sense for the element to just be passed through unchanged, like canvas, video, and image properties.  Currently, only buffered audio files are supported by A-Frame but supporting [`MediaStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) sources would enable interesting scenarios such as positional WebRTC audio.  Fix #3039 

The clarification use MutationObserver as an example but the warning generally
states that A-Frame is not updating the DOM. Thank you @ngokevin but I think the place @donmccurdy suggested  (`docs/introduction/javascript-events-dom-apis.md `) was more convenient since it is more likely developers will read it. Also, the warning was more general since we don't know all the DOM APIs that the optimisation could break. E.g.: another API also breaking is `.querySelector()` whith attribute selectors using the value of the attributes. I.e., this won't work:

```js
// <a-entity id="test"></a-entity>
document.querySelector('#test').setAttribute('position', '0 2 0');
console.log('element:', document.querySelector('[position="0 2 0"]'));
```  Following conversations on #3028 , it would be convenient to clarify this API won't work.
  That's correct.  At this time, we still have concerns about the security implications of open-ended link traversal while within VR.  We're discussing how to address these concerns with the WebVR CG and are hoping to land on something everyone is comfortable with in the WebVR 2.0 design.
In the meanwhile, Microsoft Edge does not force an exit from VR when history.pushState() is called, so that might be an interesting approach to investigate for now.    I am able to load a static glTF (v2.0), but when `play-all-model-animations` component is applied, the geometry no longer renders and the console fills with:

```
THREE.Matrix3: .getInverse() can't invert matrix, determinant is 0
```

The glTF v2.0 model I am using is a simple cube rotating, scaling, and translating - exported from blender with embedded buffers using [KhronosGroup glfTF-Blender-Exporter](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter) master (5ffd6ef). If not a bug with the animations component in aframe, could be one with the exporter, or the three.js gltf loader itself.

I have also investigated that the glTF _does_ render in [babylonjs sandbox](http://sandbox.babylonjs.com/), but not in [threejs viewer](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/).

Blender Version 2.79 (2.79 2017-09-04)   **Description:**
Edited and updated the introduction in index.md
**Changes proposed:**
-Reorganised content to follow a logical order as such: "What is is A-Frame", "Features of A-Frame", "Getting Started with A-Frame", "Off You Go!"
 Hello @dmarcos. That is the distinction I made (i.e., readme file versus introduction). The rationale is that an intro will have a logical flow whereas the readme is to get up and running as fast as possible. It therefore makes sense for intro to contain what A-frame is, it's main features, how to get started using it, etc.  **Description:**

Hi! recently I was playing with react-vr and I saw that the camera moves as my phone rotates or as I rotate myself, my phone doesnt has gyroscope, I saw some Aframe examples and if I rotate myself the camera doestn move, I test the same example with a phone with gyroscope and it does, Will be Aframe has the same feature that react-vr? It based on device motion events or something else?

- A-Frame Version: all
- Platform / Device: All
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: Any sample React VR app
 I test both react-vr example and aframe examples on Chrome for Android in Android 4.4.2 on LG g3

I rotate on myself and aframe doesnt rotate the camera, but in react-vr it does @dmarcos I look quickly on aframe source code and I see that it's using VR Controls to rotate the camera, I test a ThreeJS VR Controls example and if I rotate on my self the camera doesn't move but I use this example [https://threejs.org/examples/misc_controls_deviceorientation.html](url) and if I rotate on myself the camera also moves, so, if the device is mobile phone or some device with no gyroscope, it will be wrong use deviceorientation (like the example above) instead VR Controls?   distance model defaults to 'inverse' not linear

**Description:**
distance model defaults to 'inverse' not linear
**Changes proposed:**
change default from linear to inverse

  I used the exact same code sample used on aframevr/aframe 360-video example: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/v0.6.0/examples/boilerplate/360-video/index.html

All I changed was the source url. But the only thing we see is a dark page, not the 360 video we shot with our Samsung Gear 360.

<a-scene>
   <a-assets>
     <video id="video" src="http://siteurl.net/vrvid/cattle.mp4"

   </a-assets>

   <a-videosphere src="#video" rotation="0 180 0"></a-videosphere>
</a-scene> Here is the URL:

I am using Chrome and Chrome Canary on desktop and chrome on Samsung S8.
The browsers work fine with other 360 Pic (

 I get some security exceptions on the video source:

 Any detail on the exception?

Does it mean I have to enable SSL on the sub domain?

 Try to host the video on the vr.addisfortune.net domain. That is how I initially started out.

I moved the file I the main domain for it has SSL enabled.

 Another 360 shot hosted on the sub domain, yet not change!  fix wrong THREE.js geometry link  `MutationObserver` callback is not triggered when changing an attribute:
https://codepen.io/lodr/pen/LjoGwN
 But they are throttled and the issue breaks a property of HTML elements (_to be observables with a MutationObserver_). I don't think this should be closed. Then I think it is worth to mention somewhere in the documentation because this is an unexpected behaviour if A-Frame is claiming it is tool agnostic for being built on the top of HTML. I'm not saying that polling is not the way to go. I'm saying that if A-Frame claims to be built to be tool agnostic and to reuse the knowledge that web programmers already have, breaking HTML invariants or inherent properties is unexpected and should be warned. Anyway, I'll send a PR for clarifying the `MutationObserver` case in the FAQ.  **Description:**

- A-Frame Version: 0.6.1 
- Platform / Device: Windows 10


I have been developing an app that appears to work fine in chrome along with cordova for IOS 

I have tried to create a Desktop version using node webkit but i am getting the following error

>  ReferenceError: THREE is not defined

i understand that aframe.min has three js packaged within it so i'm a bit confused as to why this is not working. I know threejs works in node webkit so i wonder why aframe is having trouble. 

any solutions would be a massive help 
  Thanks! We are taking a look on Edge and will let you know

 Hi Diego,
The issue described by Lewis is fixed in Edge too, but this leads to another issue:
1. Load the page 2. Connect a headset 3. Disconnect the headset -> page animation loop is broken.
I couldn't root cause, but VREffect is calling vrDisplay.requestAnimationFrame( f ); even without entering VR.
Does this repro in Firefox? I could open a new issue, but I think it should be fixed as a part of this change if it does. One more thing. After disconnecting the headset while in VR the behavior should be the same as after pressing exit VR button. Currently it stops rendering the scene. @dmarcos The disconnect is still not handled properly. After I disconnected the headset, Enter VR button appeared and clicking it enters fullscreen, but the animation loop is stopped, the scene is not being rendered anymore (fullscreen is black). 
If I plug in headset again, the Enter VR button starts VR as expected (but renders black too) The behavior I described above is with Edge + Win Mixed Reality. 
I just tried with Firefox + Vive. Unplugging freezes the split screen picture and plugging resumes VR. There is no option to return to Desktop on the webpage.
Upd: No errors in console Yes, on https://webvr.info/samples/00-hello-webvr.html I am getting all events for either USB or HDMI plug/unplug. Your change is handling the events, which I can see with the VR button working as expected (fullscreen/HMD is toggled correctly). 
vrDisplay/window.requestAnimationFrame loop terminates after headset is disconnected.
Don't have Oculus Thank you! With this change all looks good, rendering restarts. cancelAnimationFrame should be called in response to vrdisplaypresentchange to prevent spawning multiple render loops.  **Description:**
The cubes in the tracked-controls example do not move when grabbed by Windows Motion Controllers. Additionally, the hand-controls meshes are incorrectly offset from the element center when initially loaded, as they inherit the parent transform (which has been set by the tracked-controls component). Lastly, there is a race condition somewhere, such that sometimes for a single frame `mesh.mixer` does not exist causing a null reference exception.

**Changes proposed:**

 No worries. Feel free to change. It's just my first attempt at helping with docs :)  @larsbergstrom what was the outcome?  With OpenVR, you should see the VRDisplay's RAF callback occur about 4ms before the next vsync.  the frame submitted in this RAF callback will be presented in the vsync following, so you have more than 4ms to render it.  This timing optimizes for both lowest latency and tries to interleave the GPU utilization between the WebGL rendering and the VR reprojection / compositing.

It is not just the matter of getting sufficient refresh rate, but that the sub-frame timing is optimal.  I would suggest that the 2d mirrored display be rendered synchronously with the VRDisplay's frame, and let the browser handle the frame drops in the mirrored display to match up the framerate.

If physics, culling, and other CPU bound operations are not in a WebWorker, these things would be most optimally performed immediately after the submitFrame call in the VRDisplay RAF callback, preparing the next frame.  Ideally, the engine should be ready to perform the GPU heavy operations in response to the VRDisplay RAF callback, and only make minor adjustments to culling as needed to adjust for the updated headset pose at the start of the RAF.  **Description:**
When plugging in an HMD after page load, clicking the Enter VR button still takes you to the 2D mouse driven mode, rather than entering VR.

This appears to be related to ([three.js #12109](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/12109))
A workaround could be to re-implement the VRControls class in a-frame; it is only an example in three.js after all and is quite a small class to begin with.

- A-Frame Version: master
- Platform / Device: Windows Mixed Reality
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/helloworld/ Sorry I omitted that. I have tested the following combinations, it reproduces on all of them:

- Windows Mixed Reality & Microsoft Edge
- Vive & Firefox
- Vive & Chromium

Test steps were:

1. Ensure device is disconnected, and that VR software is shut down
2. Open browser, navigate to https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/helloworld/
3. Connect hardware, wait for the home screen to be visible in the HMD
4. Press Enter VR on the a-frame sample
5. It will enter full screen mode, rather than VR.

A page reload will allow you to enter VR normally.  **Description:**
Can we use a OrthographicCamera in Aframe?
I do really need a Orthographic view instead of Perspective view, but Aframe always uses PerspectiveCamera, can we add options in [camera]?

I tried to write a custom camera Component by replacing 'PerspectiveCamera' in 'src/components/camera.js', but it will show errors (e.g. this.system undefined ...)

Hope someone could give some help. 

- A-Frame Version:  <= 0.6.1 @donmccurdy Thanks, I know how to do a OrthographicCamera now. But I find out other components (e.g. cursor, look-controls) didn't work well with OrthographicCamera. It may need to hack many other components.
@dmarcos I'm doing a data visualization project, it was working with general 2D lib like d3.js, we're trying to re-create all lines in a 3D world. It works well with three.js, and much easier with A-Frame, but we don't like or need the perspective effect. @ngokevin sorry to hijack this old post, but I'm currently building a VR 'editor' and I do agree with that A-Frame should mainly focus on the Perspective Camera, but I do need to switch between PerspectiveCamera (when viewing what the user has build) and OrthographicCamera (when the user is designing). I'm unsure yet on how to make it work (the sample posted above, doesn't really work), but would you accept a PR if I were to build support for it? @promontis I am also trying to implement an orthographic camera but currently struggling with controls. Have you found any useful resources by any chance?
thanks in advance @Jesusbill nope... sorry. I've switched over to BabylonJS as it provides much more out-of-the-box in the areas that I needed, namely a 3D editor. Will use AFrame more for real VR  …element with the possibility to disable the behavior (on by default)

Support mouse input in WebVR by handling vrdisplaypointerrestricted and vrdisplaypointerunrestricted events in MS Edge. It is by design that mozPointerLock* and webkitPointerLock* implementations are not included.

**Changes proposed:**
- In response to vrdisplaypointerrestricted perform requestPointerLock on the canvas element that is used for WebVR rendering
- In response to vrdisplaypointerunrestricted perform document.exitPointerLock if the locked element is the canvas that is used for WebVR rendering
- Give the developer an option to turn off this behavior by calling disableCanvasPointerLock on the scene object.

Added support for windows motion controllers, with tests, which fixed one or two bugs in tracked-controls class.

Also consolidated the logic used in tracked-controls utils and component for isControllerPresent to a single function.

This PR does not yet have the final controller GLB asset files, - I do plan on uploading those to the a-frame CDN however I am still waiting for the OK internally here.

**Changes proposed:**
- Added error callback on glTF-model component
- Windows Motion Controller support 
- Consolidation of tracked-controls duplicated logic to a single utility function
 Oh yes - I will add to the laser controls class and perform testing. Let me know if you are happy for me to update the PR with that additional commit (and the other minor resolved issues we have discussed) now, or wait. I've updated the PR to add laser-controls support. I would have preferred to do it without emitting the new 'controllerdisplayready' event; however I couldn't get the line-component to update the start/end positions once they have been set once. Have you encountered that?

Note - that the offsets and rotations default to zero/forward; but can be overridden by the data from the glTF model file (we store the offsets on specifically named nodes in the tree, similar to how we do the button transforms). Thanks all for the reviewing! I've pushed another revision that should address those 4 changes. @dmarcos  - Something I have noticed is that the controllers are quite dark in some scenes. It would be nice to have a high-intensity directional light (position: 0, 1, 0) that only lights the controller, not the rest of the scene. I can't see an obvious way to do this, have any tricks? That (which I'll get done now) - and also getting controller assets uploaded to the aframevr/assets repo so that we can modify the URL at the top of the file: [windows-motion-controls.js#L12
](https://github.com/leweaver/aframe/blob/c5df51e70dff4f830ee2bd9a6d2ebc0df39e32cf/src/components/windows-motion-controls.js#L12
) - I put a note this morning on aframevr/assets#1 related to this. I believe I am finished with my changes to this PR. Do I also need to also include the built files under dist/? Sorry forgot to hit enter on this comment box! As you probably noticed, right now this PR version is pointing to: https://cdn.aframe.io/controllers/microsoft/ - I have just submitted https://github.com/aframevr/assets/pull/29 so the URL should be valid soon.

Thanks very much for merging in!  **Description:**

While working on an AR.js + A-Frame app that allows users to draw/paint in AR, I wanted users to be able to use touch events to draw on a mobile device and use device orientation to change camera orientation. Touch events are included in `look-controls` by default, with no disable action allowed. Using `touchmove` events to draw resulted in drawing across the scene in a reverse pan because of the way that `touchmove` is coupled with `look-controls`. In magic window mode, there could be many applications of touch events that would not want to also change device orientation.

**Changes proposed:**
- Add property to look-controls schema
- Check property for true before binding, adding, and removing TouchEvent-related functions
 Thanks for the feedback @donmccurdy and @dmarcos . I will implement those suggested changes soon.  Ideally using fabien-services@benetou.fr instead.    

  
  Add some text to stress that not only you're in trouble if you write some code in a `<script>` tag after `<a-scene>`, but in general if you attach to `<a-scene>` right after it is in the DOM (which IMHO is what is surprising, when you are used to other JS frameworks).

 > What does attach to a-scene mean? Im not sure it provides any extra information. We've said where to put JS code and where not to put it.

Maybe "attach an entity to `<a-scene>`"? The fact is that when I read the current text, I thought it only applied to inlined scripts right after `<a-scene>` and I thought a clarification would help to newbies as me... The fact that it is not enough to write the code in a listener for the DOM ready event should be highlighted. I naively expected that the `<a-scene>` element was ready for children as soon as it was in the DOM, and maybe other would think the same.

However, as I said in the issue, if you don't see it this way, don't mind. I already took too much time from you. OK, thanks a lot!  See #3001 for the problem I found with some code that didn't run in Chrome. Thanks to @dmarcos and @ngokevin, who showed the need to wait until `a-scene` is loaded.

This section of the tutorial is the first one entering into details of how to write JavaScript code to manipulate a scene, so I think it needs these clarifications. Otherwise, you can lose a lot of time and energy until you realize your code should be in a listener for `loaded` of the `a-frame` element.

 Thanks a lot. However, maybe a more prominent text about that would help. I went through [that page](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/javascript-events-dom-apis.html#where-to-place-javascript-code-for-a-frame), but I didn't notice the problem. Maybe because I was not using a raw script after `<a-scene>`...

I've submitted a new pull request, #3005, about this, just in case you agree a clarification is convenient. Just close it if not.

In any case, thanks a lot for the support and explanations. OK. Sorry for the noise.  **Description:**

``` Thanks a lot, and sorry for the noise. That makes a lot of sense.

However, I went carefully through most of the [Introduction](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction), including the [section on JavaScript](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/javascript-events-dom-apis.html), and didn´t notice about that. Maybe it would be convenient to mention that early in that tutorial, since it can be very confusing when you're starting with A-frame. 

In fact, there is some code in the  [section on JavaScript](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/javascript-events-dom-apis.html) that suggests that there is no need of waiting until the scene is loaded:

```javascript
var sceneEl = document.querySelector('a-scene');
var entityEl = document.createElement('a-entity');
// Do `.setAttribute()`s to initialize the entity.
sceneEl.appendChild(entityEl);
```

The text there comments about the importance of waiting until an entity is loaded for changing its settings, but says nothing about `a-scene`, which in the above code is assumed to be loaded.

In fact, the same happens with the code right below that one, where once again an entity is attached to `a-frame` without waiting for `a-frame` to be loaded.

I'm opening a pull request to that section stating all this: #3002.  **Description:**

Hello,
I want to make a asset component.

First, I set a    `<a-assets id="assets"></a-assets>`  element that did not have a child.
Second, added img source element by assets.appendChild(imgSource). 
And then assets.setAttribute('component','');
The attribute added well when i checked browser developer console.
But the component's init and update function did not work.

Does component can not be applied to `<a-assets>` element?
Anyone know?
thanks.
  @cvan perhaps irrelevant now, but link-traversal example, this codepen (https://s.codepen.io/machenmusik/debug/XaVMWJ/mVAbGERyxabk) and a non-public app @dmarcos ok, as we discussed at OC4 Thanks and sorry @cvan!  **Description:**
I was trying to use these examples and realized they were not working with the most recent versions of A-Frame. Made a copy of the codepen example and added some changes to make it work.

Also the HTML example in the page works different, so I made a few changes, the 'fill' property in both animations started with 'backwards', now the first one starts with 'forwards', and removed the 'fuseTimeout' since it seems that the 'dur' properties in animation Entity take care of that.

I am trying to get a message to show when a user has its mobile phone in VR mode but holds it inin portrait position.
I see that there is some code in `aframe/src/components/scene/vr-mode-ui.js:136` to do this.
Unfortunately, it is never triggered, because when entering VR the scene locks the phone in landscape mode (`aframe/src/core/scene/a-scene.js:246`)

Are there any plans to make this feature available again by not locking the orientation of the phone ? I believe it would be better from a UX perspective. I have done further research and I think I understand now, I'll share its results here in case it helps some fellow developers.

The browser on which I want this feature to work is Chrome for Android.
With a vanilla version of the browser, I am able to reproduce the bug as shown here : 

![img_20170825_100036](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17003643/29711731-45447320-898e-11e7-9c64-1e5a3a555493.jpg)

But there is a caveat. When the WebVR flag (in `chrome://flags`) is enabled, the WebVR viewer changes : 
- When the flag is turned off, a bespoke viewer is used
![screenshot_20170825-123411](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17003643/29716271-a1a3a064-89a2-11e7-80ac-661a70715734.png)
- When the flag is turned on, the Cardboard Viewer is used
![screenshot_20170825-142655](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17003643/29716297-ba4659b8-89a2-11e7-82a7-beecb4676610.png)

The Cardboard Viewer will end up being the default one, and its behaviour cannot be changed via HTML code. So this feature cannot be implemented on it.
It might be interesting to implement it on the "bespoke" viewer, though. @ngokevin any thoughts on the above ?  **Description:**

- A-Frame Version: 0.6.1
- Platform / Device: Chrome / Samsung Galaxy S8
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: 

I have created a scene with a 8192x4096 sky texture, which renders perfectly on desktops, and also in browser on a Galaxy S8, but when VR view is entered, the sky texture is extremely aliased, as if the filtering is dropped down to a "nearest" filter. If inspecting the actual texture object in the scene, the filtering is on the texture is specified as a THREE.LinearFilter.

The texture has been broken down into two 4096x4096 half-domes, since 4096x4096 is the maximum texture size the mobile GPU supports.

Any idea what could be causing this? It might be interesting to note, that if the scene is rendered with polyfill in firefox on the device, the texture is filtered correctly, and the aliasing is completely gone. Using daydream in Chrome. Also the same thing occurs in Chrome beta. Haven't tried it with Oculus/Samsung Internet/Gear VR, but I can give it a try as well. Here's an example where the issue occurs: https://superhelix.dk/vr/test1/ Furthermore, if VR view is exited, by pressing the app button, the texture then also becomes very aliased in the normal view. I have tested the scene on a Vive headset through Firefox, and the aliasing does not occur here, so it is something specific to Chrome. Ok, I don't think this is fixable by a-frame as such. The problem occurs because Chrome's Daydream renderer apparently subsamples the rendering quite a bit. If I manually resize the rendering canvas, the aliasing disappears, but performance takes a hit.

I guess this should be closed, sorry for the noise ;)

If I am wrong, and this is actually caused by the way that a-frame initialises the rendering system, I'd be interested to hear about it. @markqvist I don't have specific info but have anecdotally heard that AA is forcibly prevented on several mobile platforms. Not sure that you've encountered a bug rather than a "feature" (or, compromise...)  **Description:**

  While playing around with this question on [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45805894/d3-js-makes-entity-disappear-while-using-animation-function-of-a-frame/45806052#45806052), I got into a weird bug, which I don't see reported anywhere.

When an empty` <a-animation>` is appended to a entity, its parent dissapears, because its rotation is changed to 'NaN 0 0'.

Normally i don't see a reason why anyone would append an empty `<a-animation>`, but in that case, it seems the empty entity is created on d3's `append("a-animation");` and I couldn't fix it by changing the rotation attribute, like i tried [here](https://jsfiddle.net/gftruj/soetzojt/2/).

  **Description:**
A few of the a-frame primitives use 'height' and 'width' to refer to properties of the geometry, but the docs seem to assume they're referring to properties of the material. (I'm not sure if this suggests an underlying problem with whatever originally generated these tables in the docs, but it was suggested in the Slack that I just go ahead and edit the docs manually, so I have.)

**Changes proposed:**
- Fix the 'component mapping' and 'default value' for the 'height' and (if used in the geometry constructor) the 'width' attributes, in the docs for the 'a-box', 'a-cone', and 'a-cylinder' primitives
- It seems like someone already fixed the component mappings in 'a-plane', but didn't fix the defaults; I've done that now  **Description:**

  Would it be possible to propagate the `model` property from the `daydream-controls` component up to the `laser-controls` component so that we can hide the controller model but still use laser controls?

https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/components/laser-controls.html
https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/components/daydream-controls.html Yes! I would still like Daydream controls, I had already tried this before posting the issue and it didn't seem to work:

```html
<a-entity laser-controls="hand: left" daydream-controls="model: false"></a-entity>
```

I just tried again and it didn't work again, no controller model, but also no tracked laser pointer either.

However, the whole reason I was trying to have Daydream-tracked lasers without a model was because I was trying to reduce lag on loading of the 3D controller model, in trying to resolve a bug where the controller wasn't tracking at all for a colleague of mine.  But, overnight I realized that we had just forgotten to enable the `gamepad-extensions` flag on their Pixel device.

Some follow ups:

- For people who still may want to have controller tracking, laser pointing, but no controller model, the workaround that you posted would be fine (for me, anyway) if it worked as expected, but it doesn't seem to at the moment.  Should I open a new issue for that?
- It might be useful for the A-Frame controller docs to put in reminders that the `webvr` and `gamepad-extensions` flags might need to be set on mobile (and possibly other headsets?)..

Thank you!

 Thanks, @ngokevin ! Makes sense.

How do you feel about this also working?

  var someObj = document.querySelector("#someObj");
  someObj.addEventListener("model-loaded", () => {
    raycaster.refreshObjects();

But the mesh breaks with some of them, the overall scale changes also.. it needs a detailed analysis.  Adding a animation on the color property and adding the repeat attribute cause the color to be set to #NaNNaNNaN on the next repetition.
The entity becomes white.. :/

Cheers!
Etienne I don't think `Infinity` is a valid value of the repeat attribute. Perhaps you meant `indefinite`?

```html
<a-box transparent="true" color="#007AFF">
  <a-animation attribute="color" to="#000" dur="2000" repeat="indefinite" easing="ease-in-out-bounce">
  </a-animation>
</a-box>
``` @bryik same with any integers ;)  Try adding a `from` attribute:

```html
<a-box position="0 0 -5" transparent="true" color="#007AFF">
  <a-animation attribute="color" from="#007AFF" to="#000" dur="2000" repeat="indefinite" direction="alternate" easing="ease-in-out-bounce">
  </a-animation>
</a-box>
``` Awesome it works haha! Thank you! Although it would be great if this was done by default :)   Do you mean something like this?  https://glitch.com/edit/#!/hollow-author

``` Here is one http://vatelier.net/MyDemo/AFrameVideoExample/ but not on Glitch as iOS still requires videos to be on the same domain. @ShaguftaMethwani This example isn't working for me on PC.  Can't we use js video api to make this work? https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/videosphere/ is the current example, which works fine AFAIK  **Description:**

I recently received a sweet Mozilla brand corrugated paperboard mobile VR viewer (no trademark issues here), and I was sad to learn that the nifty touch button/lever didnt't work with `cursor`.

This PR modifies `cursor` to listen for touch input events in addition to mouse events. With this small change, mobile users can have the same level of control as mouse users. This is especially useful in situations where gaze fusing is not optimal, like dragging an object around the scene to move it. (Here's an example of this with this modified version of `cursor` & `super-hands`: https://deserted-ladybug.glitch.me/)

**Changes proposed:**

- Register 'touchstart' and `touchend' listeners on the canvas alongside 'mousedown' and 'mouseup'

**Notes:**

f2bff70 is optional, it centralizes the listing of event types to facilitate future maintenance, but that might be unnecessary 

**Concerns:**

* It's not smart about multiple touches - the first 'touchend' will terminate the `cursor` interaction even if more touches remain active. I'd be happy to add handling for this, but didn't want to add complications unnecessarily. 
* It does not implement 'touchmove' alongside 'mousemove'. Since the event APIs for each are structured slightly differently, this would be more than a simple change. Again, happy to add this if you think it's worth the additional complication
* This might cause some unexpected behavior for projects using `cursor` for gaze fusing and capturing touch input manually for other purposes. If preferred, I could extend the schema make this configurable, either as a flag or as a list of event types.

Thanks to @andrewvee on slack for a discussion that prompted
 I think we're safe because these are registered on the canvas, so no entity events will bubble to these listeners. Will double check on Vive Here's the same example with the 0.6.1 A-Frame dist: https://grey-bench.glitch.me 
And it doesn't respond to touch on my surface in FF55 or Chrome nor on my Moto X in FF55

Putting some listeners on canvas to investigate, I see that a quick tap (our double tap on the surface) will generate 'mousedown', 'mouseup', and 'click' all at once, so that should trigger the cursor. 

However, pressing and holding or dragging does not generate any of the mouse events, so my example where the idea is to press and hold while moving the phone around doesn't work.   **Description:**

In Windows (arguably a popular beginner environment), Python 3 installs the `python` binary, same as Python 2. The `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` command mentioned in the docs will not work in Python 3, which can be mildly confusing to people unfamiliar with the change.

**Changes proposed:**

- Add the alternative command for Py3.
  …at mobile tilt can be disabled

**Description:**
This adds to the component look-controls schema: "tiltEnabled: false/true (default)"

**Changes proposed:**
This allows disabling the current default behavior that tilting a mobile device changes the orientation of the camera--while not in VR mode--i.e. "look around with your phone" mode. The current behavior (tilting) remains the default.
-
-
 I considered that but then if you want to disable tilt only for non-VR mobile mode and then the user enters VR-mode, the code would have to react and reset the hmdEnabled flag for the HMD to work properly. I'm assuming this, I didn't actually test to see if that would be the case. Okay then. I'll just proceed with your recommendation of writing a customized/different look-controls component. I will probably want to do more with it anyway. My goal is to help build websites that can transition somewhat seamlessly from manually navigated 3D (the most likely usecase) through "tilted"/"look around" mobile 3D (less likely), and then finally VR (the coolest, but most niche at this time). I understand your desire to keep A-Frame focused on VR, and possibly AR as well.  Testing with https://wmurphyrd.github.io/aframe-super-hands-component/examples/portals.html
so with aframe 0.7.1 and latest oculus browser, it now loads correctly the scene when traversing a portal. It was not the case in september, it did quit the vr mode and there was some sort of infinite loop.
But after traversing two portals, it starts dropping frames, and eventually freeze... Well today it froze after 4 portals. Probably a memory issue? Is the previous scene freed when we enter a portal? depends whether a-frame is caching things that can be freed e.g. image pano textures

this magic incantation used to force that texture cache to be flushed 
`AFRAME.scenes[0].systems.material.clearTextureCache()`
but that may not be what you want
 I don't know if I can analyze the memory of oculus browser with the remote chrome debugger on my machine. I didn't try it yet, I don't have much experience with this memory recording stuff on chrome.
I know how to use the allocations recording on firefox though, so I can already try with firefox on my machine to see if the memory is increasing when traversing portals. @dmarcos you're right, the link component just do a `window.location = href` in the end.

I did some benchmarks with chrome profiling tool. I'm not seeing a real memory issue, only the usual increase and decrease of memory from the GC of camera position/rotation created objects and arrays (see #3183)
By looking at profiles and the code, I did find an optimization to do in the link component #3224 though.

I guess you can close the issue, the vr2vr traversal works great in itself. The freeze or crash of the Oculus browser is an issue of this browser.  I have a basic a-frame scene with oculus-touch-controls (same thing with laser-controls too). Its off the real angle of my controller by almost exactly 45 degrees. I'm not applying rotation to the controller or any of the parent entities, I've stripped my a-frame to just controller entitties and still have this issue.

![oculus-error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/223277/29228993-ee3610a0-7e90-11e7-8125-7eb33f22e765.png)

The blue 'cone' is showing the correct level "straight ahead" vector. Both the oculus controls and the laser ray are tipped 45 degrees relative to reality. This is with A-Frame 0.6.1 IMO, this should be re-opened because: the model of the controller doesn't match the physical position of the controller. In this image I am holding the top surface of the controller level with the "correct" cone. But the model represents the controller as if this surface was tipped down by 45 degrees. But its not.

i.e. BOTH the direction of the laser AND the position of the controller are off by 45 degrees. 

I can understand that the direction of pointing could be potential, but the controller-as-displayed should match the orientation of the real controller, and its off by 45 degrees. In other words: the controller model is way off representing the true orientation of the controller (way off by 45 degrees in one axis) This is still an issue in 0.7.... its pretty disconcerting to have the controller in VR not match your actual hand position by 45 degrees. Here's a workaround for anyone else affected. It also documents the necessary tweaks to fix this upstream (one fix to the laser-controls raycaster, one fix to the controller mesh).

Run `fixOculusTouchPose()` right after loading aframe.js.

```
  function fixOculusTouchPose() {
      // FIX ONE: point raycaster in the right direction
      AFRAME.components['laser-controls'].Component.prototype.config['oculus-touch-controls'].raycaster.direction.y = 0;

      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
        document.querySelector("a-scene")
          .addEventListener("loaded", function fixModelPoses() {
            Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('[oculus-touch-controls]'))
              .filter(el => el.components['oculus-touch-controls'].controllerPresent)
              .forEach(el => {
                el.addEventListener('model-loaded', () => {
                  // FIX TWO: align model with raycaster (and reality)
                  var mesh = el.getObject3D('mesh');
                  mesh.rotateX(Math.PI / 4);
                  mesh.translateY(0.06);
                });
              });
        });
      });
    }
``` I found that I had to do a slightly different workaround
https://glitch.com/edit/#!/gainful-pirate?path=oculus-touch-controls-hack.js:1:0  **Description:**
It is currently impossible to provide a full non-HMD experience on mobile devices. The look-controls component bypasses `hmdEnabled` checks for mobile devices, and prevents touch-based pitch adjustment.

In some contexts, mobile users may want to choose between using their phone as an hmd or using pure touch-based interaction.

**Changes proposed:**
- Add new `mobileHmdAlways` configuration option that toggles the `isMobile` bypass.
- Add new `mobileFixedPitch` configuration option that toggles the `onTouchMove` pitch adjustment.
- Default both of the new options to preserve current behavior for backwards compatibility. Developers can use these options to opt in to the new behavior. Thanks for the quick response! I totally understand and that definitely makes sense for most customizations. I'd argue my pull request isn't a customization, but more a compromise of a bug fix.

I don't really want to change anything about how look-controls behaves, essentially, except I want mobile and desktop experiences to be consistent (in other words I don't want mobile devices to get special treatment). Right now look-controls carves out exceptions to its own behaviors (touchmove vs mousemove controlling pitch, `hmdEnabled=false` is ignored), *just for mobile devices*. Shouldn't that special mobile vs. desktop behavior be optional? Thanks so much for taking the time to debate this issue! I don't know much about the other PRs that have been proposed, but here are my arguments in favor of this PR. I had mentioned (1) before, but the conversation seems to have moved on and I wanted to bring it up again because it's relevant to (2).

1. This could really be considered a bug report instead of a feature request: the switches added in the PR are a backwards-compatible way of making things consistent. Phones are not handled consistently compared with all other devices, which feels like a bug. For example, `hmdEnabled` is ignored, only for phones. Pitch control is locked, only for phones.
2. @dmarcos's concern about opening the floodgates is totally valid, but here's one critical difference: as described in (1) above, this isn't really adding new features or behaviors to `look-controls`; it's restoring current functionality across all devices. I don't think there are many other switches anyone could propose that fall within the same narrow scope; there aren't (to my admittedly limited understanding) a bunch of other places where `look-controls` carves out special exceptions just for some class of devices. That could be an easy test to limit the kinds of PRs that would be considered in the future.
3. As @ngokevin mentioned, web developers love their responsiveness, and there are definitely use cases out there (and cases like mine will probably grow, especially if this PR goes through). Making this small change will greatly expand aframe's applicability for web devs (allowing full-featured mixed-device operation), increasing interest and gaining contributors who are eager to help. I don't know if that's a good thing, but probably it is? Hooray for OSS!

On a related note, +1 for @machenmusik's suggestion about exposing more hooks into `look-controls`. It's currently fairly prohibitive to clone a complex component like `look-controls` and be forever locked into merging upstream for the 99% of unchanged code. :)

And lastly, thank you guys so much for your wonderful work that makes this all possible. It's truly appreciated, no matter how this PR goes. That would solve half of the PR, but what about fixed pitch? Is there a reason for defaulting to fixed pitch? It seems weird that mobile devices are gimped out of the gate, especially with the preponderance of Google Cardboard and related "VR headsets" that people use with phones - I added flags to be backwards-compatible, but it's arguably a bug and this is a bugfix. Would it help if I reclassify?

Copying look controls means buying into constantly merging and updating. There's a reasonable standard that could prevent this being a floodgate issue (see [August 28, 2017 comment](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2964/#issuecomment-325404273), item #2) in this particular (bug-fixy) case. @dmarcos That probably depends on the usage - for example, all of our scenes have spherical image skyboxes with scenery, so you're not likely to forget which way is down (it's where the grass is),
 especially since it doesn't let you go 'round the horn and flip upside down. Anecdotally, we've hacked the fixed pitch out, and hundreds of users have tried it without being confused or disoriented (yet, anyway). Shouldn't the fixed pitch behavior be opt-in (or at least provide an opt-out)?

Thought from another angle, why isn't it considered as disorienting to pan the scene using mouse on a desktop (i.e. why doesn't desktop + mouse have fixed pitch)? The gestures are very similar: up is up, down is down, and you can't go past the zenith in either. As you wish; I'd think a simple opt-out for a workaround would make it more suitable to the majority of cases, but it's not my project.

I'm unclear: will `hmdEnabled:false` at least be respected on mobile devices going forward, as @ngokevin suggested in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2964#issuecomment-333301342? If that requires an update to the PR, I'm happy to do it - half-acceptance is better than zero-acceptance.  Information regarding plane and camera default values

 I agree that this is not specific to 360 image example, but it does provide a little more information which would have been helpful when going through the guide. I found myself on the Slack channel in order to get over these hurdles.   Oh, you're right. The docs say it's "0 1.6 0" in desktop mode and "0 0 0" in VR mode. I'm in desktop mode.
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/primitives/a-camera.md What if the comment says something more generic like "You will need to reposition the camera in order to see the planes because of the default settings. You can reposition the camera with "WASD". I'll look at the first guide again.

 What would you recommend doing? It was frustrating not understanding why the example was not working properly. Not yet.

## Content requests/suggestions summary

### August, 7th
* [A-Frame 101](https://www.whitesmith.co/blog/a-frame-101/) introductory materials by @afvc  @ngokevin @dmarcos I recently made a tutorial that has lots of little pieces of code, but in codepen, not glitch. I can pass them to glitch if you want to.
And it has a lot of references to the documentation within the code comments as well.
I've made code for most of the basic topics, except audio and video, I think https://www.whitesmith.co/blog/a-frame-101/ Awesome @afvc  can u please write the examples blog for "touch controls" in a-frame @ngokevin in regards to contributing glitch examples, does it not matter whose glitch account they reside on, or would you want to remix them onto the aframe account and link that version in the docs? @ngokevin The self-promotion from having A-Frame docs drive traffic to your personal Glitch account would be a nice incentive for contributing examples.

However, I remember one time I used a Glitch to demonstrate an issue I filed, then later accidentally deleted all the text from the HTML file in the Glitch and couldn't figure out how to restore it as it had so helpfully auto-saved the change. 

I wonder if linking to people's Glitches that can be changed or broken at any point in the future might lead to poor experiences for A-Frame docs users I'm going to gather the suggestions/requests of content per week. I'm happy to see the conversation moves forward. Thanks @afvc for stepping forward and suggest more content. @delapuente maybe a tutorial that explains the differences between using AR in mobile and desktop? It's a simple thing, but for example, I was stuck on it for several days until @cwervo gave me a hand. I can make a codepen or glitch with it.
 Also, I've been seeing loads of people that even with the help of the A-Frame docs have not managed to use obj/dae/gltf properly on blender. For several reasons : not understanding how to install gltf exporter on blender or for not having relative paths in textures and much more.
If there was a tutorial that showed two or three different ways to deal with these issues maybe less people would face them?
(I've had this problem myself for a while, with no solution yet) @ngokevin, @dmarcos and I considered this was a good idea. I don't understand why to close this issue. It was not for me only but a tool for the community to participate demanding more content.  **Description:**
a-image fails totally with the very same code as in the documentation. runs smooth with 020, but sucks completely with later versions as well as the master version. no image is visible, but is there in inspector.

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 yeah. I just did that it worked.  I am quite sure that the story is:
- yes, it is impossible to start audio (or video) without a gesture
- this also is true for Chrome because the iOS Chrome is still based on the underlying Webkit (enforced by Apple) so Chrome on iOS is just a glorified Safari with Google Services built in.

I am not aware of any plans that this might change with iOS11.

There are some threads on Stackoverflow with workarounds that were all somehow 'fixed' by Apple. From Apples standpoint this is the desired behaviour because they don't want their users to max out their bandwidth unknowingly.

I can try to come up with some explanation and example code for Audio Sprites on the sound section and a reference to that in the FAQ, if desired. I just did, and everything works without gestures on Android:
http://curious-electric.com/w/experiments/aframe/audio/

(slightly unrelated - .wav file support seems broken in A-Frame 0.6.1 (or rather in ThreeJS 0.84):
http://curious-electric.com/w/experiments/aframe/audio/index61.html
I thought this was related to #2754 but it also fails on direct load (line 21))

[EDIT: links changed] @wav I will try to find out if this is a ThreeJS problem or not and then add an issue either over there or here.

How would I proceed regarding the audiosprite example?
This won't be a trivial one-liner that I can add to the docs, I'm afraid. Where would it make sense to add an example? Right now my sample code is on my personal webspace:
http://curious-electric.com/aframe/audiosprite/

I could create a glitch or codepen from that? An amusing workaround is to use speechSynthesis. I found that gaze-triggered interactions in A-Frame can trigger new speech events on iOS, if the user has at least once tapped the screen on an element that triggers speech. (e.g. a silent utterance on a START button)

For example, if you had a balloon-popping game, this would work: 
`            speechUtterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();  
            speechUtterance.lang = 'en';  
            speechUtterance.rate = .8; 
            speechUtterance.pitch = 1.6;  
            speechUtterance.name = "Fiona";  
            speechUtterance.text = "Pop!";  
            speechSynthesis.speak(speechUtterance);`

It doesn't seem like much, but audio is so important to VR that even little sounds to confirm actions can go a long way. It's probably best to do real SFX for Android and desktop, then have this alternative up your sleeve for iOS.  What is the current state of this issue?  I have tried implementing a resume() on the audioContext upon user click of a DOM element.  I am seeing that it's state changes to "running", but I'm getting a black screen instead of entering VR.  It would be great if there was a clear instruction on best methods for implementing sound that is compatible with iOS.  I'm using https://github.com/digaverse/aframe-resonance-audio-component to instantiate audio, and perhaps the init functions triggering before unlocking the audio context is causing some issues.  It looks like howler.js [mostly works on iOS](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/issues/984). IIRC it works by pre-cooking a big soundSprite, so that may not work with the resonance component. 

   Radius is an invalid parameter. Instead, try scale. Also, demonstrate positioning of sphere within space.

  …edded scenes

**Description:**
For this issue:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2938
Not sure about the performance impacts, and whether this code should only execute for if scenes have the 'embedded' attribute

**Changes proposed:**
- Using sceneEl.canvas.getBoundingClientRect() to properly calculate the mouse position relative to the canvas Is this what you meant by using the throttledTick and window resize event together? I think this is what you mean, copying the style of 'throttledEmitComponentChanged' in component.js.
I made an example which I have also uploaded [here](http://games.clarklavery.com/aframe-sample/index.html) to test it out by mousing over the central cube. The problem with using the `throttle` wrapper is that if the user does a lot of small quick drags, it won't update to the final result. Doing a single resize works fine though.

The Library drag component library that was being used has the same issue.

Hello all,

I've started learning A-Frame and discovered that in embedded mode clicking on a primitive may not always perform correct in cases, when a-frame container is not fully visible or container is smaller  than browser height. Please take a look on my snippet. With that margin, you can click on the empty space above primitives, but not at the bottom of them. It looks weird.

This is video I've recorded to demonstrate an issue: https://monosnap.com/file/bLZhB5MOz4ChoNy0KwY9M3r4pQzTJI
 I've noticed this on the mouse component before, and I believe it has to do with these lines (153-154 components/cursor.js)
```
mouse.x = (evt.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
mouse.y = -(evt.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
```

I fixed it in the component I used by using the bounding client of the canvas to calculate the values
```
const bounds = this.el.sceneEl.canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
const width = bounds.width;
const height = bounds.height;
const left = evt.clientX - bounds.left;
const top = evt.clientY - bounds.top;

mouse.x = (left / width) * 2 - 1;
mouse.y = - (top / height) * 2 + 1;
``` Made the pull request here:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2942 @Alxblsk I think the issue you are having is part of the component you are using rather than a-frame, but for the same reason.
https://github.com/jesstelford/aframe-click-drag-component/blob/master/src/index.js#L132 @calrk This is an example I've found in Internet, to be faster. In my own example, I do not use `aframe-click-drag-component` but still see the same issue. I'll attach another one demo soon.  **Description:**
Currently, creating a link from an entity and using `visualAspectEnabled: false` (to control the styling yourself) throws two errors.

The first one is from the `tick` lifecycle method trying to adjust elements that have never been setup.

The second is a check in `update` considering an `undefined` => `false` being a "new" peekMode and thus calling the `updatePeekMode` function which again, tries to adjust elements that have never been setup.

reproduce:

```
<a-entity link="href: location.html; visualAspectEnabled: false" geometry="primitive: box"></a-entity>
```

**Changes proposed:**
Harden the checks in both functions so you can safely create links with `visualAspectEnabled: false`. @dmarcos updated 👍   when create a link with js. l can't delete the red color in circle.

thank you with much.
```js
    var entityEl = document.createElement('a-entity');
    entityEl.setAttribute('id',`link-${index}`);
    entityEl.setAttribute('link', {
      href: `chart.html?machineId=${item.name}`,
      title: item.name,
      color: getColor(item.status),
      image: 'src/img/sunrise.png',
    });
    entityEl.setAttribute('position', getLoaction(index));
    entityEl.setAttribute('text', {
      value: Math.round(item.data.temp).toString(),
      height: 5,
      width: 8,
      color: 'white',
      align: 'center'
    });
```

 The AFrame Magenta webgl shader color `vec4(0.93, 0.17, 0.36, 1.0) ` is hard coded in the link component https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/v0.6.0/src/components/link.js#L343
  given component:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('my-component', {
    schema: { type: 'selector' },
    update: function () {
      console.log('selected element', this.data);
    }
});
```

markup:

```html
<a-box></a-box>
<a-entity my-component="a-box"></a-entity>
```
console logs expected result:

when doing the same when creating element using js:
```js
var scene = document.querySelector('a-scene');
var createEl = document.createElement('a-entity');
createEl.setAttribute('my-component', 'a-box');;
scene.appendChild(createEl);
```

I get this:

 I should point out that if I listen to the loaded event _then_ setAttribute to for component, it works fine. It's happening inside components too @ngokevin 

As an example, this breaks:

 I don't quite understand? What would I use if I need to fire something
every 1/10 second and still need the regular tick function?
As far as I understood (and I tested it) with throttleTick the regular tick
gets replaced, at least in the given example.

  **Description:**
On iOS devices, the application seems to randomly reload. This has been pinpointed to a reload after 30 seconds of inactivity while in VR mode, caused by the iOS wakelock feature. As seen in other wakelock-implementations and issues, the `window.location = window.location` creates this issue.

**Changes proposed:**
Update the wakelock implementation to match other implementation which don't cause this reload-bug.

One thing to mention is the wakelock does not work on iOS (11), however I think it's better to have an application which will sleep after X seconds, instead of an application which will reload every X seconds. No, but the touched lines belong to the `iOSWakeLock()` – it shouldn't have any impact on Android. Or I'm missing something, in that case: enlighten me :-)  i used mesh traversing to make materials transparent and it was done, but not on both sides.

 Different from #666 ? @donmccurdy 
Hello, can you give me some advice how I can use this parameter (alphaTest: 0.5) in case of using glTF 2.0? @donmccurdy 
Many thanks for your help, now it works!   **Description:**

Due to the `isMobile` check occuring before the `vr-mode` check, when Daydream is in VR mode, as it's also a mobile device, sensor fusion controls take precedence. Is there scenario I'm not considering in this branching logic?

**Changes proposed:**

If in VR mode with HMD data, use that -- fall back to sensor fusion on mobile after.
 This was originally for Aframe+ WebARonAR[Core|kit] support, and some falsy assumptions on my end I think. Closing for now!  **Description:** `onVRPresentChange` throws error that `evt.display` is undefined. The `display` property exists under `CustomEvent#detail` property and not directly on `CustomEvent`.

**Changes proposed:**
- look for the `isPresenting` at `evt.detail.display.isPresenting`
 ah, right. I forgot [I ran into this on webvr-ui](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-ui/blob/master/src/webvr-manager.js#L213-L219) as well.

When using the WebVR API it is directly on `event.display` when using a polyfill it is placed inside the `CustomEvent`'s `detail` property.

Pull request updated to look for either. this fixes issue #2849   - A-Frame Version: 0.6.0
- Platform / Device: Desktop
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: https://codepen.io/prabhatsinh/pen/LjZPzv

Please check above code pen link, I have added two elements a-box and a-text. Click event is not working in <a-text> element. 

It is working fine in <a-box> element.
 Hi thanks for  quick replay,

but it's working fine in 0.5.0 version, why it's not working in 0.6.0
https://codepen.io/prabhatsinh/pen/OjXBqb

Please check above link It's working in 0.6.0, we need to a plane to make it work in text.

geometry="primitive: plane; width: 1; height: 0.4"
  Pretty much what the title says.

The documentation seems to suggest that the `laser-controls` would work with gaze-based functionality, but as far as I could tell, nothing is implemented yet to support this. Would it be an idea to add an a-cursor to the camera, until a controller is detected? Perhaps as an optional feature? 

I did some tinkering yesterday on how I could see this work as a PoC: https://github.com/realitylab-ruben/aframe/commit/44424ef023205d11e38c4946a19b80bbd1097c01#diff-3f66fed14508fae90dc58b66fac99025  **Description:**
Relying on the random selection to change the color runs the risk of users being unsure if their interactions are sparking a response. For a simple test case (especially when in VR and no console log is available) a guaranteed change is much better. I made this change myself to ensure that the interactions were actually reliable and not glitchy and unresponsive as it seemed with the random selection re-picking the existing color. This should improve first run perceptions of the interaction API.

**Changes proposed:**
- Switch random selection to simple progression through array
  It doesn't feel necessary to manage 2 sets of component code  **Description:**
I've only started working with the Gear controller and AFrame a few days ago, and the first thing I noticed was that the GearVR Controller wasn't exactly working as I expected. Instead of turning around the camera like most applications do, the controller was just rotating in place. 

While this makes sense, I felt that it was a bit confusing and had to work around the component to get the controller to show up in its right place. I think that the GearVR controller should be in a default position just in front of the camera and rotate around the viewer instead of just staying in one spot.

I haven't tested it yet, but I'm assuming that the Daydream has the exact same issue.

**Changes proposed:**
- Add a ```positionOffset``` vector3 value to schema of the ```daydream-controls``` and ```gearvr-controls``` components.
- A child entity will be generated with its position set to the value in the schema
- This child entity will contain the controller model. Because the ```tracked-controls``` will be its parent, the controller will automatically spin around the camera.
- If no position offset is given, the default will be set to ```0.1 -0.1 -0.275```. X will be set to ```-0.1``` if the ```hand``` attribute is set to ```left```.


The PR currently already had the changes mentioned above implemented for the ```gearvr-controls```. Before putting more effort into creating a proper example and changing the ```daydream-controls``` component as well, I first would like to get some feedback before moving on. It would indeed, but I would argue that this would make the model part of the component fairly useless. I can't think of any particular example where the user would want the controller to float in a static point in space where it will only rotate at a single point.

It's also a mechanic that I've, so far, experienced in all Gear-related applications. The only example I could find on short notice is in the [official Samsung Gear VR tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gghYoUlhyVU#t=1m42). In general, the controller is rendered away from the user and rotating around him to give a sense of where he is holding it.

The SDK for both [Daydream](https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/reference/class/gvr-arm-model) and [Gear](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-ovrinput/#unity-ovrinput-d7803e81) offer a similar functionality out of the box with their respective Unity SDKs.

What I would, however, admit is that this solution now only works to facilitate the model position and nothing more. If you'd have to add a raycaster, you would need to put the raycaster in another  child entity to the entity holding the gearvr-controls. [I did something similar in my example.](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2912/files#diff-321ec347dea00ae9da476ecb4f4ca732R17)

My personal problem is that both ```daydream-controls``` and ```gear-controls``` don't use the same practices out of the box that the official Unity/Unreal SDKs do, and that's what I'm trying to solve here. Maybe I have jumped the gun a bit by trying to fix this in the AFrame repository and I should first see about turning this into a standalone component. Hmm, that's weird, because I'm not seeing it in the Samsung Gear. I've only just now noticed that there is code for an arm model, but it's not working in my own projects, at least not on the Samsung Gear.

This was my mistake then, my apologies. I'll close this pull request and open up an issue. Thanks for your feedback.  Question:  Are the second UV maps used for Lightmaps and AO maps limited to duplicating the first UV set on the object?  or can we set up a second UV set in a 3d application and use that instead?  This could enable things like lightmappers for Aframe etc to work.  Currently it seems that the gltf importer duplicates the first UV set automatically, which precludes using different UV maps that optimize texture sizing and layout on 3d objects.  The use case for allowing custom uv sets would be that you could take a repeating brick texture and tile it while having a Lightmap for the entire scene instead of individual lightmaps for each object.
   updated  three.js r87 will bring a optimized handling of `scene.background` and should work nicely in VR.

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/renderers/webgl/WebGLBackground.js#L26-L108

I think a-frame should add support for this. Right now I see people creating spheres and adding them to the scene which is not the most optimal way of doing it.

Maybe `<a-background>` as a component could also work. That way one could add more logic to it like converting equirectangular to cubemaps (using `CubeCamera`) automatically. What an awesome addition!

I'm thinking `<a-scene background='whatever'>` would be more in line with the existing API - @mrdoob , can you please elaborate about the reasoning for `<a-background>` and the connection to the automatic cubemap conversion? Is there already a way to do that in three or is that a proposed feature?   **Description:**
This package will let you publish the latest aframe in the Ubuntu store, and from there reach many users on all the supported Ubuntu versions, and more Linux distributions in progress.

**Changes proposed:**
- Add the snapcraft.yaml file
 Hello!

Here at ubuntu we are working in a new packaging and delivery system. If you haven't heard about snaps before, here's a lot of info: https://snapcraft.io/

Obviously, aframe is a building block for other applications, delivering a packaged version of aframe itself is not so useful. But I think having this package in the Ubuntu store will be very nice. First, it will be a showcase for all the Ubuntu users, who then can jump into developing their own scenes. And second, the store has an edge channel that's very useful for crowdtesting. You can automate the delivery of every change made to the master branch, put it in edge, and ask your early adopters and the community of ubuntu testers to give it a try. All of this can be done with a few clicks in https://build.snapcraft.io.

To test this in an Ubuntu 16.04 machine:

    $ sudo apt install git snapcraft
    $ git clone https://github.com/elopio/aframe
    $ cd aframe
    $ git checkout snapcraft
    $ snapcraft
    $ sudo snap install *.snap --dangerous
    $ sensible-browser localhost:9000

(--dangerous because the snap you build doesn't come signed from the store. Once you publish it, your users will just have to do sudo snap install aframe).

If you have any questions, please let me know.

pura vida. @ngokevin well, it depends on how you define niche store. There are millions of ubuntu users. They will all be able to see the aframe showcase snap in the software center, and install it with one click.

We are working on making this extremely low-maintenance. After getting the snapcraft.yaml, you just have to go to https://build.snapcraft.io once, and then it will take care of building and publishing new versions for you. So, I think that giving it a try will require just a little effort, and then you can see the stats and the feedback you receive from the users to decide if you want to make a stable release in the store and keep maintaining it.

Of course, I understand if you decide not to have a snap at this moment. If you change your mind, just ping me and I'll be back to give you a hand.

The tutorial sounds like a very good idea. I will be learning more about aframe next month (that's why I found it, and I made this PR to experiment a little with it). So, I will write the tutorial, about how to deliver a app made with aframe, after I finish my first scene. electron-builder already supports snaps, so it might be fun to combine both :)

Thanks for the review!
pura vida.  **Description:** link component releasted, using past tense

**Changes proposed:**
- link component for link traversal was (instead of will be) released with A-Frame 0.6.1
  **Description:** added Google Blocks in Where can I find assets?

**Changes proposed:**
- added links to Google Blocks on top since it's the largest easiest to use library already (using more complex assets with textures for example from TurboSquid usually brings newcomers to a world of pain)  I'm currently trying to animate a camera's rotation in a scene. The animation should occur after looking at a circle for 1 second.

First I tried to directly animate the camera, apart the fact that it doesn't seem to work on chrome mobile (v57), it seemed to "block" the ability to look on the floor. [Short screen capture of the problem](https://gfycat.com/SmoggyQuarrelsomeDavidstiger).

I then tried to animate a container containing the camera as suggested by kevin [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2714#issuecomment-305892656). That second option produced an other problem, it seems that all the sky is displaced and I don't understand how to "correct" that. But on the other side, the second option (container) worked in mobile browser, in a cardboard.

My questions are :
- Are theses behaviors expected ?
- If so, any ideas or links to help me understand how to do what I am trying to do ?

My setup :
- A-Frame 0.6.1 & aframe-animation-component
- Windows 10, Chrome 59, Firefox 54
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:

Animation on a container containing the camera :

I also posted the question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45194712/a-frame-0-6-1-camera-rotation-animation) but I was starting to think that the behaviour wasn't expected and that it may be a bug somewhere, that is why I am here.

Thanks
apiaget  So we use A-Frame 0.50?
 @dmarcos you mean just by adding THREE.ShaderChunk.fog_pars_vertex to the vertex array of SPE we should be able to fix the problem?   **Description:**

The standard Three.js material has settings to make a material be emissive, meaning it can project light even when the rest of the scene is dark. Currently the emissive property is not exposed inside AFrame. This patch adds the property to the standard Aframe material.

 Is this something that would have been caught by unit tests? Does the CI system run the actual webGL code? I did a fresh checkout this morning and everything is fine. It must have been a transitory issue with TweenJS.

This functionality comes up regularly at events where we're introducing people to A-Frame. Registering and adding a custom component for it seems needlessly complicated.

Adding this to the default A-Frame set of features seems a pretty big win for users, in exchange for a tiny bit of code (per that example in the URL above). No fair going back in time and fixing things before I file them!!

- A-Frame Version:
- Platform / Device: All
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/components/obj-model.html#troubleshooting refers to a page if more information is needed, and the page link has 0.6.1 in the URL and as a result gives a 404 error on clicking on it.
  **Description:**

Allow mixin assets to have animated components. Think rather than just a _red_ mixin for a material with a red color, allow _pulsating_red_ for a material with an animated color.

```html
<a-assets>
    <a-mixin id="red" material="color: red"></a-mixin>
    <a-mixin id="pulsating_red" material="color: red; opacity: 0.5">
        <a-animation attribute="material.opacity" from="0.5" to="1.0" repeat="100"><a-animation>
    </a-mixin>
</a-assets>
A few flashing signs
```

I think mutations to mixin attributes are already propagated to entities which use the mixin. It would be a natural and perhaps even expected feature to also allow mutations by mixin animation.

- A-Frame Version: future
- Platform / Device: all
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: NA
 Jotting down implementation thoughts: 
- add .isPlaying to a-mixin.js
- make .setAttribute for a-mixin.js similar to entities (probably expected anyways)
- force DOM update to trigger MutationObserver
- or have additional onUpdate Tween callback for mixins which updates mixin users (the same as the MutationObserver callback)
 across A-Frame ? Anyways, right, the animation component should work as a mixin.  Well, the animation component also does not support mixins, currently: https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/issues/90
Keeping this closed since animation as component would be preferable.  **Description:**

Using ` <a-animation> ` for material.opacity resets the ` from ` value to 0 for repeated animation cycles if ` from ` is not explicitly provided.

The first animation cycle works correctly. Subsequent animation cycles use a ` from ` value of 0 instead of the attribute value. Repeated cycles use self.initialValue for ` from `. initialValue appears to be set to an empty object which may not be the intention.

- A-Frame Version: 0.6
- Platform / Device: all
- Reproducible URL: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/plum-mayonnaise?path=public/index.html:11:11

The box opacity is animated from completely transparent to opaque but should be animated from only slightly transparent to opaque. The easy workaround is just to provide the from value as a-animation property.

Other component properties are also be affected. I amended the glitch above to animate the height of the cylinder. It is also reset to 0 during repeats. I think all scalar (Number) properties are affected. Here is the example using a first solution:
https://just-fly.glitch.me/

The used solution is:
```js
getTween: { ...
// Store initial state.
self.initialValue = self.initialValue || cloneValue(from); //currentValue);
...
function getForComponentAttribute () { ...
    if (dataFrom === undefined) {  // dataFrom can be 0.
      from[attribute] = getComponentProperty(el, attribute);
    } else {
      //from[attribute] = dataFrom;
      from[attribute] = typeof (dataFrom) == 'object' ? dataFrom[attribute] : dataFrom ;
    }
```
probably not ideal and not thoroughly tested but a start.
[Why not rely on Tween for the repeats ?]
 I thought a little bit more about a more elegant, concise solution but could not immediately find one. The fixed glitch tests most kinds of animations with the proposed fix and they continue to work.

If desirable, I could prepare an initial PR for further review, first to see if travis testing picks up something ?   I've been playing with the Google Blocks tool and I'm totally amazed by it. I think that aframe will benefit a lot from an easy way to import objects from Blocks. Some points that would need to be discussed are:

- Are there any changes that need to be done for aframe to import Blocks? From the looks of it, it seems to export a pretty standard `obj`, but not sure about material/colors.
- Should we write a tutorial on how to import Blocks creations to aframe?
- It would be great to have a component that takes the URL of a folder with the decompressed contents of the zip exported by blocks and places that in the scene.  **Description:**

  **Description:**

I have proposed some small fixes for typos and idiom. I hope this helps!

**Changes proposed:**
The changes should be clear in the file. You'll see that I rearranged one sentence to be: "A-Frame aims to define fully immersive interactive VR experiences that go beyond basic 360&deg; content, making full use of positional tracking and controllers." I know that's a fairly large change, but the previous version of the sentence had a subject-verb agreement problem, basically saying "interactive experiences that GOES beyond..." My fix is the best solution I could find to fix the issue.

Line 111: It looks to me that the ".js" I deleted is just stray text at the end of the sentence. I hope I'm reading that right.

Line 132: "built on the notion of HTML" Is that really what we want to say here? Is there a better way to express this idea?
 My pleasure!

address raycasting
**Changes proposed:**
- add a limitations sections with a short explanation.

 A simplistic example on the page may suffice ?

```html
<a-text value="Hello, World!"></a-text>

<!-- for cursor detection add geometry -->

<a-text value="click me!" geometry="primitive:plane"></a-text>

``` The wording is friendlier now although I think it is preferable to say explicitly that text itself does not work with cursor or raycaster to avoid any confusion.  **Description:**

 Sometimes a hard reload fixes the problem. Some kind of race condition maybe.  Is there an event that emits when the image is actually displayed and not only only loaded.
As I just discovered, event "load" or "loaded" triggers before the image is displayed, specially if the image has a large size.

Thanks for the great work

At https://clara.io/ not load textures Hi, thank you very much.  Hi
I hace the same issue with export from sweethome3d when I use obj and mtl, hre the line  : 
c.lights&&(g=h,q.ambientLightColor.needsUpdate= if three.js (it give me the error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'needsUpdate' of undefined).

I can not find how to fix that....
 this commit in three.js fixes the bug: 
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/commit/b319b89f3551ec405b4efa3ee5845f29ff5b76df#diff-c95aa6af1ef517957bfbff6af39992f5

happens with eg. this obj from Google Poly: https://poly.google.com/view/eGI3RS52kJA because there is a path problem with the mtl file. the texture fails to load and the three.js Material gets corrupted, resulting in this error.  For some reason I'm not able to get master to render correctly atm. The fix in three.js will ship in r90 from what I can tell.  FWIW the best workaround to this for me is 0.7.1 with three.js r88 with the `material.lights = false;` patch applied manually.  I can change the rayOrigin from `entity` to `mouse` dynamically, but when i try to change from `mouse` to `entity` nothing append :/ done ;) #2929 @dmarcos do you have time to check the example ? #2929
Need to know if it's a bug or my code :/

Thank you !  **Description:**

The example uses 'camera-ready' to trigger the re-parenting, but this does not appear to be a synchrony issue, as the same behavior can be seen by making the change via the console on a running scene. I found this because `super-hands` `a-locomtor` checks for scenes with the default camera and moves the camera to be a child of itself to enable movement. The feature ended up kinda hacky and re-parenting the camera already caused some strange behavior like losing the `userHeight` value and generating console warnings, so I'd already been thinking of dropping it; just reporting this FYI I think I'm going to move my check earlier in the setup and insert a `a-camera` in the DOM before aframe core checks if a default is needed if no other manually specified camera is found.

`AScene.reload` doesn't currently reset attributes and components on the scene element, which is different behavior from every other element in the scene.

**Changes proposed:**
While we can't destroy and re-create the entire scene element like we do for every other element, we can:
-  remove the current components
- delete the current attributes
- re-add the original attributes

This patch fixes #2239.
 Our use case for `reload` is for demoing; we can use it to quickly reset the demo to the initial state without having to leave VR and hit the reload button or implement a more complicated solution. We don't have much state in our application, so it isn't hard to store all of it in A-Frame components. `vrdisplayactivate` would be sufficent for our use case. Unfortunately, our target devices are mobile phones running Chrome for Android with Cardboard viewers and it would be quite the challenge to convince our customers to install a Firefox nightly on every device they want to demo with.

One case for `reload` that `vrdisplayactivate` wouldn't handle is having multiple embedded scenes on one page where you want to be able to reset them, perhaps in a programming tutorial. @dmarcos We also dynamically add and remove elements, which makes the way `reload` works a little more attractive. @ngokevin I do like the idea of moving `reload` to a separate component. If `removeComponent` gets changed to always remove the component and gets documented it should be possible to implement entirely with public API. @ngokevin Come to think of it, I'm not sure there are any hooks a separate component could use to grab the original HTML before it gets modified, so that might need to be added, too. I see three paths forward for `reload`. Here are my thoughts about them:

# Remove `reload` and leave no upgrade path
There's no sense in leaving `reload` in the codebase if it's not going to be fixed. It currently isn't useful at all.

#2239 has four participants, so there is some interest in this functionality. While it's certainly possible to work around the lack of `reload()`, it takes more effort than a single method call.

Reload functionality really needs to be universal in order to work well.  Without core support or a clear de-facto standard to follow, it's likely that some components won't support any given approach.

# Remove `reload` and provide an out-of-core component to handle it
@ngokevin is right that it probably wouldn't take too much effort to move the current implementation into a component. That will require some support from core.  I see three possible ways to make that happen.
 
## Core can expose enough raw functionality to make reloading possible
@dmarcos gives good arguments against this approach. "Here there be dragons" methods don't seem to be the A-Frame way.


## Core can expose something like a `resetComponents` method
This would be safer, but at the price of keeping a fair amount of the logic in core.

## Core can provide a private interface to the component
It's hard to imagine a way to do this which wouldn't be brittle and ugly. 

# Fix `reload`
Moving `reload` out of core doesn't really decrease complexity, just shuffles it around. Keeping it in the core means that changes can be made without having to worry about how they affect the core/component boundary. More aggressive optimizations to `reload`, like keeping `<a-assets>` or the injected `<canvas>` around would be impossible to do cleanly as a component. Yeah, I do think you're misunderstanding our use case a bit. Our customer wants everything to be reset exactly the way it is on initial load, which is why nuking the DOM and restoring it to its initial state like `reload` does is so attractive. Otherwise we'd have to keep track of every individual attribute that could ever change, including entity `position` and `rotation`, and remember to add new attributes to that list if we ever start changing them.

It's entirely possible that trying to change just the things that need to be changed might be faster. Without benchmarks I wouldn't be able to say. There is an overhead to determining what things need to be added/changed/removed and individually making those changes, and `reload` runs pretty quickly. At any rate,`reload` already works much faster than a user can strap a Cardboard viewer to their face, so our customer is satisfied with the performance. That would work for us, but sadly, no buttons on the viewers. That does give me an idea, though. Tomorrow I'll look into seeing if we can get it working with a web app manifest with `display: fullscreen`. A web app manifest doesn't help. `display: fullscreen` actually breaks the polyfill. FYI: after a refactoring of our code, having `reload` isn't as vital to us.  **Description:**

- Platform / Device: Samsung Galaxy S7

Double vision on hello world example, when using a Samsung Galaxy S7, with google cardboard or class vr.
 @dmarcos same problem with the polyfill. Also [this](marchhill.github.io/VR-Maths-Shapes/) is my project that uses the latest A-Frame development version by including it with `https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/538439e/dist/aframe-master.min.js`. It still has double vision. @ngokevin The vision is blurry, and the two images for both eyes do not merge into one. There is one cursor for each eye, so you can see two cursors. I tried this with an iPhone 6S+ and it was not an issue, only on the S7.
![screenshot](http://i.cubeupload.com/bhbmU9.png) I was having the same problem with my S7. Noticed it did not happening with one or two of the examples on aframe.io. Hello Metaverse works. It is using version 0.5.0. Downgraded my project from 0.6.1 to 0.5.0 and it viewed without any issues on the S7, 0.6.0 does not view correctly either. I am having this same issue with Chrome on Galaxy S7 and aframe 0.6 and 0.6.1 . Latest stable Firefox is not having the issue, so assume it to be chrome related? @dmarcos yes, the webvr-polyfill example also displays incorrectly. I have attached screenshots of chrome (displaying incorrectly) and firefox (displaying correctly) on Galaxy s7. 

![screenshot_20170808-065651](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2109125/29046101-54ddc09e-7c09-11e7-88c9-cae257a1e920.jpg)

 Apparently Samsung changed the default resolution of the S7 in an update. [ https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/421 ] To fix the issue settings > display > screen resolution > WQHD (2560 x 1440) . No more double vision.   **Description:**
Currently the `pivot` component doesn't respond to entityEl.setAttribute because it has no `update` handler.

**Changes proposed:**

- Replacing `init` with `update` to respond to changes
- Taking `oldData` into calculation to yield a desired `pivot` value

Plus, why is `pivot` not in the documentation? Am I missing anything or is it not ready for us to use? Thanks.

  Change the "material" to "geometry".  I have been working on a VR tour of Lancaster castle and have been having some issues with camera rotation since updating from webvr-polyfill v0.9.25 to v0.9.35.

Previously, we were able to rotate the camera within the scene to point in the correct direction after transitioning from one scene to another in order to make the transition feel more natural however this has stopped working on mobile since updating the polyfill and the camera rotation we set seems to be overwritten by the physical rotation of the device, making the transition feel quite jarring.

Here is a link to the project: http://m.lancs.ac.uk/VR/  After updating to 0.6.0 the cursor in VR mode has a visible (and green) line, even with implicit (default) or explicitly setting the raycaster component to `showLine: false`. This actually broke the [mouse-cursor](https://github.com/mayognaise/aframe-mouse-cursor-component) component we rely on: it no longer emitted `click` events when using the mouse or tapping the screen on an entity. It was solved by explicitly adding `line="visible: false"` to the `a-cursor`.

**Broken code (green line is visible in VR mode; mouse-cursor does not work correctly):**
```
<a-entity camera="userHeight: 1.6" look-controls mouse-cursor wasd-controls="enabled: false">
<a-cursor raycaster="showLine: false" geometry="primitive: ring; radiusInner: 0.02; radiusOuter: 0.03" />

Repro:
Set src on image primitive or
Set src in material="src: url"

Tried both with assets and as inline, but both get the same error in the console:

 Strange I thought inline 'src' was also not working, but appears to work once the correct asset tag is used. Thanks for the tip!  **Description:**
When entering VR via enterVR(), the function is executed twice (once by the initial action triggering the function and then again after the Event "vrdisplaypresentchange" has been fired and then onVRPresentChange calls enterVR again.

This is resulting in substracting the userHeight-Offset twice from the camera-position.

 Hi @machenmusik, I have my controller set as right handed, to it should be exposed as right handed but I can only make it work setting `hand: lelft` or avoiding set `hand`, and by default is on the left. Confirmed

Subject: Re: [aframevr/aframe] GearVR controller right hand (#2844)


The GearVR Controller has a handedness that is set when you pair it using the Oculus app. (I believe the default is right hand.) If you configured your controller to be left handed, then the GearVR Controller is exposed with left handedness, and so I would expect the behavior you are seeing. Can you confirm whether that is the case?

 @machenmusik I just have bought the S8 and the Gear VR, so I'm not already familiar with the oculus system, but I think I have tried on both (both are called Samsung internet but one is through the oculus launcher, isn't it?) and I don't understand the difference between them.
Tomorrow I'll try it again and I will confirm that the issue is happening on both browsers.
 Ok, I will do more test tomorrow 'cause I don't have the device at home. I can confirm there is an issue with Samsung Internet (not Oculus browser) with Samsung S8 / Gear VR / Aframe 0.7.0. I put in bold what I think is wrong.
**It seems that Samsung Internet read the hand configured in preferences in reverse.**

With Samsung Internet with right hand configured in preferences:
- with `<a-entity gearvr-controls="hand: right">` the controller **doesn't show up**
- with `<a-entity gearvr-controls="hand: left">` the controller shows up on the left
- with `<a-entity gearvr-controls>` the controller shows up on the **left**

With Samsung Internet with left hand configured in preferences:
- with `<a-entity gearvr-controls="hand: right">`  the controller shows up on the right
- with `<a-entity gearvr-controls="hand: left">`  the controller **doesn't show up**
- with `<a-entity gearvr-controls>` the controller shows up on the **right**

With Oculus browser with right hand configured in preferences:
- with `<a-entity gearvr-controls="hand: right">` the controller shows up on the right
- with `<a-entity gearvr-controls="hand: left">` the controller doesn't show up
- with `<a-entity gearvr-controls>` the controller shows up on the right

With Oculus browser with left hand configured in preferences:
- with `<a-entity gearvr-controls="hand: right">` the controller doesn't show up
- with `<a-entity gearvr-controls="hand: left">` the controller shows up on the left
- with `<a-entity gearvr-controls>` the controller shows up on the left Is this an issue with A-Frame or Samsung Internet?
I don't really understand how the hand system config influence A-Frame here.
A-Frame appears to use `DEFAULT_HANDEDNESS: 'right'` always.
Do you guys have some pointers so we can maybe create a bug report to Samsung Internet? if you can use the chrome remote web inspector while running Samsung Internet,
it would be great to understand what navigator.getGamepads() is returning;
Oculus Browser correctly populates the gamepad with a hand property matching left or right.
I wonder if what is happening is that Samsung Internet is not actually returning a hand string, or the wrong one... Thanks @machenmusik I'll try that this weekend. I put a `console.log(gamepads);` in `updateControllerList:` in `tracked-controls.js`
In Oculus browser with right hand in preferences:
![oculus_browser_right_hand](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112249/32133676-73d49f90-bbdd-11e7-9a06-c2581be5b7d6.png)

In Oculus browser with left hand in preferences:
![oculus_browser_left_hand](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112249/32133678-7f046508-bbdd-11e7-9896-18deeb4dc24c.png)

In Samsung Internet with right hand in preferences:
![samsung_internet_right_hand](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112249/32133638-c0edb9de-bbdc-11e7-9287-c15231d15439.png)
It shows `hand: "left"`!

In Samsung Internet with left hand in preferences:
![samsung_internet_left_hand](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112249/32133644-d5b098e6-bbdc-11e7-8283-128ad7369892.png)
It shows `hand: "right"`!

So it is definitely an issue in Samsung Internet.
 Now where is the issue tracker for Samsung Internet for VR... I'm searching it... Anybody knows? Found it, I created an issue there https://github.com/SamsungInternet/support/issues/22 @mkeblx ^^ ? I'll have a look soon. Thanks For Samsung Internet handedness bug is resolved. Our next release will have fix in. Brilliant thank you! Thanks @mkeblx !  The [environment component](http://github.com/feiss/aframe-environment-component) is useful in many cases when there is no 3d modelling knowledge and/or when something quick for testing and experimenting is needed.

So, why not more components, systems and tools for getting procedural content easy and fast? For example, they could be useful for:

* Creating and applying textures and materials (using https://github.com/mrdoob/texgen.js/ ?)
* Generating appealing color schemes
* Applying complex animations
* Creating 3d models out of basic primitives and operations
* Creating buildings and cities
* Creating simple avatars
* Creating advanced particle systems
* Creating furniture
* Creating spaceships

and much more!
 Many awesome components already do this ? rain, ocean, polygons, stars .. What is the new idea ?
 Yeah, creating procedural content is not a new idea at all. I just thought that many aframe demos and experiences could benefit from it, and this thread could be a little bookmark of what kind of 'procedural' components could be done and open the subject to discussion and brainstorming. 

Of course mods can close this issue if nobody thinks it is worthy :) Ok, understood. To get started, what would distinguish 'procedural' from other components ? The number of properties ? So the topic could be about complex components with a large (>5?) number of properties?
 Ok, let's assume this is about larger, geometry generating components ? Or just generally about components ? Still a bit unsure.

Thinking a bit bigger here are some ideas.

I would like to see a generalized transformation component which would allow reprojection of coordinates (of any geometry) through custom or a set of predefined functions (not just trafo matrices), on the GPU. The particular use case would be GIS, for AR type applications, using proj4, once double fp on the GPU becomes commonplace.

A complex procedural component could be one which takes the scanned image of a floor plan, or plan of building foot prints of city blocks, and reconstructs 3d walls and doors and windows via image machine learning.

Any kind of geometry reconstruction from images as a component.

A planet generator based on our solar system plus categories of extra solar planets.

Practical domains for parameterized solid objects:
architecture, transportation, mechanical engineering, clothing, furniture, animals, avatars, tree of life, cities, mining, landscape, lab, sculpture, art, music, datamining. Potential guide for more specific brainstorming. A github search for 'generator JavaScript' ?

The label said brainstorming ...



 Instead of creating more components how about some good documentation for how someone could do it? I've basically had to reverse engineer the ocean component to learn how to do dynamic geometry.  > Instead of creating more components how about some good documentation for how someone could do it?

Reading [Writing a Component](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/writing-a-component.html) in particular [Creating the Box Mesh](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/writing-a-component.html#creating-the-box-mesh) describe precisely that. Maybe [<a-entity>.object3D](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/core/entity.html#object3d) could be linked explicitly in [introduction](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/) or [Developing with three.js](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/developing-with-threejs.html). Alternatively the documentation could visually display the stack ([as I've done in a very ugly manner before](http://jsbin.com/yuwive/edit?html,output), as usual 😉) but apparently not everybody is a fan of that. @dmarcos actually it is practically finished... you can take a look at the code here: https://github.com/rlamana/a-aviator. I basically used your official documentation as my only source. This is the first time I use A-Frame so I guess there are probably better ways to do some of the things I did. I look forward to your feedback ;) @fernandojsg done, https://rlamana.github.io/a-aviator/  **Description:**

The <a-animation> element with color as animated attribute does not use the parent element's color as from value. It is necessary to provide an explicit from value.

The box color should interpolate from blue to red but resets to black as initial color at the start of the animation. dataFrom should already have gone through this check:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/af3f89049d10b9037895b9059e5aa430c6f1bf81/src/core/a-animation.js#L95

But I am non sure why this line

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/af3f89049d10b9037895b9059e5aa430c6f1bf81/src/core/a-animation.js#L107

is placed afterwards, not before the getAnimationValues call.

It may be worthwhile to find out why it works for other attributes but not for color: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/af3f89049d10b9037895b9059e5aa430c6f1bf81/src/core/a-animation.js#L479
Ah, I see other attributes do the same check. For the initial case when self.initialValue is undefined.

This indicates that the code may benefit from reorganization to avoid that additional checking with duplicated code but that could take longer to figure out.

So, the proposed fix look good to me, as it just follows how other attributes are handled.

The proposed fix (but not the other attribute checks) may be written as:

```
dataFrom = dataFrom || getComponentProperty(el, attribute);
from = new THREE.Color(dataFrom);
```
but I did not actually try this.Does not work for 0 and false.

 https://reminiscent-tip.glitch.me/
applies @takahirox fix . It works for the example, and probably in general. Submit PR and wait for a response ? Perhaps there is a test to add ?
 https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/tests/core/a-animation.test.js
It looks like the case when from is missing and from is the current entity value was not tested, so perhaps there is no need to add a test.  **Description:**
The documentation of [cursor](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/components/cursor.html) states it internally uses the [raycaster](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/components/raycaster.html) component which has a property `showLine` that causes a line to be displayed. However the line is still visible even if that property is set explicitly. A fix i found is to add `line="visible: false"` on the cursor entity.

I am attaching two images. The first is a screenshot from VR mode in Xiaomi MI 5 on Google Chrome, where the effect is visible. The second shows the inspector in a desktop version where the line component has the `visible` property set to true despite the `showLine` property set to false on the raycaster component.

  Is there going to be a 0.6.1 patch release for this bug fix?  **Description:**
This PR fixes a typo in the cursor components event documentation. The correct event for cursor fusing is `fusing` not `cursor-fusing`.

**Changes proposed:**
- Fix typo in cursor component documentation.
 Sorry. On `0.6.0`. On `0.5.0` the documentation is correct.  When trying to set setAttribute('geometry',{primitive: "plane", height: "auto", width: "auto"}); on `<a-entity text>` the plane is not being drawn. However if you change the wrap count programaticaly afterwards the plane is showing. The plane will not update it's width and height if you change the wrap count again.

 Hi @dmarcos, we still have the problem;

`var text = document.querySelector('#af-text');
text.setAttribute('geometry',{primitive: "plane", height: "auto", width: "auto"});`

Will not work, but when we change the e.g. wrapCount the textbox will appear.  @dmarcos, yes I am on the master branche as per your suggestion.

@machenmusik, the auto width and height are on the geometry component see:

https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/components/text.html

`<a-entity
  geometry="primitive: plane; height: auto; width: auto"
  material="color: blue"
  text="width: 4; value: This text will be 4 units wide."></a-entity>`

The thing is, after creating the entity component with:

`<a-entity text="width: 4; color: #000; value: test text" id="text"></a-entity>`

and adding `geometry="primitive: plane; height: auto; width: auto;" material="color: red"`
in the console (or with javascript) nothing happens. But when you change anything in the text="" section after adding the geometry in the console (or with javascript), the plane appears. Even doing:

`text = document.querySelector('#text);
text.setAttribute('text','bla',1);`

will work. Setting the geometry width and height to an integer indeed works, but I need autoscaling. The documentation says:

> Scaling Geometry to Fit Text
To have the geometry automatically scale with the text, set the geometry component’s width and height properties to auto, and set the text component’s width as desired. In this example, the plane’s width will be set to 4 units, and its height will be set to match the actual height of the text:

And it works as intended in 0.5.0 and 0.6.0, but not when we set it programmatically.

So (imho), I doubt it's an error in the documentation. 

Edit: it seems #2764 has height: auto on the geometry and suffers from the same bug.

Edit2: @dmarcos, could you re-open this issue?  Well, @ngokevin mentions `<a-entity text geometry="primitive: plane; height: auto" material>` in #2764 so `height: auto ` is valid in the geometry component in this case.

  The github tag release notes and any other places should be updated too.  The wakelock feature that is supposed to keep the screen from dimming with NoSleep.js is not working. The demo page for NoSleep.js does work on the same phone.

  For other browsers https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js This one has gotten a little stale - do we still want it?  If so, are any further styling changes needed (and if so, what?) Revisiting this, it turns out that changes were needed to make MacOS HLS work... and iOS HLS isn't working again :-/ Does anyone have a non-upgraded iOS 10 device to try, to confirm that iOS HLS behavior regressed between 10 and 11? Great, thanks @cvan - I can't downgrade back to 10.3.3 anymore so that will be super helpful  (1) It's not just iOS.  For example, it actually works better on Edge and WinMR because it has native support, full hardware acceleration, and can handle live.  Same for Android, and especially Oculus Browser.  iOS is actually the worst, since they broke it again with iOS 11.

(2) I don't think there is actually much complexity here, comparatively speaking - can you say more about what you are objecting to specifically, rather than a general less-is-more maintenance sentiment?

(3) Video is an important use case, there is quite a bit of it.  HLS is still used on multiple platforms to deliver live and prerecorded content, 

If you are saying you don't want A-frame to maintain the list of which things need which quirks, I understand.  But having the support to be able to apply workarounds for the quirks is definitely something for core A-Frame.  There is no other way to externally apply the quirks, because even if you set the shader manually, A-frame would set the wrong texture format for THREE to try. To be clear, native HLS is available in Windows (Edge), macOS (Safari at least), iOS (Safari and friends which is everything), Android (Chrome, Samsung Internet, Oculus Browser) so I don't think there should be a question of supporting HLS where commercially reasonable.

I think the question is whether the quirks are worth (1) providing core support to allow and (2) directly facilitating in core.

I do think (1) is critical - for example, allowing the use of formats other than the originally hardcoded RGBFormat for video textures, which is a critical piece without which only black screens would be seen on impacted platforms.

I can understand the push to avoid (2) and push out of core, if usage is minimal.  How many folks visit A-Frame powered sites with macOS Safari?  With iOS?  I don't know the answer.  I do feel relatively confident in saying that the number will drop to zero if it doesn't work.  I also don't know what percentage of that usage includes video, but to be frank since there is no WebVR on either, there isn't a lot else to do with A-Frame there...?  Maybe we need to add analytics tags to A-frame so we can gather this type of info. @dmarcos , @cvan not having adaptive streaming (thus also HLS) is one of the reason video professionals are still using KRPano, despite stating a desire to migrate to A-Frame. I had that precise discussion last week at WebXRParis. PR that helps to fill the gap for 360 videos that do load fast (people using YouTube as a comparison point) makes a huge difference. @Utopiah can you clarify, there is already support in A-Frame for native HLS (although it would appear that Apple broke it in iOS 11) -- is the ask for adaptive streaming regardless of native support (e.g. hls.js, dash.js, and the like) ?  From prior discussions with @dmarcos @ngokevin, that level of support may be more appropriate for components at the moment. @machenmusik yes adaptive streaming regardless of native support, be it within core or as a component (whatever is the most appropriate maintenance wise) there is a clear need for it from video professionals. thanks @Utopiah -- outside the various Apple/Safari breakage bugs (CORS, iOS 11) that is doable now actually... @machenmusik yes I've done it in March and it worked relatively well back then but it was neither complete nor obvious. Just checking - am I right that the current PR no longer needs changes, but that there is still some discussion about removing the BGRA and flip Y functionality and/or quirk detection from core, with @dmarcos @ngokevin for removal, and @cvan @machenmusik @utopiah against?  

If so, can we merge this PR first so the current state is less broken / inconsistent, and open another issue to discuss how to refactor quirk detection etc. out of core? I would also like to point out that having a working HLS example is actually of rather significant benefit to those platforms that support native HLS without Safari's quirks, with the newest notable being Edge for WinMR. I agree that we want to move quirk detection and handling out of core as much as possible.

So IIRC the one thing that needs to be in core is selection of the THREE texture format (e.g. simple RGB vs. RGBA, which then gets interpreted as BGRA by shader in some cases).  Video hardware accelerated decoding actually provides YUV colorspace and it is vastly more efficient to do color space conversion in shader if not intrinsic to the HW acceleration, and if WebGL can get that to us, performance can approach what can be done with native.  Also, not sure if THREE hides, but on some platforms native video runs faster as 32 bit RGBA or ARGB...

So OK, I propose this:

- keep this PR, modify it so it's just about having a working HLS example and ignoring any particular changes for quirks, then merge it.  So it may not work on Safari, but should on Edge et al.

- start working another issue/PR to remove all but the necessary texture format specification from the current quirk accommodations

- in tandem with that PR, make an example component outside core that does the quirks

Agree?

 I think the very simple case of adding, alongside the existing MP4 video demo, an equivalent that uses HLS - which was the original call for action here - has somehow gotten wrapped around the axle of Safari quirks and concern over whether they should be accommodated.

So let us please reset the discussion to be about simply adding a video example that uses HLS instead of MP4, with appropriate files and links from existing examples, and I will do the same to the contents of this PR.  MP4 files are not suitable for live streaming cases, which is the space that support for HLS format and/or Media Source Extensions (MSE) covers nicely.  I presume that if this is done, there will be no objection to merging the PR to provide the example, and we can discuss other concerns separately.

There are several prominent browsers that support native HLS video in A-Frame without any special considerations, which we should use to help politely suggest similar behavior from browsers with broken native HLS support.  Note that browsers that support MSE have other paths to support live content, such as DASH and dash.js, so they may not benefit from adding HLS native support. With all due respect, it seems clear that you guys are not highly fluent in the nuances of video support in browsers.  Let me make a few statements and see whether we agree...

- A-Frame supports video as a core media type, like 3D objects, and audio, and text (which took some convincing, but has proven its value over time.)

- It does this because supporting experiences using (both traditional 2D and newer 180/360) video is a common use case for A-Frame, similar to panoramic 360 images and the various experiences built from and with them.  (Also, new uses of video-as-2D texture mixed with 3D points / mesh are starting to emerge such as DepthKit.)

- The HTML specifications and browser implementations are responsible tor video element and handling, not A-Frame (or three.js).

- The details of video element support for various codecs and container formats (e.g. MP4, webm, HLS) are provided by HTML specifications and browser implementations, and are out of scope for three.js and A-Frame.

- A-Frame introduces a very minimal layer, atop three.js at present, so that the material component can reference video elements much the same way they can reference image elements, and they can be visualized and utilized alongside other (three.js and) A-Frame functionality.

- A-Frame should provide examples of how to use the minimal layer it provides for each core media type, or else it should drop support for the core media type.  (NOTE: This is the intent of the current PR.)

- A-Frame cannot guarantee, and should not attempt to guarantee, that said examples will work on all browser implementations, as that is out of scope.  (This is the discussion we are having about quirks, and should be separated into other issues / PRs.)

Ok? Existing A-Frame video examples work when the browsers provide native support (e.d. Safari, Chrome, Edge, Firefox) but may not work in browsers that don't support that kind of video (if I recall correctly, that includes MP4 in Chromium, and webm in Safari at least).

The same should and will be true for these HLS examples once I strip down this PR.

We can refactor to simplify (by removing quirk special handling) separately.

Ok? @ngokevin I think we agree on the direction, very specifically that A-Frame will continue to support video in core to the extent the underlying implementations expose it, but not include any customizations for deficiencies or quirks in behavior.  In fact we expect to remove existing workarounds in subsequent PRs.  Do I misunderstand?

On the fervent hope that we agree there... I really don't understand the objection to simply having an example of video playback with A-Frame that points at HLS files, to sit alongside the MP4 and webm examples currently distributed.  It's like refusing to have examples of JPEG images, only PNGs... I am still in the air, but I will submit a new PR that has just the examples directory files from here, as I think this PR has confused matters by mixing concerns.

 Ok good, so no objection to examples, but don't want to use the pre-existing examples folder methodology in the repo for reasons above.  Got it, makes sense, thanks! So for the examples like the showcase videosphere which are currently examples folder in repo, do we want to move them out into one glitch with all the examples?  Or individual glitches?  Or just leave them alone? so what is the final decision ? If I want to play hls stream inside aframe, what is the recommended way ? currently I am using videojs library which wraps the video element inside the a-assets. It is working for chrome/firefox/safari on desktop, chrome on android but not on (safari/chrome) on iphone (iOS version 11.0)?  > currently I am using videojs library which wraps the video element inside the a-assets.

Assuming that means video.js with hls.js support, that is required for browsers that do not support HLS natively.

> but not on (safari/chrome) on iphone (iOS version 11.0)?

Unfortunately there seems to be a Safari regression with iOS 11. Hey @machenmusik , 
Thanks for the reply.
So can we expect this to be solved in a few days ? How long could it take before this Safari regression with iOS 11 is taken care of. Is there a thread already open for this ?  I believe this issue is best followed via https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/9754, which has a long history. BTW, if more typical MP4 video is an option for you, that seems to work OK on Safari as long as you avoid Webkit/Safari CORS bugs and/or if Safari fixes for those bugs have landed in the version you use Thanks @cvan yeah, mp4 is working fine on iphone safari iOS11. Thanks @cvan and @machenmusik for the webkit bug thread and three.js issue thread
  While developing a new site, I noticed my interface was mysteriously broken this morning (6/30/2017). I had not pushed any code changes, but it's pulling in aframe.io/aframe/dist/aframe-master.js which _did change_ last night.

The code that no longer worked is supposed to manage UI elements by automatically readjusting the position of buttons (simple plane geometries) whenever a button is added/removed. It does this by looping all elements (each button is `control`):
```
pos = control.getAttribute('position');
if (pos) {
  pos.x = offset_left;
  control.setAttribute('position', pos);
}
```

I checked `control.getAttribute('position')` and they were all correct, but none of the positions were actually changed in the scene. I tried manually performing `control.setAttribute('position', pos)` via the developer console and noticed something odd: it took **two** calls to `setAttribute` to actually get the element to move. So my updated UI loop (which works again, hooray!):
```
pos = control.getAttribute('position');
if (pos) {
  pos.x = offset_left;
  // For some reason, this now needs to be called twice.
  control.setAttribute('position', pos);
  control.setAttribute('position', pos);
}
```

- A-Frame Version: 0.6.0 (Date 30-06-2017, Commit #13ced44)
- Platform / Device: Firefox and Chrome on Windows 10 (latest stable versions of each)
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:
To reproduce, go to https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/boilerplate/hello-world/ and execute this script via the console:
```
var pos = document.querySelectorAll('a-box')[0].getAttribute('position');
pos.x -= 1;
document.querySelectorAll('a-box')[0].setAttribute('position', pos);
// The box does **not** update position, until you run the following line (uncomment before running):
// document.querySelectorAll('a-box')[0].setAttribute('position', pos); // Now it works!
``` A few objects in my experience moved when upgrading to 0.6.0

For me it was happening when I changed the 'position' 'x' attribute-- it reset y to 0 instead of holding onto its previous value. 

In other words, I define an entity at position (0, -.24, 0) and throughout the experience I'm changing that x position, but every time the x position changed it was resetting y to 0. I surmised that I needed to keep redefining y, and that seemed to fix the problem.

`


    //move from -.25 to 0 and scale from 0 to 3 over panotime
    countTime -= 500;

    var xLoadPos = -.25 + (0.25 * (1 - (countTime/panoTime)));

    var xLoadScale = 3 * (1- (countTime/panoTime));

    loadBar.setAttribute('position', 'x', xLoadPos);

    loadBar.setAttribute('position', 'y', "-.24"); //ADDING THIS CODE FIXED IT

    loadBar.setAttribute('scale', 'x', xLoadScale);

` I have multiple things broken with this update. I have two components changing entity rotation in `tick()`.

Firstly, I experience the same problem as @ibrews.

Secondly, I noticed that reversing the order of these components inside HTML tag restored the previous behavior. Is there a test that checks the execution order of `tick()` etc.? If not, we should write one. @ngokevin Probably later, I have no time at the moment, unfortunately, but wanted to let others know. Ah, that makes sense! But quick question: why is that solved by calling `el.setAttribute` a second time? Wouldn't the same `oldData === data` check have the same result? More than likely

With the addition of the `extend()` function, the extension mechanism can consider the cases in which the component is absent or is of a primitive type:

1. If both `base` and `extension` are absent, `extend()` will return `undefined`.
2. Else, If `base` or `extension` is absent, `extend()` will returns a copy of the other.
3. Else, If none of them is absent and both are pure JS objects, the second will extend the first as usual.
4. Finally, the `extension` is preferred so a copy of it is returned.  The line in charge of [extending components coming from mixins](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/extras/primitives/primitives.js#L81) will return an invalid value when the mixin component is a non-object single-property value such as an string:

```js
data[name] = utils.extendDeep(data[name] || {}, mixinComponents[name]);
```

This is caused by how [`deep-assign`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deep-assign) works.

Try the following snippet:

```js
const deepAssign = require('deep-assign');
undefined
deepAssign({}, '[camera]');

I'm trying to change the text in an a-text dynamically with setAttribute from Javascript.  The example linked below simply just changes the text to another hardcoded text (compared to initial value) each tick. It works as I expect it too in Chrome ("my text" is shown), but not in Firefox or Safari ("text" is shown). I cannot really see what's wrong here, especially since it works in Chrome. Any ideas?

  In the past the cursor did not interact with invisible objects by default. This behaviour changed in 0.5.0. and now we have to do extra work to _not_ interact with invisible objects.

Consider the following scenario:

- A raycaster with the objects: .clickable attribute
- An image that, when clicked, will show another image
- The new image, when clicked, will show a graph and a close button that will close all but the first image

What we need to do with 0.5.0 is:

- Add the class 'clickable' on the first image
- When the first image is clicked, make the second image visible _and_  add 'clickable' to it's class
- When the second image is clicked we need to set the graph visible and the close button, and add the class 'clickable' to the close button
- When the close button is clicked we have to set 'visible=false' to the second image, the graph and the close button _and_ remove the class 'clickable' from various objects.
- I did not mention we need to refresh the raycaster each time the class 'clickable' is added or removed

Now consider the above scenario if the cursor does not interact with invisible objects.

When a dev needs interaction with an invisible object isn't it better to hide the object with 'opacity=0'?

Kind regards, and thank you for a great product! Hi @ngokevin, still the same issue when I use:

`<a-box material="visible: false" width="1" height="1" depth="1"  class="clickable"></a-box>` I gave up on this myself. It would be nice.   [docs] update cursor component documentation

- Change 'cursor-fusing' argument in 'Adding visual feedback' to 'fusing'.
  Hi,

the aframe master example regarding 'Adding visual feedback' is wrong;

a-animation begin="cursor-fusing" should be

a-animation begin="fusing"  Still, when you use 'cursor-fusing' as the beginning of an animation the animation will not play. Ah, I see what you mean now.

In my opinion the dev has a choice which cursor (gaze, laser, w/e will be in the future) to use and can therefore set the appropriate cursor in code. When he / she needs a fallback to another cursor there can be a test for HMD that support laser (or other) cursors and if not choose another cursor like a gaze cursor?  **Description:**

I believe components can assume during their initialization that components on child nodes have already been initialized due to the inside-out initialization order. This assumption does not hold up in a scene with no `<a-assets>` declared.

This can definitely be solved in the component by not making the assumption, but I thought it was worth documenting for you.  Here it is with decomposed primitive:

https://glitch.com/edit/#!/denim-straw

The issue is still the same https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component/blob/master/reaction_components/locomotor-auto-config.js  Get the `navigator.getGamepads()` to line up with controller entities in the scene markup. 

From @donmccurdy from the A-Frame Slack:

> A-Frame makes an assumption about which gamepad is right/left though (or maybe it's in the gamepad API?) so custom components have to match that.

It looks like [`this.controller` in `tracked-controls`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/tracked-controls.js#L78) does this, but there's currently no component level way to pass along this information, so we're left doing something like `var controllers = navigator.getGamepads()`.

Since it pretty closely follows this issue: maybe there also oughta be a declarative way for handling button input and touch/pressed values? e.g. `leftTrackPadPressed = "LeftTrackPadPressedFn";` re: @donmccurdy 

I'm interested in getting events from the gamepad, that ideally include information like current state of the buttons and position/rotation — for example, to make a component that vibrates the controllers when a certain button is pressed, it'd be nice to just listen to specific button presses and vibrate `this.el.controller`. ~I'm also in favor of passing `hand: 'left' | 'right'` in the `controllerconnected` event, to get a baseline assuming the controllers support handedness.~ Actually, @donmccurdy, in writing the below I found that `tracked-controls`
 events (anecdotally, off of `buttonchanged`, but we can assume WLOG) returns the hand info in `e.detail.target.components['tracked-controls'].controller.hand`. That's still pretty cumbersome, but it's worth maybe just documenting this for now?

---

re: @dmarcos 
I've been looking for something like a streamlined version of accessing `document.querySelector('a-scene').systems['tracked-controls'].controllers` with a mapping between an controller and the element it originates from. Right now to do, for example, a very arbitrary fire-on-every-button-change, vibration call, you'd do something like the following:

``` javascript
document.querySelector('[tracked-controls]').addEventListener('buttonchanged', function (e) {
   e.detail.target.components['tracked-controls'].controller.hapticActuators[0].pulse(e.detail.state.value  / 2, 100)
})
```

Now that I've dug down into it, I feel like this satisfies what I was originally asking for, but the ergonomics could be better, such as surfacing `e.detail.controller` in the event response or declaratively allowing a function to handle a given controller, for example:

``` javascript

function triggerHandler (controller, buttonValue) { /* do stuff with this information */}
function trackpadHandler (controller, buttonValue) { /* do stuff with this information */}
/*... etc.*/
----
<a-entity tracked-controls="triggerHandler: triggerHandler; trackpadHandler: trackpadHandler; controller: 0; idPrefix: OpenVR;"></a-entity>
```

The example above is probably too vendor specific, but we can abstract it higher (gotta reference the WebVR and Gamepad API specs if I actually find the time to work on this) to handle buttons input. I've heard about controller/input support in 0.6.0, maybe this is redundant/can be coupled with that implementation? Yeah, while working through the issues I brought up at the top of this, there doesn't seem to be much actionable work here, although getting the haptics API would be a different conversation that can be picked up later, in a different thread when appropriate. Also, now that I think about it, the complexity surrounding handling controller input is such that a declarative model would be more obfuscation than enlightening, thanks @dmarcos.  **Description:**

A-frame has the option to register custom geometries:
https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/geometry.html#register-a-custom-geometry
The documentation mentions and the expectation would be that there is an update life cycle method, similar to components.

However, the update method of a registered custom component seems to be never invoked. Instead, the geometry component calls the init method when attributes change. This works for the built-in geometries but may not work for custom geometries.

- A-Frame Version: 0.5.0
- Platform / Device: all
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: https://heavy-client.glitch.me/
There is an update method which prints to the console. It is never called, eg. not at the initial init nor after clicking the button.

Solutions may include to either clarify documentation (deprecate custom geometries update) or add hook into custom update in geometry component update.
 https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/geometry.html#register-a-custom-geometry

now mentions update as a lifecycle method. I can prepare a short PR to clarify this doc section if desired.

 Yeah, as it is, registerGeometry does not really provide advantages over registerComponent for custom THREE Geometries, as far as I can tell.  **Description:**

Make custom geometry example code functional (it wasn't):

- from `<a-light>s` to `<a-lights>` Alright, my bad. Still sounds kinda weird. Shouldn't it be `<a-light>` without the s? Ah, that's why. 🆒   The position attribute implies that this component alone can do positional audio, which is not true (as of 0.5)
To have positional audio, you need to attach this to another entity.

Hi guys,
Thank you for the great framework. I am working on a project that requires support for IE11.
I have noticed an issue with the aframe 0.5.0 version. I am trying to make a screenshot of the current canvas. The operation fails at [this line](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/990e9272dc9ddc463a7707fae885c2afd26f9006/src/components/scene/screenshot.js#L224 ) in screenshot component. The issue is that TypedArray.prototype.slice is not supported in this version of IE. Would you consider supporting the functionality in IE 11?

Thanks. Hi @donmccurdy 
Thanks a lot for the suggestions and linked issues. I have checked the issues as well. I guess if new need to support it we will go with the polyfill. 
Thanks for your time and keep up the good work 👍 !  Hi,

I've made a presentation for a client in Aframe. All is working well except on iOS devices iPhone 5S, 6,  iPad mini 1 and the iPad Air 1. iOs is at the latest version (10.3.2).

The presentation is 86MB in total and contains a GLTF 1 model, and about 15 sky spheres. The offending device(s) will reload the presentation at random points in time as well as at random events.

 Hi @donmccurdy,

thank you for your answer.

The gltf model itself is 'only' 14.4MB, but the total presentation is about 84MB.

It's a collada model converted to GLTF 1. I will see about lowering the size for the model.

Thanks!

 When there where 2 spheres this problem did not occur, so there seems to be some memory issue in this presentation. I just included a 28MB collada model and the safari browser kept reloading the page.

 I have managed to downsize the equirectangular images and other images in the presentation and the total size is now about 54MB. It still will crash at some point and cause safari to reload the page. Have that in the nightly update for win10. It hits aframe and crashes the
browser. Hopefully it's fixed tomorrow. I couldn't work all morning.

 Hi @ngokevin, I've tried the version you recommend but that version has a bug where the cursor is interacting with hidden objects (visible="false").

Edit: so the rayraster is supposed to interact with invisible objects? In that case I have some rewriting to do.  I've been working on a VR game within A-Frame. When I started testing on devices (iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus running Safari, and Samsung Galaxy S6 running Chrome), I began to notice the page would randomly refresh, which is an issue for us, as it restarts the game.

This is happening with the demos on their website, as well as our self-hosted game.

Has anyone experienced this issue, and/or know what the issue or the solution is?

- A-Frame Version: 0.5.0
- Platform / Device: iPhone 7/7 Plus
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: [https://aframe.io/examples/hello-metaverse/]
 It hasn't happened once on a desktop (am I correct in saying that 2D is desktop). We've only had this page refresh issue on devices, most regularly in VR mode. I believed it was an issue on our end, until we started testing on a-frame.io examples, and it happened there too.  We're still very much having this issue on multiple devices on a-frame's own projects. Admittedly, on the iPhone 7 Plus it's less regular than the iPhone 7, sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes 1 minutes. I recommend leaving your phone in the VR mode until it happens. If you notice that i's no longer in VR mode, a page refresh has occurred. 

I'm very much in need of a solution or an explanation to this, so I'm not prepared to close this issue at this point. Hi, I'm having the same issue. On the basic Hello Web VR example, if I just leave my iPhone sat for a few minutes, I'm booted out of VR mode and the attached logs in console.

![screen shot 2017-06-16 at 09 16 04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2477827/27218114-b1f4f248-5274-11e7-86c4-97fbc68d7006.png)
 So after getting an unminified version of the files, I have found out that there is an issue with the iOSWakeLock function (lines 80195 and 80195 of aframe-master.js from v0.5.0).

	function iOSWakeLock() {
		var timer = null;

		this.request = function() {
			if (!timer) {
				timer = setInterval(function() {
					window.location = window.location;
					setTimeout(window.stop, 0);
				}, 30000);
			}
		}

		this.release = function() {
			if (timer) {
				clearInterval(timer);
				timer = null;
			}
		}
	}

From what I can gather, it is a function to keep the screen from timing out. This has not worked for us and we've had to change phone settings to accomplish this. This also explains why it only occurs on iOS. If anyone can shed any light on why this might be happening that would be great. In the meantime, I've commented this out. @cvan All of the iPhones with this issue had their display settings set to never auto-lock.  I'm experiencing the same issue, after every 30s without interaction in VR-mode, the app will reload itself. I'm on iOS 11.0 with the screen-lock setting on 5 minutes. Hi 👋 ,

I am currently running into this issue on iPhone 6S & X (Safari) and my MacBook Pro Retina 2015 and 2016 (on Google Chrome w/ the iPhone simulator). The refresh happens exactly 30 seconds after instantiating the app. Steps to reproduce:

- Visit https://aframe.io/examples/hello-metaverse/ via Google Chrome on your computer.
- Go into Inspect Mode, and toggle mobile simulator. Pick any iPhone model.
- Click VR Mode button on bottom right and switch to landscape mode.
- Now wait for 30 seconds, and you will see that the page refreshes.

Same thing is happening when I load my app up in VR mode on my iPhone. The page refreshes exactly after 30 seconds, and there are no logs at the moment it happens to tell me why it's happening. 

Note that the app does NOT refresh if I pull it up on an Android (in VR mode), so this is definitely a problem with iOS.

After digging around, [this line](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/vendor/wakelock/wakelock.js#L50) seems to be the culprit. It sets the `window.location` to `/`, which is what was refreshing the page. 

I've commented that line out in my production bundle, but I still don't really understand the issue with it. I know it's related to keeping the phone awake, but there has to be another way of doing that instead of directly setting `window.location`.

If anyone can shed some light on this, it would be much appreciated! :) I've uncommonly heard similar reports on using WebVR polyfill and it comes down to the wakelock. Hi, I'm having the same issue on iOS 11.

However, [NoSleep.js](https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js) that similar to wakelock.js of A-frame is successfully working. 😃 
I compared NoSleep.js and wakelock.js, then found the following difference.

### NoSleep.js
It plays the video for iOS 11.
https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js/blob/01b379d53cd89c15052b7ab92da319812b7c823b/src/index.js#L3-L7

### wakelock.js of A-frame
It does NOT play the video for iOS 11.
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/619d57c9a41efe127052897e734322cc67c25e5b/vendor/wakelock/wakelock.js#L67-L68

Does anyone think that replacing with NoSleep.js is a good idea? NoSleep.js has already been included in A-frame **0.8.2** through `webvr-polyfill`.
I noticed it now. :sweat_smile:

I can see its successful work on my iPhone7 (iOS 11), and think this issue has been solved. :+1: :+1:  **Description:**

 @dmarcos http://aframe-master.glitch.me/ uses the master which a-frobot commited just after #2751 has been commited (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commits/master).  Small feature request: expose the vertexColors property in the `material` component. So users can do like
```
<a-entity myComponentThatGeneratesABufferGeometry="height: 1.23; radius: 4.56" material="opacity:0.5; vertexColors=2">
```
I'm building several such "myComponentThatGeneratesABufferGeometry" that use vertex coloring e.g. http://https://github.com/morandd/aframe-heatmap3d  It'd be cleaner to re-use the AFrame `material` component, if one is provided, rather than have the user pass in all the material properties to my component so I create the material internally.

thanks for considering

**Changes proposed:**

  -**Issue**: 
I have a few images in <a-assets>, which are being used as the src for <a-sky>. I am also adding new images to <a-assets> dynamically, using javascript. Initially, when the page loads, all the images are downloaded. When I change the src of <a-sky> to an image which is already downloaded, it re-downloads the image again, instead of loading a cached version of the same. Also, once I add a new image to <a-assets> and change the src of <a-sky> to this, it downloads the image every time, instead of using the cached version.

Is there an event listener that can be used to keep track of whether an image is cached or not?

- **A-Frame Version**: 
0.5.0

- **Platform / Device**: 
Ubuntu 16.04

- **Browser**:
Google Chrome Version 59.0.3071.86 (Official Build 64-bit) Thanks, @donmccurdy !
I figured out the error related to caching. 

I had another query. I am accessing the same set of images multiple times using <a-sky>. After the initial download, when the images are accessed, another request is being sent to the source of the image, which returns a 304 (not modified) status code. I wanted to know if there is a way in a-frame to keep track of how the requests for these assets is being made, and also what the response for such requests may be.

**PS**: I don't have any back-end code, nor am I using XHR requests. I want to know if we can access the status code of the response of the image (or other assets) being requested by aframe using client-side JS only.  
 Thanks, @donmccurdy !
I wanted to use the status code to check if an image is already downloaded and to choose whether to show a loader or an animation based on the browser response. If it's downloaded, then I would show an animation for changing the sky, else I would show a loader until the image downloads.
Any idea of how this can be checked and implemented in a-frame?

Also, yes @ngokevin 304 is Not Modified client redirection response code. It is an implicit redirection to a cached resource.  Thanks, @ngokevin and @donmccurdy .   **Description:**

BR/KK Done!  

**Pull Request Created:**
Docs: Corrected Typo changed word semicolon to colon and vice-versa **#2777**  So its an issue on my Windows 10 computer and a coworker's Windows 10, and our Alpine servers running docker.
However it works fine on a coworker's Mac and another Windows 10 computer. 
May be related to the new Windows 10 update? but that wouldn't explain your mac or our docker servers...

Fails:
Windows 10 : npm v5.0.0
Windows 10 : npm v5.0.3
Alpine/Linux : npm v3.10.10

Works:
Windows 10 : npm 3.10.8
Mac : npm (not sure)

Getting this on our servers as well, but they've been running updates for a while with no issues before now
npm ERR! error: cannot run ssh: No such file or directory
npm ERR! fatal: unable to fork

Still looking into it and will let you know if I find more.
Thanks Thanks, been able to work around it using `npm install aframevr/aframe` for now.
It may have to do with the npm cache. I cleared mine earlier and the problem has come up for me, so might be able to replicate it by clearing it. I'll test this tomorrow on a computer that is currently working fine. I've been testing `npm install aframe` today and I've tried with npm version 3.10 and 4.2 without success. Actually there were no issues to begin with, but as soon as I cleared my npm cache I started getting these errors:

```npm ERR! git rev-list -n1 a02a8089b: fatal: ambiguous argument 'a02a8089b': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.```

So after a lot of testing and searching, I've come up with this:
There's - as mentioned earlier - a dependency to the dmarcos/webvr-polyfill repository at a specific commit SHA number ([a02a8089b](https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill/commit/a02a8089b)). This commit however doesn't seem to be associated with any branch, so that might be the reason why git can't locate this commit. After looking through the commits on all the different branches on the dmarcos/webvr-polyfill repository I found one commit that looks almost the same as the a02a8089b commit, and it's this one: [dmarcos/webvr-polyfill@ 9faf790](https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill/commit/9faf790). It could look like a force push has been done to the dmarcos/webvr-polyfill repository, which has resulted in the SHA numbers to update, which is then causing the installation error where git can't locate the a02a8089b commit.

So, there shouldn't be any problem as long as you've previously installed aframe without issues and don't clear your npm cache - as the cache has remembered the reference to the a02a8089b commit. However if you either clean your npm cache or install a new npm version you will start getting errors. @dmarcos Yes this is working fine on my local and deployment servers now. 

Thanks,
Clark npm install aframe fails again

8.4.0  **Description:**
Daydream controller doesnt work and entering VR Mode throws a critical error, somehow it works in custom builds and older versions of Aframe.

- A-Frame Version:
Tried various ones, first ofc the latest one 0.5.0 (master/f850c2f),
then some of the last 2 days 0.5.0 (master/9266cfd) and so on,
then I bundled an A-frame version with an older VR Polyfill (0. which PlayCanvas uses in their [WebVR example](https://playcanv.as/p/sAsiDvtC/) because this somehow still works including the Daydream controller,
nothing worked.

- Platform / Device:
**Hardware** ZTE Axon 7 + Google Daydream View
**OS** LineageOS 14.1 running Android 7.1.2 (lineage-14.1-20170612-nightly-axon7-signed) 2017-06-12 10:29:17 
**UA** Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.1.2; ZTE A2017U Build/N2G47O) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.92 Mobile Safari/537.36

Yes its flashed, because ZTE just released a working 7.1 Nougat/Daydream version some days/weeks ago and there was no official version which supported daydream in February. I will also test if the error still occurs with the manufacturer stock version soon, but since it works on PlayCanvas and older A-frame examples i think this _makes no difference_.

- Main error:
Uncaught (in promise) Error: Failed to enter VR mode ('requestPresent'): Presentation request was denied
-> after triggering the VR mode button and thus the Daydream (Pls insert your device) screen never appears.

- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:
Every **current** example from A-Frame on the mainpage and from private projects using current versions, too i.e. [ground control vr](https://github.com/aframe-capstone/ground-control-vr).
[Codepen](https://codepen.io/intenser/pen/gRMGBq)

- Working examples are:
-- [webvr.yoga](http://webvr.yoga) (working daydream controller)
-- [webvr.playcanvas.com](https://playcanv.as/p/sAsiDvtC/) (even tho it throws other errors and its not completly compareable it still shows the controller works in web with my setup)
-- https://webvr.info/samples/XX-vr-controllers.html?polyfill=1 (this works as intended like in gaze is no controller interaction just by touch you can change the background, then I enter VR mode the daydream window pops up and the controller is able to change the background on click)

 Iam so stupid sorry, you're right both times. I didnt find any deeper description about how to implement the controller because daydream component site is [not ready yet](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/daydream-controls.html) (I guess?!) so i ripped it from another repo. I updated the pen however, still not sure if thats the _best_ implementation for testing if the controller works or not, but that the default daydream VR mode is not starting is at this point enough I guess.

About the flags: I disabled the following chrome://flags/ (WebVR, WebVR experimental rendering optimizations and Chrome VR). Now Aframe is switching to stereoscopic view but the daydream application is still not starting to enable the controller. Errors ahead:

![errors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6901764/27086981-1826020a-5054-11e7-93a0-0bef5e11eae8.jpg)

The PlayCanvas example still works however, the webyoga site is now broken, too (just stereoscopic gaze view without controller) and the webvr xx controller example still works. @cvan Yes its the same problem or at least close to it. I was not sure about it while opening the issue, thanks for the reference.
@machenmusik The thing that confused me with the polyfill is that while the WebVR flag is activated, the polyfill seems to be still active partly. However i tried various chrome browsers (beta, canary, etc.), versions and also Aframe (master) and vrpoly configurations (0.9.24-latest) and nothing seems to "work".

Just for clarification of a "working" daydream component / webvr application with a Daydream mobile device:
1. Loading site (your latest example for instance) on mobile device in gaze view (fixed crosshair to view)
2. Clicking VR button in lower right corner to enter "VR mode"
3. Enter Daydream ["Put your Phone into the Daydream View" ](http://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/reviews/201314-image/Daydream-View-Review-014.jpg)
4. [ Pair Daydream controller Room](https://www.vrheads.com/sites/vrheads.com/files/styles/larger/public/field/image/2016/11/daydream-controller-failure.jpg?itok=pW1er5Vf)
5. Come back to site in stereoscopic view including [a visible controller](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2017/images/playcanvas/activate.png)

Is this how you experience it on your Pixel phone? @machenmusik 

What happens in my case is 1. -> 2. -> 3. -> 4.  but then come back to stereoscopic view and the controller does not appear, I just get gaze view with gaze controls without controller events at all. But as I said before this works in several other WebVr applications even with poly or/and webvr flag, it does not matter. Also the controller is theoretically available, same as the daydream view, tested here:

<img width="715" alt="screen shot 2017-06-14 at 14 05 45" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6901764/27141037-683042d2-5127-11e7-9d11-ddf134f5bcb1.png">

[code here](https://codepen.io/intenser/pen/dRpmoe) (its not clean cause I tried a lot various stuff with a friend this morning)

I completely understand that you want to focus on officially supported devices, but the ZTE Axon 7 which I use is one of the [first supported Daydream devices](https://vr.google.com/daydream/smartphonevr/phones/) and I think it should therefor be considered. I'm not the best developer but I'm pretty sure its just a minor issue regarding the adjustment of code once the problem is detected.
 Ok the flashed OS thing is not much of a difference since my brother has the same phone with original OS and its not working there, too (same issues just slighty other UA). But sure you are right if no one can debug it since the lack of the hardware it wont work out. *cries deeply* @machenmusik if the page is insecure it usually shows even in vr mode that the page is "not safe", however I tested everything, including the flag/token and without it I also pressed every button multiple times while in stereoscopic view its strange the controller seems to be there codewise but it simply doesnt work. I can confirm that the regular chrome browser does not work in every case, just canary or beta. The problem is I get no specific error or like no informative error which shows up that is different from playcanvas or the webvr.info examples which still work (like there are warnings and errors regarding dpdb and device size but thats it). In your example on codepen I only have gaze view BUT the webvr mode kicks in after pressing the vr button, otherwise the 3. "Put your Phone into the Daydream View" part from the post above would not start cause of the missing token/flag. 

Regarding the flashed OS I will visit my brother tomorrow and try it with his phone (I already did that but I missed the flags I guess). Problem with ZTE is their shipping of updates, so there is only 7.1.1 available for stock builds and I guess that will make a huge difference to the current Pixel Android builds but we will see.

Latest UA btw from the different builds in case its needed somewhere (same phone/hardware both times)

Lineage latest

You'd have to manually enable WebVR and Gamepad Extensions in chrome://flags due to Codepen as per https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2769#issuecomment-308418328

cc @ngokevin  Everything should be addressed.  **Description:** 
When using <a-assets>, the <audio> src ('#audiosource') currentTime property does not seem to update. I am currently attaching a sound component to an <a-entity> ('#entity') and printing out the currentTime of the src which plays on init(). The return is always 0 even though the sound is playing.

```
<a-assets><audio id="audiosource" src="audio.mp3"> </a-assets>
<a-entity id="entity" sound="src:#audiosource; loop: true; autoplay: true; volume:2" ></a-entity>

<script>
var sound = document.querySelector('#audiosource');
// - some skipped code
console.log (sound.currentTime); // - this prints every render`
```

- A-Frame Version: 0.5.0


 When referencing to the sound component on the entity, the reference points to an undefined object. Using `pool` and `audioSource.context` does return the current time of the entity's sound component, however, it continues to increase even then when the sound source has stopped. This maybe because the sound pool object is "playing" even though it has stopped.  **Description:**
Hi,
I think there is a problem that VR mode is not rendered correctly in Firefox android browser, it has huge amount of aliasing and terrible resolution. the non-VR works fine and Chrome doesn't have this issue. Screenshots were taken with Aframe.io example.

 @dmarcos Samsung Galaxy S7 and Huawei P9 It no longer works at all on nightly or firefox developer on my desktop and hasn't since Monday. Developer opens the page but crashes on click to VR and nightly just crashes on page load. Wish I hadn't updated now.  @dmarcos I am also experiencing the same rendering issues as @cuitingcheng on a Nexus 6P.  I also have this issue. Furthermore, the sensors are not being used in FF on Android, so we get a still picture instead of a moving scene when we move the phone.(Samsung S7). This can be closed right?  https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2591


 **Description**

- Mentioning a-frame being understandable without three.js knowledge

**Changes proposed**

- Added a line in the docs.  **Description:**
- The closing tag of HTML is labelled as the 'Opening tag'

**Changes proposed:**
- A different image with correct labels


 It was in the a-box tag, but yes not a cdn. Nevermind. I'll change the url  aFrame does not work on Windows 7 IE11. On a Windows 7 machine on IE11 open up any of the demos from the website. ie:

https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/helloworld/

The first Javascript error in the console is:

 var evt = new CustomEvent(name, data);
  el.dispatchEvent(evt);

But fixing this just leads to several more errors.

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 I got the basic stuff in Aframe working now in IE11. I added the following Javascript to my main page:

	```
    (function () {
        if ( typeof window.CustomEvent === "function" ) return false;
          function CustomEvent ( event, params ) {
           params = params || { bubbles: false, cancelable: false, detail: undefined };
           var evt = document.createEvent( 'CustomEvent' );
           evt.initCustomEvent( event, params.bubbles, params.cancelable, params.detail );
           return evt;
        }
        CustomEvent.prototype = window.Event.prototype;
        window.CustomEvent = CustomEvent;
    })();
	```

And it seems to do the trick. I don't know yet if it will work for complex examples beyond boxes and text though @zubairq 

I have tried inserting this at the top and bottom of my code in a dedicated <script> tag but it still doesn't work.

I don't get any error... the main image (I use for the background) does not load...

Any ideas? @donmccurdy None actually.

I have just applied basic functionality using examples from the a-frame site, was hoping just to get it working in IE without too much hassle but this may not be possible

Thanks for your help so far Personally, I would prefer they not use it at all but I am trying to cover all bases. 

So no go then? @sim3083 I tried to follow the thread but I got a bit lost. Could you post just ONE message where you list the problem top down so that I can understand what you are trying to achieve and what you have tried? (Sorry but I suffer from bad short term memory so I need stuff explained in baby steps - I am not being sarcastic either ) @sim3083 Alternatively if you could post an online link to your example then I can try it in IE 11 and try and fix it myself @zubairq 

That's totally fine... I had a couple of different versions running to see what I could get to work.

http://repo3.cfals.info/tram_supply/index2.html

That's the simple one, I have one with more complexity and some jquery but need to see if this works first.

Thanks! @sim3083 Some of the AFrame stuff works on IE11. The demo of our product, Visifile is here:

http://139.162.228.5/

It is AFrame 0.7 and works on IE 11, you can try it to see. Are you saying that the link you posted does not work with IE 11?

http://repo3.cfals.info/tram_supply/index2.html
 @dmarcos I am not sure what you mean by ¨THREE path that uses any of the WebGL missing extensions or methods¨, could you give me an example? @zubairq your example does not work in Chrome or IE11

`VM126:164 WebSocket connection to 'ws://139.162.228.5/websocket' failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 307`

The link I posted does not work in IE11

 @sim3083 Could you provide me with some details of where you are running this from? It sounds to me like you are running this either from a restricted network access PC or on a corporate network where they discallow certain websocket connections, as the error you get is caused by Websockets, not AFrame @zubairq It is from a work network... does this mean its another barrier for this working in IE? @dmarcos @zubairq 
IE11 Firefox and Chrome all show that error going through the network

**Outside the network**
Chrome works
Firefox works
IE11 - blank screen with this in console

Ill try and compare @zubairq version with mine and see if I can spot what I am doing wrong Thanks @dmarcos 

I have yet to see a working version on IE11 or less so at the moment I am assuming it cant be done... I have tried to apply the code from this page with no success so not sure what to do @sim3083 Just so that I can look further into this, do you get the error on IE:

THREE.WebGLShader: Shader couldn't compile.
 
when you go to this link

http://139.162.228.5/

?
 @sim3083 But it CAN be done in IE11. I have seen over 80 different Windows 7 PCs with IE11 run Aframe from the link http://139.162.228.5/ @zubairq this is what i get when looking at it in IE11 (outside the network)

``` @zubairq 

Are you able to have a look at this file and tell me if it runs for you in IE11 (or lower) or what I have to do to get it to run?

http://repo3.cfals.info/tram_supply/index2.html

Thanks @sim3083 Ok, I will try that later today @zubairq thanks heaps... may mean I cant use a-frame which is a real shame @sim3083 I just tried the link http://repo3.cfals.info/tram_supply/index2.html in Chrome on my Mac and I only get a JPEG on the screen, nothing in AFrame though, is that the correct behaviour? @zubairq sorry try it now @sim3083 Ok, that works on my mac. I'll try IE11 later today @zubairq great cheers @sim3083  http://repo3.cfals.info/tram_supply/index2.html  works in Chrome from work network @sim3083  doesn't work from IE 11 on my work network @sim3083 I looked at the "View source" of the page  http://repo3.cfals.info/tram_supply/index2.html  but I couldn't see the extra IE code that I suggested you add though:

(function () {
    if ( typeof window.CustomEvent === "function" ) return false;
      function CustomEvent ( event, params ) {
       params = params || { bubbles: false, cancelable: false, detail: undefined };
       var evt = document.createEvent( 'CustomEvent' );
       evt.initCustomEvent( event, params.bubbles, params.cancelable, params.detail );
       return evt;
    }
    CustomEvent.prototype = window.Event.prototype;
    window.CustomEvent = CustomEvent;
})();
 @sim3083 Look at :+1: 

https://github.com/zubairq/visifile/blob/master/public/index.html

and copy the header and meta tags and also


			(function () {

                  if ( typeof window.CustomEvent === "function" ) return false;

                  function CustomEvent ( event, params ) {
                    params = params || { bubbles: false, cancelable: false, detail: undefined };
                    var evt = document.createEvent( 'CustomEvent' );
                    evt.initCustomEvent( event, params.bubbles, params.cancelable, params.detail );
                    return evt;
                   }

                  CustomEvent.prototype = window.Event.prototype;

                  window.CustomEvent = CustomEvent;
                })();


and also the sript

	es6-shim.js 

then it should work @zubairq Thanks for your efforts

I added the code and copied the aframe and es6 js files to my location gave it a go (at the same address) and it gave me the same errors as the ones I posted above (the long one) 

See if it works for you in IE11

S


 @sim3083 It's fine, I committed on the AFrame forum that I will try and get AFrame working with IE11 so I will stick by my word, as long as I know it is still possible

Can you update the example https://github.com/zubairq/visifile/blob/master/public/index.html
with the changes then I can test it and see what you have added. @sim3083 I mean can you update http://repo3.cfals.info/tram_supply/index2.html
 Already done @zubairq  @sim3083 Ok, super, I can test it in IE next week at work @sim3083 works fine for me now, on IE 11.0.9, what version of IE do you have and is it running in Edge mode? 11.0.9600.16428 

Is this through your work network? When I test it at work I get nothing and no errors, outside of work I get the errors from above

Can you also test the below link? It has some jquery overlays on it

http://simonbertoli.com/aaa/

 @sim3083 Yes, it was IE11 on work network with Win 7. I'll try the other link today. My suggestion is to try the link  http://repo3.cfals.info/tram_supply/index2.html on someone else's IE 11 Win 7 and Win 10 that you know so that you can debug it more easily @sim3083 The link http://simonbertoli.com/aaa/  does not work on IE11 in work network @zubairq both links on IE 11 Win 7 and Vista do not work for me outside of the network @sim3083 How many different IE11 physical PCs did you try the http://repo3.cfals.info/tram_supply/index2.html  link with?  I was getting a peerdep error without this update: https://travis-ci.org/kellyselden/aframe/jobs/241841600#L384-L386

I figure we aren't getting it yet here because we have a primed npm cache on travis. Yep, I should be able to submit that quick.  In response to https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2755#discussion_r121292464.

This makes running in node more happy and eliminates the need for this change https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2755/files#diff-97c6b758b49a87147586d2d87795312aR38.

cc @ngokevin Sounds good. I'll take a look. Also, if you can think of a test that would have caught this regression, I would be happy to include/write it.  similar to #2747 and #2752.

This is the last piece. After this, using aframe in node will only require a `global.window` mock.  Hello,
I think the sound example in the documentation is broken on master. It works perfectly on the 0.5.0 release but not on the latest commit of the master branch.

- A-Frame Version: master
- Platform / Device: Windows 10 - Firefox Nightly 
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/sound.html#preloading-a-sound-asset

When I do the exact same thing from the documentation on master, I have this error in the console:

> TypeError: Argument 1 of BaseAudioContext.decodeAudioData does not implement interface ArrayBuffer.

Thank you for reading this. This happens to me when I preload an audio file and then try to play the sound using .playSound(), but everything plays fine when the audio isn't preloaded and autoplay is set to true. I'm looking around in the source but I wanted to let you know in case that rang a bell for you. I know you guys reworked the way assets were cached between 0.5.0 and 0.6.0 Using `THREE.Cache` was added to resolve an issue where images were being downloaded more than once: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2472, but unfortunately I think this code doesn't work for audio (and possibly video, but I'm not sure).
If you set `preload=auto` in an `audio` element, then  `aframe` sticks the loaded audio _element_ into `THREE.Cache` once the browser finishes downloading the audio:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-assets.js#L165
Later when the `sound` component uses the `THREE.FileLoader` to load the audio, it pulls the audio element from the cache and throws the error @HAZARDU5 linked above:
```Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to execute 'decodeAudioData' on 'BaseAudioContext': parameter 1 is not of type 'ArrayBuffer'.```
(The loader returns the cache hit here: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/loaders/FileLoader.js#L42).
I think sticking the audio element into the `THREE.Cache` is a bug, because what we actually wanted in there was an `ArrayBuffer`, not an `HTMLElement`. A workaround is to use `a-asset-item` instead of an `audio` element inside of `a-assets`, and set the `response-type` to `arraybuffer`. That way, `a-asset-item` will load the audio using `THREE`'s file loader and the Cache will have an ArrayBuffer:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-assets.js#L109

e.g.            `<a-asset-item id="mySound" src="assets/audio/mySound.wav" response-type="arraybuffer"></a-asset-item>`

@ngokevin I suggest the documentation for the `sound` component be changed to reflect this too, because as-is, the preloading audio example does not work:
https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/components/sound.html#preloading-a-sound-asset
  
   @dmarcos I think we'd want to store an `arraybuffer`, but since the browser is the one loading the audio for an `audio` tag, I don't know of a way to get an `arraybuffer` out of the `audio` element. The `a-asset-item` workaround works because the `THREE.FileLoader` is makes an `XMLHttpRequest`, and that request is configured to return an arraybuffer: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/loaders/FileLoader.js#L253
   I also run into this bug (in 0.7.1) with preload="auto" and then trying to do audio.play() in a click handler (so that it activates the audio on mobile).

FWIW I'm able to use this workaround, based on @johnshaughnessy recommendation:

`<a-asset-item id="mySound" src="assets/audio/mySound.mp3" response-type="arraybuffer"></a-asset-item>`

Then instead of trying to do audio.play() in a click handler, I instead look up the element with the sound component and do: 
`soundEntity.components.sound.stopSound(); 
soundEntity.components.sound.playSound();`

From some reason the stopSound call is necessary for it to work on iOS (~11.2). @madebynoam Worked for ogg files in A-Frame 0.8.2 as well  **Description:**

Corrected the threejs URL in the documentation to point to the correct location

**Changes proposed:**
- Updated the documentation as proposed by @superjose here https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2733

The last commit is the only one needed. Missed one link in the first one.

  similar to #2747 Correct. I believe the main use case for aframe in node is to build the objects, not (yet) DOM manipulation.  I want to record a vr motion video of my house.
How can I do it?  * Enable the entity setAttribute API to accept partial updates of multi-property components when using a CSS-style property string
* Enable the use of the `clobber` flag under same scenario
* Remove single-use helper functions in a-entity for updating a single property of multi-property components
* Add unit tests and update a test where behavior changed

Details:

Previously, it was only possible to do partial updates when passing objects. Extending this behavior (and the clobber flag) to CSS-style strings requires differentiating those strings from simple property names, as a string in the second parameter could be either one.

This is handled by calling out to `utils.styleParser` and checking the return type, which is redundant to work done inside the component. This inefficiency could be reduced perhaps by reworking slightly the interface between the entity and component to pass the parsed result down; or a different mechanism of differentiation could be devised.

However, using strings in either capacity (CSS-style or the single property update form) is inherently a less efficient convenience for the object form, and their use should be discouraged when performance matters (e.g. `tick`).

The `clobber` flag (third parameter to setAttribute) behavior in this scenaro has now changed: previously, any time the second parameter was anything other than an object, `clobber` was treated internally as true. Now, CSS-style strings are treated the same as objects, where it defaults to false but is configurable by parameter.

This means that `el.setAttribute(‘myComponent’, ‘’)` previously would reset the component to its default values (because it was clobbering and not passing any new values). To get the same behavior as before, use `el.setAttribute(‘myComponent’, ‘’, true)`. One unit test was updated to reflect this change.

Finally, `entity.updateComponentProperty` has very little logic, is not a public API, and was only called by `setAttribute`; so it was simply merged in and its unit tests removed. Thanks for the feedback @dmarcos. I went ahead and amended your suggestions into the commit and then rebased it onto master.   It makes it easier to run in Node, because you have to provide these mocked globals before requiring aframe. For example: https://github.com/kellyselden/ember-aframe/blob/master/index.js#L15-L37  I also lean to the consolidation as it will future proof the api. On the other hand it breaks component with dependencies and may also conflict with anyone setting a config property of his own. Maybe you could call on all component writers to consult/prepare them @donmccurdy I think the point is to keep prototype pollution to a minimum. The property name could vary, for instance I was thinking of "meta" or something, but it doesn't really make a difference for me at least @machenmusik you're right and it probably won't. I did this PR at some point https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1437 . I lean more for a simple solution right now though as it would cover present needs. If more is needed in the future it can be provisioned then on top of the flag which would have minimal impact @donmccurdy if you mean being able to specify an alternative system for components, I'm also all in for that. It would make the effect components tidier @machenmusik postprocessing is covered adequately as it is right now. Systems always run after components and there can be only one system that finally outputs to canvas. So there are two lanes of order (components then system) and that's good enough.

The use case for more prioritization would be to have a screenshot system that would always run after the post processing system to record the final frame @machenmusik the screenshot component basically redraws the scene on its own so it's not very efficient and no post processing. On its good side it can draw into cubemaps and do 360 video.  Changes 1a45e04 and 7e459ed refactored the relationship of `entity.setAttribute`, `component.updateProperties`, and the responsibility of merging new attributes with earlier ones (provided a clobber isn’t explicitly requested).

The component now has that responsibility, but `entity.updateComponentProperty`, the function responsible for the updating of a single component property, still maintains logic that merges attribute values.

This change simplifes the logic of that method to only pass the new attribute down to the component, which will then perform the merge itself.

This isn’t likely to yield any performance improvements, because a new object is allocated either way and redundant copies were already protected against, but it makes the logic of these files more consistent.

See https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2729

**note** on my machine I am only able to run the tests in Firefox Hey @ngokevin, I haven't seen the intermittent failures reproduce on my machine, and I also just submitted a PR that touches this code again. When you get a chance I hope you can take a look (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2748) and provide feedback, and also let me know if you're still seeing failures?    system.update() is not called when system attributes are modified via the web inspector while setAttribute() works as expected.

- A-Frame Version: master
- Platform / Device: All  want to work assign me @ngokevin  Hi @amitsin6h, thanks for stepping up for this bug. Feel free to work on this bug and create a PR, if you have any questions you can ask on #issues slack channel of a-frame (https://aframe.io/community/#slack).  @ngokevin Are you just asking to change sources such as src/components/laser-controls.js to master/src/components/laser-controls.js, docs-v0.7.0/src/components/laser-controls.js, etc. in every doc page in all of the branches?  xirvr's gltf component has been merged in #2333  **Hi everyone! Just a quick note to change the urls for the Threejs website.:**

In here: 
- https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/components/material.md
- https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/material.html#standard

Urls have this form:
https://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Materials/ShaderMaterial

Threejs has this urls:
https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/ShaderMaterial


Apparently Threejs has renamed the #Reference for #api. 
 Woot. My bad. I messed up with the PR :/ sorry for that!!! I didn't want to commit anything. 

I just want to point out that in the aframe website the URLs from threejs seem off: 
https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/material.html#standard

If you look for "THREE.MeshStandardMaterial" you'll see that the URL points to a 404 Not found location. 

The hashtag "#Reference" has been swapped for "#api"

I'll reopen a new PR.  **Description:**

A-Frame crashes when having a cursor and a Collada model in the same scene, and looking at most parts of the model. For example [this model](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/9437690f-9220-4abd-8235-93e2296a0644/Iskren-Marinov-Comp) crashes A-Frame when looking at the paintings. Seems to be the same problem as [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40114053/collada-model-causes-a-frame-to-crash-when-panning-around).

- A-Frame Version: 0.5.0
- Platform / Device: Windows 10 [Same issue?](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2319)  Thanks for this fix! I was taking a look at it a few days back, and I noticed that `a-entity.updateComponentProperty` still performs property merging for the case of single property updates:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-entity.js#L551

This should be duplicated work now; instead of `extend`ing the previous `attrValue` object, `updateComponentProperty` could just call into `updateComponent` (which it already does) with a new simple object, `{[property]: propertyValue}`.

This is most likely a small amount of overhead, but it is something to think about if this area gets touched again. Sure thing! Check out https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2743  Description:

this.el.setAttribute('mixin' , '');
is throwing an error "'querySelector' on 'Element': 'a-mixin#' is not a valid selector."

 Ok, thanks for letting me know! I thought it was a nice added feature but I should've checked with you beforehand indeed. Hope I haven't wasted your time too much. Thanks!  **Description:**

By switching out models and lights dynamically in a scene, I have exposed an issue in the light component where a null reference exception occurs when creating a new spot or directional light where the target is already loaded.

`setLight` calls `getLight` which calls `onSetTarget`. `onSetTarget` expects `this.light` to be present, which works as long as the target is not loaded, since an event listener is set up in `getLight`, giving `this.light` time to get set in `setLight`. When the target is not loaded, however, `onSetTarget` is called immediately and `this.light` is undefined.

**Changes proposed:**
- Added tests to expose the issue
- Call `onSetTarget` with the new light to set the target on, instead of relying on `this.light`
- ~~Continue to also set target on `this.light` if present (this was necessary to get all tests passing, not sure why)~~
  I am try to rotate the 360 image using 
<a-animation attribute="rotation" fill="both" easing="linear" dur="40000" to="0 500 0" repeat="indefinite"></a-animation> it's working fine 
But inside 360 image I am using some of the icons and labels while I try to rotate the image the icons and labels are going out of the environment 

**Any one tell me that How to rotate the camera** ? Instead of rotating an Image

Thanks in advance 

 Add `id="camera"` to your `<a-camera>` element and do:

```js
document.getElementById('camera').setAttribute('rotation', '0 45 0');
``` Hello nwoltman
The above code is not working it just changes the image direction to "y" the camera is not get rotating 
I need an rotation like this https://livetour.istaging.com/57ecd104816dfa005668e914 and as well I need floor plan also how to do
Thanks in advance
 @Kumaresh-Rajalingam Yes the code I gave you is an example of how to rotate the camera to a specific rotation. I didn't realize you were asking how to do a rotation animation. Try following the [animations guide](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/core/animations.html) and use an `<a-animation>` inside your `<a-camera>`. There's also an A-Frame Slack channel where you can get more help: https://aframevr-slack.herokuapp.com/
There's always [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) as well. @nwoltman have you check the above link that I sent? I need an rotation like this   I have a use case where an object is switching from selectable to a non-selectable state. I do this by changing the class name from 'screen selectable' to just 'screen' (raycaster is set up with '.selectable' selector).  

It appears that the raycaster component does not react to class name changes, it only detects a change when an element is added or removed from DOM.

- A-Frame Version: 0.5.0 and current master @ngokevin I just think that this is not a corner or a rare case - changing a class name of an element so that it triggers (or does not trigger) a selector match. Why not do an extended check in the raycaster component (maybe just reacting on "class" attribute changes)? Is it a performance consideration?   The physical based rendering of A-Frame is limited because these values can only come from integers. Popular physical based pipelines like Substance Designer generate texture maps for diffuse, roughness, metalness, and normal. 

 I think it could still be valueable having it available for primitives and non-exported, here's why.

Even though i'm artist who's capable of using blender3d and exporting fancy models with fancy maps, a more simpler VR artist may only know how to use primitives and seamless repeatable textures.  Having roughnessMap and metalnessMap could allow seamless PBR textures for less skilled artists to create powerful materials on simple objects.   

I know it seems kind of crazy, but when I just started out as an artist in VR, all I could build with was cubes and spheres and simple cylinders that I scaled just so. It took me a long while to build up to being a 3d artist, but meanwhile I wanted every cool effect I could get away with on those primitives :)

 @dmarcos Yes sir.  Imagine an artist creating a library of PBR material sets (leather, rough metal, concrete, etc.)  Places like this exist already somewhat: http://freepbr.com/

Here's the program I personally use that is simplest, it allows you to drop on an image of a material, make it seamless, and adjust values to get correct roughness and metalness, then export the maps: 

https://www.allegorithmic.com/products/bitmap2material I agree that building with primitives is a good start as a gateway to working with Blender and more sophisticated modelling tools. 

 

I think there is a lot of room for expansion of basic primitive parameters in AFRAME, perhaps some sort of more universal primitive component would be valuable. 

 

If you are looking for ‘all of the effects’, what I think would be most interesting is if it was possible to support all the primitive parameters Second Life / OpenSimulator offer. ( which are documented here http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlSetPrimitiveParams ) . 

 

Some things that are missing from aframe that are useful in SL are things like path cut, hollow, twist, and shear. They also have flexible primitives. And the big thing I find missing from aframe is unique textures (and attributes such as shininess / roughness) on a per face basis. ( Of course there are some components with different properties, but none that are as far reaching as the above ). 

 

An aframe extended primitive component that had a 1:1 match for each of the Second Life / Opensim primitive parameters would open the door to bringing a lot of already created 3d content to the web.  

 

People make quite complex structures with these platforms and primitives because of the wide variety of deformations and attributes presented. AFRAME would benefit from supporting more of these.

 Absolutely agree @rob-lindman  I think one opportunity for A-frame is to make powerful features accessible to people who may only know HTML.  Having people use gltf, three.js materials, and even just the amount of time to break open a 3d editor to make something simple is pretty non-trivial for a large number of people.  Even myself, sometimes I just want to take a shortcut and use a simple primitive instead of busting open blender just to generate a cube, unwrapping, materializing, etc. Sometimes I just want a set of simple beautiful shapes I can play with seamless textures. @donmccurdy 

It's been my observances in VR that many artists tend to go through various phases:

1. building with rough solid colored objects
2. minecrafter types capable of assembling complex objects with basic primitives (guns made from blocks)
3. primitive tweakers who play with complex textures (usually seamless) to get an even more detailed object
4. 3d artists who can model, but they don't know how to render textures, and use basic textures on simple uv maps
5. 3d artists who can model and  render textures but not know how to do advanced shaders or baked effects
6. people who can do it all

This feature is for satisfying artists that fall into the type 3 and 4 category.  They've gathered enough skills to know textures are cool and want to know how to exploit them, but their 3D skills are lacking.  It's an important bridge zone because the cost of learning 3D modeling is generally VERY high. The artist looks for anything to keep their sanity with something beautiful while their skills advance. The emphasis usually is on seamless textures, alpha masks, texture repeats/offsets, when you have no capability to generate UVs of your models, people on the lower spectrum of 3d modeling capabilities rely upon the UV maps of your default primitives.

There's providers of seamless PBR textures out there and builders tend to learn from each other the tricks of their appropriate skill level.  Here's one such provider of material textures:

http://freepbr.com/

The only reason I suggest this feature is in the attempt to give low skilled people a cool effect in a manner that seemed in alignment with stuff that exists.  It's entirely possible a-frame doesn't not have interest in such lower capability artists and that's fine.  So please don't let me push this forward too far beyond the project owner's own interests.  Just offering one possibility of could be.

I think there's alot of ex-Second Lifers wondering if a-frame could be the basis of the next metaverse, and we're transferring our own experiences onto your project. Take from it what inspiration you like or not. =)
 An opinion:
A-Frame nominally supports THREE.MeshStandardMaterial so should support roughnessMap and metalnessMapsince as they're part of it
-OR-
give a warning that they're NOT supported. It took a few hours of experimentation to confirm this.

A use case:
My client wants shiny metals. My 3D artist works with Maya which, apparently, can't export shiny, and converting to glTF is not an option (their preferred format is fbx, which is proving to be a nightmare).

Again, after experimentation I found a workaround, by applying them to the underlying object3D with JavaScript. This seems to be unnecessary friction.

Unless it's onerous to implement, isn't it better to have something and not need it, than not have something and need it?

In time, glTF will likely be widely supported, but unfortunately that's not the case now. Shouldn't A-Frame try to support existing formats and properties as well as possible to minimise friction with the limited tools we have available to us?

Thanks.
 Yes, I realise that materials can't be applied to models (as I found out the hard way).

The fbx issues are a bit of a red herring, my real problem is not being to apply metalness and roughness maps to an obj.

Converting would add at least two steps to the process (almost certainly more) and they're not prepared to do that as their current pipeline works fine, nor do we have the time.

I've tried various conversion tools but none worked.

Yes, fbx is a nightmare, but that's what I was given initially. Now, we're using obj.

@ngokevin 
hi, I'm using MeshStandardMaterial's features. :)
Is it THAT easy to write a component for MeshStandardMaterial? @donmccurdy what's your workflow? How is it with shiny metal? The problem in the thinking in this thread is people seem to only imagine
two users of aframe:

3d noobs who should be content with phong

Uber 3d artists who should all convert their assets to the format flavor of
the month.  **Description:** Raycaster component caches raycatching objects by querying for them, then storing them on a property. However, this cache is [only updated/invalidated when an element is added/removed](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/6511a237a9c762347fbc65c3bcf98b2772691c24/src/components/raycaster.js#L41).

 I ran into this corner case when adding/removing the classname I'm using to mark elements for raycatching. Of course, adding and removing the class will not trigger the `child-attached` event and so the cache will remain incorrect.

**What should happen:** ideally, raycatching should happen on elements that have that class _at time of intersection_.

The caching of this DOM query looks to be a performance optimization. Do we know if the DOM query is actually a bottleneck here?

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 Also, stray thought: we should be able to filter out entities with `visible: false` by default, right? That seems reasonable. Thanks!  I've written [ambient declarations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html) for a-frame in order to provide type support for TypeScript. I created a ticket a few months ago (DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#11696) to track interest and recently I've been asked to merge these typings in to a standard place for consumption.

It would be great to include TypeScript support w/ A-Frame. This doesn't require any code to be rewritten, just include [a .d.ts file like this](https://github.com/devpaul/aframe-typings/blob/master/src/AFRAME.d.ts) as part of the release and add some tests to exercise the typings against A-Frame.

Benefits include:

1. IDE support via intellisense and better code completion for A-Frame and it's dependencies (e.g. Three.js) (this is great for new users)
1. Eliminates common errors stemming from typos and misuse
1. Including in A-Frame would keep typings current w/ releases
1. Zero runtime const (ambient declarations are not part of executed code)
1. Better support for Angular and TypeScript users

By including typings w/ A-Frame, TypeScript users will immediately have types available and it would have no effect on non-TypeScript users.

I'm happy to answer any questions. If there's enough interest I'll submit a PR. I forgot to mention, if people would like to experiment w/ current ambient declarations there's a boilerplate here: https://github.com/devpaul/ts-dojo-aframe-boilerplate > If the .d.ts file will have to be updated by hand regardless, then I think it would be better to maintain it outside of this repo — none of us are using TS here, and it's likely to go stale.

I think this is the key point. If there's sufficient community support then it's worthwhile to add typings as part of A-Frame. If support and upkeep may be an issue then it's OK as a separate project. The biggest drawback to this is the release of typings wouldn't be tied to A-Frame, which isn't huge if the community isn't yet there.

> A-Frame's API is also primarily through the DOM

I love A-Frame's usage of the DOM. Typings would lower the barrier to entry as users start working directly with elements or writing custom components. Having Threejs typings for `object3d` and the other more complex dependencies of A-Frame has helped me quite a bit.

> If typings were in the repo, how are they served?

Bundled typings are indicated via a `types` entry in `package.json` that points to a file (e.g. aframe.d.ts) distributed with the package. Docs: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html

> By adding typings to the repo, do we get any advantage for maintaining them

When we added [typings to Dojo](https://github.com/dojo/typings) we identified a number of bugs in the code and tests that didn't correctly test the code. We did this by writing a script to convert our tests to ESM module format and then used TypeScript to compile the tests against the typings we created by hand.

> could typings be generated from our JSDoc automatically?

While there are [projects](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsd-jsdoc) out there that attempt this, I wouldn't recommend it. The main benefit of adding typings to a project like A-Frame is to lower the barrier to intermediate development when users start writing custom entities and components and need to deal w/ threejs or other dependencies. Automated solutions aren't typically very good at linking to external projects (good linkers are hard to write).

> If we can automate the typings here in a way that wouldn't be possible in another repo

If typings are published in DefinitelyTyped they'll be available as a separate package. TypeScript users could install it via `npm i @types/aframe`. The biggest drawbacks here is the release of types will lag A-Frame and since typings are separate their versions are not tightly coupled. A major API change and a lagged release of typings will stall TypeScript users from using the latest A-Frame.

But everything is trade-offs, right? If there's enough community support to warrant adding typings to A-Frame, or there enough of a benefit to A-Frame to include them, then we should. Until there's an overwhelming call for it I'm happy to publish typings in DefinitelyTyped.  I've set up two simple test cases:

1) 1000 planes are rendered via `a-plane` tag
2) 1000 plane geometries are added via `new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.PlaneGeometry(1, 1))` and then `scene.add(plane)`

On my PC performance in roughly the same when the camera is still ~ 80 fps. However when I start dragging the mouse to rotate the camera the 1st test case shows a performance drop to 15fps, while the 2nd renders the same 80 fps.

Moving camera with wasd controls does not cause fps to drop.

What could be the reason for this performance drop?

The scene doesn't have a cursor, so I guess this cannot be caused by raycaster checking collisions.

- A-Frame Version: 0.5.0 and current master was tested  @ngokevin Thank you, actually, the issue is connected to react or aframe-react which I'm using, I will file an issue in the proper place  Is this issue still being worked on? Hi @rttomlinson, thanks for stepping up for this bug I dont think anyone is working on this. Feel free to work on this bug and create a PR, if you have any questions you can ask on #issues slack channel of a-frame (https://aframe.io/community/#slack).  I see that @rttomlinson has considered working on this and probably still is.  I am a new contributor to open source projects and would like to get involved.  Considering this is still an open issue, can I work on it as well?

Thanks! Hi Jiel,

 Thanks @rttomlinson.  There has been a commit that I referenced that looks as if the issue has been solved, so before I start I would like to hear from someone from the A-Frame team so I can perhaps get working on another issue.  If I have any questions though, I will definitely ask! Thanks for clarifying @dmarcos, I appreciate it!  **Description:**

This uses the [googlevr/webvr-polyfill] directly again instead of the aframe fork after talking with @dmarcos on what things needed to be fixed to eliminate the need for Aframe to maintain their own fork, in addition to general support and communication from us on the polyfill end. Did lots of triaging this week and cleared out some low hanging fruit in addition to:

* [support Android Webview in polyfill](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/issues/114)
* [Syncing the dpdb with polyfill, and consolidating all information regarding the dpdb](https://github.com/webvrrocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb)
* [Clearing out PRs that were in aframe fork and not in the master](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/commit/d873027a71d07f3d2154fa599d49764a515c73e3)

There are outstanding issues in the polyfill, of course, so please let me know if you're aware of any bad bugs and to help out with priority, because Aframe is by far the biggest consumer of the polyfill (I'm guessing, anyway), so try it out and let me know if there's anything else on our end needed to no longer need a fork.

Thanks! @dmarcos thanks! Let me know if there's any questions or anything I can do on the polyfill end to help We found a nasty bug in Chrome for Android when native WebVR is enabled (either via origin trial or chrome://flags) where `getVRDisplays()` hangs, resulting in the polyfill never kicking in, same issue as #2444 I believe. [The patch](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/pull/248) is still up for review, but would love to get a build out and get this in aframe 0.6.0 since it seems like this will break easily as more enable origin trials
 Bumped PR to use `0.9.34` which includes patch from https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2700#issuecomment-305359753 Changing the polyfill from @dmarcos ' branch to the official version 0.9.34 completely break VR presentation on the Rift and Vive in Chrome WebVR June 6 build. When I click the button to enter VR, it goes fullscreen and picks up the position from the HMD, but it doesn’t do the usual “split-screen” view and the HMD is black.  I haven't tested with Firefox.

I have resolved this for myself by making a branch where this specific commit is reverted, but I haven't done a PR for the revert, as I expect the team would rather investigate the issue and get A-Frame working properly with the official polyfill version. Thanks for the heads up, @RSpace. Creating a bug on webvr-polyfill, dug into this a bit   Yeah, multi-language docs need integrates into the docs  **Description:**
Testing the A-Frame demos with a Sony Z3C, Firefox for Android 53.0.2 crash with VR effect
Testing the demos from the WebVR polyfill, same Firefox works nice. The VR effect from original polyfill looks great in FF for Android

- A-Frame Version:
v0.5.0
- Platform / Device:
Firefox For Android in Sony Z3 Compact
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:
A-Frame demos
 I'm trying with the three.js examples, but I see a message saying my broswer does'nt support WebVR for the webvr section examples (same for chrome). There's no crashes
With the Google's WebVR polyfill examples, FF for android works very nice. There's no crashes
The VR effect works fine from A-Frame demos in Chrome

So... there is this bug filed Mozilla's Bugzilla https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1340876. I attached a video with the crash here All the no webvr examples works, no crashes :-)  Webvr crashes on everything I'm using except Chromium. Chromium just won't launch into VR but has a never ending loading. NVidea 1080ti on Win10. I don't expect to hear back since I've been complaining since Monday.  In Nightly for Android (Sony Z3C), there is no way to get the VRDisplay, so the WebVR is not so VR Solved now with version 0.6.1  Just a note that I recently used the gltf 2.0 exporter for blender and found using the core `gltf-model` component doesn't work currently, subsequently found this thread.

Has there been any work on getting the 2.0 spec working with `gltf-model` yet? @sirkitree You can use `gltf-model-next` from @donmccurdy 's A-Frame Extras package https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/loaders/gltf-model-next.js I feel Blender's glTF2 exporter more stable than the old one, I think people will have less troubles with glTF2 and will not need COLLADA at all. Also, the development of the exporter is very active and I think @UX3D-nopper will respond promptly.

My only concern is that right now you have to use special material nodes that aren't included in Blender to make it work. I don't know how clear this will be to newcommers, I'll check this issue out. Khronos will sooner or later get in touch with the Blender community. Goal is to integrate the glTF 2.0 exporter into the offical Blender repository.
Another goal is, to replace the current material nodes with an internal Blender node, that the mentioned confusion is eliminated. Optimal would be a "glTF 2.0 node" inside Blender, which is using Eevee.  **Description:**

Following links on the web to create a component, I landed on the [angle npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angle). About halfway down the page, there is a link to the writing a component documentation that is broken. The link reads "how to write a component".

**Suggestion:**

The link should be replaced with this `https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/introduction/writing-a-component.html`

  It would be great to have a way to render a text on a background with some padding around it.

I’ve tried an example from docs, however, it seems that auto width mode actually sets the maximum width of the container, leaving the gap on the right:

<img width="616" alt="screen shot 2017-05-18 at 14 31 53" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1079094/26206794/cc6a5788-3bf6-11e7-9c35-2aa398a22657.png">

What I would like to achieve is an ability to render a label with some background around it (similar to Bootstrap labels for example)

Here is a hacky solution that I came up with:

```javascript
import AFRAME from 'aframe';


const fontWidthFactor = 1000;

AFRAME.registerComponent('text-auto-width', {
    dependencies: ['text'],
    schema: {
        padding: {default: 0}
    },
    init() {
        // Hook into text component's updateLayout method
        const textComponent = this.el.components.text;

        const textMesh = this.el.object3D.children[1];

        if (textMesh.geometry.layout) {
            resize(textMesh.geometry.layout);
        } else {
            const origUpdate = textComponent.updateLayout;

            textComponent.updateLayout = (data) => {
                origUpdate.call(textComponent, data);

                resize(textMesh.geometry.layout);
            };

        const resize = (layout) => {
            const {value, width} = this.el.getAttribute('text');

            const metrics = layout.computeMetrics(value, 0, value.length, Math.INT_MAX);

            const actualWidth = metrics.width * width / fontWidthFactor + this.data.padding * 2;

            const geometry = this.el.getAttribute('geometry');

            this.el.setAttribute('geometry', {...geometry, width: actualWidth});
        }
    }
});
``` @ngokevin `align: center` has nothing to do with auto sizing, it will render container with the same width +1 for text padding @eng1neer did you end up finding a solution to this? I tried using the code you posted but I get "TypeError: textMesh is undefined"  Avoid memory allocation produced by string.split() in setAttribute function, which is called in the RAF after each TWEEN update animation   **Description:**

- A-Frame Version: 0.5.0

- Platform / Device: Windows 10
- Browser: Chromium
- Reproducible guideline: Just open the visual inspector on a computer where the icon font is not installed.

On the top on the right side, I could see three buttons for translate, rotate and scale. But I couldn't see the icons. I've seen that the inpector using this code:

```html
<a title="translate" class="button fa fa-arrows active"></a>
<a title="rotate" class="button fa fa-repeat"></a>
<a title="scale" class="button fa fa-expand"></a>
```

So I'm thinking that the icon font you're using is missing in the inspector. The icon font _(probably font awasome I think)_, is not installed on my computer.

  When a camera is set to active=false, it should call pause() on itself.

Currently a camera with look-controls will still move in response to mouse movements even when it is not the active camera.  This can be strange/problematic because then when you switch back to the look-control'ed camera it will be pointing in some random direction, since it's been controlled according to onscreen mouse movement even while inactive.

[Related?](https://github.com/bryik/aframe-bmfont-text-component/issues/28) I thought the cause might be the use of highp precision in the SDF shader because [MDN says highp may not work on old phones](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/WebGL_best_practices). The phones in both of these issues have similar GPUs (Mali-400). On Chrome 58 on a Pixel, this is the result for me

Touching Daydream touchpad causes `TypeError cannot read property 'length' of undefined`. Because of this TypeError, I also seem not to get `axismove` or `trackpadmoved` events.

This is apparently a bug that @dmarcos is familiar with because I was able to [find a fix he landed to try to work around it](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/2827f9c49934e9b11206bb8bdf1bcb0a82d618dc/src/components/tracked-controls.js#L296). I gather the empty touches array was added in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2537 to avoid this problem, but somehow `touches` doesn't seem to make it on to the event? Here is the exact content of the `touchstart` event fired from the Daydream trackpad (captured in Chrome remote devtools):

```
CustomEvent {isTrusted: false, detail: Object, type: "touchstart", target: a-entity, currentTarget: Window…}
bubbles: true
cancelBubble: false
cancelable: false
composed: false
currentTarget: null
defaultPrevented: false
detail: Object
eventPhase: 0
isTrusted: false
path: Array(6)
returnValue: true
srcElement: a-entity
target: a-entity
timeStamp: 128821.66500000002
type: "touchstart"
__proto__: CustomEvent
```

Changing https://github.com/aframevr/webvr-polyfill/blob/master/src/touch-panner.js#L48 to read

```javascript
TouchPanner.prototype.onTouchStart_ = function(e) {
  if (e.touches) {
    // Only respond if there is exactly one touch.
    if (e.touches.length != 1) {
      return;
    }
    this.rotateStart.set(e.touches[0].pageX, e.touches[0].pageY);
    this.isTouching = true;
  }
};
```

does solve the problem. After vendoring aframe and hacking that in, I get no more errors, and `axismove` and `touchmoved` events all work.

I am using a-frame master from just a couple hours ago. @machenmusik note this change wont fix it, since `touches` is still referenced without a check below https://github.com/chenzlabs/webvr-polyfill/commit/87130ae1ffb8d5c33fe78dc10ea4a0da279eb173#diff-4c2e10343ad71eef9d298507c2d3dcadR48 @machenmusik oh oops, looks like we both just created a PR https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/pull/228 @machenmusik should I also submit a PR to aframevr/webvr-polyfill? @machenmusik oh dang, good point. I'm ok to go with either PR. If yours will produce a cleaner merge history then so much the better. @machenmusik let's just use yours if it has the cleaner commit history. Interesting... just pulled up https://webvr.yoga on Daydream and I don't get the same TouchPanner touchstart TypeError.

https://webvr.yoga is using https://github.com/ryanbetts/aframe-daydream-controller-component rather than the daydream-controls component in `master` so there are likely to be differences.  I want to play 360 live stream video come from webrtc client, how? Thank you detail feedback. A quesiton, what your "normal video streaming" mean? I just want to play live 360 stream by Webrtc, I dont know how to use aframe to render that live 360 video. In demo code, only play the local video file.  **Description:**
As of ~11:30CST May 9, the latest a-frame inspector min.js as retrieved from unpkg.com e.g. by the A-Painter demo is now throwing errors whenever an entity is selected which has a material component with a src or other map (or asset?) property.  The error manifests as a "e.match is not a function" js error in an obscurely nested minified block in which e appears to be the actual parsed asset object, and the function appears to be attempting to re-parse it as a URL or asset ID, e.g. comparing "#"===e[0] and then looking it up as a # id if true, or attempting to parse it as a URL (using string .match) if false.

As a side-effect, many inspector fields for map/asset properties now show as empty boxes with [object] as the source, rather than as previews with the corresponding asset #id as the source.

Edit: in fact, upon further experiments with debugging off, the errors derail the whole Inspector and Scene refresh flow to the point where any material updates in the inspector become impossible.  Definitely a priority bug, I would think.

 a variety of other issues, likely related, also show up, some suggesting a corrupted/misfiled canvas context, others that sound like somewhere that _is_ expecting a valid parsed object are instead getting some earlier state e.g. a raw string, although I am having difficulty isolating deterministic repro steps.  Clicking between entities with different types of shader, or with and without materials, seems to re-trigger most types of error, somewhat arbitrarily.

 Just found the inspector's independent github.  Would it be worth closing this out here and re-opening it there, or is it already being ingested for action?

Edit: A locally-linked (e.g. inspector="url: scripts/aframe-inspector.min.js" in the scene tag) inspector latest-zip-downloaded from the inspector github does not, at least initially, appear to be exhibiting this issue, so it may be tangled up in how the latest-version auto-URL is being resolved.  However, latest listed _release_ does appear to be 0.5.2, which looks like what is being remotely loaded, so... no explanation as of yet :-P

Edit 2: locally-sourced 0.5.2 just threw the match error.  crisis not averted.  Hi, how can I load the model like this?

  There's distortion on the top and bottom of the 360 image 

Here's the screenshots from the A-frame demo:
http://imgur.com/a/0Fd0K

Any idea how to fix it? Hi @dmarcos ,

The distortion isn't caused by an artifact of the camera. The reason is because the experience we are building uses 360 rendered images, and have being reproduced on another viewer (made with Unity) with no artifact.

Here are the comparison:
viewer built with Aframe with artifact:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7750800/25828518/8dabff90-341e-11e7-9b2b-1175ea62e0c9.png)

viewer built with Unity without the artifact using the same image:

 @machenmusik We are using 0.5.0 for this project.

@dmarcos Here's the link to our test demo we are building
https://beta.babylonvr.ca/viewer

For comparison, here's the exact same image we used but with react VR, they somehow fixed the problem
http://test1.babylon360.com/vr/

 I think Pannellum gets around this kind of distortion by ["using an exact mathematical mapping from an equirectangular image to a rectilinear view"](https://github.com/mpetroff/pannellum/issues/142). Implementing [this](https://github.com/mpetroff/pannellum/blob/master/doc/pannellum-equirectangular-projection-reference.pdf) looks pretty difficult...cube maps are an easier solution. @machenmusik The codepen uses a video as a source, which seem to work, but I can't get it working with a photo even at higher detail @machenmusik 
I tried it with a flickr 360 photo
http://codepen.io/starwaver/pen/MmVQKp Here's the same photo uploaded on facebook with no distortion
https://www.facebook.com/starwaver/posts/10211510609455389 @dmarcos 
Many consumer cameras take non-power of 2 photos which I think is problem for apps that are photo galleries. I think it would be helpful to enable it.  We tried it and apparently uploading a power of 2 photo doesn't help, but adding npot:true does seem to fix it.

Also sphere segment doesn't seem to affect it much, but higher segment does drop the performance quite a bit. Nice catch @machenmusik, `npot:true` is a significant improvement!

![npot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12419712/25978884/1a9f4c88-3693-11e7-82b6-654295b2fc0d.jpg)
 @machenmusik but why npot:true also significantly improve this issue on a 4096x2048 image. Is it already a power of 2 image?  **Description:**

 This doesn't occur on master.  Is this one dead? well, we got #3176 merged successfully, but #2830 didn't make it, and there seems to be understandable negative feedback on accommodating browser specific quirks in core.  Safari tech preview should finally fix their ancient CORS problem, so that particular aspect shouldn't be required going forward at least.

@dmarcos @ngokevin @donmccurdy thoughts? sidebar: @cvan let me know what you think of the example in #3210 that has multiple sources and HLS, along with some crude click-to-play scripting per the above  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43774660/aframe-remove-texture

The issue is that removing a texture either doesn't work, or creates a "black" surface. You can see the code pen: https://codepen.io/msj121/pen/JNrWxg

```
//Neither work:
sphere.setAttribute("src","");
sphere.setAttribute('material', {src: ''});
```

Uses: https://aframe.io/releases/0.5.0/aframe.min.js

 These don't work either:

```js
entity.removeAttribute('src');
entity.removeAttribute('material', 'src');
```

---

Also, if I have an entity that looks like this:

```jsx
<a-sky shader="flat" src="/image.jpg"></a-sky>
```

This works:

```js
entity.setAttribute('material', {}, true); // `shader` and `src` go back to their defaults
```

But this doesn't work:


```js
entity.setAttribute('material', {shader: 'flat'}, true);
```

So it seems like `src` doesn't get removed if the `shader` property doesn't change. Looks like this is fixed in v0.6.x  I want to work on this Hi @BhuvanaMeenakshi, I wasn't sure if you had a chance to take a look at this yet. It was in an area I recently studied so I thought I'd give it a go. Seeking feedback. Yes @gregfagan you may proceed!   i have an object i want to go from state A to state B and stay there while being triggered by mouseenter, thing is it keeps rerunning the animation when you re enter the shape, is there any way to kill the trigger once the animation ends?

<a-animation easing="ease-in-out" begin="mouseenter" attribute="scale" dir="normal" dur="2000" to="1 40 1" repeat="0" delay="1000" ></a-animation>
 @shikuru  You can remove event handler which is responsible for starting an animation on animation end.

```
<a-scene>
      <a-image id="obj" src="xyz.jpg" position="0 0 -10" height="6" width="9" scale="1 1 1">
             <a-animation attribute="position" from="0 0 -10" to="-5 0 -10" begin="startAnim" dur="1000" fill="forwards">
      </a-image>
</a-scene>
```

---------------Javascript-----------------

```
var startAnimListener = function(){
   document.querySelector('#obj').emit('startAnim');
}

var removeAnimListener = function(){
    document.querySelector("#obj").removeEventListener("mouseenter", startAnim);
}
document.querySelector("#obj").addEventListener("mouseenter", startAnimListener);
document.querySelector("#obj").addEventListener("animationend", removeAnimListener);
```  I was trying to implement aframe wrapper around threejs ObjLoader2 (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/loaders/OBJLoader2.js) and found an issue when an asset defined in a-assets tag and then used by ObjLoader2 was cached in a text format while the loader was requesting it as an ArrayBuffer:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/v0.5.0/src/core/a-assets.js#L102

Loader received a string when it was expecting ArrayBuffer.

Other loaders from threejs examples may be affected too.

Thank you for creating this coding language. I did learn three.js a few years ago and it was a monster. This should seriously be part of HTML specs. Amazing work. I can't thank you all enough. 

I'm posting here because it seems logical even though it could be considered a help issue. I have noticed on codepen that all of the experiments in AFrame stop dead at any interactivity. So, the assimilation and saturation is huge when just adding elements to a static scene. But once a person tries to add interactivity such as look here and teleport or click this and change that support falls apart. Suddenly it's assumed that one has years of programming experience or even has time to study it just to make simple interactivity. If I had to spend hours trying to learn back end languages in order to create an href tag I never would have become a web designer in 1991. 

So, my request is a code snippet section in GitHub. For instance, I borrowed simple code and read the docs and figured this out: 


To Teleport.

Header code:
```
<script>
  AFRAME.registerComponent('set-camera', {
    schema: {default:''},
    init() {
      const camera = document.querySelector('a-camera');
      this.el.addEventListener('click', () => {
       camera.setAttribute('position', this.data);
      });
    }
  });
</script> 
```

HTML code:

`<a-sphere color="#F44336" set-camera="0 2 -189"></sphere>`

To Set rotation:

Header Code:

```
<script>
AFRAME.registerComponent('set-rotation', {
    schema: {default:''},
    init() {
      const camera = document.querySelector('a-camera');
      this.el.addEventListener('click', () => {
       camera.setAttribute('rotation', this.data);
      });
    }
  });
</script>
```

HTML
`
<a-sphere set-rotation="0 90 0"></sphere>`

and on and on. Please add simple scripts as a link to aframe.io and examples. 

This will speed adoption much faster I believe. I am in the process of completely learning everything now because of what aframe can do. I believe once people can add interactivity it will inspire those that want to program at a higher level. Does this make sense? 
 Thanks, Kevin. This is fantastic stuff. This was the issue I was having
that I didn't realise these components did that. If the event component was
part of the docs in a way for one would see that as the next step. So,
build a static environment, add interactivity by including this specific
component. Maybe drill down in a blog post about how the simpler component
using events was programmed so that someone could follow the logic. My fear
is that many web designers see javascript includes as walled gardens and
can't even figure out how the code actually works.

I am having an issue with the other link you sent me. I downloaded the
GitHub folder and found that the files are not in a position in relation to
the index.html pages.I assume it's a GitHub thing. I'll figure it out.

If you are ever in Denver look me up. Do you know anyone doing this work
here in Denver?

I'm also looking at starting a WebVR Meetup here and possibly just promote
A-Frame if I don't have any ReactVR fans locally. Thoughts on this idea?

Thanks again for a truly awesome tool.

 I will check out the school. Thanks. I'm working on this at the moment:
http://cablecenter.org/vr/chof2017/

I've used your events component for interactivity and it makes life simple
for sure. The only one complete is Steve Burke at the very beginning. If
you click on his picture it brings up text and videos. Off line the videos
work great but online the second video doesn't show up but does play. On
Android phones it doesn't play.

As you can see I'm not afraid of code and hack entire blocks of it to get
what I want. I do need to slow down, go back and cover the basics. I guess
this is how I learn, I jump in and realise what I don't understand later.

It looks like I need a true preloader for the videos and audio. The audio
intro gets messed up because of the video loading I believe.

I know someone has done experiments with YouTube videos and Mr. Doob had
examples a while back on adding YouTube videos three.js but this may be an
issue for me. I have 20 years x 6 videos that I wanted to add into the
exhibit. Ambitious, yah, maybe even crazy.

Still, this is what I have been waiting for. I'd be happy to help out in
any way I can. If you know anyone that I can pay to help with the video
aspects and preloading I do have a budget.

The events component is great. I'm wondering if the event component can do
animation? I see that event-set__8="_event: click; _target: #myitem;
position: 0 2 4;" But could I do aniamtion somehow like
event-set__8="_event: click; _target: #mycamera; animation.to: 0 2 4;"?

Thanks again!

  well not really a typo tho

changes gearvr-controls in the example code to daydream-controls  **Description:**
I cloned a version of 360-image-gallery-boilerplate onto my computer and modified it to have 15 panoramas. On the iPad mini (Safari), when I switch between new photospheres (going to photospheres that I have not been to already), the experience gets slower and slower until it forces the tab to reload. This doesn't happen when going to previously visited photospheres.

I am currently working on a panorama viewer built with Aframe and some homes that we use have more than 40 panoramas. I have put together the example described above based on 360-image-gallery-boilerplate to see if it has to do with my code or with Aframe.

Could it be that there is some kind of memory leak caused by the updating of the material src attribute?

Thanks,

 `Texture.dispose()` didn't seem to work for me. I seemed to still be getting a memory leak. I ended up doing something like this instead:

``` javascript
let material = this.el.components.material.material;
if (!material.map) {
  material.map = new THREE.TextureLoader().load(src);
} else {
  material.map.image.src = src;
  material.map.needsUpdate = true;
}
```

I noticed that `THREE.TextureLoader` creates a new `THREE.Texture` object every time `el.setAttribute('src', src)` is called. This was creating a leak on the GPU as `gl.texImage2D` were accumulating. It's for this reason, I guess, that we need to call `Texture.dispose()`. But even when I call it, the memory leak occurs but at a slower rate. Setting the source this way `material.map.image.src = src` removed the memory leak completely.

Wouldn't it be more streamlined if `el.setAttribute('src', src)` would instantiate a `THREE.TextureLoader` only the first time it is set and afterward just change the image src?

Thanks again This is still an issue. I observed the same thing going on in AFRAME 0.8.2. I get the impression that the textures are not being disposed when the src attribute of a component is updated.  For example, let's say that a button is clicked and a `<img>` is appended to the `<a-assets>` at runtime, is this supported? I would like to use `<a-assets>` caching capabilites but not preload all my assets at page load.
  Checking look-controls-enabled before adding a-grabbing class to body.

Ref - https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2633 ```js
if (!this.data.enabled) { return; }
```  
 at beginning might be a little cleaner. A related issue that can tackle is that there is still the open hand grab-cursor in `init` being added even if not enabled which don't want so would need to only do if `enabled`. Created new PR - https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2642/files Cool. 
One more thing.. the deferred `sceneEl.addEventListener('render-target-loaded', enableGrabCursor);` also needs to be only be called if enabled so could put the check around both if & else.  **Current Behavior:** When the `src` attribute of an `<a-videosphere>` is changed, the difference is reflected in the DOM only.
**Expected Behavior:** When the `src` attribute of an `<a-videosphere>` is changed, the new video asset should be rendered.

```videosphere.setAttribute('material', 'shader: flat; color: #ffffff; src: '+data.src);``` It appears that changing the `material` attribute (even without the shader property) works while changing the `src` attribute does not.

```
videosphere.setAttribute('src', '#video'); // NO CHANGE
videosphere.setAttribute('material', 'src: #video;'); // SUCCESS

In my application I would like to remove the *look controls* and set some custom behaviours.

I removed controls from the camera as display below but I can still see the grab-cursor while clicking/dragging the scene.

 Created PR : https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2637 Created new PR - https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2642/files  I'm developing a Vocaloid viewer with a-mmd.js and ar.js but is not possible to reuse my entities twice not even removing it from the scene.

I hope the music and vmd file is reloaded, but only the mmd file is loaded again.

What I'm doing wrong?
 Hi. Both options create an entity with different attributes, but first remove the entity created with the other option (if exist), the problem is that I can't create an entity again with the same attributes after it has been removed with the other option. OK, I could solve it, the problem is that by default it is called THREE.Cache.enabled = true, that seems to prevent the reuse of textures, audio, images etc ... once they were already used and removed from the entity. Would not it be more practical to keep it disabled (I don't know if it could be better to save memory) or to pass a method to configure the cache in Three.js? I mean, prevent reinitialization of entities. I don't have a simple example (with codepen as example) but you can check my use case in my repo https://github.com/kurai021/aframe_demos, open ar_vocaloid example. Disabling cache I can reuse sounds and textures without cloning the entity, And I guess could be better for memory but bad for network as you say  Added a warning in registerPrimitive when the user has provided mappings keys that are not all lower case. Since the DOM reports all element attributes in lower case (regardless of how the user typed them in the HTML source), the mappings keys must also be lower case.

This issue was discussed here
  https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2629
A separate PR was previously accepted to update the documentation to mention that mappings are case-sensitive.

**Description:**

**Changes proposed:**

 switched from console.warn to warn() and added braces around if. I hope it's OK (but please take a quick look - I'm not such a genius with javascript)  
The keys in the "mappings" struct in registerprimitive are case-sensitive and must be lower case to work.
This is totally non-obvious. 

Could you either add a mention about this in the doc page 
  https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/primitives/#register-a-primitive

or resolve this in primitives.js.  I think that the DOM is returning the element attribute names using either lower case or whichever case the user happened to use, but there are a number of instances like "mappings[attr]" which is a case-sensitive lookup between the DOM attribute and the mapping name.

There is something about camelCase in addComponentMapping but it's not clear to me what this is.

 thanks!   I understand the reason behind not letting to change material properties of entities with MTL materials assigned (there may be several materials in one MTL etc.) but isn't it useful to be able to turn the model wireframe or change polygon rendering mode from to double-sided? At the moment visual inspector lets you change material properties but none of them take effect.

Besides this general question, is there a way to change the underlying material that was loaded from .MTL?

 @ngokevin Thank you. What about the first part of a question? Can it be considered a feature-request?  Hello,

some examples are linked to Glitch only where I'm not able to read clear license for the examples.
I prefer to use Github for local development and where I can find a clear license ( MIT ).

Is it possible to have all examples on Github too if someone like me do not want to use Glitch?

Thank you.
  Pointerlock would be really valuable for me, I'd be glad to help with the implementation!

Pointerlock on focus seems most natural to me. Mousedrag is a drag D; What if there are multiple Aframe scenes on a page, or lots of other content on the site to scroll through? The only other situation I can think of is if there is lots of content at the top of a page and an A-Frame scene at the bottom. The user could be confused as to why there is no pointer.

I am all for Pointer Lock, though. What is the current third-party component? I like this idea and think this really should be in by default.  It's painful to develop by dragging the mouse cursor around and really doesn't provide that great of an experience for desktop users checking out aframe experiences.

I know there exists some modules out there that kinda have done this, but they are flakey and unmaintained.  **Description:**

Aframe  image sky  display quality and the original agreement？  ... so there is no way to actually pass in empty string in distinguishable fashion (e.g. `{type:'string', default:undefined}` doesn't work since empty string BECOMES undefined)

codepen example http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/XRjYBO

note that it doesn't actually matter whether type is string or omitted entirely. use case: Vive tracker has `OpenVR ` id prefix, and empty string for hand.  this bug makes it impossible to actually pass in empty string to `hand` in `tracked-controls` to match properly.  see undesirable workaround in vive-tracker PR #2583  i am using videosphere on my project and have noticed high CPU usage in pc, usually causing heavy lags and on mobile, the mobile heats up really quickly and there is quick battery discharge due to this. is there any fix?

    two questions to start:

what browser and os?
what font, and msdf or sdf?
 looks like the msdf shader is incorrectly applying opacity before discards... sdf shader looks right... can you confirm sdf is ok and msdf (default) is broken?  if so, easy fix. no, actually msdf is the default text font/shader...  can you try #2620 and see if it fixes for you?  worked locally for me (some more detail on default shader - because the default font is actually msdf, the shader actually used gets changed under the hood even when set to sdf) that was the result of discussions where only font that was msdf is the default one, every other font is sdf, and we didn't want to make everyone override shader as well as font.  maybe making default property something like auto-sdf would be clearer (pick sdf or msdf depending on font)  **Description:**
Example code did not align with example text
**Changes proposed:**
- changed 'light' to 'geometry' in description
- added necessary 3rd argument to example code
  What about using some threejs exporter?  Can observe it is momentarily shown before being hidden.

https://aframe-master.glitch.me Will do. How is it possible to debug this ? 
Does entering VR work for someone ? For me the Oculus Browser only shows an Window with the Scene. I tested aframe.io in the new Gear VR 2017 and the VR enter button disappears even before I can click on it to enter VR. The site loads, the button is visible for a brief moment, then it disappears. Mabye it has something to do with the mobile version / css of aframe.io
(Oculus browser)
 I investigated and it looks like if the exit-vr event is not triggered. I realised that because I listen to the exit-vr event on the scene and remove my grid component and it is never removed when leaving VR in Gear VR with controller. And the camera rotation is not reset after leaving VR. Maybe it has to do with the controller button click? @dmarcos  When loading a scene/page:

If I touch the touch pad of the controller:

No output when entering or leaving VR mode. Yes, it is the current master. I put some debug statements into the exitVR method and it is never called. To me it looks like that the VR controller is exiting VR mode but a-frame still thinks it is in VR. That's why the camera rotation after exiting is the same angle as in VR before, and, of course, no enter VR button is shown. Yes, entering VR works fine. The Oculus Browser. I tried with #2707 but still no success. Is it possible that the click on the back button of the Gear VR controller is just not taken into account by a-frame? Any hint where I could debug in the code? No, it is never called. These were my debug statements (none of them were called):

```
exitVR: {
      value: function () {
        var self = this;

console.log('0');
        // Don't exit VR if not in VR.
        if (!this.is('vr-mode')) { return Promise.resolve('Not in VR.'); }

console.log('1');
        exitFullscreen();

console.log('2');
        if (this.checkHeadsetConnected() || this.isMobile) {
console.log('3');
          return this.effect.exitPresent().then(exitVRSuccess, exitVRFailure);
        }
console.log('4');
        exitVRSuccess();
        return Promise.resolve();

        function exitVRSuccess () {
console.log('EXIT VR SUCCESS');
``` Yeah, I use a remote console. @ngokevin should I test your fix? Or do you have a Gear VR at hand? I applied your changes but it did not work. Why would we fire onvrdisplaydeactive? We aren't unmounting. The spec seems pretty clear here.

> onvrdisplaydeactivate A user agent MAY dispatch this event type to indicate that something has occured which suggests the VRDisplay should exit presentation. For example, if the VRDisplay is capable of detecting when the user has taken it off, this event SHOULD fire when they do so with the reason "unmounted".

We are firing or should be firing onvrdisplaypresentchange

> onvrdisplaypresentchange A user agent MUST dispatch this event type to indicate that a VRDisplay has begun or ended VR presentation. This event should not fire on subsequent calls to requestPresent() after the VRDisplay has already begun VR presentation. Just tested the example from https://aframe-master.glitch.me and now the enter vr button does not disappear. Tested on Samsung Galaxy S7 with Gear VR 2 in Oculus browser. It does not work when testing https://aframe-master.glitch.me in Oculus browser, Gear VR with controller, Samsung Galaxy S7, at least for me (I reloaded the site a few times). The button still disappears after leaving VR and the camera rotation is wrong. Has the fix already been commited to the latest master? @weddingdj You are correct. I misread the issue title. When accessing the a-frame examples from https://a-frame.io (with a-frame 0.5.0) there was no enter vr button on Gear VR2 for me in the first place (couldn't enter vr mode at all).
When using a-frame master as in https://aframe-master.glitch.me, the enter vr button is shown, but disappears after exiting vr mode (as this issue title suggests). Sorry for my misunderstanding. The entitled bug still persists.   **Description:**

Video tags assume that autoplay/controls should be set if absent from video elements.
This seems to deviate from the expected standard as described here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#Attributes

`webkit-playsinline` is superseded by `playsinline` and should be set as well

**Changes proposed:**
- adhere autoplay and controls attributes if not set (do not automatically assume autoplay / controls is intended)
- check video tag correctly and set playinline where webkit-playsinline is set
  sometimes when running `npm run test:chrome`
this happens:

should fix #2606 
  looks like gearvr-controls still has the addEventListeners outside injectTrackedControls (that we reverted)  I recently started playing with A-Frame. Awesome tool! My favourite feature the inspector. Also the entity component system is so powerful.

As someone coming from React I had a hard time re-using existing structures e.g. a tree build out of a tree trunk and tree crown object. I found a repository with various examples, but I was wondering if this concept makes sense in the core.
Here my outcome so far: https://github.com/nikgraf/webvr-experiments/blob/master/a-frame/v3-forest/index.html#L11-L16

I was thinking about this:

```
<a-define-template id="tree">
  <a-obj-model src="assets/tree-crown.obj" mtl="assets/tree-crown.mtl" position="0 2.5 0"></a-obj-model>
  <a-obj-model src="assets/tree-trunk.obj" mtl="assets/tree-trunk.mtl" position="0 0 0"></a-obj-model>
</a-define-template>

<a-entity template="tree"></a-entity>
```

Does that make sense for A-Frame? @ngokevin that's awesome! Going to migrate my examples to that one.  It'd be nice if all of the inspector's styling was prefixed to prevent collisions from user styles. `button` -> `inspector-button`, etc.  Provides core support needed for iOS 10 HLS playback discussed in #1416.

Note that this leaves video flipped in Y dimension and also with B and R color channels reversed.
It is expected that corrections can be applied using custom shaders.
(Accommodating those corrections using the built-in shaders is outside the scope of this PR.)
 (Due to the current Mobile Safari CORS issue, this is a bit of a PITA to diagnose / address / test as the A-Frame page and the HLS content must have the same domain.) > Is that better than the video not playing at all?

Without this change, there is no way to make it work at all.
With this change, it is actually simple to use custom shader to fix flip and channel order.

So yes, this change is much better than the video not playing at all... see discussion in #1416
 ok, the switching could probably use a little better guard (e.g. auto-switch if it's a shader like standard or flat we know won't work) if you wanted to touch up the PR due to CORS issues with Mobile Safari, in order to test this, your HTML page must be in the same exact domain as the IDevice-compatible video content (m3u8 manifests and ts / aac files),  Subdomains will not work at present. How about play the live 360 stream from webrtc?  **Description:**

**Changes proposed:**
- links were generating 404 page error, after correction the problem resolved.

 Should I create a pull request there? ok.  There is a great locomotion solution out there called [Freedom Locomotion](https://hugerobot.itch.io/freedom-locomotion-vr) ([video](https://youtu.be/LiQJS8ir9sQ)) that can be implemented as a camera/hand-controls component.  **Description:**

While I know that the position, rotation and scale values if given for a single entity are simply forwarded to three.object3d() and I happen to know that three does sensibly apply these transformations in the proper scale, rotation, then position order, I could not find a clear (or any) statement in the aframe docs which confirm that. aframe aims to be understandable without three.js knowledge.

Perhaps just a sentence in entity initial paragraph, or in the Parent-Child transform section. I want to work on #2591 problem  The end effect of position, scale and rotation depends on the order in which these are applied.

- Fix the link for the vive requirements
  Hello,
The link "Vive recommended requirements" into the documentation is broken.
https://aframe.io/docs/master/introduction/device-and-platform-support.html#hardware-specifications

I think the page has been moved to https://www.vive.com/us/ready/

I did a pull request here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2587
  if gyro is disabled(default is enabled), user is only drag to rotate camera, user can't use mobile auto move, like this video demo
it is used for mobile device
https://youtu.be/Yysc7OlDbzw

you can use it and test it on mobile
```
<a-camera gyro-enabled="false"></a-camera>
```  Support for vive-tracker.

Handles quirk in Nightly where gamepad id strings are same for both controllers and trackers (either all `OpenVR Gamepad` or `OpenVR Tracker`), but hand properties are correct.

At the moment, applies a rotation correction to what gamepad API returns to make it behave more like Vive controller / natural expectations -- specifically, the rotation correction makes it so that the controller pose aligns with the corrected pose if you take the tracker, put it on top of the touchpad, and rotate so the LED-bearing protrusion points toward the strap / bottom of the handle -- but this may be removed pending discussions.

The rotation correction can be avoided by explicitly specifying zero rotation, e.g. `<a-entity vive-tracker="index:0; rotation:0 0 0">`

Uses tracker model from https://github.com/aframevr/assets/pull/22 with corrected pose orientation. per separate discussion, rather than using getGamepadsByPrefix, now uses controllers list from tracked-controls system (what is this new failing node test about?)

``` Yes this is definitely functional as is. The offset is not a big deal and honestly the controllers also exhibit "drift" between Firefox and the SteamVR interface, so I'm not sure it's anything specifically related to the trackers. (You can see this for yourself by pressing the system menu button rapidly on the touch controllers to switch between the Firefox output and the SteamVR system menu.) @dmarcos you were advancing an alternate with your spectator camera work, should this be closed? No I don't think it's a PR yet If there's a discussion happening around spectator cameras, I'd love to read it :) @NellWaliczek I haven't seen what @dmarcos is cooking up yet.  A Glitch version of an old codepen I did is here https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aframe-spectator-camera Was working perfectly, @kfarr and I were playing with it... not blocked AFAIK, but was sitting around working for months and never got merged, then @dmarcos said he was going to redo entirely as part of spectator camera work so I gave up on this one. Rather than fix the new conflict, I'd like to close this because @dmarcos has said that a separate PR will be done along with some spectator camera functionality.  But looking back here, I don't see either the new PR yet (and looks like @NellWaliczek is interested here too) or @dmarcos explicitly confirming...

Can core team confirm this is deprecated now so I can close?  Or close it yourselves?
Or if that is deferred for some reason, and we do actually want to merge this, let me know  if you like, you can take over #2583  if gyro is disabled(default is enabled), user is only drag to rotate camera, user can't use mobile auto move, like this video demo
it is used for mobile device
https://youtu.be/Yysc7OlDbzw alright, I'll resend a pull request  Several property types (`audio`, `asset`, `map`, `model`) expect to support either an id selector string (`#` followed by `id` value to match) or arbitrary string that is often a URL (e.g. `https://cdn.aframe.io/foo`).  

However, the code to handle the id selector string uses `querySelector`, which is stricter on id values than necessary (e.g. can't start with digit), and also looser on actual selector values than necessary (e.g. would allow resolution of class selectors and others).

Per discussion in Slack, the suggested resolution is to change the id selector string resolution to use `getElementById` which should resolve both being overly strict on id and being overly loose on selector.  e.g. `.getElementById(selector.substring(1))` -- and also to update the property type documentation to clarify what is actually supported. example: http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/rmNpjO  **Description:**
When using the fullscreen mode in Safari/iOS, the navigation bar stays active.

I am raising this as an issue here, as the WebVR Polyfill Examples are working on iOS, but aframe does not. So it doesn't seem to be an iOS problem.

I was investigating why it is not working with aframe, but the only difference I found is that the examples are calling requestPresent handing over a canvas object. 
`        vrDisplay.requestPresent([{ source: webglCanvas }]).then(function () {
...`

Can this be the reason? I tried to add a canvas and call with the source, but it didn't work...

Also interesting the comment:

>       function onVRRequestPresent () {
>         // This can only be called in response to a user gesture.

Is this ensured in aframe?

 I checked what happens if you go to Fullscreen with the WebVR sample, it wraps a fullscreen wraper div around the canvas and also changes the canvas size. Tried to do this with a listener when entering VR, but it didn't work:


        document.addEventListener("enter-vr", function() {

          this.fullscreenWrapper_ = document.createElement('div');

          var cssProperties = [
            'height: ' + Math.min(screen.height, screen.width) + 'px !important',
            'top: 0 !important',
            'left: 0 !important',
            'right: 0 !important',
            'border: 0',
            'margin: 0',
            'padding: 0',
            'z-index: 999999 !important',
            'position: fixed',
          ];
          this.fullscreenWrapper_.setAttribute('style', cssProperties.join('; ') + ';');
          this.fullscreenWrapper_.classList.add('webvr-polyfill-fullscreen-wrapper');





        this.fullscreenElement_ = document.getElementById("ascene");
        console.log(document.getElementById("ascene"));
        var parent = this.fullscreenElement_.parentElement;
        parent.insertBefore(this.fullscreenWrapper_, this.fullscreenElement_);
        parent.removeChild(this.fullscreenElement_);
        this.fullscreenWrapper_.insertBefore(this.fullscreenElement_, this.fullscreenWrapper_.firstChild);
        this.fullscreenElementCachedStyle_ = this.fullscreenElement_.getAttribute('style');
}

 I found a workaround (don't know how and if you want to implement this though):

3 things to do:

Change CSS for HTML and BODY and set a-scene fixed to 0

```
    body {
      overflow: scroll !important
    }

    html {
      position: relative !important
    }

    a-scene {
      position: fixed;
      top: 0;
      left: 0
    }
```

Add a div in body that makes the page larger
```
  <div style="height:150vh;">
        
  </div>
```


Add an eventListener that scrolls the page down on EnterVR:
```
        document.addEventListener("enter-vr", function() {
          window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight);
        });
```

Now there is no menu bar anymore. You can still scroll up, but at least it has the same effect as fullscreen :) @derhuebiii 

I tried your workaround but nothing happens. Bars a still there. Do I need place the event listener on a special place in my HTML?

You put html twice in your css. This can be one right? Or has one of the htmls be somethings else.

Thanks for investigating this! 
  @rambambulli 
HTML in CSS only needs to be there once, it's a copy paste error.

The listener shouldn't matter where as long as it's loaded when pressing the VR Button.

Worth to mention my header looks like this:
```
<html>
<head>
    <title>My A-Frame Scene</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width = device-width, initial-scale = 1.0, minimum-scale = 1, maximum-scale = 1, user-scalable = no" />

    <meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
    <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
    <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black" />
```


You could check two things:
1. is the event listener firing (check with console or alert)
2. can you scroll the page manually? in my case, if I open my code in Chrome (on computer), there is a scrollbar now and I can scroll down (but the aframe isn't moving). If not you might need to check the css overflow on your page.

I am testing with iPhone6SE btw. If this won't helpI will upload my example and send you the link to test if my code works for you.

(2. reminds me that this whole workaround should only be applied after a check if Safari is used to avoid unnecesary scrollbars) @derhuebiii 

thanks for your time. Now it works but when I move from vr to pano and back the a-scene is a bit smaller resulting in a white line on the bottom or on the right (depending on landscape or portrait of course)

The strange part is that when I place a bookmark of the scene on my IPhone start screen is works perfect. 

I'll keep on testing :(. Thanks @rambambulli Yes it is not a final perfect solution, more a quick hack. But it is something to work with and maybe build a solution.

For the start screen I heard that if you do this, iPhone allows "real" fullscreen. So this "hack" should even also only be activated in browser mode.

Maybe the aframe team can help on how to go on from here? As it is working in WebVR polyfill this sounds like an aframe topic for me, anyone from the team can point to someone who can have a look at this? Happy to support but this whole topic about identifying device and fullscreen seems a bit complex. > If you load your phone in landscape mode, the "pseudo-fullscreen mode" won't trigger. But, if you turn your phone back to portrait mode and then back to landscape mode, the "pseduo-fullscreen mode" will trigger.

Yes, that's correct, didn't realize that before. If this workaround would be implemented a "pop-up"/modal like we get when entering the VR mode in portrait mode that a turn to portrait and back helps would also help for that problem. Of course not optimal, but the best we might get currently with iOS...

It is the same for the WebVR samples I referred to above, another hint for iOS behaviour.  Using selectors for images / videos / canvas only works when the selector is by id (starts with `#`) although the selector syntax is more general.  This PR allows class selector (e.g. `.main-video`) to work as well. working example (using for with built version of PR)
http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/aWbpYb unfortunately, some assets don't work by id -- e.g. `<video id='1'>` will fail to be accessible via selector `#123`, Firefox / Nightly will throw errors. the standard querySelector behavior is to allow class and only return first (which may be only).  seems to me that aframe should respect browser implementation decision to allow and just pass it through abandoning this approach per discussion, in favor of better documented id selector or string requirement (and using getElementByID to resolve id)  **Description:**

 sorry this wasnt an issue i typed and pressed enter, thot it was in the search bar but cannot delete this
i have no issue  This adds a triangle geometry as discussed in #2535.
It is specified by 3 vertices, `vertexA`, `vertexB`, and `vertexC`.

If there is nothing need to amend regarding to property names, default values etc., I will send a PR to add docs. Yes, I think it make sense since the other geometries are centered by default.
I have just added a commit for that. vertexA/B/C seems a little verbose.  i take it there is some problem preventing an array of vec3?  if so, maybe we should change that - I am thinking something like vertices or verts as vec3 array would be better, and that would give use plumbing to support strips and other more advanced primitives? @machenmusik 
I've considered using an array of vec3 also, but I'm not sure. JS array doesn't have fixed length, so either we need additional check on array length during input, or have additional specification on how to handle longer/shorter array. I think using 3 (or even 4) vec3 variables instead of using array is still acceptable.

Building strip or other geometries of course is a different case, and I agree array would be more suitable when the vertex input amount is varied or very large.

Let me know if I've missed anything. :) for just basic triangle this is probably fine.  my worry is that people will try to make thousands of these because they can't do strips and then wonder why performance isn't what it could be.  so i naturally jump to syntax that also would work for strips etc. > make thousands of these because they can't do strips

People probably will, as well as thousands of boxes and spheres too ;)
I guess that means we have to add strip and other more advanced geometries...

For now, I will leave it as `vertexA`, `vertexB`, and `vertexC`. Documentation is added. Also found out my initial implementation has no UVs, so I added some code to compute a sensible set. Rebased on top of master to trigger a TravisCI build. Bump ;)  I'm trying to load a model with a material applied to it using the example from the docs https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/obj-model.html

However, it seems that material is not being applied and the warning is shown in the javacript console:

`components:obj-model:warn Material component properties are ignored when a .MTL is provided` 

I've also tried to run example from this repository (`examples/test/model`) and the above warning is also shown. Textures are applied correctly, but when I remove texture from .mtl file (`map_Kd crate.jpg`) the material described in .mtl seems to be not applied.

What exactly does the above warning mean?

  Just digging into this and redux thanks to this bug and the blog post (thanks!).

So I'd like to suggest that there should definitely be discrete state machines, with their own state object, below the level of scene.

I anticipate wanting a tag like` <activity/> `with a free standing game or interaction that users might approach and interact with at a level below the whole scene. It might even have a collision field associated with it to start and stop it as you approach etc.  Robustness tweaks for tracked-controls
- if matching hand filter supplied to isControllerPresent, and gamepad provides no hand, use DEFAULT_HANDEDNESS for matching purposes
- defend against missing pose
- allow system-level specification of id prefixes that should always be included when present in controller list, e.g. if pose is sometimes missing the line in question:
`If the hardware cannot supply any pose values, MUST be set to null.`
You and I read that differently.
For example, if the controller is paired but currently disconnected, then the hardware cannot supply any values, and pose must be null.  Even where gamepad must have worked at one point, this can happen if your batteries run out.  The guards are to ensure that A-Frame survives cases where pose is null even if only temporarily, rather than throwing errors that prevent correct processing. if 6DOF controllers leave the tracking volume / frustrum,
would they have null pose?
or would.they have orientation (from accelerometers), but null position?
 would be good to understand what browsers actually do including previously mentioned exceptional cases.
if all browsers interpret as you say, i don't know how some of these conditions are detectable (e.g. if there must always be a pose, then what pose values should be provided while disconnected?)  Just looking through the source it appears A-Frame is still using the old "v0" Custom Elements API, which is only natively supported in Chrome. The newer v1 API is now natively supported in Safari, Chrome and has support from Firefox and Edge. Native support in mobile Safari should make initializing large scenes faster. @ngokevin Custom Elements v1 is way more supported than Custom Elements v0 which you're currently using. Safari, Firefox and Edge will never support v0. I'll take it to #567, since I wrote the v1 polyfill.  you still need the hand filter, for cases where it gets passed down (e.g. hand-controls="left" should only match daydream-controls if left hand) -- did you want to make it so default hand is empty that would be accepted for any hand? it's not just hand-controls.  shoot-controls for a-blast is handed.  in a-paint, paint-controls (I think) is handed.  goes back to the whole top-down declarative vs. bottom-up assembly discussion.  because of the original paradigm and examples, most apps out there declare what they want to see like hand-controls, and deal with what ends up getting populated.  if you want to be able to use daydream-controls without filtering on hand, that is easy, but that is kinda the opposite of what this PR does (removing filtering and forcing incompatibility) the commit only removes from docs, if you want to allow default to accept either hand, I think that change needs to be made to `src/components/daydream-controls.js` right? The existing daydream-controls implementation is based on oculus / vive / tracked-controls core components (most of which predates my involvement, so others may need to weigh in on earlier context).  Those have all leveraged the same structure: 

tracked-controls handles the real interfacing with gamepad API, and has schema values that let the app filter which controller the component should bind to and represent.  (I have generally described that that the top-down approach, where the user specifies what they want, and if present the components do appropriate bindings.)

higher-level components (e.g. oculus-touch-controls and vive-controls ) are allowed and indeed encouraged to be multiply specified, and only those actually present are bound using tracked-controls.

The approach you are suggesting (remove the hand property, have the component use what it provides to you) is what I generally describe as bottom-up approach -- which was previously rejected when proposed w.r.t. oculus and vive, specifying multiple options explicitly was deemed preferable.

In your proposal, not only would you remove the hand property, you'd also want to expose the hand through the component in use -- which is actually what the hand property provides for?

> 2, Specifying both hands is confusing (solution to problem 1):
> `<a-entity daydream-controls="hand: left"> <a-entity daydream-controls="hand: right">`

Actually, I believe we proposed that to allow either hand to match depending on what was actually exposed via gamepad API, the usage should be what you stated was preferable:

> `<a-entity daydream-controls>`

by keeping the hand property, but having it default to a value (either blank, or "either") that would simply omit the hand filter given to isControllerPresent.

In that case, the natural behavior is as described as preferable, but also a specific hand filtered binding can still be specified.
 Using a specific example to illustrate...

Let's say that by necessity and design, I have a separate model for left hand and right hand, and I'd like to use declarative specification to accomplish the following:

1. If I don't have a Daydream controller available, don't show either hand model.

2. If I do have a Daydream controller available, use the correct hand model based on whether the system decided that the Daydream controller represented left or right hand.

If we remove the hand property, there is no way to do this with `<a-entity daydream-controls obj-model=...>`.

If we keep the hand property to use as filter, then this would be done the same way as with oculus or vive:
`<a-entity daydream-controls="hand:left" obj-model=(details for left hand model)><a-entity>`
`<a-entity daydream-controls="hand:right" obj-model=(details for right hand model)><a-entity>`
and only one of the entities would actually get the controller.

In the case where the model is the same (e.g. a sword or pistol that looks the same regardless of hand), then the preferred specification in both scenarios is presumably the same...
`<a-entity daydream-controls obj-model=(details for non-specific model)></a-entity>`
so I am unclear as to the benefit of removing the hand property altogether.

Don McCurdy asked me to file this as a bug. The community needs a more thorough documentation of materials and shader development for aframe. 
Robust, useful, and well documented examples to use as a jumping off point
Documented tutorials and walk throughs of the process
Coverage of the current methods and deprecating any outmoded examples in the current docs
Explanations of the different approaches and why to use which ones - when to use a component, etc.

 If it's to wrap an existing three.js shader to make it usable in AFrame as a component, it would be great to take mesh_standard and maybe a toon shader?
If it's to demonstrate writing one from scratch a good phong is a great boilerplate and jumping off point. People can extend Phong pretty quickly to do novel things.
 Actually meshStandard is only partially implemented - there is no lightmap support for instance. Also - if I were to do it I would reveal the shader attributes to the component interface with the same names. I understand that 'src' is a standard web dev attribute, but in the underlying shader it's 'map'. But aside from that - yes - show how to wrap the other three.js shaders so that when new ones are introduced it's easier for the dev community to make it available to designers and artists. The noise example is great - clean and to the point. It's a lot easier to follow than some other shader examples I've seen. The inclusion of time is a good addition and very instructional. It would be great to show an example that took each of the different types of attributes - float, vector, color, image, etc., and then had comments (over)explaining their implementation - what goes where and why.

I would agree that external dependencies may be best left to more advanced examples.

The noise shader reminded me of a shader I wrote for Unity that takes a sequence of images rendered of an explosion in Houdini, but looking in from the surface of a sphere (like an inverted pano render). By encoding z-depth and color into the frames I was able to "recreate" the explosion on a poly mesh sphere where the vertices and the color were changing according to the actual rendered simulation. The missing chunks for me here are how to pull in an image for the texture atlas, or a movie file, and floats and vectors for control parameters.   - A-Frame Version: 0.5.0

```
// Add this to any entity, taken from 360 example
sound="on: click; src: #click-sound;"
```

Any attempts at playing a sound using the `sound` component by leveraging `fuse` on the cursor to trigger the `click` handler does not work.

This shouldn't be the case. The user has made an explicit action/gesture to start audio. That's the only documented rule for iOS, so the implementation under the hood should be the issue to my knowledge. Problem is, the "explicit" action is staring in one place for an extended period of time, which Apple doesn't consider a user gesture.

**Docs:**

- https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/Device-SpecificConsiderations/Device-SpecificConsiderations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009523-CH5-SW1

This is different than autoplay audio, which is an issue with the iOS Safari implementation (imo) and not within the scope of this discussion.

The same code does play audio when downloaded to the homescreen. That's okay, but a considerably worse user experience that I'm currently not interested in.

_**Update**: Realized the issue is using `fuse`. Fuse doesn't propagate the same way a click does and therefore doesn't count as a user gesture. Updated the title + description. Worried the best that we can do is update the docs to warn that `fuse` causes audio to not trigger on iOS._ Also relevant https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-ioshtml5/#N101DA

It feels like as long as `audio.play()` is within an event handler for `click` this should work but I'd imagine the issue is that we programmatically trigger the `click` event for `fuse` and Apple is smart enough to not count that. Is this true? @ngokevin very fair. Thank you!  - A-Frame Version: 0.5.0

How do I trace back this warning a specific entity? All I know is that it's some entity that has a sound component. 0 identifier being given and in many instances there are too many entities to reason out which one it is. @ngokevin awesome! Thank you.  I'm using the look-controls component on a Pixel C tablet and noticed that I can only pan left to right when dragging the screen around. This is also happening on the Hello WebVR example. 

On a related note, when I switch over to full screen/cardboard mode, the example has access to the Pixel C's gyroscope and responds accordingly.

I should have access to the gyroscope by default (like the way it's being handled on a pixel phone) but it's currently not the case.

- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/helloworld/ I also have the same issue on iOS and Chrome mobile sims. @dmarcos Is there an option to turn it on?  What would be the best solution if some of the mobile browsers don't support gyro within aframe? (can I turn it into drag control mode with a button or automatically)  Sounds reasonable. We store specific objects likes `vec2`, `vec3`, and `vec4` anyway. I don't see why a more broad `object` `type` would be bad.   I tried loading various glTF models but they never render right when I go into VR mode on the Vive.  They are in the correct place in space, but the location in the two eye views is very different so they are impossible to fuse.

This happens both with my own models and with models from [glTF examples repository](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models).

In the super simple example linked below the duck is on top of the plane in a regular webgl view, but is way off when you go into VR mode.

Perhaps related, when I go into the inspector the glTF models don't rotate with the rest of the scene and don't update when they are transformed.  I suspect they aren't being correctly added to the scene by the loader (or something).

 @dmarcos Thanks for checking, yes, brainstem model works.  But the ones that fail are not just my own models, I'm testing models from the glTF repository and they all seem to have the same problem.

The example uses the [the duck model](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/blob/master/1.0/Duck/glTF-Embedded/Duck.gltf) from the glTF site.

This, however, does not work on mobile; it would be useful to have a `reverseTouchDrag` option for mobile.
 I have done it in my fork, branch: project-custom-0.5.0 and find keyword reverseMouseDrag. It's simple to add condition **What about this** (shorter code) ? @ngokevin @dmarcos 

```
var modifier = this.data.reverseMouseDrag ? -1 : 1;

 @l2aelba that's related to entity animation (being replaced by the way, cf https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3678) and has no relation with look controls. @Utopiah Aha ! So thanks so much.  @Utopiah closing?  This PR, which includes #2538 in its entirety (and is intended to be merged afterward), should add support for the new 3DOF Gear VR Controller as proposed at https://webvr.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FC0EEECMA5%2Fp1490839724160554

Note that at time of this writing, this PR has not yet been tested on a supporting browser with supported hardware.  Once such testing has been completed, this comment will be edited appropriately. rebased, but will need changes when #2513 is merged rebased, onto latest master and also #2567 i am not sure whether it will work without it.  @mkeblx does it work with only the commits after "add gearvr controls", and if so are you able to say that for only Samsung Internet, or also Oculus Browser? removed portions from closed #2567 -- @mkeblx does codepen still work? fixed conflict with @ngokevin hand-controls changes got confirmation that this PR still works after removing portions of closed #2567.
if #2513 is merged before this one, I will update to conform.
otherwise, should be good to go Added controller model https://github.com/aframevr/assets/pull/20 (Thanks @840labs)

@machenmusik Something like below should work if you want to modify in this PR.
```js
buttonMeshes.trigger = controllerObject3D.getObjectByName('Trigger');
buttonMeshes.trackpad = controllerObject3D.getObjectByName('Touchpad');
// Offset pivot point # can be removed
// controllerObject3D.position.set(0, 0, 0);

Note: Pivot should be not needed, set to center of trackpad like pivot on Daydream controller location.

You can check this error on first starting the animation and hovering out. Then quickly hover over the sphere and move again away from it. [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/c4cu639d/7/)

 @ngokevin this can be closed, I believe. I'm able to repro behaviour in 0.5 but not in 0.7.0. (maybe @derhuebiii would like to confirm.)  Is there a way to use a custom fragment shader for a material? If not, this feature should be added.  If so, the documentation should specify it.

I'd be glad to work on either. Thank you @donmccurdy that example is great! Maybe we should document its existence?  **Description:**

  This PR adds support to `tracked-controls` for non-6DOF controllers, for example the Google Daydream controller, by using camera position and a primitive arm model to emulate positional data.  As they should now be supported, this PR also adds `daydream-controls` and `gearvr-controls` alongside `oculus-touch-controls` and `vive-controls`.  Lastly, it includes support for allowing zero-DOF controllers, for example Gear VR Touchpad, by using camera orientation (disabled by default, but enabled for `examples/showcase/tracked-controls/` since otherwise that does nothing in zero-DOF cases). is there a need to back it out?  won't do anything unless you explicitly enable zero-DOF, and then you presumably want it to do something (with the current trackpad) if we think that 0.6.0 will be shipped before the GearVR controllers are available, I would agree.  but the controller release is happening quite soon (3 weeks from now) ok, let me see if i can split into this PR for controllers we can exercise now (Daydream; any other 3DOF gamepads?) and a separate one for GearVR once we can confirm with those.  Ideally we would be able to confirm support to be available before or at launch, not afterward.  (The existing code in this PR may just work.)

 (if you are using more complicated models with daydream controller, daydream GPU is still way worse than any desktop so you may be running into scene complexity issues?) @dmarcos mentioned yesterday that three.js does the same thing so doesn't seem like A-Frame has much to do with it (maybe browser) yes that was the conclusion @dmarcos and I came to yesterday (perf not us, hand --> defaultHand) -- looks like some editorial nits but very close now ok?  Due to unfortunate name collision, add empty touches array to avoid Daydream error in TouchPanner.  suggest a new key in the schema to indicate whether to be used when single property is given -- can't use default since that refers to the default value.  maybe `singleProperty` -- and if no schema property has that set to true, then single property syntax is not allowed for that component.

``` Oh thanks @ngokevin. So the component data doesn't update. But it should still update the scene right? Is this not working because the invoked `setAttribute` method is on the html node and not A-frame's `setAttribute` method? And the component data doesn't update when using it from the link @ngokevin sent. Also instead of `setTimeout` don't we use the `tick` method instead? I ran into this issue as well. I thought, "well that's fine, I'll just go fix it". I think I know what is happening now, but I do not think I have enough knowledge of the rest of the A-Frame internals to know the best way to go about fixing this. If the below is useful, great. If it suggests a path to a solution that is easy to explain I'd be happy to take a shot at making a PR, but at the moment it seems to me that a solution would need to go deeper than my level of understanding. If neither is the case, then this is just my documentation of my first foray behind the A-Frame [a-]scene!

My trail started in [a-entity.js](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/050cbaf249ec34bb378a3a3c304a4fe6e71c069b/src/core/a-entity.js#L459):
```
  updateComponents: {
...
      for (name in componentsToUpdate) {
        data = mergeComponentData(this.getDOMAttribute(name),
                                  extraComponents && extraComponents[name]);
        this.updateComponent(name, data);
        delete componentsToUpdate[name];
}
```
When `updateComponents` runs after changing the mixin id, `this.getDOMAttribute(name)` is returning the value of the attribute with mixins included. Thus `mergeComponentData` is giving precedence to the old mixin values and the new ones (contained in `extraComponents`) never get written. The comment on `getDOMAttribute` [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/050cbaf249ec34bb378a3a3c304a4fe6e71c069b/src/core/a-entity.js#L727) suggests that it should not be including mixins. 

The only relevant difference here between `getDOMAttribute` and `getAttribute` (which by its comment _is_ supposed to include mixin values) is that they look at `this.attrValue` and `this.data` respectively. However setting a mixin calls `updateComponents` which calls `component.updateProperties`, which updates both `this.attrValue` and `this.data`, so `this.attrValue` gets populated with mixin values, which looks to be incorrect.

So, assuming the above is correct, I'm not sure where to go from here. The comment on `getDOMAttribute` would suggest that we don't want to use `updateProperties` when updating a component with mixin values, but we do need to update the component's `data`, and I'm not sure how best to do that without `updateProperties`. Do we need a whole separate update path, starting with [the loop](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/050cbaf249ec34bb378a3a3c304a4fe6e71c069b/src/core/a-entity.js#L429-L433) in `updateComponents` which finds all mixin attributes? But then it seems like `updateProperties` is doing a lot of other useful stuff that should happen for mixin values as well. I'll stop speculating on things I don't yet understand.  **Description:**

Fix for issue #2366 

**Changes proposed:**
- Added a note to to the documentation about how `appendChild` is async, and a possible workaround. 

  **Description:**

I was giving an A-Frame talk and wanted to show the Inspector… Could not make it because I didn't have a working network connection. At that time, I didn't know that the Inspector was being pulled on the fly, and the "Loading…" message was being shown indefinitely, no errors on the console, and I found it confusing.

This shows an error message in the "loading" magenta button when the injected `<script>` tag fires an `error` event.

**Changes proposed:**

- Add an `onerror` event handler that shows an error message in place of "Loading…"

  Continuing on this question #2518 using A-frame **version 0.5.0**, I would like that there is an option to enable databinding using Angular 2 or React in a next version of A-frame. 

In my opinion is the performance a little bit better when you're using databinding related to write if by yourself. Because not experienced programmers doesn't always think about the performance of JavaScript.

By using always `document.getElementById` for a lot of controles, the HTML DOM must be inspected every time and not performance at all. For anyone finding this issue as of July 2017 onwards who might still be interested in the full picture: it doesn't work.

A-Frame components are impervious to Angular 2+ binding – it just does nothing in almost every case. The [Angular2_VR_Starter](https://github.com/brakmic/Angular2_VR_Starter) project that @ngokevin mentions doesn't make use of data binding whatsoever, and the lengths to which the author went to simply load up a scene using Angular as a basic launch platform are quite extensive. Angular feels less.. "familial" in the context of this app – more like a creepy uncle.

On a side note (just reporting from personal experiences), Angular 1.* doesn't exactly play nicely with A-Frame WRT data bindings either; a lot of them will _work_, but most of them present quirky issues with seemingly no remedy when used in real scenarios. Upgrading to my 1.* app to 4.* was my troubleshooting step for this since Angular 2+ seems much more "React-y" than its predecessor; turns out this is a misguided assumption.

> I don't know what's needed to work with Angular 2, or maybe it does work.

Perhaps it's time to consider removing Angular from the list of libraries under [this page/section's "Tool agnostic" subheading](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/#features)? It works great with React (which is a solid achievement!) but there doesn't seem to be any interest from the A-Frame side in investigating compatibility with anything else but React (if I'm interpreting this thread correctly). Putting Angular and React in the same list seems more misleading the more information we have. Yup, it just suffers from too little ROI. What was done in that integration was really quite clever, but really just the bare minimum of what A-Frame can offer and not much room to go upwards.  **Description:**

 @ngokevin - Sorry for lack of response (I was swamped with work stuff for a bit). Thanks very much for adding the test / fixing.  you mean should be able to override base URL, right?

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/oculus-touch-controls.js#L5
hmm, `vive-controls` doesn't have a base URL.

There is a larger question here, IMO, of whether all of the cdn.aframe.io links that core components use should be able to have their base URL redirected for offline use, not just the models for tracked controllers (e.g. fonts) is it enough to export the base URL variables for whatever components need to do this? (this is easy enough that we may want to find a willing first-time participant looking to jump in) then you have to do it for left and right, obj and mtl, per instance... seems pretty tedious... and needs to be done for `hand-controls` too either way. not worried about schema, just that there are multiple urls that all need to be overridden together. for the static use case, the filenames would all be the same, just need to change the base URL to something local. more insidious is the case where someone is using `hand-controls` and not directly specifying oculus or vive... need to override for all instances, which putting in schema won't accomplish. yes but the use case mentioned here is how to embed the stock models for self contained usage.  in that case really you would need other cdn.aframe.io files as well Hi @dmarcos @machenmusik @ngokevin, is this issue still being discussed? If not, can you please summarize how a newbie can work on this?

Thanks :-)
 Hey everyone! I am a new contributor and am looking for some issues to work on.  This one has piqued my interest and I would be open to understanding how I can help.  I noticed that there was a comment by @machenmusik that it is easy enough for a first-time participant to tackle it.  

How can I help?  **Description:**

The AFRAME.utils-Function "deepEqual" causes an Infinite-Loop leading to a Maximum Call Stack Error when a Component-Property is updated under the following circumstances:

--> The Property is an Entity (e.g. when Property-Type is "Selector" and an Entity has been loaded and needs to be compared for differences using deepEqual).

Since an Entity contains references to itself, deepEqual will end up comparing the same things over and over, resulting in an infinite loop.

 @ngokevin what? You say that a-frame doesn't update values in attributes, but it does! 
Animation goes good, but after animation DOM attribute value is set to undefined!
I mean, fill="backwards" doesn't work as expected, it breaks light after animation! I expect that a-animation will set "from" value to attribute, but not undefined 
If you don't understand our need another example, please let me know  @ngokevin 
[example one](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dpmpJP) with aframe version **0.1.3** - OK (example from [this page](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/cursor.html#adding-visual-feedback))
[example two](http://codepen.io/Disorrder/pen/JWqWOx) with aframe version **0.5.0** - Animation bug!
Please, compare cursor animation and reopen this issue! It's critical in using standart `a-animation` component :(  Per discussion on #2423, this PR separates the axismove changes and omits the emulated property.

This PR extends #2413 / #2415 to oculus-touch-controls as thumbstickmoved, and also addresses spurious axismove events discussed in #2423. @cmvanb - we decided to close #2423 in favor of this PR, which should have the same benefits `buttonchanged` is a slightly different but used event; personally not in favor of `abuttonup`, `abuttonchanged`, `bbuttonchanged`, etc. due to being too close to the separately used `buttonup`, `buttonchanged`, etc. -- but it is of course technically possible by changing mappings here and also in #2446.  @dmarcos @ngokevin any more thoughts on this one?  hoping to get #2446 in as well, but this one first.

interested in outside perspectives on backward compatibility (whether the event names change is problematic for existing usage) -- I think right now most things use trigger / thumbstick / grip which aren't changing.   axismove events similar to #2413 / #2415 for oculus touch (prior commits were vive specific, which frankly we should really avoid where possible in future...) ```
This PR extends #2413 / #2415 to oculus-touch-controls as thumbstickmoved, and also addresses spurious axismove events discussed in #2423.
``` summing up recent comments - in `daydream-controls`, `everGotGamepadEvent` is in fact used in `onControllersUpdate`, which is more efficient.  `oculus-touch-controls` was not and so was checking for controller presence every tick, so changed it to stop doing that if `everGotGamepadEvent` (like the other controllers). > The analog buttons (triggers in Vive an Oculus) return duplicated touchstart / touchend events on a single press.

Hmm, if that's true it sounds as though real events are working correctly and we can remove the emulation stuff altogether?  Otherwise I would expect only some doubling... will look at suppressing actual when we are doing emulation.

> The tracked controllers example only shows one hand with Vive while it works with both hands on Oculus

That is the usual symptom of problems with gamepadconnected/disconnected issues.  Are you sure you tried the latest version including `d8ae5cc`?  When we were working on things this afternoon (notably the support-vive-tracker-dist codepen) I saw both hands with Nightly and Vive just fine...

I am thinking that given the apparently unreliable behavior of gamepadconnected/disconnected propagation, maybe those handlers should be removed altogether again for now (as you suggested in comments), and we should send (throttled) events to cause periodic check from system level.  If we don't throttle, we'll be in the scale-unfriendly pattern of each candidate controller component redoing its own version of checkIfControllerPresent every tick -- which is soon to be two hands times four controller components, and maybe five if you count vive-tracker. With vive trackers, i saw only one gamepadconnected fire on one of the vive-tracker components, in a scene with two actual trackers and two separate entities, each with one instance of vive-tracker set to filter for the right index.  Since only one instance received it, that was the one that realized it was present and decided to show up.

gamepadconnected doesn't know anything about index, so for that to work, the expectation is that the gamepadconnected event would propagate to all listening components, so they can do their own checks against the system controllers list.  If the two tracker connections were coalesced into a single gamepadconnected event, things would still work if that event fired when both were available via gamepad API, and if all the listening components actually received it.

can't use the codepen I had before as example since I committed the changes back to checking on controllersupdate. so I think we're good now, but you're probably gonna want to have GitHub squash when merging Since #2545 was merged first, I've incorporated the salient aspects of #2588 here now per discussion.  to fix Nightly issue with null stageParameters,
add camera userHeight if null stageParameters;
to keep tests working, only getVRDisplays when VR entered.

(NOTE: tried to move getVRDisplays from system into component where dolly is,
but got weird effect where right hand was applying offset but right hand wasn't,
so there may still be some strange race condition somewhere)
 Works well.  Tested in both Firefox Nightly and Daydream for 3DOF support. 

Prob want to squish the commits.

Thanks for the patches + reviews! (@ngokevin you can squash at merge time via Github, correct?)  #It would be very convenient to have methods to add and remove mixins using using Javascript in the same way class names are handled:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList

ie:
entity.components.mixin.add('');
entity.components.mixin.remove('');

Otherwise you have to manually manage the string.
 Yeah, that makes more sense rather than digging into the component.  👍  Since order is important, where would `el.addMixin()` add ?

 I still works, I don't know if it is officially supported. I just wanted to make sure checkHeadsetConnected() returns true.  Is it planned to support Daydream controller?
  (1) shouldn't this actually be done in the tracked-controls system that finds new controllers?
(2) shouldn't the type be the gamepad ID, if not the gamepad state itself?  I am not entirely understanding what this provides in addition to ongamepadconnected events, maybe it is simply the abstraction? would also like to understand the intended behavior in light of #2423 and #2446 e.g. what should be done if anything for emulated situations? if the general idea is to have the components re-emit their own version of `gamepadconnected` when they are going to inject, don't we also want something for `gamepaddisconnected`, and make it independent of 3DoF vs. 6DoF for example daydream controller and upcoming gearvr controller?  (maybe even gearvr touchpad to the extent folks continue to use that with Carmel?) @fernandojsg I see, so by `type` you really meant source component i.e. `oculus-touch-controls` or `vive-controls` which is not immediately obvious from the injected `tracked-controls`-- if we go back to the original decision to have all the different types of possible components attached, I think the pattern you are looking for is actually the `auto-detect-controllers` approach and then the particular injected component would be available through the standard eventing for new component addition, rather than only ambiguous `tracked-controls`.  Given the current decision there, it seems as though the injected `tracked-controls` should have some indication of source component, so you can tell that the parent of the injected `tracked-controls` is vive or oculus.  Does that sound like what you are looking for? > standard eventing for new component addition

Looks like there may be stale documentation
https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/core/entity.html#events_componentinit
https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/core/entity.html#events2_componentinitialized

If the name & id of the source/parent component doing the injection were available as part of as well as injected name/id/data, then this pattern would be generalizable to listening for and filtering `componentinitialized` which would be a nice solution.  Thoughts?
 Maybe no changes are required?
Have a look at `which-controller-present` in this CodePen...
http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/qroKWN > I've updated my PR with the component code of @machenmusik included directly on the tracked-controls . So we don't need that extra component and it's cleaner also as we don't need to remember to include that component. What do you think?

So where did we end up with this one after all?  Looking at it again, I think @fernandojsg proposal would work, and if other third-party components obey the `controllerPresent` convention, they could participate as well.

> I believe this is the case when you include directly tracked-controls instead of vive-controls or oculus-controls the specific controls inject tracked controls when the controllers is already available, but if you just inject tracked-controls by yourself you won't get 100% of the cases.

True but if you inject `tracked-controls` yourself (rather than letting `oculus-touch-controls`, `vive-controls`, `daydream-controls` etc. do their detection) then you should know what you are doing and not need the signal event to tell you.

> I imagine an entity wanting to subscribe to the controller but not use a tracked-controls component

For `oculus-touch-controls`, `vive-controls`, `daydream-controls` this is not possible as they rely upon `tracked-controls` for button / axis / pose update (and recording/replay takes full advantage of that fact). I'm not sure how that actually helps the original use case @fernandojsg was trying to solve (need to know whether oculus-touch-controls or vive-controls is actually connected) -- the upper level enjoys the abstraction of not having to know the raw gamepad id strings, but only the higher-level component abstractions,.. my recollection is that some components need to do their own filtering using getGamepadsByPrefix
... and also we only want the event to fire when things change, if we fire when isControllerPresent is true it will spam multiple times every tick. thinking about problems separately,

to solve "how do i know which component injected this tracked-controls" just add a string to schema that higher level components fill in with their name when injecting.  then you can read it even if you missed the event.

to fire an event when you see a new controller would ideally be gamepadconnected/disconnected from browser, but in practice i have not seen that work correctly so systems component would probably have to fire - perhaps on scene as we were discussing previously.  

but putting the two together is slightly trickier as for fernando's use case, you only want the event AFTER you can read which component injected.  So maybe fire event from tracked-controls schema update on that property. the less invasive change makes sense to me, bigger refactor if any can happen post-0.6.0 I think the event needs to fire only when this.controllerPresent changes state, not just when isControllerPresent would return true? and really the event should probably only fire after tracked-controls has been injected, so that anything from tracked-controls may be accessible? @dmarcos had suggested that controllerpresent handling be moved into tracked-controls (utils?) - maybe checkIfControllerPresent should move to utils in order to accomplish, and take a callback function to fire if changed (after which the event could be generated) where that callback may differ across higher-level components @fernandojsg if you look at the vive-tracker PR, you can see a change to the way tests are mocked -- just change the system controllers list to what you need it to look like i believe that due to issues with gsmepadconnected/disconnected propagation, that is still needed to reliably detect controllers, but would be happy to be proven wrong  When I open a scene in the visual inspector, add an entity via the UI and try to export the scene via the "Export to HTML" button, the default scene is exported and the new element is missing.

 I'm not entirely sure but what I found out was that the collider-check tag on the sphere created a raycaster with default settings on the sphere entity itself rather than using the parameters of the wrapped raycaster. I removed the wrapped ray caster and adjusted the raycaster on the sphere and it worked fine.

Thanks for filing. I wonder if it's an issue with the collidable entity not being initialized in time the raycaster does its querySelector, even though the raycaster should be listening for attached entities. What happens if you swap the order, or remove the objects check?

  **Description:**
This fixes issue #2412. The code(shown below) from the issue now returns true. If a type `vec2` or `vec3` is given, the normalization procedure should run `parse` and change it into an object with the correct coordinates.

```
<script>
  AFRAME.registerComponent('test', {
    schema: { v: {type: 'vec2', default: '1 1'} }
  });
</script>
<a-scene>
  <a-entity test></a-entity>
</a-scene>
<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    var e = document.querySelector('a-entity');
    var def = e.components.test.schema.v.default;
    var shouldBeTrue =
      JSON.stringify(def) === JSON.stringify(e.getAttribute('test').v);
    console.log('Are equal?', shouldBeTrue);
  });
</script>
``` 

**Changes proposed:**

`processPropertyDefinition` now runs `parse` on the default string values such as `'1 1'` into `{x: 1, y: 1}` and `'2 2 2'` into `{x: 2, y: 2, z: 2 }`. The function `parse` was labeled `parseCoordinates` to be more clear and avoid conflicting names in the file. Not sure if that was necessary though.

An error is given if the string does not have 2 or 3 values separated by an empty space. For example, `type: 'vec2` and `default: 1 1 1` would run `warn('Default value for type vec2 can only be 2 coordinates')`.  Yeah it was definitely hacky. I agree, probably the better solution is to have the default values be parsed correctly from the beginning. So would it be better if I made a utility function that checks if the `defaultVal` contains the correct values and then run it in `processPropertDefinition` if `typeName === 'vec2'` or if `typeName === 'vec3'`?
 Yeah. What are the different types and their default values? Would have to have to perform checks on all of them.  **Description:**

  I missed this in renaming #2496  Let me take this. I think we should set `material.needsUpdate = true` in `updateMaterial()` if `alphaTest` value is updated, correct? :+1:  Was going to post this.  A new version has been released with some bugfixes for recent versions of chrome on android.  Created a PR on that fork: https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill/pull/2  This one for example is fixed in 0.9.26: https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/issues/202   I can't understand is there segments settings on the `a-plane`?

Well, Three.js [PlaneGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=plane#Reference/Geometries/PlaneGeometry) has `widthSegments` and `heightSegments` and them works as expected

This PR fixes issue #2359. `div.a-enter-vr` extends across the window blocking cursor clicks / cursor grabbing events passing to the scene.

**Changes proposed:**
Changed css of `a-enter-vr`. Removed `height` and `width`. It seems like the `div` is only used for the button.
 Oops. Will fixed that. Thanks @ngokevin.  Now that #2484 has landed, we can begin to iterate on the node experience and make it better. This removes the need to mock `require` to ignore css requiring in node (which is a bundler-only feature). I changed to value exports instead of functions.

When adding tests. I found out that not only is `process` mocked by browserify/karma, all node globals are mocked (found by debugging chrome while karma was running). This meant I had to get a little more explicit with environment detection. rebased and updated.  Objects just in `a-scene` DOM are displaying good, but if wrap them into `a-entity` they disappear.

@ngokevin thanks  so it seems that you want a separate component that will apply default user height like camera, and use that instead of default camera behavior?      After #2476 and #2477 were merged, it is now possible to run aframe in node. This is a regression test to preserve this functionality as aframe grows, and to iterate upon to make it run better in node. This is a partial solution to #2031, but there will most likely need to be more work.

I tried to put the test in `tests/` first, but it made the globbing [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/3b9d8f419d45f3167d0053208cab6fb557dd8b22/tests/karma.conf.js#L24) difficult because `tests/!(node)/**/*.test.js` kept ignoring the `tests/__init.test.js`. @ngokevin Renamed to "/tests/node/test.js". I figured it would clearer to call it test to know what it is doing. I can still rename it "index.js" if you desire.    mainly to have editors enforce the 2 space indents.  **Description:**

In version 0.3.0, non-visible entity does not interact with raycaster,

but in 0.5.0, non-visible entity still interact with raycaster,

any reason why this is such a case ?

my scenario is that I have multiple scenes with multiple control entities, with version 0.5.0, I can't simply set those not-in-the-scene entities non-visible.

- A-Frame Version: 0.5.0
- Platform / Device: Chrome
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:

 I think it is important that the raycaster is interacting with non-visible entities. For example if I want to show the cursor (attached to the camera) when it is entering an invisible sphere, I want exactly that behaviour. So you can create user interfaces where the cursor only appears when the user can trigger an action. @ngokevin thanks kevin

Which `el` is it in this case? I did `AFRAME.scenes[0].querySelector('[raycaster]').components.raycaster.refreshObjects();`
works well.

hope it helps.  **Description:**
This PR fixes #2450. Just a minor change in the function name. The function isCoordinate should be plural. Modified to be areCoordinates.

**Changes proposed:**
isCoordinate was modified to be areCoordinates I see what you are saying. Would it not be better to be consistent with good grammar when naming functions though? I suspect that although the other functions are named `isXXX`, they are grammatically correct. I feel like that would be more intuitive for other users that are using A-Frame when they are building their own apps to have function names to be grammatically correct. 😄  @dmarcos I would argue that developer ergonomics should be considered as well. When I first saw `isCoordinate` on the `AFRAME` global, I had to second guess and look up the docs/implementation. I didn't know if it was testing a single number or a string of numbers. Eliminating that confusion would be worth it IMO. Can you link to the type definition? I can't find it in the source. @dmarcos The more I think about it you are right, `areCoordinates` sounds like it might take an array as a param or multiple params to test them all. @kellyselden Good point. It does sound like you would input more than one set of coordinates if you have `areCoordinates`. 

@dmarcos Yeah you're right. Will change it.  When I rotate an entity it sometimes comes back with an e-notation number. For example, the number coming back was:

`-71.99999999999999 62.074139506678954 -1.5056867448590336e-22`

This number isn't recognized by isCoordinate and my entity would disappear.

I've modified the regex pattern to successfully match a number with e-notation.
 You're welcome :)  **Description:**
This allows customizing the size of the "perspective" screenshots taken by specifying the width and height e.g. <a-scene screenshot="width: 1024; height: 1024">. Before this only applied to "equirectangular" screenshots, and "perspective" just took the current dimensions of the scene canvas.

 I'm still seeing 3 GETS when using `<a-asset-item>` One consequence of this is that even with `<a-asset-item>` resources, it's difficult to reliably reason about download progress due to the abundance of non-meaningful XHR progress events. Thanks for the fix I was eager to try it. When I switch to current aframe-master.min I get: 
```
three.js:19131 DOMException: Failed to execute 'texImage2D' on 'WebGLRenderingContext': Tainted canvases may not be loaded.
```

Switching back to 0.5.0 fixes it. What is strange is not all images are affected. The assets are dynamically appended to `<a-assets>`. I am trying to build a simple demo of the issue.  Thanks for the quick reply. If you run this locally once and browser refresh it will raise this error. 
```
Failed to execute 'texImage2D' on 'WebGLRenderingContext': The cross-origin image at https://cdn.aframe.io/360-image-gallery-boilerplate/img/city.jpg

If you switch back to 0.5.0 there is no exception. I assumed it was related to a change in caching system.

I had pasted the wrong one above, fixed as you said by adding `crossorigin` in the original project. Ok might be my browser then. I go to https://aframe-2472.glitch.me/, refresh and get `Failed to execute 'texImage2D' on 'WebGLRenderingContext': The cross-origin image at`. Thanks for your help. I know I'm pushing but I asked some friends to test, it's def a bug found only in Chrome and yes it happens to all users. There is no issue on Firefox tho. Simply open your demo https://aframe-2472.glitch.me/, in chrome, and refresh. The result will be a  dark screen and a console error `Failed to execute 'texImage2D' on 'WebGLRenderingContext': The cross-origin image at ...`. 

Here's a recording of the steps above, running on most recent Chrome version using your demo. To trigger the dark screen I just refreshed `cmd+r`. 
http://recordit.co/qbmzxjwtlt I can confirm the behaviour @pasdoy reports on Chrome/Windows. The cross-origin image cannot be loaded as a texture when it is fetched from the disk cache. Works for me!

  just FYI, changes along these lines were rejected in the time of the Chromium bug (see #2217, this would be always fixing timestamps rather than detecting) -- but maybe folks will reconsider now that Nightly exhibits the issue...  **Description:**
I am creating an editor for HTML content where one building block is for aframe blocks. 
For this I am using an iframe to which the HTML code gets pushed via document.open/write/close.

If I push an aframe scene the first time, this works all fine. If I do it a second time, I get the error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot redefine property: vrEnabled
    at Function.defineProperty (<anonymous>)
    at M.enablePolyfill (webvr-polyfill.js:7699)

    at Object.<anonymous> (webvr-polyfill.js:1)
    at Object.50 (webvr-polyfill.js:7830)
```
 
I solved my problem by adding "configurable=true" to the aframe.js :

> WebVRPolyfill.prototype.enablePolyfill = function() {
>   // Provide navigator.getVRDisplays.
>   navigator.getVRDisplays = this.getVRDisplays.bind(this);
> 
>   // Provide the VRDisplay object.
>   window.VRDisplay = VRDisplay;
> 
>   // Provide navigator.vrEnabled.
>   var self = this;
>   Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'vrEnabled', {
>     configurable:true,

Anyway there should (or maybe is) another solution to fix that problem of reloading an  a-scene element?

Thanks!

Components don't have a reference to their system at `this.system`, it's a reference to a function named `newSystem`. This happens when the system is registered _before_ the component is registered.

Changing the order of registration (so component goes first, system seconds) yields the correct behavior.
 Hmm...not sure what you mean. I did this and they do `console.log` a similar object `NewSystem` containing `sceneEl`.
```
      AFRAME.registerSystem('system-before', {
        schema: {},
        init: function () {}
      });

      AFRAME.registerComponent('system-before', {

        }

``` Hi @dye784,

Check out this codepen: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PpdMxM

Popping out the console we can see that `this.system` is a function and not an object.

However, this other codepen (http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QpVeeK), which is exactly the same but with the system / component declaration reversed, we can see that `this.system` is the Object, as expected.

In the example below, I create some boxes dynamically (you have to look down, step back to see them). The right-hand ones are merged with the leftmost one.

When using WASD to move around (and mouse to look) notice that as soon as the leftmost box goes out of frame the other boxes _also disappear._ It's as if the clipping calculation has (correctly) determined that the leftmost box no longer needs to be drawn, but then also stops drawing the others.

At a guess, perhaps the bounding dimensions of the merged group are still considered to be the same as the bounding dimensions of the first box?

**BONUS BUG:** in this example, the number of boxes that appear seems to be related to how quickly you start looking around (i.e. bring them into frame). If you wait a few seconds you get all 10. If you start moving immediately you may only see 3 or 4.

When creating entities dynamically, if you attempt to merge them, they appear to take their world position/rotation rather than their parent position/rotation.

Here's an example. I create two sets of merged geometries. One is done manually in the HTML. Even though it is embedded inside a positioned/rotated parent, it works fine.

The other set of merged geometries is created dynamically. I have tried to mimic the manual HTML exactly. However you can see that the second box in the set, rather than being embedded inside the first in the set, is positioned 1m to the right. I believe it is getting this from the world co-ordinates.

 definitely~i'll look into it updated~ oh gotcha i wasn't using ruler. try now  I was confused for a moment when inspecting `AFRAME.utils.coordinates.isCoordinate` in the debugger. Seems it should be renamed (or aliased) to `areCoordinates`.

https://www.quora.com/Are-coordinates-plural-or-singular I take it that label means you agree? If so, are you worried about breaking changes? Should it be aliased with a deprecation warning? @dmarcos I like the idea of `isCoordinates`, saying "is of type `coordinates`". @kellyselden , @dmarcos That's a good point since it's supposed to be read as type of coordinates.  mchen [12:59 PM] 
interesting default camera Y height behavior with current master...

With Rift and latest Chromium, when using the auto-enter/exit VR, user height is correct both outside VR (default user height 1.6) and in VR (true HMD height), first time and every time.  That consistency is provided by #2428.

With Rift and latest Chromium, when manually clicking the enter VR button but not wearing the HMD, user height is correct outside VR (default user height 1.6) but wrong inside VR (e,g, camera placed higher than true HMD height once you put it on).

With Rift and latest Nightly, it appears that vrdisplayactivate is not working and therefore neither is auto-enter VR (i.e. you put on the Rift, see nothing, and still have to click the button).

With Rift and latest Nightly, when manually clicking the enter VR button but not wearing the HMD, user height is always 1.6 since it just goes fullscreen and doesn't try to enter VR at all.  In fact, it won't try to enter VR at all unless you reload the page.

With Rift and latest Nightly, when manually clicking the enter VR button while wearing the HMD, user height is correct outside VR (default user height 1.6) but wrong inside VR (e,g, camera placed lower than true HMD height once you put it on, apparently by 1.6 the default user height), first time and every time.  That consistency is provided by #2428.

So two apparent bugs:
(1) Nightly vrdisplayactivate is not working.
(2) Manually entering VR via UI button seems to have some issue with getting initial HMD position/height, and since applied as deltas by `look-controls`, that stays wrong while in VR. using http://chenz.org/vr-camera-height.html to avoid any potential issues with codepen,
same behavior above is seen.
 With Rift, 

if you place a breakpoint at src/components/look-controls.js line 214
and then evaluate some variables in console,

Nightly, which does *NOT* work properly, does *NOT* return stageParameters:

this.dolly.position  
`Object { x: 0.2644968032836914, y: -0.8083080649375916, z: -0.9467211961746216 }`
this.controls.getVRDisplay()  
`VRDisplay { isConnected: true, isPresenting: true, capabilities: VRDisplayCapabilities, stageParameters: null, displayId: 1, displayName: "Oculus VR HMD", depthNear: 0.005, depthFar: 10000 }`

Chromium, which works properly, does provide stageParameters:

this.dolly.position
`Vector3 {x: 0.009547733701765537, y: 0.5052434802055359, z: 0.014989607967436314}`
this.controls.getVRDisplay().stageParameters
`VRStageParameters {sittingToStandingTransform: Float32Array[16], sizeX: 2.0250000953674316, sizeZ: 2.0250000953674316}` With Vive,

if you place a breakpoint at src/components/look-controls.js line 214
and then evaluate some variables in console,

Nightly works properly, and stageParameters are returned:

 this.dolly.position  
 `Object { x: 0, y: 0.75, z: 0 }`  
 this.controls.getVRDisplay().stageParameters  
 `VRStageParameters { sittingToStandingTransform: [16], sizeX: 1, sizeZ: 1 }`

Chromium, which also works properly, does provide stageParameters:

this.dolly.position
`Vector3 {x: -1.1390511989593506, y: 0.31331753730773926, z: -0.6187263131141663}`
this.controls.getVRDisplay().stageParameters
`VRStageParameters {sittingToStandingTransform: Float32Array[16], sizeX: 0, sizeZ: 0}` So it appears that the camera height issue is result of a bug in Oculus Rift support in Nightly where the stageParameters are not returned on the VRDisplay, and so the code cannot correctly adjust for roomscale.

Who from Mozilla can confirm and address?  @kearwood?  @cvan? Thanks for spotting the missing stageParameters for Oculus.  Oculus wasn't capable of roomscale when we first implemented support.  Since then, we have updated to the newer Oculus SDK with support for the Oculus Guardian system and will be adding stageParameters for Oculus:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1344393

You can expect this to be implemented early next week. Great, thanks @kearwood!  While modernizing, it would be great to expose capacitive events for Oculus Touch, but that is probably a little more work. sorry I haven't had time yet - anyone had a chance to test latest Nightly with Rift for stageParameters? latest Nightly exhibits same behavior @kearwood Running latest Nightly, I now see that Rift HMD height is correct, but the Touch controllers are still in the floor the way the HMD used to be :-/  @kearwood thoughts? Codepen for the Y height issue which appears to now impact Touch controller, not HMD...
http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/aJNejw
@dmarcos @ngokevin @kearwood let me know if you would prefer to close this issue and open a new one on the controller.  (@fernandojsg do you see this with your recent A-Blast Touch changes?) I would think it's something like the room transform not being applied to the controller pose?  ie:

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/js/controls/VRControls.js#L127

 (not sure why that should differ across browsers though?) looks like tracked-controls should be doing this already?  (before my time though)
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/tracked-controls.js#L87
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/systems/tracked-controls.js#L17 patch for applying user height when null stageParameters in #2446 but should probably test with daydream controller to make sute it doesn't break 3DoF @machenmusik can we break that commit into a separate PR?   I think the emulation pieces need to be discussed in more detail before we can commit to those changes.   

I will give it a spin on daydream and report 

Hugely appreciate the patches! i think that commit may be separable, but you can try it on daydream now using chenzlabs master via rawgit (which I think I have codepen for...) Horray!   I just cherry picked the commit 53d72ca545367c1b7af7e4cd1e47f977cc95b831 and it seems to resolve the issue with the rift and also works with daydream as well. ok great!  i am tied up for some time, if you want to do a PR with just that cherry pick feel free - but I do think we should commit the rest of the changes needed to fully leverage recent Nightly support for Oculus Touch ASAP, or else the controllers still won't be entirely usable @machenmusik gotcha.  Will take a look at the rest of the PR. I got a few minutes to submit #2510  **Description:**

- A-Frame Version: 0.5.0
- Platform / Device: Mac / Chrome latest
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:

If I'm changing the visibility of an entity having children (ex. a-box,...)  the cursor is not able to click if the entity is set to visible.

Cursor
```
<a-cursor raycaster="recursive:true; objects: a-entity[visible='true'] *"  ... >
    ...
</a-cursor>
```

Entity
```
<a-entity visible="false">
    <a-box widht="2" height="2" depth="2" ...></a-box>
</a-entity>
```

Changing the visibility via JS and setAttribute('visible', 'true') no click events will be triggered.

Thank you for your help! Perfect! Thank you!  This PR adds support to #2513 for the different Oculus Touch controller mapping exhibited by the current Firefox Nightly build(s).  Note that Nightly is currently NOT exposing capacitive touch events as Chromium does; therefore, some `hand-controls` poses are more cumbersome since buttons need to be fully actuated rather than merely touched.

Per discussion, this PR no longer includes #2423 in its entirety, as another approach has been agreed to fix #2379. :)
Are you asking for docs change to provide a fuller explanation, or code change, or something else?  

The reason why `emulated` is needed is because per some of our original discussions on how to support multiple types of controllers, the strategy employed is to speculatively pre-attach the various components that could be used (`oculus-touch-controls` and `vive-controls`), and they are supposed to do nothing if their respective controllers are not present.  When #2314 committed changes to always attach event listeners, that broke the do-nothing contract, and so with both `oculus-touch-controls` and `vive-controls` attached, both components reacted to events that something like `tracked-controls` would generate, leading to e.g. double-event bug #2379.  If applications perform non-idempotent operations as a result of getting tracked controller events, the effects can be more significant.

To fix #2379, the do-nothing-by-default contract is restored, but then emulation / replaying needs some other mechanism to indicate that the events should be acted upon even though the physical controller is not present.  That is the `emulated` flag.  

Although, actually it turns out that for replay examples like https://ngokevin.github.io/kframe/scenes/aincraft/?avatar-recording=recording.json 
even #2314 was not really enough to allow correct functionality, because it is `tracked-controls` events that are actually being replayed, and `tracked-controls` was only injected when the controllers were physically present.  (in the example, you would not see the hand pose change.) -- you need to explicitly have `tracked-controls` present (but it must not match any actual controller, to avoid collisions in events between actual and replay), and if either #2446 or #2423 is included, then you need to add `emulated:true` to whichever one of `oculus-touch-controls` or `vive-controls` you'd like the replay to use.
 (@ngokevin said this: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2423#issuecomment-283795941) I liked @ngokevin 's commentary so added something along those lines to the docs, to @dmarcos 's point.

Anything more you'd like to do with this?  I think we can deprecate #2423 in favor of this one. @dmarcos per discussion on #2513...

> Note that Nightly is currently NOT exposing capacitive touch events as Chromium does; therefore, some hand-controls poses are more cumbersome since buttons need to be fully actuated rather than merely touched.

It appears that Nightly is currently exposing trigger as axis ONLY, so in order to generate typical button events (down/up, even if we ignore touch), there is no choice but to add some emulation code (see https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2446/commits/b2f803edb08a7e80886fe67749057d2ed39f400c) 
 update: latest nightly builds appear broken, however the 3-22 build has oculus touch mapping as 6 buttons and 2 axes (albeit without touch) - as that is same as chromium, may be able to simplify the mapping again.  closing this for now  > I feel after you release the trigger, the button value isn't completely at 0. But at a value close to 0. We need to introduce a threshold.

Thresholding probably belongs in browser, but could probably be done in component as workaround.  Was doing this to synthesize touches, sounds like it may be needed to generate real button presses?
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/oculus-touch-controls.js#L178
(Assuming you mean Touch here, but not Vive?)

> The models are also a bit too bright. They look flat-shaded. Maybe we can make the material less shiny / reflective / darker?

I agree that less shiny would be better; can/should someone with better modeling chops change them to GLTF as well? oh ok - so you want to steal the oculus-touch code and also apply threshold to buttons then?  **Description:**

When I add a WebVR origin trial token to my A-Frame application, the "cardboard mode" mode partly breaks. I still get a stereo image rendered, but the rotation of the phone is not translated to rotation in VR. As a result, the image is "stuck" in cardboard mode and the VR experience is broken.

I suspect this is related to some of the `isMobile()` checks in `look-controls` and elsewhere. It seems like A-Frame hasn't been updated to accommodate regular phones supporting the WebVR API yet.

Examples - must be opened in Chrome 56 on an Android phone to see the issue (enter VR mode):

- _Without_ the origin trial token (WebVR API is _not_ used): https://viewer.cimmerce.com/test/hello_world_regular.html
- _With_ the origin trial token (WebVR API _is_ used): https://viewer.cimmerce.com/test/hello_world_origin.html

Though these examples use A-Frame 0.5.0, my own app uses the newest master version of A-Frame, and has the same issue. I'd be happy to submit a PR, but I think some discussion is needed on how WebVR API support on phones should be handled going forward.

- A-Frame Version: 0.5.0
- Platform / Device: Chrome 56 on Android 6 (Samsung Galaxy S6)
 Yes, if I, in Android Chrome, enable WebVR at chrome://flags and visit
https://aframe.io/examples/ the issue is immediately appearant.

 I have just tested the A-Frame examples and my own A-Frame 0.5.0 app with Chrome 58 for Android with WebVR enabled in chrome://flags: It works!

I get a prompt to install Google VR Services when I enter the page, and after installing that, I can switch to "real" WebVR mode from the browser. Rendering is still not on par with the old "fake" WebVR mode, but hopefully the Chrome team is working on that.  **Description:**

This PR adds `responseType` attribute to `a-asset-item`.
It's necessary for `THREE.GLTFLoader` in r84. #2378
And it'll be helpful for user components which need `arraybuffer` data.

It has a limitation.
If we attempt to load the same data as different `responseType`s,
only the `responseType` of the first attempt is applied
because it loads from cache  if exists.

I think it won't cause any problems because
there's no situation that we wanna load the same data with different `responseType`s.
(If exists, let me know.)

**Changes proposed:**
- Add `responseType` attribute to `a-asset-item`. 
- Add `responseType` tests
 Thanks for the update!

I have a question.

You changed the order of

    THREE.Cache.remove(XHR_SRC);
    var assetItem = document.createElement('a-asset-item');

Is there any special reasons you needed to change?
And if so, we should change the order here, too?

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/3c074bdde332f3d28649eb9bbf3c3e207107fe9d/tests/core/a-assets.test.js#L276  **Description:**

The behavior of `setAttribute('component', {...}) changed starting with v0.4.0 such that array property types behave uniquely. 

1. Arrays are assigned by reference, so later changes to the variable that was passed in `setAttribute` will also be reflected in the component data
2. Updating an array property by passing it in an object to `setAttribute` will never trigger the component's `update` method (because it is assigned by reference [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-entity.js#L707) before the check for changes to call update [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/dec48d73bbe0d0189ae203eb12431ffc5521e0a2/src/core/component.js#L221))

See full discussion in #2227. 

**Changes proposed:**

- Document current behavior
- Add test cases to detect future changes in behavior

I also added documentation of the clobber update flag, but I can remove this if its not something you want in the docs. 
  "Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'isPlaying' of null" originally reported in #1483 still happens in rare cases. Upgrading to 0.5.0 does not fix this issue.

- Added check for self.parentEl before calling self.parentEl.isPlaying() to guard against edge cases where parent is null after dynamic DOM shuffling @ngokevin Hmm, that sounds reasonable – okay, I'll try to come up with a Codepen with the simplest possible reproduction. It may prove tricky as it is _quite_ an edge case (would probably only show up in limited scenarios, i.e. integrations) but I can definitely confirm there is still at least one more scenario where `self.parentEl` ends up null.

Apologies for the half-baked pull request!  This PR attempts to resolve #2394, which happens repeatedly on Rift and infrequently on Vive. @RSpace trying this blind as I can't test until weekend, if you have a chance to try it please comment with your findings @dmarcos see further discussion in #2394 -- the re-entry problem is avoided by not doing removeHeightOffset/addHeightOffset (which is what happens when you set userHeight to 0) or restoreCameraPose (which currently cannot be avoided).  A first workaround would be to also decline to change position/rotation in restoreCameraPose when userHeight is 0, but that does not seem to be the core problem... I can confirm that this PR fixes the issue. I no longer get the wrong height when entering VR the second and additional times on the Oculus Rift. I have also tested on other devices and seen no regressions:

* Oculus Rift, Win 10, Chromium VR Feb 17 build: OK 
* HTC Vive, Win 10, Chromium VR Feb 17 build: OK
* Gear VR, Android 6, Chrome 56: OK
* Cardboard, Android 6, Chrome 56: OK

Thanks a lot for finding and fixing the issue @machenmusik ! I definitely recommend merging this PR before next release. @dmarcos if this fixed it (yay!) the problem was that the delta application of pose that `look-controls` does was not being properly reset when exiting VR, which only manifests the second and subsequent times VR is entered. @RSpace thanks so much for the effort to verify especially regression check! @dmarcos have you had a chance to consider?  happy to say it definitely works.
http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/ZeGxZe  Fixes #2426

Microsoft Edge doesn't report HMD orientation before requestPresent (for  privacy reasons) which causes checkHeadsetConnected() to always return false; on Microsoft Edge, the 'Enter VR' button falls back to the fullscreen experience, and the content is not rendered in the HMD.

Fix it is to add a vrDisplay.isConnected check (if available) to get the correct answer from hardware.

 done  isn't flushToDOM() expensive? you should be able to move something without owning it, personally i think reparenting should be reserved for more durable reasons.  i think of it more like tractor beam unless you are really grabbing to wield, not grab-and-drop.  should be able to do tractor beam with 3DOF, if you are moving like in editor not purely physical analog, you want to be able to push and pull much farther than 6DOF range of motion, so trackpad/thumbstick anyway resyncing by using unmodified world position / rotation would only work if no new parent has nonzero offsets, right?   We have an a-entity with a number of children that we are trying to re-parent to the left or right Vive controller based on the menu pressed. When doing so we receive an TypeError from index.js:270 that states, "position is undefined"

We have tried the flushToDOM() call on the entity prior to the appendChild() that you recommend above. We have also tried the initial list of stuff above where we cloneNode() prior to appendChild() followed by removeChild(). Nothing has worked.

Here's the call stack if it helps,

document-register-element.js:2:4917` I've been working on a setup for re-parenting objects, including the camera. I want to do this to utilise the transform updates of the parent, but maintaining the worldspace of the child object as it is parented and unparented.

Use cases: an elevator or tray of objects. 

Keeping the worldspace transform and rotation of the child would allow a camera to step on an elevator, move freely whilst on it, then step off on a different floor seamlessly.

I found the following code works great for non-kinematic type objects. 

```
          child.object3D.parent.updateMatrixWorld();
          // remove child from scene and add it to parent
          THREE.SceneUtils.attach( child.object3D, child.sceneEl.object3D, parent.object3D );
```

When I test the code out with the camera, however, there's a transform jump as I transition on or off the parent object. It looks like the camera worldtransform is stuck at the initial spawn point. 

```

Any thoughts on how to resolve this? 
 What about some sort of temporary parent-constraint for when we don't want to mess with the scene hierarchy, inspired by [Maya](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/Maya/files/GUID-2FC0EE9E-A8D5-4B2A-A751-8B926389497A-htm.html)?

Here is an example component [on Glitch]( https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aframe-parent-constraint ). I haven't battle tested it yet but perhaps a start?

EDIT: original code was very broken, though this still can be optimized (especially num of vars)
EDIT2: fixed a couple of bugs
EDIT3: was subverting THREEjs transforms updating pattern. Updated to follow in line with use expectations.  (Per request, this PR no longer extends #2413 / #2415 to `oculus-touch-controls` as `thumbstickmoved`)

Should fix #2379.
 Verified on both Vive (via SteamVR/OpenVR support) and Touch (direct Oculus support) with latest experimental Chromium. Looks like a nice upgrade. After #2415 was merged, I noticed that the trigger on the HTC Vive also fires onAxisMove (z axis) events. Does this PR handle the trigger axis as 'triggermoved' or as 'trackpadmoved'? trigger is not an axis, it is a button with a value associated -- or at least that is the case with Chromium.  per discussion with @dmarcos in Slack, we should definitely avoid browser-specific ids and button/axis mappings if possible, bleah. `axismove` events should have been fired before #2415 as well, meaning that you could easily handle `axismove` yourself if need be.  but for buttons with values, as trigger should be (and grip for Touch as well), it looks like no specific event was fired when the value changed, only the more generic `buttonchanged` that is also fired on up/down/touchstart/touchend. Ok, so 'buttonchanged' still needs to be fired correctly for this specific case (htc vive trigger), with the correct value? Does the oculus touch grip work like this already? `buttonchanged` should be firing now, see https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/tracked-controls.js#L151

oculus-touch-controls and vive-controls provide mappings to friendly names for up/down/touchstart/touchend, but looks like they don't handle changed.  that can be added, but would like to settle the button/axis disparity between Chromium and Nightly first to avoid redoing work.  @dmarcos any more word from Gecko folks? @cmvanb if you have time in next few days, can you confirm which environments (browser / HMD+controllers) receive events such as `triggerchanged` with the latest PR? I can test FF nightly + Vive for you. I will also try Chromium + Vive, although Chromium didn't work last time I tried. Will do that tonight or tomorrow. I don't have an Oculus to test with. (FYI, there is a brand new experimental chromium that resolves previous issues with latest steamvr) I tested the branch with vive + FF nightly 54.0a1 (2017-02-23) (64-bit).

When clicking the trackpad, 'trackpadchanged' event is fired (multiple times/frames) as expected.
When sliding a finger over the trackpad, 'trackpadmoved' event (multiple times/frames) is fired as expected. The x/y values are correct.
When pulling the trigger down (fast), several events are fired in this order:
'trackpadmoved'
'trackpadmoved'
'triggerdown'
'triggerchanged'
'trackpadmoved'
'triggerchanged'

On releasing the trigger:
'trackpadmoved'
'triggerup'
'triggerchanged'
'trackpadmoved'
'triggerchanged'

It seems like the 'trackpadmoved' event is still being fired for the trigger. Otherwise, the values seem correct to me.

PS: Chromium still isn't working for me. I'm using the version made available here: https://webvr.info/get-chrome/ thanks @cmvanb !

I believe there is currently a fundamental difference in how the latest experimental Chromium and Nightly model Vive and Touch expose controllers with respect to buttons and axes.

Chromium represents trigger (Vive and Touch) as a button that has an analog value, and not as an axis... same thing for grip on Touch.  The only axes are trackpad (Vive) and thumbstick (touch).

Nightly appears to be representing buttons that have analog values (like trigger) as axes, for example the new Oculus Touch support was exposing controllers with 3 buttons and 4 axes in Nightly, rather than the 6 buttons and 2 axes in Chromium,  This causes problems since `axismove` events are currently fired by `tracked-controls` when trigger changes, with no indication of which axes changed.

@cmvanb can you confirm whether the `triggerchanged` button state provides an analog value using Nightly?  If not, then even the button events are inconsistent, so suppressing spurious `trackpadmoved` events would not suffice.

IMO it is highly undesirable to have browser-specific gamepad API mappings for the same controllers on the same machine.  @cvan @kearwood @toji - would appreciate your thoughts on how best to resolve discrepancies. Easiest way to "split" the axismove handling is to simply comment out the onAxisMoved handler, in which case the code won't fire.  but remember there is already a different version of axismove committed into master for vive only, not for oculus, so we'd be disabling that vive-only functionality by doing so so rather than split out the axismove handling, I added axis change propagation, which allows culling of spurious moves. @cmvanb if you get the chance, can you check to see whether the latest version of this PR prevents the spurious `trackpadmoved` events you were seeing before? @dmarcos relayed discussion with Mozillans where different Oculus Touch button/axis mapping is not likely to change soon (unlike id string).  Can I urge Mozillans to reconsider?  At least make analog buttons like trigger and grip generate actual button events, rather than treating them like sliders... otherwise even simple trigger button down/up will become unreliable See https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2446#issuecomment-283754949 @ngokevin you might actually be better off also capturing emitted events from `oculus-touch-controls` and `vive-controls` (perhaps daydream and gearvr, not sure about leap hands) as well as those from tracked-controls, at which point you don't even need emulated true, you just need the app to be paying attention. should we deprecate this in favor of #2446? Right.  if you merge this PR, #2446 will simplify itself :-) so which things between this and #2446 want to be separate PRs?  there is some overlap so may be nontrivial (e.g. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2423#issuecomment-283206116), and i am tied up for a little while

i think we definitely want the fix for #2448 that @caseyyee confirmed via cherry-pick, that one is easy (now #2510), but maybe not entirely done with Nightly Rift+Touch without #2446

i think we need to fix the double-event issue introduced unless we move back to `auto-detect-controllers` paradigm, and IIRC the axismove changes here are needed now to prevent spurious events from prior vive-specific PR / Nightly having control elements be both buttons and axes, so a bit hesitant to separate temporarily only to have them merged back together shortly w.r.t. separating PRs: I think these delineations would work

- cherry-picked #2510 - already done

- axismove and nightly touch support - need new mapping structure for both

- emulated

may get a chance to look at that late this evening.  A-Frame inspector logic to export an entity (currently inside the [getClipboardRepresentation()](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector/blob/4a442d0ca566f7435519c090254d7bd8fb3a1c50/src/actions/entity.js#L142) action) could be simplified if optimisations based on removing implicit components and default values are in A-Frame. This way, the representation which depends on A-Frame entity internals is decoupled from the inspector.  i am using react class to add dynamic elements 

cameraPosition(){
    var cameraEl = document.querySelector('#camera');
    var worldPos = new THREE.Vector3();
    worldPos.setFromMatrixPosition(cameraEl.object3D.matrixWorld);
    return (worldPos);
  }

  handler(){
    var el=$('a-scene');
    var pos=this.cameraPosition()
    var position=pos.x+" "+pos.y+" "+pos.z;
    var newEL=$('<a-cylinder  position="'+position+'" id="data-'+this.state.count+'"click-drag color="green" ></a-cylinder>').on('click',function(){
      $(this).on('dragend',function(data){
        console.log(data)
      })
    })
    el.append(newEL);
    this.setState({count:this.state.count+1});
  }


but the newly created element doesn't  register the component click-drag I'm not sure, but a couple of thoughts come to mind:

Firstly, I would see if the component registers if you add it _after_ appending it to the DOM (by using .setAttribute).

Secondly, I would try adding the node using native DOM methods, rather than jQuery. It's possible the way jQuery manipulates the DOM isn't genial to how A-Frame listens for new scene nodes. A-Frame is not magic and does not, to my knowledge, use generic DOM mutation events to discover changes - it wraps specific DOM methods with interceptors that trigger Three.js operations.

(I wish the project was more clear about this, however - at present it's quite hard to use DOM scripting confidently because it's difficult to reason about what A-Frame expects).

As an aside, though - why are using jQuery in a React project? React already 'does' DOM manipulation. The whole purpose of JSX is to not have to create awkwardly interpolated template strings everywhere. Using jQuery in a React project is like buying a Ferrari and then taking it around town on the back of a flatbed truck.  **Description:**

`a-asset-item` is for preloading and caching assets.
But glTF data consists of glTF file and other files specified in the glTF file, like
.bin, .glsl, image(texture) files.

`<a-asset-item id="model" src="something.gltf"></a-asset-item>` preloads only .glTF file.

How can we preload all the involved files?

Do we make glTF special `a-asset-item` in which it loads glTF with `THREE.GLTFLoader` ?

- A-Frame Version: 0.5.0
- Platform / Device: Any
 > Does this block #2378?

No, different topics.

Yep, this isn't serious issue (yet) and isn't glTF specific.
I agree with adding `type="model"` property. (Or `all`?)
Let's keep discussing slowly to see if it's ok and there's any other better ways.
 we could infer from the `src` attribute that it's a glTF and do some superficial parsing to extract the assets and preload 'em so they're at least in the browser cache when the GLTFLoader does the heavy lifting? Seems to me that, assuming it's possible, the use of .glb (single file) should be encouraged if folks want to be able to preload as a generic single file?  

If taking the approach of having asset items invoke loaders, maybe just a preload boolean in the loaders (or some other not-horrible way the components should know).  If we use video as an comparative use case, if you want to preload video, you usually specify as element within a-assets, then reference by selector when you use it. +1 for focusing on .glb now that it's easy enough to make that happen.

A suggestion:
- optional field for asset items identifying the event name they wait for (e.g. `loaded`, `model-loaded`, `materialtextureloaded`)
- asset item types that are well known like image, video sound should have appropriate events utilized
- model parsing should fire an event when done, if it doesn't already, so it would be simple to wait for per the above  For example, make it less error prone for your app to stay in sync with upstream changes to `DEFAULT_CAMERA_HEIGHT`. My app is updating the position of a camera, and needs to keep the `DEFAULT_CAMERA_HEIGHT` around to offset the Y param when setting, because the camera is auto adding 1.6 to the Y. Otherwise, the Y param of the camera jumps by +1.6 every time I set it. Are you looking for this value?
`document.querySelector('[camera]').components.camera.data.userHeight`
 Perhaps you can set the camera user height property to zero to avoid the offset?

http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/QdewNZ >Are you looking for this value?
document.querySelector('[camera]').components.camera.data.userHeight

It would be nice to have the value before the camera is rendered.

> Perhaps you can set the camera user height property to zero to avoid the offset?

I want to use the default user height.

My flow is as follows:

```hbs
<a-camera position={{position}}></a-camera> // y = 0
```

```js
let position = document.querySelector('[camera]').getAttribute('position'); // y = 1.6
```

```hbs
<a-camera position={{position}}></a-camera> // y = 1.6
```

```js
let position = document.querySelector('[camera]').getAttribute('position'); // y = 3.2
``` > You can access the default value before initialization like this: AFRAME.components.camera.schema.userHeight.default

@dmarcos I saw that value when sniffing, but it only ever shows 0 for me. Even when on desktop and without a camera or scene. given that the default user height is not coming from VR or HMD setup, but is instead a hardcoded value, perhaps to avoid the offset issue, you can handle user height yourself and don't let the framework code mess things up for you. > Can you use cameraEl.getAttribute('camera').userHeight to get the value?

@ngokevin mentioned up here https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2418#issuecomment-281202407

That is the right value, but it would be very convenient to have that value after I import aframe, but before I start rendering the scene/generating html. it looks like because of the way handlebars is being used, you'd like to remove (subtract) the user height offset, but that rather than simply setting userHeight to zero so that no offset is applied, you'd like to be able to access the default user height value.  Assuming that's the case, and you would therefore use @dmarcos suggestion except that you see the wrong value at present, perhaps that should be filed as a bug so that the behavior can be corrected for you, rather than asking for internal constants to be exposed? interesting: 
- the default camera userHeight is, in fact, zero.
- if no camera is defined, and one is therefore injected into the scene, it gets a userHeight of 1.6, which is the value of an unexposed constant.
- because the userHeight is only set to non-default value upon injection, it is not available at time of `loaded` event, however it is available at `renderstart`

 @machenmusik You are right, there may be a bug somewhere in here that I am trying to work around, but I'm so new to Aframe so I just hacked around it for the time being. I think what I observed was if you initially render this

`<a-camera position="0 0 0">`

position Y evaluates to 1.6. Then if you change it after render using handlebars (ember.js might remove the element and re-add it) to this

`<a-camera position="5 0 6">`

position Y evaluates to 0 now, because after initial render, Aframe stops autopositioning the Y param.

(my workaround code if anyone is interested)

https://github.com/kellyselden/ember-a-frame/blob/v0.0.2/tests/dummy/app/components/my-camera.js#L46-L52 A simpler approach may be to use something similar to the previous snippet to get the default userHeight from the injected camera, then modify said camera by setting userHeight to 0 so that offsets will no longer be applied, and to whatever subsequent Y values you want.  But I'm not sure that is necessary since the default userHeight is hardcoded to 1.6, so you don't really need to wait for renderstart since you know what you are going to get back. > But I'm not sure that is necessary since the default userHeight is hardcoded to 1.6, so you don't really need to wait for renderstart since you know what you are going to get back.

This is the original issue. I know the hardcoded value is 1.6, but to make my app less brittle, I'd like to get the value from the framework in case it ever gets tweaked. OK, then go ahead and wait for renderstart... e.g.

> That is the right value, but it would be very convenient to have that value after I import aframe, but before I start rendering the scene/generating html.

I feel like we are going in circles. I've laid out the use case why it would be nice to have the value as a constant and not a runtime calculated value. The remaining question is whether it is worth it for you all to expose it. @ngokevin It was mentioned above that `AFRAME.components.camera.schema.userHeight.default` should have it, but it is only ever zero in my testing, when it seems like it should be 1.6. Maybe there's bug there where it is not 1.6 when it is supposed to be? If so, that would be a good alternative to a public constants section. @kellyselden - @ngokevin statement matches my observations above https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2418#issuecomment-282892629 it seems that you want two things to happen:

1 - let aframe pick the default camera height

2 - let your code set the height to the value it wants

and that due to your current methodology, you would need a private constant due to the default camera having a non-zero userHeight offset value.

the codepen above is an alternative method that still satisfies 1 and 2, but removes the requirement for the private constant to be exposed to your code, because the camera userHeight gets set to zero and thus you no longer need to offset the desired Y value by the userHeight.

without understanding more about your specific use case, it isn't clear why the alternate method does not suffice.
 Closing for now. @machenmusik's workaround is better than my workaround. It makes waiting for first render not as bad as before. Will reopen if any new info arises.  what's this ? a custom element ?

``` Thanks for your reply!  **Description:**
Exposes 'axismove' events from tracked-controls component in vive-controls as 'trackpadmoved'.

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2413

**Changes proposed:**
- add onAxisMoved event listener function, which exposes the underlying event
 really we should do this for any controller button with axes, right? stated properly... in thinking about this a little more after having coffee, i think what we currently lack is a proper mapping of axes to buttons (or lack thereof) - as an example, if a controller had both 2-axis depressable stick (touch style) and 2-axis trackpad (vive style) we might want button mappings thumbstick and trackpad, and axismove events would ideally be mapped to thumbstick and trackpad as appropriate.

but in current degenerate state, maybe hardcoding it for those controllers is okay for now. i am kinda indifferent to turning axis values into a map, the nice thing about array representation is it supports 1D, 2D and in theory 3D Updated PR per review comments. should event be trackpadmove, along the lines of mousedown/up/move? @dmarcos #2379 may make this tricky to support correctly on touch as well, have you folks made any progress in fixing? i think there may be confusion issues due to #2379 (@dmarcos since you changed listeners to be attached always, an entity that has both vive and touch controls will emit both vive and touch events on axismove) but following the pattern it should be straightforward to adopt similar for touch (thumbstickmoved).  might be worth generalizing all that to gamepads though since it has nothing to do with tracked controls pose  This is done, right?  Although there seem to be some spurious events firing per discussion on #2423   If the type is explicitly given or inferred, the normalisation procedure of a schema property should also normalise its default value making it pass through the `parse` function. This would allow using the attribute string representation as the default value (see bug #2410)

``` Cool. Will work on this one.   I think it would be nice if we could add a inline help into the data scheme for component/system. Thus devs can describe how to use each data field of their components and making them easier to reuse by others devs.

The format of the help string may be plaintext or markdown.

usecase: Thus one can easily extracts it. e.g. to be display in the inspector. to play with a component from the inspector is very nice to learn

usecase 2: automatic generation of documentation. e.g. we autogenerate a markdown output, and then copy that directly a github README.md   I consider accessing sub objects pretty important. It would allow users to pack all (or many) objects in just one scene, so it can be much more convenient both authoring the assets and loading them (with the additional benefit of having only one request). Also, I can imagine a lot of cases where you want to access to a subobject for changing its properties. Think for example, changing the color of a button of a controller, rotating a head, fading out a tooltip..)

A-Frame helps user to layout and customize basic objects very easily in a declarative way, but when it comes to full, complex or simple 3d models, it just load them and tell the user: "ok, now you are alone with this object and threejs, I won't help you any more". And I think that is a big barrier for many users.

I think we could help in two ways:

1. Adding a model-object component like the one suggested in this issue. Declarative, easy, very A-Framey.

2.  Adding a lightweight abstraction API of threejs tightly coupled to the A-Frame component structure, introduced by @dmarcos in his lastest post. I initially thought of something like this:

```javascript
get(selector)
setVisible(selector, visible)
hide(selector)
show(selector)
toggleVisible(selector)    
remove(selector)
setMaterial(selector, material)
setLambert(selector, params)
setPhong(selector, params)
setConstant(selector, params)
fadeTo(selector, to, duration, delay)
fadeIn(selector, duration, delay)
fadeOut(selector, duration, delay)
setMaterialParameters(selector, params)
setShape(selector, shape, weight, duration, delay) //shape keys
play(selector, animation, delay) //animations
stop(selector)
getMaterials(selector) //keyed array with of all materials

properties: 
.loaded // model is loaded
.materials[] // keyed array with all materials
.meshes[] // keyed array with all objects
```

* parameter `selector` can be a string or an array of strings, for selecting objects by name. Regexp could be an option too. 

Example of use:
```javascript
      AFRAME.registerComponent('mycomponent', {
        modelLoaded: function(evt) {
          this.setLambert('cube1', {color:'red'});
          this.setPhong('cube2', {color:'green'});
          this.setMaterialParameters('head', {map:'#facetex2'});
          this.setShape('face', 'mouthopen', 1, 2});
          this.fadeOut('sphere', 5, 10);
        },
        tick: function (time, delta) {
          if (!this.loaded) { return; }
          this.meshes['chair'].position.x = Math.sin(time / 100) * 0.1;
        }
      })
```

(of course this is not a very well thought implementation, take it as a simple and naive first approach) Another way I was thinking of this was to make the model loader create A-frame entities with selector-friendly id values from the sub-object names, which is along the lines of loading a scene or hierarchy rather than object by object

Sorry just realized @donmccurdy said much the same, apologies for duplication So maybe a hierarchical loader that is different, that would unpack into an entity tree... model-tree?  Separate from single-entity loaders to avoid confusion. Yeah I think preserving structure is important in many use cases, for example when you want to grab references to joints for a skinned mesh.

I like the idea of 2 components, 1 for cloning individual objects out of the model (the original thing proposed above) and 1 for making existing objects in the model hierarchy selectable and configurable with components.

For example:
```html
<a-assets>
  <a-asset-item id="room" src="room.gltf"></a-asset-item>
  <a-asset-item id="avatar" src="avatar.gltf"></a-asset-item>
</a-assets>

<!-- clone the mesh named "chair" from room.gltf into the scene -->
<a-entity model-object="from:#room; obj:chair"></a-entity>

<!-- Make references to  the specific named nodes inside avatar.gltf available as aframe entities -->
<a-entity id="player" gltf-model="#avatar">
  <a-entity id="head" camera look-controls wasd-controls></a-entity>
  <a-entity id="left-hand" model-selector="left_hand_joint" hand-controls="left"></a-entity>
  <a-entity id="right-hand" model-selector="left_hand_joint" hand-controls="right"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

This is nicer than the approach of just inflating all entities as it both saves you the overhead of doing so and also allows you to declaritively configure the components to bind to parts of the model.

I see 2 tricky bits here:
1. The 1:1 mapping of the ThreeJS hierarchy to the aframe hierarchy is broken down a bit here, the `model-selector` entities actually represent some entities that might be deeply nested in the parent's structure but only show 1 level of nesting in aframe. Not sure how this would be done without adding some hacks to `setObject3D`.
2. Ideally there would be a way to defer initializing the other components on the entity until the model has loaded in a way that doesn't require those components to know they are dealing with entities inflated from a model file. Maybe this could be solved by doing something similar to `aframe-template-component` like:

```html
<a-assets>
  <a-asset-item id="avatar" src="avatar.gltf">
  </a-asset-item>
  <script id="avatar-selector-tempalte">
    <a-entity id="head" camera look-controls wasd-controls></a-entity>
    <a-entity id="left-hand" model-selector="left_hand_joint" hand-controls="left"></a-entity>
    <a-entity id="right-hand" model-selector="left_hand_joint" hand-controls="right"></a-entity>
  </script>
</a-assets>

<a-entity id="player" gltf-model="src: #avatar selector-template: #avatar-selector-template"></a-entity>
``` @ngokevin this is cool for handling the first case, where you want to clone individual objects out of a gltf file, but doesn't work for the case where you only want to reference nodes but keep them in their original hierarchy. My current usecase for this is referencing joints for skinned meshes and specific materials. Yep, that's what I am doing now, would just be nice to have some declarative way to get at these so reusable components (with no knowledge that they are operating on some deeply nested node) could be added to them.  the pool component is creating the pool of entities twice. 

in init and in the update that runs after init. 

`if (oldData.mixin !== data.mixin || oldData.size !== data.size)` (line 43)  is returning true and triggering a second pool to be created. (I think because oldData has no value on this first run of update?)

Hi bro's
Today, an another tricky question. 
I notice, asset managment system trigger for each asset ( img , video ....) an another XHR request making impossible to check each asset loading state
In extenso: 2 times img xhr make the first img ( dom element ) having complete state to true whereas the img is not complete. 
The second fact is that it makes 2 load from 2 initiator making event handling on loading state and ready state wrong anytime. 
2 solutions: Let dom handle Xhr's Requests for IMG and VIDEOS and then update three.js texture with img or video blob (making partial video stream possible ).
You will probably have to listen to DOMMutations on a-assets
The second one is to create diffrents Events for video and img loading and complete and attach those events on elements, but it won't correct Double Loading ( Thx to Aframe Asset Managment System ).

When I develop locally using `aframe.min.js`, it doesn't look as though any of the SDF fonts get loaded. When I switch to `aframe-master.min.js`, the fonts are fetched by XHR. 

This confused me a little when first developing. Does this file need to be patched / updated?

 The font data is not contained within the aframe JS, they are loaded via CDN.

You raise a good point / question of whether the default font should be fully embedded, but doing that may increase the size of JS file as well as penalizing those that only want to use custom fonts.

@dmarcos @ngokevin was there some issue in creating the aframe-v0.5.0.min.js file, that does not exist in aframe-master.min.js? @machenmusik - it wasn't that I expected the script to directly embed the font file; rather that I expected the script to fetch the font by AJAX, like the `master` bundle. I assume this is the intended behavior whatever the release. if you are loading your web page from file system, there may be a security permissions issue.
are you using a local server e.g. `npm start`? 

see this codepen which works with aframe.min.js:
http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/rjXNmq per https://github.com/aframevr/aframe#builds ...

To use the latest stable build of A-Frame, include aframe.min.js:

```
<head>
  <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
</head>
``` @machenmusik I was operating the page from a local webserver, yes. I didn't see any permissions issues in the console - in fact, the network tab showed no outbound XHRs for fonts at all (e.g. to `cdn.aframe.io/fonts/Roboto-msdf.json`). It was very curious.

In the end, I just used the master build, and now text renders absolutely fine. I have never used the dist/aframe-v0.5.0.min.js file, not sure it is built correctly... @dmarcos @ngokevin?
When you said aframe.min.js, I thought you meant https://aframe.io/releases/0.5.0/aframe.min.js which seems to work fine as shown in codepen. I cannot replicate the issue any longer.

See this jsbin - https://output.jsbin.com/becumezaya/1 - where I'm pulling in the version of `aframe-v0.5.0.min.js` that was committed with the [0.5.0 release](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/110055d70ec0fa870ea566b9705406498431ab54#diff-374fe7cddd9a8e5ffec5bb33cc6f4c18) (#110055d). The fonts render absolutely fine. Looking at the network panel for font requests, all seems well.

I'm really at a loss to explain my problem. The only thing that occurs to me is that I my local network connectivity is poor - I'm part of a large team that right now has to share a single consumer-grade broadband connection, using a single consumer-grade router. Perhaps my font requests were just the victim of QOS or something? Or perhaps our poor router just couldn't handle all the connections.

I've seen delays in font rendering before - is there a way to make A-Frame wait for font assets before rendering? Would adding them as `a-asset-item`s work?  the reason to have the check inside setMap is to handle the case where the property has changed in between the original call and the texture load that results in setMap (i.e. if you asked a texture to be loaded then changed it before the load completes, don't apply the texture in setMap)

removing it will cause a regression and hard to trace errors... it seems that the check to avoid redundant texture load operations wouldn't work then, also not sure it would work correctly for cases whether multiple textures being loaded for same material/shader.

what in #2393 annoys you? probably some way to make the falsy possibilities (specifically null and empty string) unified before the setMap check, if that is what was ugly to you @dmarcos take a look at latest #2393 ?  should be much more comprehensible    One suggestion for a topic: what are the goals for the impact that A-Frame has outside of code base deliverables?

For example, we would like to enable x number of web developers who have no prior 3D/VR experience to be able to rapidly prototype applications; or y number of useable A-Frame projects are built, or support for A-Frame on z devices.

It doesn't need to be this specific to start, but it'd be very helpful even to have a basic discussion. The outcome of this discussion would be actionable items that regional advocates can implement to drive them forward, such as meetups or hackathons around topic  x, y, or z, and for a basic agreed upon mechanism to measure the progress of these efforts.  Fixes #2388  easiest way to test - run local instance with this change via `npm start`, and load @fernandojsg's codepen on same machine, changing aframe script src to `http://localhost:9000/build/aframe.js` ok, LGTM now... @dmarcos take a look at latest? should be much more comprehensible specifically, latest added comments try to better explain why having a single remembrance of last texture load attempt is insufficient, per discussion on #2402 LGTM... @dmarcos ?  Thanks for your work on this. Sometimes it's hard to make sense why a model isn't showing up correctly, and this will prove really useful. For example, I have a collada model with some squishy stretch marks which may be related to bump/normal maps. I'll remove them tonight and see if the problem persists. Hi @donmccurdy, if I understand it correctly this issue is open to add a new section on https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/introduction/faq.html page, may be right after "Which 3D model formats work?" section?  **Description:**

  },  **Description:** Regarding the file size of the final build I would like to make a few suggestions on how to reduce it.

- A-Frame Version: 0.5.0

First of all I think A-Frame is a great piece of software. It's API over the DOM elements was very novel for me and IMHO it's great to build even complex, fast and maintainable applications. So keep doing! Hope I can help with some PRs on the way. 👍 

So let's talk about some ideas in how to improve the final build size.

- *Remove `warn`, `console.warn` and other similar calls in the final build.* Similar to React I IMO it's nice practice to have code warnings to help developers only in the development and not production/minified version of A-Frame. Played around with this a little and was able to reduce file size by 20 KB. Finding more parts of the code only used for improving developer experience can increase this savings even more.

- *Do not include the whole package.json.* Have the version numbers of A-Frame and three.js is again really useful in development. However I thinks it's not necessary to include the whole package.json into the build. This can either be fixed by a similar matter like in the first suggestion, or by defining global variables read from the package file to get included in the build as simple variables.

Maybe you have other ideas and ways in mind how to further improve the build size? Happy to hear what you think.
 Thanks for the quick reply.

> A-Frame doesn't require use of a bundler

Talking about JSX, you're probably right. This language extension needs a proper build process. But essentially React also works without any build process at all by using `React.createElement` or the [`React.createFactory`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-api.html#createfactory) methods.

> My vote would be to avoid introducing separate production and development builds, because for many users just opening the JS console is an "AHA" moment.

I totally agree with this. And I favor libraries working with schema validations and developer warnings to improve performance and reduce errors. My proposal however would be to use the minified version of A-Frame also as the production build (which IMHO goes hand in hand), similar to how React or other libraries are doing it when you use the minified version from some CDN. React also claims to have better performance in the minified version by removing for example component property validation. Maybe similar techniques are also possible with A-Frame?

In short: IMO the minified version is also the production build and should as such be as small and performant as possible, while the development build is the unminified version providing better developer experience.

> Perhaps we could consider moving from Browserify to Webpack or Rollup (I believe the latter two support tree-shaking?).

Thought the same and would like to create a PR for moving to Webpack if appropriate. > As Don said, React is a different ecosystem where you're pretty much mandated to use build tools. Even though you could theoretically do it, no one uses React without build tools.

To be clear, I don't want use React to compare the build process. I agree, that A-Frame should be useable without one. What I wanted to compare is the difference between production and development build, between minified and unminified version of A-Frame.

> I'd be interested in seeing the build size comparisons, and I do prefer Webpack, but I don't think you save much size besides the tiny overhead for each module.

I think that this is better than nothing. We want to use A-Frame to be able to quickly build 3D embeds into bigger editorial articles working both on desktop and mobile. We are happy about every byte we can spare on the way.

One thing I'd like to add is the compatibility with other Webpack, Rollup and browserify setups. I would like to use the refactoring to also make it easier to include A-Frame and Three.js into an existing build process. This would also solve issues like https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1989 or https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1041. **AFAIK this will not mean to break compatibility with CDN usage. My goal would be to have the same build steps and build files exporting to global, like before.**

If you have any more feedback, don't hesitate to share it. A quick update: Worked on the refactoring for a while now and was able to reduce the file size of the minified build to 976 kB (268 kB gzipped). This build still includes the warnings. So there is a bit more, we can gain.

Though I still have a problem with using this build in the examples due to a weird behaviour of the Webpack `style-loader`. Hope to be able to fix it soon. @donmccurdy very nice findings. Will try to tackle what is possible with Webpack. Especially the working on the size of the SVG files sounds promising.

> The size of the assets that the average VR application is going to load will make a-frame build size negligible in comparison.

@dmarcos Agree on this. We just had the problem of creating low-poly meshes to reduce script size. Nice to know, that the controllers can be simplified, too.

> Can you provide more info about your particular use case? How big is the a-frame build compared to other assets that your average embed loads?

I'm working for the interactive team of an online news site and we plan to create more 3D and VR visualisations to enhance reading experience. More than 50 % of our users surf the website with a mobile device, therefore the size of assets is very important for us. The average size of embed assets is between 60 to 200 kB. But we are aware that WebGL based experiences come with some overhead. However as I said we are happy for every byte we can spare. I'm very sorry, but my job situation changed and I'm therefore not able to spend so much time on this issue any longer. I'll try to find time in the coming month to create a WIP PR to share my current state with implementing Webpack.  The example scene has a texture that isn't available and have entities positioned on the camera. Newcomers might wonder what's "wrong".

**Description:** fixed the simple scene

**Changes proposed:**
- remove the texture
- positioned entities properly

 The accepted answer works. After upping my inotify max watches I was able to run ```npm start``` and with active reloading and nodejs running stable.

For future reference this is the command used. You probably can also use ```npm dedupe``` to reduce the number of files that Grunt wants to keep an eye on.

 Reached the same conclusion, too heavy for that very specific use case, wondering if someone has a lighter solution. Yes it's precisely what I did before cf https://twitter.com/utopiah/status/831496563780378625 so... in case others stumble upon the same issues:

I'm getting this error-message when I'm opening any Scene that uses A-Frame 0.5.0 on my iPhone 6s.

<img width="962" alt="screen shot 2017-02-14 at 11 55 43" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/125398/22926492/0f954ed4-f2ad-11e6-8f3f-2566c7516af1.png">

It's a bug in the WebVR Polyfill, but I'm reporting it here because it looks like this fork of the Polyfill is only used for A-Frame:
https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill#a02a808 (probably related to #2008 and #2352 )

In @dmarcos version the path to the dpdb.json is relative, not absolute like in the master of the WebVR Polyfill.

The JSON is getting required by `var ONLINE_DPDB_URL = require('./dpdb.json');` so ONLINE_DPDB_URL already is the JSON object, not a path to a JSON file like in the polyfill master. 

The Bug is that the url in the xhr-request  `xhr.open('GET', ONLINE_DPDB_URL, true);` is the required JSON object - not a URL -  which is the cause for the 404 error. There's no need for the xhr-request because the JSON object is already stored in ONLINE_DPDB_URL.

The Bug is in https://github.com/dmarcos/webvr-polyfill/blob/master/src/dpdb/dpdb.js#L22 line 22-61


 Also the commit referenced here `"webvr-polyfill": "dmarcos/webvr-polyfill#a02a8089b"` in the package.json of a-frame  doesn't exist. It should be `#a02a808` instead of `#a02a8089b`.
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/package.json#L43 Hi @dmarcos ,
the bug probably occurs on all mobile devices. I only tested it with my old iPhone 5 and my 6s Plus, but since it fails to load the online DPDB (which should happen on both Android and iOS) you should be able to reproduce it on an Android phone...

On desktop i can reproduce the Bug when I use the Custom User Agent "iPhone" in the 'Responsive Design Mode' in the Firefox Dev Tools. This makes the polyfill return true when running the isMobile and isIOS checks.

1. Open https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/helloworld/ in Firefox
2. Open DevTools and enter 'Responsive Design Mode'
3. Write "iPhone" in the 'Custom User Agent' field 
4. Reload the page

When I do this, I'm getting the same error-messages that I get on my iPhone: 
- Error loading online DPDB
- And the 404

    this.onDeviceParamsUpdated = onDeviceParamsUpdated;

    // BUGFIX: Use the JSON object already stored in ONLINE_DPDB_URL 
    // after requiring './dpdb.json' instead of making a XMLHttpRequest with the Object as URL
    this.dpdb = ONLINE_DPDB_URL;
    if (this.dpdb) {
      this.recalculateDeviceParams_();
    } else {
      // Error loading the DPDB.

    xhr.open('GET', ONLINE_DPDB_URL, true);
    xhr.addEventListener('load', function() {
      obj.loading = false;
      if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status <= 299) {
        // Success.
        obj.dpdb = JSON.parse(xhr.response);
        obj.recalculateDeviceParams_();
      } else {

``` Got the same error on Chrome running on Android...
Any solution?
Thanks,
DD I've had the same error on Chrome on Android too, didn't have a chance to find a solution... switched back to A-Frame 0.4.0 instead for the time being, not sure if the error actually breaks anything but was having a different plugin issue which also was fixed by dropping to 0.4.0.

Whatever the issue is, wasn't there in 0.4.0. It doesn't come up on desktop for me. But comes up on Chrome for Android and I think I also saw it when testing on iOS safari. it seems to me that the correct solution is:
(1) the DPDB JSON file that is to be required should be for DPDB_CACHE, not for ONLINE_DPDB_URL.
(2) if the intent is to avoid making an external call and to always use the DPDB cache, the simplest way is to act as if (or actually make sure) fetch_online is set to false; then the XHR will never happen.
(3) if the intent is to still make an external call, then ONLINE_DPDB_URL should be set to the appropriate URL string value. I have the same issue on Chrome 56.0.2924.87 on Android 6.0.1 (Samsung S5; tested with aframe master and 0.5.0). Also the examples on aframe.io does not work with Chrome 56 only with Chrome Dev, I guess the latter supports the WebVR API and don't have to use the polyfill. I tried the bugfix suggested by @Stefie and it resolves the issue. But another error occured afterwards:

> Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to load because no supported source was found.

also this call:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/v0.5.0/src/core/scene/a-scene.js#L190 

failed on my Samsung S5 with Chrome 56. Regrettably, I don't have the exact error message anymore.

I resolved the issue by replacing `"webvr-polyfill": "dmarcos/webvr-polyfill#a02a8089b"` with `"webvr-polyfill": "^0.9.26"` in the `package.json` of the aframe project (master). I used [npm link](http://www.asyncdev.net/2013/12/working-on-related-node-modules-locally/) to use my adapted aframe version in my other project.

I don't know the root cause of the problem. I also compared the entry for my device in the https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/blob/master/src/dpdb/dpdb-cache.js with the one in the "dmarcos/webvr-polyfill#a02a8089b" fork, but they are the same.

I also tested the current aframe master version (which cause the issue on my device) on a Google Pixel with the same browser version but Android 7 and it runs without problems on the Pixel.

Update: even the fixed version leads to a Chrome crash on my S5. But on a Pixel phone and a Nexus 5x it works fine. So, basically -

- we've forked webvr-polyfill because the online DPDB store is outdated, and we don't know who at Google can update it
- we want to use our own JSON of device params instead (`dpdb.json`)
- we're pulling that into dpdb.js with a require: `var ONLINE_DPDB_URL = require('./dpdb.json');`
- we're passing that 'URI' (actually an object) to XHR.open. Naturally, this fails, because it is not a string. We end up fetching a URI that ends with '[Object object]'.

I can think of three fixes, in order of work required:

1. Stop fetching DPDB over the network and just use our up-to-date JSON directly. For instance, we could merge our device data into dpdb-cache.js and instantiate DPDB with its `fetchOnline` set to false;
2. Poke / help / bribe / beg someone at Google to make them update their DPDB data, to support more devices, and then get rid of our own device definitions;
3. Create an open DPDB repository that anyone can submit changes to, serve it somewhere and make a PR so webvr-polyfill uses it. I've created a PR to fix this issue over in the webvr-polyfill fork. If anyone could take the time to look at it, that'd be really helpful: https://github.com/aframevr/webvr-polyfill/pull/3. @dmarcos I believe it's @borismus' team. However -

> unfortunately given my team's focus on Daydream, just haven't had time to split things up or add to dpdb.

https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/issues/147#issuecomment-248077259 @cvan and I have been working on syncing up @thoragio's initiative at [webvrrocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb](https://github.com/WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb) which publishes the DPDB at https://dpdb.webvr.rocks/dpdb.json instead of the no-longer-updated https://storage.googleapis.com/cardboard-dpdb/dpdb.json. The latest version of [webvr-polyfill](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill) is in sync with this, as well as has the correct online URL, so #2700 will fix this issue  As per #2321.

Note that the example hasn't been tested on the documentation server due to CSP limitations.

  The idea here is to click over a part (it's a CAD system looking complicated object made of many pieces) and have the piece clicked move to the side (kind of like an exploded parts diagram).
Works fine on Chrome, on Nightly it jumps instantly to new position, and what it's supposed to do is animate to new position (which works with Chrome).

JS code to have parts listen for click and emit a "move" event:
```
//onClick move part of the model
var i = 1;
for (i = 1; i < parts.length; ++i) {
    parts[i].addEventListener("click", function(){
        this.emit("move"); //emit is an aframe function that can be used to trigger animation
    });
};
```
aframe markup:
  `<a-mixin id="shiftParts" attribute="position" begin="move" from="0 0 0" to="-3 0 0" dur="1000" easing="ease" direction="alternate" ></a-mixin>`

  is this due to https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2314#issuecomment-275812279 ?
specifically, if the event listeners for both `oculus-touch-controls` and `vive-controls` are active regardless of whether they are present... i think if you're not going to emulate the gamepad api (which would naturally emulate presence) then you need to inject something into the appropriate isControllerPresent to only attach when actively emulating, rather than leaving multiple instances of controls components with active listeners.  brings back to mind some of the earlier debates LOL.  note that if you have real vive and emulate touch or other supported controls, you would still have problems in all likelihood @dmarcos ?  perhaps you can add an `emulated` property that controls the event listener behavior when not present, as @ngokevin suggests  **Description:**

I've run into this problem while I was trying to bump Three.js to r84.

In r84 `THREE.GLTFLoader` expects that glTF file is loaded as arraybuffer.
(In r83 it loads as text)

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/r84/examples/js/loaders/GLTFLoader.js#L28

But `a-asset-item` loads data as DOMString(text) in advance and keeps it in `THREE.Cache`.

`THREE.FileLoader` returns cached data if cache hits.

I mean, `THREE.FileLoader` returns cached text even though
`THREE.GLTFLoader` sets `THREE.FileLoader.setResponseType('arraybuffer')`
if `a-asset-item` loads in advance.

Actually `gltf-model.test` fails because of this issue with Three.js r84.

I have some ideas in my mind to solve this problem.

1. We don't use `a-asset-item` for `gltf-model`. Easy but inconvenient.
2. Disable `THREE.Cache`. Easy but worse performance.
3. Enable arraybuffer `a-asset-item` (#2112). (Add responseType prop?)
4. `a-asset-item` checks the extension of file and loads as arraybuffer if it's .gltf or .glb

I prefer 3.
Which one do you guys like or any other better ideas?

/cc @donmccurdy 
 IMO, it'd be nice to have 3. and 4.

We provide a way to set responseType in `a-asset-item` like this

    <a-asset-item id="model" responseType="arraybuffer" src="model.gltf"></a-asset-item>

It'd be worth for A-Frame non-core components which need to load data as non-text.
(`a-mmd` I've making is actually one of them)
They document the data type.

And also `a-asset-item` automatically sets appropriate responseType for the data which
A-Frame core supports. (arraybuffer for .gltf and .glb)
 I'm working on updating `a-asset-item` and have two questions.

1. Why does `a-asset-item` call `THREE.Cache.files[src] = responseText;` 

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/d055cfc56ef263d69c89c266921d6d9c4f5c3691/src/core/a-assets.js#L102

although it's called in `THREE.FileLoader`?

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/accd0b3b2067ac05cd2557252ba4394fd04c7939/src/loaders/FileLoader.js#L137

And if it needs to explicitly call, why doesn't it use `THREE.Cache.add(src, responseText);`?

2. In `a-assets.test.js` this `var XHR_SRC = 'base/src/README.md';` is the path to non-exist file.

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/96df6c1f22fdf72c392be710d945bb9e8684b05c/tests/core/a-assets.test.js#L8

Is this intended?
 I tried. The all tests passed. I think I can remove.

Just in case, I checked if cache works with primitives/model example.

  Use of Object.Assign causes React-Native to throw this error:

> One of the sources for assign has an enumerable key on the prototype chain. Are you trying to assign a prototype property? We don't allow it, as this is an edge case that we do not support. This error is a performance optimization and no spec compliant.

I see the error itself inside the android emulator upon launch.

  **Description:**

Simply as title: just add a closing parentheses on one sentence. sure, thanks :)  I do wonder whether there will actually be only one specific string, vs. "OpenVR Controller" "OpenVR Gamepad" "OpenVR Flight Stick" "OpenVR Tracker" -- it may be that we end up needing prefix support agree.  may be a challenge to get consistent values across OS, as not all controllers have same ID namespaces like USB PID/VID  … new 'OpenVR Controller'

```
Note that due to recent browser-specific changes, Vive controllers may be returned
by the Gamepad API with id values of either "OpenVR Gamepad" or "OpenVR Controller",
so using idPrefix for Vive / OpenVR controllers is recommended.
```
 separating from #2191 so they can be discussed and merged independently

This is now necessary to accommodate both old and new Vive controller change in gamepad id string.  when you say `a-scene transmogrifier=...` you are creating a scene component.  systems are afaik not configurable in that manner... nowhere on that doc page do I see any example of syntax that would allow for configuring a system in the same manner one would configure. scene component.  so it is not at all clear to me, as a relative newcomer, that there is any expectation to be able to declare `a-scene systemName="systemProps: propValues"` so if you are saying you want that behavior, i would strongly suggest namespace prefix e.g. `a-scene system:name="propNames: propValues"` to specify and disambiguate. so what is the intended difference (if any) between system and scene component, except that systems get a reference injected into non-scene component instances, and do not need to be explicitly declared?

Entering VR mode, then exiting VR mode (via the small x in the top left corner), causes the enter VR icon to disappear, with the inability to enter VR mode again. Tested with a variety of apps, from our own to A-Frame's examples, with the same result each time.

When testing with [https://aframe.io/examples/](https://aframe.io/examples/), the following errors result when entering VR mode:
```

- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL: No code snippet, but can provide screenshots (?) if desired? perhaps muting the video would help @Hermanya I'm not sure what you mean - we were never playing video. We were just entering/exiting VR mode on a variety of apps. `wakelock.js` is using a video under the hood to keep the device awake. `play()` fails because mobile chrome requires the user to tap on something on the screen in order to play a video. The only way around that is to mute the video, so that it's more like a gif and less annoying to the user. Thank you for explaining the errors that were encountered! But, I guess I'm confused now - I'm not sure how they tie into the enter VR button disappearing after exiting VR mode, or how that can lead to a solution to it. Judging by what you've said, that's the source of the errors, but it appears the errors may be independent of what we were experiencing then - our main issue was that when you clicked the enter VR mode, and entered, then exited, there was no way to re-enter VR mode (the button disappears) without refreshing the page.  I tried many threejs examples both which use the touch controller on FF Nightly and Chromium VR

For the component a-assets your video expect to be
```
<a-video src="airbending.mp4"></a-video>
```
Wich is not W3C compliant. 
The best implementation should be: 
```
            <video preload="auto"  autoplay="false" id="my-video-1" loop="false" webkit-playsinline playsinline controls muted>
                <source src="airbending.mp4" type="video/mp4"/> // At least one source

                  <!-- <a-entity text="value:fallback text for video">-->
            </video>
```
But you dont let in aframe master the possibility of using sources inside video tag.
If people use the source tag instead of scr directly inside video tag you send a warn about no src or srcObject but it's wrong.
The video contain an src object in source child element, and the best source tag is chosen to match best format for each navigators.

- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:
None i do think the complaint about the warning is legitimate - as a compromise to get the video regression fix committed, i left in the warning, but to the author's point, src and srcObject on video element are not the only ways to attach valid sources to video objects. @maissani per discussion, when you mention the reference in `a-assets`, you mean `video` not `a-video` correct? yes, i mean video not a-video
If you use video with source like mentioned before, you will trigger a console.warn that is implemented on your library because currently: Aframe expect an src attribute.
The video will play in 3D environment but the warning hasn't to be triggered and at least aframe should take the right source that the navigator takes. 
if it's implemented directly with src in video use src in video.
and if a source or multiple source are implemented, chose the right source that the navigator has to take to provide the src attribute in aframe side.  @dmarcos , you check the ```video``` tag not the ```a-video``` tag, in ```a-asset```.
Playinline take no sence to VR context and controlls too but first: 
Playinline => Make able to play video on IOS 
Controlls => The same + with video you should play and pause video  after loaded to make it playable in VR without mouse cotrols on CHROME on Android and on IOS. 

Do you want me to send you IOS and Chrome on Android Issues related to video autoplay on mobile devices ? 
 
 This issue is only related to W3C compliance (http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp)   (IE your example: https://aframe.io/docs/0.4.0/core/asset-management-system.html#example) 
You can also check : HTML Video - Browser Support in the W3C compliance reference
console.warn that hasn't to be there 
or at least made aframe component a-asset able to read the source src from video source child ellement as the src of the video.
 my preference, as per discussion on the original PR, is to let media elements do what they do and get A-Frame out of the validation business here by nixing the check and warning, rather than taking on the burden of reflecting changes throughout the evolution of media element usage in HTML5.  specifically, if using video element by selector reference, assume they know what they are doing and omit check and warning.  @dmarcos @ngokevin thoughts?

  **Description:**
Fixes #2008 

The blurry effect from #2008 was actually caused by incorrectly setting BUFFER_SCALE to 0.5 even on iOS 10.

**Changes proposed:**
- The workaround was created to fix webvr-polyfill/issues/102, however they PRed a different solution for it since, so this workaround in aframe might not be needed at all (haven't tested). Just tried master + this patch on an iPhone 7 Plus w/ iOS 10 and it does indeed fix the issue for me! Finally! thank you @nullcode   On my phone (nexus 6x), as I add more geometry to my scene I've noticed that head tracking becomes slow, stuttery or shaky. However using touch to look around is as smooth as butter. This seems a bit odd to me.

I've created a scene to help explain the issue: https://jsfiddle.net/xkzbwh3u/
On my phone when head tracking:
001 - 100 boxes  = is fine
100 - 200 boxes  = some noticeable shakiness after sudden movements and slight stuttering
500- 1000 boxes = very shaky, stuttery and sluggish

As explained above, looking around by simply touching or swiping the screen shows no shakiness at any of these ranges, at least not from what I can tell.

It looks like, to me, that Android's accelerometer is finding it harder and harder to provide data to the browser as I fill up the scene with objects.

Is there anything that can be done about this? Hi @ngokevin, thanks for your performance suggestions. Do you have any advice for collada models? Can you `mergeTo` a collada model? I'm experiencing the same problem on Android (7.0, OnePlus 3T). I realize this issue doesn't lie solely with A-Frame, but I think it's an important one as new VR creators try to get up and running quickly and want to show off their creations on whatever hardware they have.

@ngokevin A couple of questions if you don't mind:

- Do you have links to any resources about this issue at the Android level? I'd be curious why it exists and if there is any effort to resolve it.
- Is it possible that the WebVR spec will eliminate this "sensor lag" for mobile devices such as Android?
- Are there any possible non-graphics workarounds, such as smoothing the sensor input across a couple frames? I ask because I'm curious if this would help, and I assume it would need to happen within the `look-controls` component. I haven't found any code to suggest this is being done.

I just started tinkering with A-Frame, and built my first VR experience. I'm extremely impressed how it works with tried and true web technologies, and how low the barrier to entry is. That being said, this issue _increases_ the barrier to entry for anyone using Android. I do have several hundred boxes in my scene, but my phone easily renders it at 60+ fps. There's no apparent performance issue, though the head tracking is still jittery. While my demo served the purpose of learning about A-Frame, it's difficult to show others with all the stutter.

The boxes in my scene are all colored differently (based on some math), so merging the geometry would mean rewriting the entire demo to use a shader, texture, or other means of achieving the same image. Given that modern hardware has no problem rendering this scene as is, it's hard to find motivation/time to rewrite this toy just so Android sensor readings _may be_ more performant. Further, anyone who is new to 3D may be able to populate a scene with primitives, but needing to aggressively tune the performance of such simple scenes could easily be a turn-off.

I appreciate any information on this!
 Thank you for the quick response. This definitely makes sense.

Given that this won't be an issue with proper WebVR support, I can understand setting lower expectations for polyfilled experiences. Thanks again 🙂 Worth to mention that callibrating the sensor on my Galaxy S7 just did wonders. I thought it was laggy fps-wise but then I figured it was running quite smoothly without the gyrosensor.

Callibration on S7 is making this "8" with the phone, Google has a good explanation here:
https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6145351?hl=de  `renderSingleSided` and `renderReverseSided` properties I requested aren't supported yet?

https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/issues/117
 Thanks! Just curious to know if we can dynamically enable/disable shadow after scene is rendered once? OK, I see.

I inserted some comments in the code to support dynamic updates just for your information.  Using mergeTo seems to always cause this error. The merging itself seems to work, but the error breaks other things in my app. 
`Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'isPlaying' of null`

note: I'm using aframe-react though.  **Description:**

When developing a web extension, presence of A-Frame's `<a-scene></a-scene>` causes Chrome to make the popup very narrow. It causes Firefox to crash. I've attached a link to minimal repro. 

In my extension I attempted to set the popup's width by setting `width`, `position` and other css styles on `body`, `a-scene` and other elements. In all cases, **Chrome sets width of the popup to its minimum**, yet A-Frame correctly renders the 3D objects in the scene - they're just hard to see in such a narrow window.

 Thanks for pointing me in this direction. It turns out that A-Frame sets `html`'s `display: fixed;` which breaks the Chrome popup.

I'm curious why A-Frame needs to change `html` display style. Does it have to do with `iframe` scenarios?

  I don't have any code comments, but wanted to say thanks for this PR and glTF FTW :)   fixes #2329 this is turning out to be more insidious than expected...  still working on it

i can see now why the implementation did what it did, in that once the change makes entities require geometry in order to intersect, a slew of the tests break because they never actually cared, and doing it correctly is not as simple as one would expect.

(frustrating, because functionally things work correctly...) looks like there is an issue with refreshObjects() happening before geometry is attached (and thus there are no children of the entity's object3D to add yet).  if there is some better way to understand when refreshObjects() can be invoked correctly, that would be most welcome... ok now I am a little baffled, as `npm run test:chrome` works locally with all non-skipped tests passing, but apparently something in travis-ci changes, and things fail. # [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/aframevr/aframe/pull/2331?src=pr&el=h1) Report

i suggest in the raycaster component, we do a refresh on:
1. `sceneEl.addEventListener('loaded')`
2. `sceneEl.addEventListener('child-attached')` + `loaded` on that attached child
``` Any update about this fix ?  all the tests work, the latest version of PR uses strategy suggested,
maybe it got a bit buried in the push to 0.5.0...

I believe the raycaster interval fix was merged into 0.5.0 separately,
but the remainder is sitting ready and waiting @dmarcos @ngokevin now that 0.5.0 rush is over, are we ok to take this? it can be significantly more expensive to do recursive raycast where non-recursive suffices as well, but perhaps @maissani and others can comment if it still works, sure... @maissani @donmccurdy is this PR still useful to you?  (also rebased against something more recent) @donmccurdy @dmarcos @ngokevin anything else on this one?  ### Description:
#### Raycaster doesn't trigger objects when recursive is set to false
### Environment:
- A-Frame Version: 0.4.0 (refs: 87c934aae6c85ac05af48e3c569db584197fb946)

ps: I introduced a console.log line 59310 in aframe-v4.js to reveal intersection value behavior
<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
### Expected Behavior and Issue
Raycaster with recursive true currently working properly. 
Raycaster with recursive false is not working properly: it doesn't trigger on Objects. 
It seems that 
```JavaScript
intersections = this.raycaster.intersectObjects(this.objects, data.recursive)
```
Doesn't  return any intersection when set to false
This bug is probably related to Three.js or not

A simple workAround tho fix this is to set to true whatever ( and then rollback when it's fixed on three.js), and add a conditional check to get only the parrent object (only if he is the origin of intersection ) (is the wrapping that is done always only one level deep?)  Has drawing 3D maps using AFrame been tried before ?
If its been done before, can you provide an example code snippet ?

Thanks for your help!
  I see that 0.4.1 is published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe) but I don't see it in the releases page her nor do I see the 0.4.1 tag.

Has the tag just not been pushed? I see that master's [package.json](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/652f23f3862c2b6622ed03fe0e2b1450ee49c4ab/package.json#L3) states 0.4.0.

Thanks! 
   hmm, this file is a copy of sizes.html that just uses msdf font instead on the left...

Sent from my Android device with K-9 Mail. Please excuse my brevity. it only switches the shader if one is trying to use the default sdf shader with a font that matches msdf pattern (as sdf shader will not work correctly with msdf font image) - if they choose another shader explicitly, this will not apply.

Sent from my Android device with K-9 Mail. Please excuse my brevity. (in case it wasn't clear, the default shader change to msdf does apply to the newly added built-in roboto msdf font, but also applies to any others that follow the naming suffix paradigm) for yOffset, not sure it's that simple since at the moment, the returned fonts are loaded once and cached for reuse, but having individual yOffset values per font instance would require separate copies of fonts.  thoughts?  …depend on it  Hi,

Point is a basic primitive of THREE.js but it's not available as `a-point` in core. I suggest putting it in core.

I'm the author of aframe-point-component
https://github.com/naugtur/aframe-point-component

Let me know if you're interested and I'll make a PR Yes, sure I am. I'll publish this to registryif you say no. Just wanted to check if you'd consider including it in core, because it seems to me it belongs with sphere, box, circle etc.

I have another component in the making and I'll publish it soon.
  The rotation component is continuously updated on a static camera entity (possible performance implications?).

check console.log

The new values for pitch, yaw and roll are the same as the old values (0,0,0). `isSinglePropSchema` in line 202  of `aframe/src/core/component.js` for rotation is true which shortcuts the and-expression, so equality is not tested and the statement never returns. Then in 217 `el.emit('componentchanged', {` happens.

`isSinglePropSchema` is true, because in line 13 of `aframe/src/core/schema.js` 

```
if ('type' in schema) {
    return typeof schema.type === 'string';
}
```
`schema.type` is "vec3" so `typeof schema.type` is "string".

Maybe that points in some direction.  **Description:**

Waiting for the model to be loaded before attaching the raycaster fixes the issue.

  Hey @ngokevin I can write the guide. I just wanted to know that what format should the doc be in?
Should it be a md file, doc file or any format would work?  

**Description:**
Added ability to get the canvas of a screengrab of the scene by doing `sceneEl.components.screenshot.getCanvas()` - in order that screengrabs could be programmatically uploaded to server etc. using .toBlob()

It's based on the existing `.capture()` method, and you can specify a projection (`equirectangular`) - default - or regular screenshots (`perspective`)

Hinted at in conversation here - https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/926#issuecomment-261511950

**Changes proposed:**
- add .getCanvas() method, which returns a canvas object with rendered projection
- keep existing .capture() method, for backward compatability.
 Aaah, need help. Build is failing on Firefox 51 - " capture is called when key shortcut is pressed" - but I'm testing in FF51, and keyboard shortcuts are working...  😊 - Code in haste, repent in public... will fix now 🍾 🎉   **Description:**
Added ability to move vertically touching screen in not vr-mode

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2306 
I just bumped up against this issue as well, and I see it has been raised several times in the github discussion.

It's a bit confusing for us A-Frame users because the "look-controls" component covers 3 quite different interaction styles: desktop with a mouse, mobile with multitouch, and VR/magic window mode. 

Why not allow pitch, within definable min and max angles, in touchmove in look-controls? This makes sense for my use case, and from the previous queries about this, it seems I'm not alone. Alternatively, another way to do this could be to add a toggle to look-controls so that ptich/yaw are controlled by single touch in 2d mode, and by deviceorientation in vr mode.

Overall, it would be really nice if it were easier to switch between camera control schemes between default, touchscreen device, and VR/magic window. For example on the deskop or mobile device, maybe you start with orbit controls, but then when you enter VR with a headset/cardboard/"magic window" mode, you switch to free-look controls.  Currently we users have to write our own components to juggle cameras, but I think having some defaults baked into AFrame would be quite helpful. Over in the orbit-controls I submitted a PR with to add a "vrCamera" attribute, which lets the user specify a different camera element ID that gets activated on enter-vr, then switch back to orbit on exit-vr. Until (...) this is accepted I have written my own component to do this juggle.

Ok, sorry for a bit of a soliloquy/jeremiad. AFrame is awesome! Just trying to offer some constructive contributions -- and I'm happy to make some PRs to manifest this if that's helpful.





 
Yep, understood about wanting to keep it simple. However I would say the current state of affairs having to juggle cameras is not so user friendly. 

My situation is I think a pretty common one:
I want to show off a 3d object on a web site. It should work on the desktop, on a phone/tablet, and with a VR headsset or cardboard. Some scenes I want to show using orbit controls, and some scenes I want to use a free look camera.

I thought this would work out of the box so to say.

Here is the logic to switch cameras to accomplish this:

```
Scenes using the orbit-controls paradigm
	On Desktop:
		start: use orbit controls
		enter-vr: save orbit cam position. Switch active cam to look-controls. 
		exit-vr: save look-control position. Restore orbit-cam position. Switch active to orbit cam
	On mobile:
		start: use orbit-controls
		enter-vr: save orbit cam position. Switch active cam to look-controls. 
		exit-vr: save look-control position. Restore orbit-cam position. Switch active to orbit cam

Scenes using the look-controls paradigm
	On Desktop:
		start: use look-controls
		enter-vr: Remain in look-controls mode
		exit-vr: Reset camera pitch to 0'. Remain in look-controls mode
	On mobile:
		start: use multitouch-look-controls*
		enter-vr: switch to regular look-controls
		exit-vr: switch to multitouch-look-controls

*multitouch-look-controls adds two gestures: single finger up/down drag to pitch, and pinch to zoom/dolly.
```

If I were to share my "controller controller" code for the above,  any suggestions where best I should contribute it? For new users (like me) there are already plenty of camera controller components floating about, so it would be nice to contribute this code / readme / blog entry to an established codebase.
 
  should the motion capture components be hooked up to the utils and systems portions so the event replay makes it actually appear as though the controllers are present and returning the appropriate pose data?  I thought we intentionally abstracted tracked-controls etc. from the actual gamepad API for precisely this purpose... contrary view - the utils and system functions are part of core, allowing
the gamepad api to be wrapped/replaced so that existing APIs can be used
seems better to me than creating the opportunity for dueling systems trying
to fire the same events.  and if it can be done with the core API
navigator.getGamepads() etc. then even software that would not be aware of
the emulation would obey...

 you may only need to modify / wrap `trackedControlsUtils.getGamepadsByPrefix()` ... if this doesn't cause problems when using multiple (e.g. both oculus touch and vive), that may work, but for more complex interactions you may need the actual gamepad api values, not just derived events, which is why I mention an alternate strategy of providing mock data and events which at the moment is fed by the tracked-controls utils functions.  (rather than monkey patching, exposing API to allow injection... also used for testing anyway, IIRC the controls classes had to provide local overrides for getGamepadsByPrefix for that purpose) ```
mchen [8:07 PM] 
re: recorder and tracked controller events - the worry I have is that if the app uses both aframe controls and also gamepad api (e.g. arcade), recorder replays may not work well / correctly... and that if during recording playback the gamepad api input isn't turned off, chaos may ensue

[8:08]  
even if you ignore the former, you will probably want to address the latter

ngokevin [8:08 PM] 
you mean you’re not using tracked-controls?

mchen [8:08 PM] 
both tracked-controls (via oculus-touch-controls and vive-controls) and actual gamepad API -- to support actual gamepads, Ooculus remote, etc.

[8:10]  
even if i wasn't, it's not clear that playback would only ever occur without HMD and controllers present/active...

ngokevin [8:10 PM] 
what are some things our recorder would not pick up from your arcade?

[8:10]  
because the gamepad API doesn’t emit events right? you have to poll it for button states

mchen [8:12 PM] 
right.  so there is code that looks at gamepad states, across all of them, and does the right translation into keys for JSMESS emulator to see

[8:13]  
if you are recording tracked controller events only, would fail completely for this case

  **Description:**

I'm loading an OBJ model with a single color map/texture. I use the `<a-assets>` tag to load both the obj-file and the texture file.

For some reason, the texture is downloaded 3 times. It doesn't hit the cache any of those times:

An additional problem, which made me aware of the issue, this seem to make the model unable to load and render in Safari (desktop and mobile), as it fails with with CORS related error the third time it attempts download the texture:

(It's not a general CORS issue, as it renders fine in other browsers, although the texture is still downloaded three times)

 Upvoting as this issue still exists in 0.5.0 within Chrome, Safari and Firefox.  Good to hear it's not just me. Judging on the number of open issues I don't think the core team will get to this anytime soon then. A PR is probably needed to get this fixed, but I don't have bandwidth to debug and fix the issue at the moment either.  I understand this is mentioned briefly in `getting-started.md`, but it's done as kind of an option? It implies you can either 'Grab the Boilerplate' _or_ 'Include the JS Build' (from CDN). And indeed the latter will work up to a point, but it breaks at this step.
 Sure I can do that. However can we have both?

The reason I say is that, at the moment, there isn't a 'flow' that goes from 'Getting Started > Guides'. At the moment the flow (which is a little confusing) goes:

aframe.io > Get Started > Device & Platform Support > Best Practices > FAQ > The End

To get to the guides, you then have to backtrack to question 3 in the FAQ and click the 'guides' link? I think that would be better. Maybe it should go:

aframe.io > Introduction >  Device & Platform Support > Get Started > Guides

Really the 'Best Practices' and 'FAQ' are not something a newbie needs to read? Okay made the changes to Getting Started as requested.

Not sure how to change the 'flow' of the pages though (i.e. make 'Devices & Performance > Getting Started')? Is that outside the GitHub project? I think there's a separate discussion here. Do you want to merge this PR and I'll start a new issue?

Separate discussion:

* At the moment, the first time the doc mentions 'asset management' or 'entities' or 'lights' is in Best Practices. Readers have had no introduction before that. So even if it wouldn't hurt beginners to read Best Practices and the FAQ, they won't necessarily be able to understand them.

* At the moment, the Getting Started section ultimately leads to the FAQ, the 3rd question of which is 'how can I get started'. This is a bit circular :) However it's the only way you get to the guides. All done. Please review.  **Description:**

This on a tablet (nexus 7 or 9) or Ipad should be 
1) Enabling by default devicemotion camera 
2) on vr mode, go full screen. 
On Aframe 2.0, 1) works and 2) says your device doesn't support webvr mode. I have been checking Google WebVr Poly and it works there perfectly. My guess is that this is something inside how Aframe decides to use VR Mode and Gyroscope Control of the Camera by default.

 In Aframe 4, I'm only enable to move the camera using touch but no movement.


The expected behavior should be

1. Vr Mode should go to full screen on tablets.
2. Moving camera with Device Motion should be default on tablets too.
 I've discussed over Aframe Slack about this, we checked over Google WebVr Polyfill and there is no restriction for this on their lastest version. 
Our guess is that there is something where we ask ismobile but on a tablet is not.

An Any help is welcome we are happy to help to create the fix for this issue @ngokevin do you have any idea why 2. was working on Aframe 2.0 but not on Aframe 4.0? Any ideas where to check? Both return **false**
For some reason Aframe 2.0 let us use the accelerometer.

 Check the examples, now both have the alert with the result.

There is also distortion when taking a screenshot of the CodePen (CodePen's debug mode fixes this), but that's another issue. Being able to set the size of the screenshot to 960x500 is nifty for making [bl.ock](https://bl.ocks.org/-/about) previews, but AA is kind of necessary for this.

I suppose I could take a 3840x2000 screenshot and then resize to 960x500.  I have an ionic2 app with videosphere and in ios  touching vertically the screen I can´t get tilt effect (If I move my device it work). It doesn´t work in android neither. I try it in browser and works ok.

 @dmarcos you can try accessing with your mobile browser to https://aframe.io/examples/. You can check what I meaning  @ngokevin I understand if you are in vr mode tilt doesn't work but if you aren't , in my opinion, it should work ... however could you make me an example about "play" with camera and vertical panning?

  **Description:**

The scene is embedded inside a bootstrap modal dialog and the shouldCaptureKeyEvent method ( https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/utils/index.js#L176 ) returns false because, in my case document.activeElement is the modal dialog div which does not equal to the document.body. 

`return document.activeElement === document.body;`

What is the reason for this statement?

<!-- If you have a support question, please ask at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/?tags=aframe rather than filing an issue. -->
 I see. In my case the modal-body contains the scene and I show the modal dialog when the users clicks a button (http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals). It is a standard use. The console shows that document.activeElement  is `<div class="modal fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog">` instead of body, because the focus is set on the modal div and not the body.

Would it be possible to just take WASD user input when the focus is on the canvas? I will play with it, either we leave the impl. as it is, or I propose a change. I just saw that I can manually set the focus to an element so I could force the focus to the body, even if the modal is open. Let's see how it goes.

I think my use case is specific and I guess that not having WASD navigation in a scene which is  embedded is ok for most people. I had no success in setting the focus on body manually, after opening the bootstrap modal dialog. My personal solution would be to patch aframe.js and override the method in utils.js unless you say that WASD navigation must work for embedded scenes, no matter where they are embedded. But I have no idea how this could be achieved, without eg. triggering input in textfields. One possible solution would be to add `tabindex="1"` ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29992688/how-to-keep-the-focus-on-a-canvas-always ) to each injected canvas which forces the focus on the canvas and not on the body. If I could reference the current canvas in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/utils/index.js#L176 we could do `return document.activeElement === canvas`

How do I get the current canvas in utils?

I could setup a codepen with several embedded canvas including one in a bootstrap modal and see if the behaviour is as expected. @cvan Thank you for your code examples, I am sure it works that way. In my case I am dynamically loading a template partial from an REST endpoint depending on a certain type of content (photo sphere, video sphere, models, etc.) and I append the loaded template code (a-frame scene) to an element within the bootstrap modal dialog. I don't like the idea of loading a template which represents an html document (and I don't like iframes). But that's just my personal taste and my special use case. ;-)

I think for all other people wanting to load an a-frame scene into any sort of modal dialog window (which takes the focus) your solution should be fine. Although the `canvas tabindex="1"` solution is not too bad  in my opinion (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29992688/how-to-keep-the-focus-on-a-canvas-always).  On my environment, both works.

At Hello world example https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/boilerplate/hello-world/

I ran this on console

    var scene = document.querySelector('a-scene')

    var cylinder = document.createElement('a-cylinder');
    cylinder.setAttribute('color', '#888888');
    cylinder.setAttribute('height', '1.5');
    cylinder.setAttribute('position', '3 1 0');
    scene.appendChild(cylinder);

    var cylinder2 = document.createElement('a-cylinder');
    scene.appendChild(cylinder2);
    cylinder2.setAttribute('color', '#888888');
    cylinder2.setAttribute('height', '1.5');
    cylinder2.setAttribute('position', '-3 1 0');

Result

Q are you using the built-in vive controller model?
A yes no change

Q do you inject controls / hands, or declare them a priori in your scene?  are tracked-controls there right off the bat (too early?) or does it wait for vive-controls or oculus-touch-controls to inject them?

@mchen fyi removing wasd controls prevents the `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'rotation' of undefined` however i still see many `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'material' of undefine` upon button presses @kfarr doesn't seem to happen in normal operation.

are other inadvertent invocations of onButtonUp/Down/TouchStart/TouchEnd/Event providing invalid button names?

what button name is appearing in 
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/vive-controls.js#L216
in your situation? Yes using master. The culprit seems to be things related to vive trackpad. `onButtonTouchStart` and `onButtonTouchEnd` for example  By allowing an alphatest, transparencies in models loaded will now work better.

I personally believe this should be an option able to be set in the schema... Perhaps this should only be added in once schema has been updated and changed to allow for multiple variables without breaking backwards compatibility? I do think single variable schemas should be removed as they limit functionality WAY too much for the future, unless there is a way to set one of the multiple variables as the default for single variables.


As far as I can tell this pull request of tested code should not be added to the repo yet as alphatest might cause undesired consequences like hiding a material that has no texture set to it because the file wasn't found etc.... I do think its a good example of possibilities for model loading and the necessity to fine tune things, as models are beastly complicated to get right.

 I think this is a property for the model loading process itself. It seems inefficient to load the model, then to loop through all materials after an event. Seeing as though complex models with multiple sprites can have 100s to loop through.

That being said, I have noticed with some collada models that they simply don't load properly without this setting being adjustable, it is not about adjusting a model to me, but loading it properly in the first place. 

For instance, sprites in models tend to have transparent backgrounds (so flowers in a model), but these show up as artifacts without using this setting. By default I think it should be turned on, but at the very least I think it should be exposed. 

Currently I am using my version of the collada-loader and it seems to work well. So far, only faces where the material was not loaded might disappear as it assumes it is transparent due to a lack of data/colour.

I thought collada was the main support with gltf to come later? I think both are good. Sadly the GLTF issue I have run into is that many are binary and not ascii.  Fair enough. It will be the same issue with GLTF, I do understand that covering all cases would create a large library. I do think that this specific property having a default might actually reduce bugs for model loading quite a bit.

Perhaps something I will try to take up with ThreeJS themselves though they do not focus too much on model loading from the bug reports I saw.

  (same with `oculus-touch-controls`)  In the [**Adding Audio**](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/guides/index.md#adding-audio) section of the official docs, the following source file link seems to be dead:

If this isn't the correct repo for this issue, let me know where it should migrate to!  **Description:**

This PR enables mixin ids following/followed by/separated with spaces, tabs, and new lines like this
`el.setAttribute('mixin', '  id1\tid2\n\nid3  ');`
It'd be useful for users.

Refer to #2291

  **Description:**

This PR adds `el.mixinEls.length` check for mixin clear test to get the test stricter.

Refer to #2291
  **Description:**

This PR enables `el.setAttribute('mixin', '')` (#2280).
It clears all mixins of el.

This PR doesn't touch `removeAttribute('mixin')` because
another guy is working on here #2282
 BTW, I'm thinking to replace `new(old)Mixins.split(' ')` with `new(old)Mixins.trim().split(/\s+/)`.
The latter can accept two or more spaces, tabs, and new lines.
It'd be useful for users.

    (example in the console)
    -> var str = ' abc def\tghi\n jkl  mn  '
    <- undefined
    -> str
    <- " abc def	ghi
         jkl  mn  "
    -> str.split(' ')
    <- ["", "abc", "def	ghi↵", "jkl", "", "mn", "", ""]
    -> str.trim().split(/\s+/)
    <- ["abc", "def", "ghi", "jkl", "mn"]

What do you guys think?   I think the appropriate line is 
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/vive-controls.js#L162
no idea why you're not seeing it trigger for vive, as I don't think anything has changed there... did the model files somehow change during the CDN adjustments? (taking a quick look...)
the vive triggers move for me... maybe browser is not setting analog value correctly anymore and only giving you 0 or 1? (@dmarcos need any changes before merge?)  I am interested in the writing for the documentation for it. I'm working on this except for documentation.

@donmccurdy 
Why do you think default distanceModel should be linear though
default PannerNode.distanceModel (= THREE.PositionalAudio.distanceModel) is inverse?
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PannerNode/distanceModel
 I see, thanks! @wildaces215 
Panner options has been added.
Do you wanna update the documentation for it? :D

https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/sound.html I want to work on this Hi @BhuvanaMeenakshi, it seems @wildaces215 is already working on this. If you dont see any updated from @wildaces215 in next few days, you can pick this one, till then feel free to explore other open issues :-) I've get caught up on things it free sorry about the inconvenience

  Hi, I wanted to have a limited view in my app so I cloned the `look-controls` component according to this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41038973/how-can-i-constrain-rotation-of-an-a-camera-aframe/41150640#41150640) by @ngokevin. But it breaks if `reverse-mouse-drag="true"`

Any thoughts?
  maybe related links to registry demos then  **Description:**
Allows entity.removeAttribute(`mixin`) 
 Well, is this change good enough?
I think we should call `unregisterMixin` for all registered mixins for `removeAttribute('mixin')`.
 @takahirox I see what you mean with that. I'm seeing how it can be approached with unregistering all mixins, then removing the mixin attribute.

@ngokevin it looks like a-mixin.js sets up the object initially, then mixin update logic is handled in a-node.js. If we want to approach update logic in a-mixin.js, I wonder what the best approach is.  Is this about building an interface-builder in VR? Or assembling an interface in HTML, then have it show up as a VR interface?

This is definitely hard because there are no user guidelines and best practices for what a user interface should be like in VR. A lot of UI is trending towards laser-pointer based because we're so used to 2d surfaces and mouse.

Is the focus on data-display? Or about button pushing (like implementing levers, knobs, dials, buttons, etc)?

What's the goal here? It was very difficult to find one set of movement/interaction code to accommodate mobile, typical desktop/laptop web, phone VR, PC VR, and roomscale, controllers / gamepad / remote.  Even just the VR subset of that was challenging. Boris' Ray-Input will help tremendously https://github.com/borismus/ray-input as it adapts to Daydream, Cardboard, Vive/Oculus, as well as mouse input types. ... touchscreen for non-VR mobile?  touchpad on laptops as well as mouse?  what if you want movement not just gaze selection?   feels almost like a topic with blog posts from various folks on what worked well and didn't -- here, with an eye on implementing with A-Frame... ok great that makes it much more straightforward, although perhaps less widely applicable (thinking of Daydream 3DOF, if not GearVR) I confirm this is a recurrent need for newcomers. Hey all, great conversation sorry for being late to jump in. I like the
idea of breaking this up into a series of blog posts about "VR UI First
Practices" that includes both the UI challenge scenario and then the
code-based solution with a link to a repo or component at the end. I'm
happy to take one on with regards to city builder. My topic could be
something like - "creating interface for previewing and selecting objects
across Oculus and Vive".

Maybe if a few more folks can commit to topics and a proposed date for
their writeups? I could commit to a first draft by Jan 30 for mine. And
then someone from Mozilla can make a nice intro / context post.

 Are we definitely looking for all original content here or would a page with curated links with a blurb about what they're good for also be helpful?  Cool, I haven't built anything with 6DoF (yet!) but I'd be happy to get a further reading list started. Okay did a first draft here, comments enabled and welcomed: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RvmQ-ExpLIQFr8kK4d67jndI070dCtz3AI2BeJYYJjY/edit I've revised (edited down) and prepared a Medium post. It's ready to publish, but I'm in no hurry as I'm hoping that we'll have a stable Chromium build soon so people can actually use this: https://medium.com/@kfarr/38b0c86ed7b7 we need a builder interface like unity3d  I want to work on this
 this.el.setAttribute('mixin', this.data.mixin);

Hope this can resolve?
  Why is the 0.4.0 version's resolution so bad in VR mode? 
I did not change any rendering parameters!

  When clicking the "Enter VR" icon (the goggle icon), to enter in VR mode, the screen periodically turns black. The issue seems to occur at random times.

We have tried using both A-Frame version 0.3.0 and 0.3.2., but with no difference in behavior.

Whether it fails (renders black or is successful) I recieve the following errors:

 For information: it's inside an a-scene, editor just wont allow it for some reason.

@dmarcos: Yes, I've also tried updating to 0.4.0, same problem. I just tried to run the showcase HelloWorld on the phone, works perfectly. It's built with Ionic / Angular.js, the scene can run independently, at least the VR mode can. Clicking VR-Mode works 50% of the times, and it's possible to use the Android back button and spam untill it is successful.

The scene I provided is a lobby scene which is a view for itself, I can provide the controller and service it uses, but as far as I can tell, it doesn't actually have anything to do with the VR-mode button.

Can you perhaps be specific in what you would like to see?

  ya i will do it
  When `<a-scene>` is created, it scrolls the document to the top of the page. Note that the `embedded` attribute is also set.

Ok, so, if you're on roomscale devices definitely avoid `kinematic-body`
if not, I think i would do something like this: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/examples/walls/index.html
rather than putting height on the camera (edited)

[3:55]  
since physics needs to know about that height

giordy [3:55 PM] 
i’m using it for mobile

[3:56]  
for roomscale i’m using the teleport-controls

donmccurdy [3:56 PM] 
Ok cool

giordy [3:56 PM] 
but I can’t have both in the same scene as teleport-controls want a separate camera object

donmccurdy [3:57 PM] 
Kk, haven't had the chance to try `teleport-controls` myself yet

giordy [3:57 PM] 
i spent all day today trying to get it work with the physics engine but it gave me all sort of problems

[3:57]  
but then again my js skills are quite limited

[3:59]  
if you wanna take a look at what i’ve done you can find my scene at http://www.pippistarace.it/aframe/ (without controls)

donmccurdy [3:59 PM] 
Yeah, i don't have any expectation that kinematic-body can work with roomscale.. it's just hard to do, and the experience would be so bad that it's really not worth it.

giordy [4:00 PM] 
or http://www.pippistarace.it/aframe/indexrift.html (with controls but no physics)

leupsi [4:00 PM] 
Please have a look at the modified version of the Playground example. The barrier to limit the world works fine, only problem is the camera is bouncing back when colliding. And it doesn't work when wasd-controls are used, no idea why that. I think it's quite useful when playing the scene on a cardboard, so the user does not lost himself in white. http://leupsi.com/interaction/aframe/barrier/

giordy [4:01 PM] 
yeah i figured as much…I need to find a way to toggle between the two on the same scene, i suppose I need to dynamically delete or change a bunch of entities

[4:03]  
@leupsi it looks fine on safari, what do you mean it’s bouncing back?

donmccurdy [4:03 PM] 
@leupsi i don't see the bouncing either.. to some extent that's controlled by restitution: `physics="restitution: 0.3"` for example.

[4:04]  
`wasd-controls` won't work with physics though. There are specific accomodations in `universal-controls` for physics to be possible.

leupsi [4:05 PM] 
Okay thank's for the clarification @donmccurdy

[4:06]  
So flying is not possible with physics enabled?

donmccurdy [4:09 PM] 
I don't know. I would try adding `universal-controls="fly: true"` also. But I haven't been doing much with kinematic-body lately, focusing more on roomscale.

giordy [4:09 PM] 
try to set gravity to 0 and add jump-ability="maxJumps: 3; distance: 10;"

leupsi [4:12 PM] 
Preparing for the next moon mission? :stuck_out_tongue:

donmccurdy [4:24 PM] 
haha well it's realistic at least :laughing:

leupsi [4:32 PM] 
@donmccurdy `universal-controls="fly: true"` works but it's super sensitive and w and s are inverted on the axis, so they move up and down. Anyways is it possible to set the sensivity of "fly"?

It's not inverting axis like a flight simulator or anything, you'll need to write custom code if that's what you're going for

@mchen the only way I got the kinetic-body to work is with the following code

```html
<a-entity id=player camera kinematic-body universal-controls position=" 0 1.764 0">
           <a-entity id=cursor cursor="fuse: true; fuseTimeout: 0" raycaster="far: 8;" scale="0.01 0.01 0.01" position="0 0 -1" geometry="primitive: ring" material="color: #2E3A87 ; shader: flat"></a-entity>
       </a-entity>
```

[3:08]  
@mchen but to have the teleport-controls to follow the “player” entity it needs to be like this

```html
<a-entity id=player position="-26 0 -16">
           <a-camera>
           </a-camera>
           <a-entity auto-detect-controllers="singlehand:right" teleport-controls="playerEntity:#player;collisionEntity:#floor;button: trigger;startEvent: down;endEvent:up"></a-entity>
       </a-entity>
```
(edited)

[3:09]  
notice that in the second example the camera is separate from the “player” entity

[3:14]  
this was the only way to get it to work properly, if I add the teleport controls to the first example then all hell breaks lose. (i.e. controllers Y position becomes higher than the camera, when I try to teleport the ray rotates both with the controller AND the camera)

[3:14]  
i think it’s because teleport-controls doesn’t like being a child of the camera, but the issue might also be with the generic tracked-controllers since the position is also wrong (edited)

with this the physics collisions work, but the controllers are placed too high and rotate both with the physical controller and the headset.

mchen [3:10 PM] 
right, because the controllers are children of the camera and thus headlocked, which you don't want.

giordy [3:11 PM] 
with the second example (that you can try at http://www.pippistarace.it/aframe/teleportnphysics-test2.html) the controllers and teleport work fine, but the physics don't work (i am able to go through walls) (edited)

[3:14]  
i think i'm going to have 2 versions of the gallery anyways, one for the full HMDs and the other one for mobile/browsers

[3:15]  
this is what I was talking about when I was saying that I can't have the kinematic-body and the teleport-controls in the same scene

tltmedia [3:16 PM] 
I keep falling through the floor :stuck_out_tongue:

mchen [3:37 PM] 
shouldn't the kinematic body be on the player not the camera in the second example?

giordy [3:48 PM] 
i tried both, it doesn't make a difference

[3:50]  
and if I don't set gravity to 0 it falls through the floor. i even tried to set the y position at something higher than 0 (ex. 1.6 like i have it in the first example) but it still doesn't work

...

mchen [10:37 PM] 
@giordy the reason why the player falls through the floor when you put the kinematic-body on it is actually quite simple.  you have your floor-box aboze zero.  so since the player y is zero, as soon as you make it the kinematic body, it is already below the top surface of the floor and starts falling.  move your floor down so the top edge is at zero, and that problem goes away...

[10:38]  
what I wonder is whether at y=0 the player is able to move under the walls, so maybe cheat the player up a tiny bit?

mchen [10:44 PM] 
no, i see what the other problem is.  the way you have test2 set up, you are actually moving the camera, not the player.  so if the player is the kinematic body, it's sitting in a place with no collisions, and you're moving the camera through walls while the player that you're checking is in the same spot.

[10:45]  
... and it is quite possible/likely that several of the movement controls you are using will not like being on the player instead of the camera, which is why for the arcade I stopped using wasd-controls for example

mchen [10:52 PM] 
@donmccurdy given a player construct, is there a way to make `universal-controls` move the player not the camera (which is currently being moved anyway via direct vr hmd changes) ? (edited)

[10:53]  
by player construct, I mean something like

```
<a-entity id="player" kinematic-body universal-controls>
<a-camera></a-camera>
<!-- hand controls would also be children of player, peer of camera -->
</a-entity>
```

(edited)

donmccurdy [11:00 PM] 
@mchen that example looks like it should work, it just moves whatever entity it's attached to.

[11:01]  
Eh, well except that the hand controls are going to be positioned in absolute coordinates

[11:01]  
so any motion or rotation of the camera is messing with that.

michael.andrew [11:35 PM] 
Probably better to just move the world around the player so the hand control positions stay correct. I’m having similar issues at the moment with something I’m working on.


----- Today January 10th, 2017 -----
danodejos [2:24 AM] 
joined #issues

mchen [2:27 AM] 
@donmccurdy ... yeah, that appears to be causing @giordy issues

donmccurdy [2:31 AM] 
Ok, I don't have an easy solution to that. Hand controls are not designed to be nested inside a moving entity, whether it's `universal-controls` or `look-controls`. (edited)

[2:32]  
I should probably also reiterate, `kinematic-body` is fundamentally incompatible with roomscale VR, so there are a lot of things likely to go wrong here.

mchen [2:33 AM] 
right.  proper structure IMO is player entity as parent of both camera and controllers (and any other tracked objects in that roomscale space, I suppose)

donmccurdy [2:34 AM] 
What does the player entity do, in that case?

[2:34]  
or provide?

mchen [2:34 AM] 
prevents you from having to move all three independently...

[2:35]  
in theory you can teleport the roomscale space around, instead of moving the entire world

donmccurdy [2:35 AM] 
So, like teleportation would move the player, but walking in roomscale would just move the camera?

[2:35]  
Ok yeah. That seems right to me.

mchen [2:35 AM] 
camera does what camera does, yeah.

[2:36]  
when you say kinematic-body is incompatible with roomscale, i've only seen your physics system use dynamic and static bodies...?

donmccurdy [2:37 AM] 
To adjust the example above, then:

```html
<a-entity id="player">
  <a-entity camera universal-controls></a-entity>
  <!-- hand controls would also be children of player, peer of camera -->
</a-entity>
```

^Is what I'd suggest. I think that should work equally well with `<a-camera/>` in place of the inner entity. Teleport controls wouldn't know about the player wrapper, but if we decide that's the right structure we could consider setting that up.

[2:38]  
Yeah, for exactly that reason I've omitted the `kinematic-body` component from aframe-physics-system. It's just in aframe-extras, with an "experimental" label on it.

mchen [2:39 AM] 
doesn't work right if you do that, universal controls artificially moves the camera without the controllers and screws up the roomspace

[2:39]  
IMO, we may just want to attach the controls to the player and move that...

donmccurdy [2:40 AM] 
Hm? That's what we just said though, `universal-controls` moves the camera the same way that `look-controls` does.

[2:40]  
are we talking about roomscale here?

mchen [2:40 AM] 
yes

[2:41]  
orientation adjustment doesn't mess up controller position, but when you start using wasd-controls or something to actually do translation, that gets weird

donmccurdy [2:41 AM] 
Ok, gotcha, I thought we were talking about tracked HMD movement / walking. When you walk in roomscale, `universal-controls` needs to move the camera.

mchen [2:42 AM] 
if you are wearing the HMD / camera, it's cool.

[2:42]  
ohhh right, you have universal-controls doing hmd-controls in the refactor.

[2:42]  
but the artificial stuff shouldn't muck up the roomscale relationships.

[2:43]  
which may mean another refactor...

donmccurdy [2:43 AM] 
Yeah, lots of possible inputs to universal controls. Could be a gamepad, there's even some teleportation support built in.

[2:44]  
I'm nervous about having `universal-controls` try to move different entities depending on the input device, that's hard to plan around...

[2:44]  
Another option would be to refactor hand-controls to just assume they're relative to the camera

[2:45]  
so you can always do:

```
<a-camera universal-controls>
  <!-- hand controls here -->
</a-camera>
```

[2:45]  
that's the approach I took with leap motion, and it worked nicely.

[2:45]  
(but it's also much easier with leap motion ...)

[2:46]  
Let's move discussion to a github issue, getting late here, and it would be worth having a record of this.

mchen [2:46 AM] 
k

donmccurdy [2:47 AM] 
original goal of universal-controls was to support locomotion from different input devices
ideally goal of some "player" abstraction would be to support locomotion AND tracked controls from various sources.

[2:48]  
fine with me if that requires rewriting stuff somewhat related:
```Updated A-Frame Arcade http://chenz.org/aframe-arcade/ to use physics for handling movement and collisions... nontrivial to make teleport, roomscale w/controllers, and traditional arrow keys / mouse drag/ scroll all work.  if folks get a chance to try it and let me know if there are things that don't work well, I'd love the feedback (DM me)```
that uses a fork of @fernandojsg aframe-teleport-controls that has been taught how to (1) move player entity, not camera and controllers (2) move physics bodies as well as non-physics entities
and has its own equivalent of arrow key `wasd-controls` as well as multi-tap/click, mouse scroll / drag, D-Pad / stick movement... http://chenz.org/aframe-arcade/ does something very similar to (C) actually, although the `teleport-controls` string looks a little different to specify the player entity that should be moved (IMO that is actually better than having a hidden need for `tracked-controls` and moving anything it finds with that component, active or not). (A) breaks tracked controllers badly at the moment.
(B) gets very ugly w.r.t. locomotion IMO especially if rotation is included > Let's exclude `kinematic-body` from discussion

http://chenz.org/aframe-arcade/ is now using `aframe-physics-system` and `dynamic-body` / `static-body` for movement and collisions as of this morning. @fernandojsg right, that is what i am doing as well, with some mods to your teleport controls... (1) allow other objects to block the teleport arcs (2) move player entity if specified (3) move physics body not object3d if present... chenzlabs/aframe-teleport-controls

found a physics combination that works ok with teleport for chenz.org/aframe-arcade (player as dynamic body) although i would rather have standard gravity and a few nonexistent types of constraints instead I'm using a similar approach in my project, my player object looks like this:

```
 <a-entity id=player position="-26 0 -16">
            <a-camera>
            </a-camera>
            <a-entity id=controllerleft oculus-touch-controls="hand:left" mixin="controller"></a-entity>
            <a-entity id=controllerright oculus-touch-controls="hand:right" mixin="controller" teleport-controls="playerEntity:#player;collisionEntity:#floor;button: grip;startEvent: down;endEvent:up"></a-entity>
 </a-entity>
```

Unfortunately this approach breaks whatever component uses the controller's position because in this case it becomes relative to the parent object instead of the scene.

As you can see I'm using both teleport-controls (the ones forked by @machenmusik, which allows me to have the player start at a different location other than 0 0 0) and super-hands components.

To get it to work correctly with this configuration (i.e. controllers attached to another entity instead of the scene) I had to modify both the @donmccurdy 's sphere-collider (already merged) and @wmurphyrd (still need to do the pull request) by [changing all references to the controller's position attribute to controller.object3D.getWorldPosition()](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/commit/d7eb72f586001f1908b39f7a8125ba48d093d848).

It's a bit of a hack but it works for me. I'm sure you guys can find a much better solution though, I'm a newbie here... yeah there was/is a habit where everything is assumed to be a direct descendant of scene (without saying so)

almost wonder if it would be better to have current usage of position be called localPosition... but that would likely break everything Seems like this is going to be an ongoing point of confusion for creators.
While digging into the THREE.js API works, it's not in line with the spirit
of A-Frame.

One option would be flag parameter in getAttribute to specify relative v.
absolute. Probably not ideal, though, since it would have inconsistent
effects depending on the attribute (I think only position, rotation, and
scale would benefit from this)

 I don't think modifying getAttribute would match (sounds like getComputedAttribute, which I presume went away for a reason) - maybe just standard API for these like AFRAME.utils.___ (which can actually be implemented via THREE, and replaced with alternatives if someone wanted to use A-Frame over a different backend) I had an idea the other day for another solution that more is consistent with the API: new default components world-position, world-rotation, & world-scale.

* Use the same `getAttribute` and `setAttribute` API, handling the appropriate transformations and updates
* Essentially invisible to creators unless they need the interface, but also easier to discover when they do need it than a utils method
* For entities that have no `object3d`, can failover to traversing the DOM hierarchy to determine the absolute position/rotation/scale taking the teleport case, it's not enough to have get-only e.g. to propagate camera change to controllers.  that would only work if one had a player / camerarig entity that owned both, and assumes only one level of hierarchy.

Why not allow setting using global coordinates, which would be done by setting local to the appropriate computed global-to-local delta? yes, but if you want to move it to global coordinates, not being able to set using global coordinates will be a problem. I'm not sure we should assume that the player/camerarig is a direct descendant of scene, in the same way we shouldn't assume that camera and controller entities are a direct descendant of scene.  I agree that the most common case is that way right now, but I can see a outer world-offset entity, with a player entity inside that which contains camera and controllers... thinking about this a little more, position and scale are pretty easy, but rotation may not be.  Maybe read-only globals plus utils functions to set relative to a given entity?  And, the geometries aren't getting merged, possibly because of a wrong property check (in merging demo the both have buffer=false).  Nice.  I have pretty limited time this next few months, but do think this is super important for 3D web for all the reasons Don mentioned and we all already know :)

@ngokevin how do you suggest we do this?  There's very little in the component itself that's glTF specific, most of what's in the component I made is build tools and demo -- I would assume it's as easy as copy pasting the Collada component and changing a few lines to make glTF part of core?  The command line Collada to glTF converter works quite well, but it's fairly tricky to set up.  There is an online converter that works for testing, but doesn't build to multiple files so binary data (even when not in binary mode) is baked in, making it giant / slow to parse.

Autodesk has an FBX to glTF converter, to my understanding coming out quite soon, which I expect to be pretty strong.  Autodesk also has a new project that is WebGL focused, which I'd be surprised if it didn't integrate glTF soon (Project Play).

Blender has an exporter plugin, but haven't used it -- I've only heard one person trying to use it, and I think they had problems with it.  

All things considered, I think the Collada to glTF converter is worth the headache of getting it running (just like most front-end developers are now used to the permission problems Node initially has when they are not used to a Linux system).

... but confess that I'm biased ;)  Also, figured I'd point out that with Unity, you can make things like this:

[https://vimeo.com/181420338](https://vimeo.com/181420338)
[https://vimeo.com/192071365](https://vimeo.com/192071365)
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHH3-bP-fE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHH3-bP-fE)

It might be that a run-time focused library (i.e. ThreeJS + AFrame, Babylon, regl) won't catch up to what a compile time library (Unity, Unreal; leveraging Emscripten and soon Web Assembly) -- but if (Three/AFrame) it is to have a chance, the kind of shader, geometry, and animation work in the above three examples needs to be done by a designer and exported in a way the run-time libraries can use them -- trust me, trying to code these is insanity :)

One more side note on adoption, Babylon has support for glTF, and I believe someone is working on an importer for regl as well.  > It also makes it impossible to preserve private APIs within A-Frame core.

Can someone explain why private APIs within A-Frame core are needed, preferably with examples?

> But I recognize that neither of those is a good solution when the component depends on various utils or helpers.

Right, I think part of the idea here is to make utils and helpers exposed non-private, so that nontrivial new component functionality can be developed without having to be in core in order to depend upon private APIs. To use a potentially flawed Windows analogy... do we see A-Frame core as Win32 API on which a variety of functionality and components can be developed?  Or as MFC where a framework and components are provided, and more can be created by following the paradigm? @ngokevin so sounds like aframe non-component is like win32 API (private APIs may be required) and aframe components are like MFC atop public win32 API.  if so, gets my vote at present  Hey,

If I click on an intersected component, which fires a click event, the intersection point never shows the clicked point but just the position, where the cursor entered the component.

Any help?

my javascript:
```

var paper = document.querySelector("#paper");
paper.addEventListener('click', function(evt){
 console.log('clicked @: ', evt.detail.intersection.point);
});
```

my entity:

```
<a-entity geometry="primitive: plane; height: 6.1; width: 8" material="src: #p-dr-mtl" class="paper" id="p-dr" position="0 10 0" rotation="-35 0 0" scale="0 0 0">
            <a-animation attribute="position" begin="getPaper" to="0 5.25 -1.2"></a-animation>
            <a-animation attribute="scale" dur="2000" begin="getPaper" to="0.2 0.2 0.2"></a-animation>
</a-entity>
```
 Hey! Thank you. I had a wrong/old version of a-frame.  A-Frame Text component Dynamic Data needed help 

If so examples and demos any pls ...  Add support for NPOT texture settings e.g. material="src:#imgElement; npot:true"
Fix support for texture offset / repeat (broken defaults and broken apply logic) This fixes #2252    before executing callback from material.src load, check to make sure we still should (i.e. that the textureSrc still matches); also, clear textureSrc when material.src is cleared to correctly detect subsequent changes unless you have some way to make an image load delay for long enough to trigger the race condition during testing, not reliably that I can think of... ok I don't know what happened, I think that somehow #2199 got roped into this one... rebased to get rid of all that noise, we can deal with that on #2199 itself changes made to #2199.

is this one good to go now? @dmarcos have you come up with an alternative fix, or has this version grown on you?  When material.src is reused, possible race conditions may prevent the desired src from being visible.

- A-Frame Version: 0.4.0
- Platform / Device: multiple
- Reproducible Code Snippet or URL:

1. Find an image URL that takes a while to be loaded.
2. Set up a scene with an entity that loads material.src from that URL (directly via src, or indirectly via selector)
3. After material.src is set, but before the image URL finished loading, change material.src to something else (e.g. a canvas)

Expected result - the canvas will remain visible as material.src, and the image load will be ignored.
Actual result - despite material.src referencing the canvas, the image load will overwrite the canvas and remain visible.  In order to make the canvas visible again, some hijinx is required due to another issue I will file separately  (that assumes the browser would allow it...)
there is already code in 0.4.0 that will auto-enter for Carmel; 
the intent was to be able to provide empty string to auto-enter regardless of display,
but in practice I'm not sure that the parsing allows empty string to survive through to init (at present, when auto-enter fails, the button to enter VR again later does not reappear for some reason, so there is a penalty for trying but failing) so using the 0.4.0 auto-enter-vr, if you know the VR display name you want to auto-enter and can modify the display parameter for the auto-enter-vr component accordingly, that might work...

IMO not good to avoid page reload since scripts won't re-run etc. also see #2298 @caseyyee my current working pattern is to use experimental Chromium and Rift; since that sends vrdisplayactivate, all you need to do is lift the headset up far enough for it to trigger deactivate, then let it drop back down to reactivate and bam! you are back in VR @ngokevin the reload should be detected as a "subsequent navigation / refresh", I would think...  **Description:**

If you try to do something like the below, you'll get knock on errors in raycaster and cursor due to there being no scene element.   I'm still getting used to the codebase so I just added these patches, but perhaps the right way to handle it would be to actually stop the element from appending if there is no nearby scene, instead of just warning.  testing for a scene in many different places seems redundant, but please advise :) 

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2225

```
var el = document.createElement('a-entity');
el.setAttribute('cursor','')
document.body.appendChild(el);

```

**Changes proposed:**
- warn if no scene element in raycaster and cursor
- return early so we dont throw an error.
-
  **Description:**

This PR adds a console warning if you try to append an element without a scene nearby.

Previously, this code 'failed silently' -- your entities need to be children of a scene.
```
var el = document.createElement('a-entity');
document.body.appendChild(el);
```

Now it displays a warning 
```You are attempting to attach an entity outside of the A-Frame scene. Try appending to the "a-scene" element. ```

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2225

**Changes proposed:**
- Check is there is a closest scene before loading.


P.S.  Please let me know if there's an earlier place we should be doing this check -- it does end up actually appending the element to the document body, which seems undesirable, but harmless i guess since it doesn't do anything.  If someone missing the warning and sees the element in the DOM, it could be confusing.  Also not sure if there's a performance impact from checking this for all elements (doesn't seem like it.)
 yep! -- i just noticed that object3D error is actually coming from the cursor component that is being appended in the issue, so i think that here the warning will be sufficient and i can open another pull to try to exit early on no object3d on the raycaster :) thanks -- didn't know about the warn utility, i'll be sure to use it next time.

 Hey there, I got the same error.
Are there any updates to this issue? same here same @dmarcos i had aframe running as a thumbnail in a corner and when clicked it takes over the page. when it loads small like that the images are very compressed, if you just change the size the image compression becomes very visible. once it is large i destroyed the aframe and built it again so that the images appeared larger. if i had the ability to reload instead, the other state information like position of camera would not be lost on destroy and rebuild.  **Description:**

- A-Frame Version: 4.0
- Platform/Device: Oculus Rift + Oculus Touch
 & http://www.pippistarace.it/aframe/helloworld2.html

The Oculus Touch controllers stay relative to 0 0 0 even though the camera has been set at a different position during loading of the scene.

this is a demo scene with the oculus touch enabled and the camera set to 0 0 0 http://www.pippistarace.it/aframe/helloworld1.html

this is another demo scene where the camera has been set at a different location. I would expect the touch controller to somehow be relative to the camera but instead they stay at 0 0 0 and can be seen from a distance
http://www.pippistarace.it/aframe/helloworld2.html I didn't change any of the `tracked-controls` position logic in the recent refactor, so I expect this would have been true previously as well... but I think the issue with the second scene is that the camera is specifically offset from the controllers due to the non-shared parent entity, so I think it is working as expected... @dmarcos @fernandojsg thoughts? well the issue that I am having is that my scene is dynamically generated and the camera starts somewhere far from 0 0 0. 
Is there a way to move the controllers or give them a starting location as well? you should be able to give them a position, @fernandojsg added that before I got here IIRC you are correct, if I set a similar position as the camera then the controllers show up.
I did try it before  but I did not realize that if I set the SAME position as the camera the controllers end up a little behind and cannot be seen. Once I saw their position in the inspector I was able to correct it. 

One issue that I found is that if I start with the camera rotated by a certain amount (i.e. 90 degrees) then the controllers will always be facing the wrong direction, even if I specify the same rotation as the camera.

Another issue that I found is that changing the position completely breaks the teleport-controls, every press seems to teleport somewhere else instead of the target at the end of the arc.

I've added the teleport controls to the two html files so that you can try it out you can see how i am using teleport in my gallery example... yeah i don't think there is rotation offset support in `tracked-controls` - not sure how far we should go, feels like a better control of roomspace may be helpful rather than these one-offs not sure if but if camera and controllers have shared parent that has rotation offset but position is done to each child individually, that may work for now including for teleport?  i think the teleport code needs to understand world to local conversion when computing position offset @giordyb sounds like the remaining issue you are having is really with teleport controls and not with tracked controllers anymore?  should we edit title and/or close this issue? is the behavior from Nightly correct?  i would expect that if (direct) oculus support is enabled, openvr should not be used for oculus devices? @machenmusik yes, it looks like the issue is limited to the teleport controls, I believe we can close the issue.
@caseyyee I did all my tests with chromium for webvr. I can't close this issue.  But... @giordyb I believe I have a fix in chenzlabs/aframe-teleport-controls

@caseyyee any way to try out the direct support in upcoming Nightly to make sure there aren't any discrepancies? @machenmusik I tried the teleport control version that you mentioned but I think it's broken, even at 0 0 0 i'm not getting anything when I press the trigger, and all I did was replacing the JS script  @giordyb you should close this issue and we should move the discussion to teleport-controls projects...
were you using my version before, or @fernandojsg ?  mine changed to use hand gesture events, so if you were using @fernandojsg then you need to change some of the parameters @machenmusik agreed, I will close the issue.  Just updating the pointer to the correct one for the Understanding Component-Entity-Systems article.  Using the new setAttribute non-clobbering object update to replace an array property will update the schema data but will not trigger the update method.

In this example, I expect to see 'receiver updated' logged two times (once on initialization and again on the `setAttribute` call from `update-test.send()`) and for the cube to turn black. Instead there is no second update log, and the cube stays gray, but the log output from `update-test.send()` shows that `recevier.data` is indeed changed. 

Trying to trace this in my Adit app, it looks like somewhere in the update process the target's schema property gets set by reference to the replacement array object, so the check in `component.updateProperties()` for whether there has been any change in order to trigger update always comes up false.  Thanks for adding the array item comparison, but I still have the assignment by reference issue:

After calling `setAttribute`, update-test.data.arr and receiver.data.arr become the same object, so changes to update-test.data.arr appear in receiver.data.arr and the check for a difference between the two (to trigger `update()`) is always false @wmurphyrd that makes sense to me. If you modify the internal representation directly and then try to update via `setAttribute()` without actually updating, it does not make sense to trigger an update. Sorry, @wmurphyrd. Now I realise. You are expecting a copy of the attribute because that is the way regular attributes work. Avoiding memory sharing is delicate since it can incur in performance penalties. @ngokevin @dmarcos @fernandojsg thoughts?  **Description:**

                removeLightOff();
            }
        }
    }
});
```

It worked pretty well in Desktop browsers. However, it didn't always work in mobile devices. "Sometimes" it added .lightOff to .site-header and .featuredImage. Clicking X button in .a-orientation-modal never removed .lightOff.

How do I make toggling always work in mobile devices?
Thanks!  **Description:**

It's not possible to add components programmatically to elements that are not yet mounted to the DOM. Discovered in ngokevin/aframe-react#52, if attempting to inject an element that contains components into the DOM, the `this.el.sceneEl` property in the component does not yet exist, causing an error in most components.

`Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'object3D' of null`
 Yes, in the aframe-react bug it is injected within the a-scene entity. Changing the STR to `document.querySelector('a-scene').appendChild(el)` does work in examples I just tried. Maybe it is aframe-react only, but not sure (yet) what in aframe-react could cause this Thanks! seems that the object3D error is related to trying to append the ```cursor``` component -- added the warning but will also open a pull to try to handle the cursor error.  **Description:**
\<a-animation\> doesn't animate on the Vive. When an animation is triggered, the entity teleports to the end location and doesn't animate through.

Suppose we have the following code:
```
<a-entity id="user">
      <a-camera></a-camera>
      <a-entity id="vive-controls-switch">
          <a-entity vive-controls="hand: left"></a-entity>
          <a-entity vive-controls="hand: right" vive-cursor></a-entity>
      </a-entity>
</a-entity>
```
You would expect that when we animate `#user`, the whole bit would animate, like it does on other platforms. However, the animation seems to skip and teleport to the end. What could be causing this?  So I'm trying to simply load a obj model and a material to a basic <a-scene> ... It is a 3d model at the following dimension ( 19.2 MB (20,156,958 bytes)) ... Is it too big for the scene?

  **Description:**
I'm a développer working currently with Aframe library. 
I have to handle zoom and fov with an Aframe camera. 
My problem is when i use Aframe camera and when i set the zoom, the display aspect is strongly wrong. 
I have see a PR this morning talking about that, this is a bug on camera, because when the developper set the camera aspect it's strongly wrong to take window.heigh and window.width.
It's also wrong when set camera aspect with data.aspect and not registring it on schema because it makes people able to pass variables into data.aspect but with getting a warn. 
My opinion is that data.aspect should be registred in schema and that aspect has to be dynamicly set when embeded.
You can test it, by pull Aframe v0.4.0 and by changing camera fov and zoom. 
I think this should be quickly fixed because it's break some feature like zoom.

 This is the PR that i highly recomend to merge: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2216 .  Sorry for the long time with no responses. 
Aspect should be on schema as long as you store it with data.aspect: 
- The first reason is because everyone can set aspect by using aspect attribute because you made it accessible, it will just trigger a warn. My opinion is that when you made it accessible, you should made it public, if you dont want to made it accessible you should do not use public variables or methods. 
- The second reason is that it's a good entry point to create effect like speed , fat effects etc....

Aspect Ration should be Always set dynamicly:
- when embeded, because when you are in a embeded mode you can have a viewport that is not reflecting to the real viewport: This made default Aframe Behavior breaking ( Aspect Ratio will not display at the right value )   **Description:**

This PR fixes the coordinates override bug in `coordinates.parse()` that
property value 0 is overridden by defaultVec's when object is given to the method.
Animation pivots/warps examples went wrong because of this bug and this PR fixes them.
 Done  Does AFrame support re-rendering from the DOM? In other words, if the DOM is modified (say with Socket.io), can AFrame be triggered to reload the scene with information taken from the DOM? Thanks very much. You're right -- my mistake. I made an error in the program and that was the reason why the objects weren't showing up. Sorry for the trouble.  Make sure time doesn't go backwards, and that deltas are reasonable.

Experimental versions of Chromium used for WebVR have a known issue
where the requestAnimationFrame timestamp is off by 1000
(microseconds instead of milliseconds)
 This is a more thorough solution to the issue #2207 behind PR #2208  On the one hand, I understand entirely this sentiment.  (Although personally I prefer this one as it makes all A-Frame `tick` handling immune to stupid `requestAnimationFrame` time behavior, not the specific off-by-1000 Chromium bug.)

On the other hand, the experimental builds are the only ones with native Oculus support, are commonly used for both Rift and Vive WebVR development, and are currently susceptible to loss of controller updates...  as it is not an A-Frame bug, I am not sure we want this to break loudly in QA vs. writing a `warn` message to logs and continuing on.  If you prefer to switch `tracked-controls` support to use `throttle` rather than `throttleTick`, rather than introducing workarounds into either `throttleTick` or the core itself, I can make a PR for that, but I don't think we should just leave things broken as-is.  > Firefox Nightly also supports both.

Really?  when I run Nightly, it only supports Oculus via SteamVR, so Touch controllers show up as OpenVR Gamepads and lose many of their unique characteristics...? > If you prefer to switch tracked-controls support to use throttle rather than throttleTick, rather than introducing workarounds into either throttleTick or the core itself, I can make a PR for that, but I don't think we should just leave things broken as-is.

I think we are pretty close to done on #2192, if you prefer I can add the change from `throttleTick` to `throttle` in that PR OK, understood.  I will change `throttleTick` to `throttle` as part of #2192 and close this PR  **Description:**

At camera component update, aspect ration is not managed for embedded scenes: this PR fixes it.

**Changes proposed:**
- handle camera aspect at update => used to be (window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight), now is handled by a scene-like function to get aspect ratio. I just realized I didn't explain why I needed this here: my problem is not on resize, it's when I change zoom or fov (for instance). At this moment there are no resize event and the aspect ratio is still recalculated... currently based on the window size. I wanted to dynamically be able to update camera properties only  By the way, your proposal seems good to me as well, it's just not the same use-case Well, I do not need to reset the aspect ratio at update time, but *someone* probably does or this code wouldn't be here:
```javascript
camera.aspect = data.aspect || (window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight);
```
Actually `data.aspect` suggests it should be possible to set aspect in camera properties, but it's not present into the schema.

So let me sum up the conversation here:

1 - Either the aspect should be into the camera properties
    - It should be into the schema
    - It definitely should be in the `update` method
    Or it shouldn't:
    - No point updating the aspect at all at update time

2 - The calculation of the ratio is currently delegated to the scene: it should move to the camera component and triggered by a `canvasresized` event from `a-scene`

On the first point, I have no use-case on the top of my head, but I usually like to be able to set components properties where they make sense. And someone probably had this in mind or there wouldn't be a `data.aspect` at all. Not my call...

On the second point: either you want to be able to set the `aspect` on the camera component schema, and then it makes sense to handle resize here, either you don't and it's perfectly fine delegating it to `a-scene` as it is now. What do you think ?
 Is this PR still under consideration? Yes, sorry, what I meant was: is @radenui still willing to finish those?

If not, I could fork this PR and apply the missing changes.  **Description:**

This PR updates Three.js to r83.
It passed `npm test` and I confirmed examples keep working.
LMK if there's any other tests I need to check.

#2212

**Changes:**
- Rename `THREE.XHRLoader` with `THREE.FileLoader` in `a-assets`
- Update sound component for `THREE.Audio` which generates `source` when it  starts to play in r83.
  fix typo  **Description:**

This PR fixes the description of `coordinates.parse` doc.  **Description:**

If I'm right, `isCoordinate` test is wrong because
'rejects invalid coordinate' doesn't reject.

This PR fixes this issue.
The root issue was `regex` is missing `^` and `$` and
it has matched four or more space separated numbers.
  **Description:**

This PR fixes the null parse test of coordinates.
`coordinate.parse(null)`  returns `undefined` if `defaultVec` isn't given.

LMK if not test but `coordinate.parse` impl is wrong, 
(I mean, if it should return `null` for null parse)
I'll close this PR end make another PR to fix the impl.
 Done I haven't updated null parse impl in this PR.
I'm gonna file another issue for it and discuss the specification there.
  **Description:** Since there is a method AFRAME.utils.device.checkHasPositionalTracking() then the next step would be to check if 6 degrees of freedom controllers are available and if so, use them.

- A-Frame Version: any
- Platform/Device: PC not sure whether it is currently possible to distinguish 3DOF from 6DOF in gamepad API, as I don't have Daydream?  also due to security concerns, gamepad API does not allow enumeration until controllers are used.  There may be a way to do something like this with tracked-controls utils function isControllerPresent working on a virtual gallery for my mom (shh it's a surprise...)

I am not trusting `gamepadconnected` to work (maybe it will consistently at some point) 
and have an example using `AFRAME.utils.trackedControls.isControllerPresent(this.el.sceneEl, undefined, {})` which needed a scene reference to get at systems 

(and if you use `gearvr-controls`, then `|| AFRAME.utils.gearVRControls.isControllerPresent()` which doesn't need a scene reference)  **Description:**

compare <a-plane src="..."> to <a-entity material="src:..."> in debugger; missing sceneEl causes texture load failure for example IIRC, this was trying to use a-text primitive... ... although I may be wrong, definitely something I tried using in the holiday gallery I put together looks like someone in Slack questions channel is having similar issue with `a-sky`, maybe that was it...  add bmfont-text component and a-text primitive to core from https://github.com/chenzlabs/aframe-bmfont-component yep, makes sense, the PR to @fernandojsg 's version is mine and incorporated here I have merged the output from @fernandojsg component PR review into this PR. IMO, it's better to work issues here where we don't necessarily have to concern ourselves with compatibility with prior uses of the actual component.

Sidebar, it is a nuisance that you can't use the same source between standalone and proposed core... which would make this sort of thing much easier if working components could literally be pulled into core > @machenmusik What does it mean working components?

when you're developing a component, you typically start with it being standalone, and only later does it potentially merit proposal for inclusion into core.  when such proposals are done, it is a shame that there is a bunch of manual editing required to go from standalone component to core PR... e.g. rename component index.js to component.js, relative require statements as opposed to global AFRAME, to THREE or not to THREE :-), component boilerplate doesn't understand docs or tests, etc. squashed the PR edits here.
what else is needed? i made a crude attempt to cache fnt/png requests in a separate branch, is it better to get baseline in then do later, or try to do all at once? could use some more eyes on the new custom shader (avoid horrible aliasing when text gets too small) would `text` be too prone to namespace collisions? Could definitely use help on tests, another case of inheriting something with none... and often visual verification is important... if `text` won't cause collision issues great.  it does have a property called text though, so that might be a little strange.  did you want me to change the component name, or were you going to take care of that? gonna be a few hours at minimum on my end, if you have the cycles go ahead if you folks have better suggestions than using gl_FragCoord.w as a guess of when to drop the alpha test (which makes the distant appearance even worse) and blend, let me know.  there are still some cases like extreme off-axis viewing that the custom shader doesn't do much for... so I changed the name to `text`, and switched aframe-arcade over to it, if you'd like to have a look / test drive remember the concern about namespace collisions?
```aframe-master.js:71618 The primitive a-text has a mapping collision. The attribute text has the same name as a registered component and has been renamed to text-text```
so renaming in the primitive at least...
 already did `<a-text value="hi there">` so we are good there, question is whether to change for `text` as well to make it consistent `text.value` is in there.  we have candidate docs now, functionality LGTM at the moment, any headway on tests?  not sure if there were any from prior incarnations to leverage re: other implementations - yeah that would probably be useful, although it could probably use a broader perspective if someone has tried them all re: moving promise caching to FileLoader - one danger there is loss of granularity (e.g.caching small things like fonts but not always large things like videos that are being progressively streamed) - aframe texture promise cache is separate from this font promise cache, etc. awesome!  thanks to everyone for sticking with it! 

maybe we should add showing "Hello World!" to the A-Frame hello world example...  texture variables with is:'uniform' and type:'map' now work with default init and update handlers

so now you can just do things like this:
```
    AFRAME.registerShader('offset-repeat', {
        schema: {
            // the texture source (probably a video)
            src: {type: 'map', is: 'uniform'},
            // texture parameters
            offset: {type: 'vec2', default: {x: 0, y: 0}, is: 'uniform'},
            repeat: {type: 'vec2', default: {x: 1, y: 1}, is: 'uniform'}
        },

        vertexShader: [
          'varying vec2 vUV;',
          'void main(void) {',
          '  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);',
          '  vUV = uv;',
          '}'
        ].join('\n'),

        fragmentShader: [
          'uniform sampler2D map;',
          'uniform vec2 offset;',
          'uniform vec2 repeat;',
          'varying vec2 vUV;',
          'void main() {',
          '  gl_FragColor = texture2D(map, vec2(vUV.x / repeat.x + offset.x, vUV.y / repeat.y + offset.y));',
          '}'
        ].join('\n')
    });
``` The existing Shader.prototype, with these changes, will handle some of the annoying grunt work of updating values for attributes and uniforms, but will let you do it yourself if you leave out e. g. `is:'uniform'`

IMO this PR has a lot of benefit for those 99.99% of us that are not hardcore shader people (e.g. I don't need any custom stuff anymore for the various shaders I did now that there is basic texture support)

Nothing stops someone from doing their own more direct ShaderMaterial usage with this merged... so for more advanced users, they can always go ahead and do as suggested in #2047, and if they are using values with supported types, they can use the convenience mappings.
 #2047 may simply be an example of how to use more directly, maybe the ones mentioned in Slack, and zero code change  for the simple shaders I am using, it's actually quite convenient.
e.g. here is the previous trivial example, which contains a lot of useless busywork
```
    // this shader uses offset and repeat
    AFRAME.registerShader('offset-repeat', {
        schema: {
            // the texture source (probably a video)
            src: {type: 'map'},
            // texture parameters
            offset: {type: 'vec2', default: {x: 0, y: 0}},
            repeat: {type: 'vec2', default: {x: 1, y: 1}}
        },

        uniforms: {
            // the texture value (once the texture source is loaded, update)
            map: { type: 't', value: null },
            // texture parameters
            offset: {type: 'vec2', value: {x: 0, y: 0}},
            repeat: {type: 'vec2', value: {x: 1, y: 1}}
        },

        init: function(data) {
            this.material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
                uniforms: this.uniforms,
                vertexShader: this.vertexShader,
                fragmentShader: this.fragmentShader
            });
        },

        update: function (data) {
            AFRAME.utils.material.updateMap(this, data);
            this.uniforms.map.value = this.material.map;
            this.uniforms.offset.value = data.offset;
            this.uniforms.repeat.value = data.repeat;
        },

        vertexShader: [
          'varying vec2 vUV;',
          'void main(void) {',
          '  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);',
          '  vUV = uv;',
          '}'
        ].join('\n'),

        fragmentShader: [
          'uniform sampler2D map;',
          'uniform vec2 offset;',
          'uniform vec2 repeat;',
          'varying vec2 vUV;',
          'void main() {',
          '  gl_FragColor = texture2D(map, vec2(vUV.x / repeat.x + offset.x, vUV.y / repeat.y + offset.y));',
          '}'
        ].join('\n')
    });
```
and here it is after the PR changes, which is what I expected:
```
    // this shader uses offset and repeat
    AFRAME.registerShader('offset-repeat', {
        schema: {
            // the texture source (probably a video)

            // texture parameters

            repeat: {type: 'vec2', default: {x: 1, y: 1}, is: 'uniform'}
        },

        vertexShader: [
          'varying vec2 vUV;',
          'void main(void) {',
          '  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);',
          '  vUV = uv;',

        ].join('\n'),

        fragmentShader: [

          'void main() {',
          '  gl_FragColor = texture2D(map, vec2(vUV.x / repeat.x + offset.x, vUV.y / repeat.y + offset.y));',
          '}'
        ].join('\n')
    });
```

 utils / boilerplate functions already exist - they are used internally by the default init and update functions
(I don't know why attributes is commented out, nor whether it is safe to uncomment)
```
  init: function (data) {
    this.attributes = this.initVariables(data, 'attribute');
    this.uniforms = this.initVariables(data, 'uniform');
    this.material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
      // attributes: this.attributes,
      uniforms: this.uniforms,
      vertexShader: this.vertexShader,
      fragmentShader: this.fragmentShader
    });
    return this.material;
  },
```
and
```
  update: function (data) {
    this.updateVariables(data, 'attribute');
    this.updateVariables(data, 'uniform');
  },
```
I don't really see a need to remove them, or to further augment them beyond this PR.

The utils handling in this PR to expose the pre-existing texture support for custom shaders is *extremely* useful.

#2047 is probably a simple example of doing those and additionally manipulating your own variables (I don't have anything that needs it, but I think @donmccurdy found one) - zero code change.
 I don't think that having either what is there now, or this PR, would imply or require full support for all THREE types.  There is a clear pattern to follow if others want to add support for other types (including cubemaps, now that the texture handling is figured out for them and all that is needed is the right entries in the property type mapping table) without this PR it is rather tricky to figure out what is going on with the texture mapping (including the oddball cases where the vestiges of the whole src-or-element issue decide they will try and make a copy of your video and you start hearing double) without this PR, the `map` property type doesn't work correctly ;-)

yeah, clearly it is down to
> more code/API to maintain versus the benefit

I agree with @dmarcos that the surface area of the API is not likely to change radically;
the benefit is being able to do many common custom shaders easily, so IMO it's worth it.

re: #2047 -- 
the example you posed is non-functional and lacks how you would propose literally any parameters be populated or properly conveyed to the shader.
```
AFRAME.registerShader('myshader', {  // or registerMaterial to map to three.js API
  schema: {},

  init: function () {
    this.material = new ShaderMaterial({
      // ...
    });
  }
});
```

If you are going to leave that as an exercise to the reader, that seems a large step backwards from either what is there now or this PR.  

As things stand right now without this PR, the necessary utility functions are not usable for other purposes besides the built-in `flat` and `standard` shaders that expect `data.src` to become `material.map`

With this PR, that API can easily do simple shaders for common needs ("e.g. how do I offset a texture") as well as less common needs such as 2D image / video manipulation.  The latter especially is of significant benefit. OK so we are leaving this open for now pending more property types / ShaderMaterial properties?  if so, would be good to have a list here for review later re: #2032 -- can the schema code handle properties that are objects/maps (to hold texture parameters) ? OK so the codecov thing now is saying
 81.53% (Diff 100%) ... hampered by, as I understand it, a general lack of tests at all in this area prior to this PR as well?  same thing I ran into with vive-controls earlier.  if there are some minimal criteria (like the semistandard checking) it would be good to add them earlier in the pipeline, it's not entirely reasonable to enforce different standards on external submissions Did some tests, code coverage looks good now.  OK to merge and open issue for remaining property types? @dmarcos let me know if anything else is needed here thanks!

 @ngokevin Got it. Thanks.
  For distortion map properties such as `displacementScale`, `displacementBias` and `normalScale`
 This affects docs back to v0.3.1 I believe  Fixes https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2190 @dmarcos @ngokevin looks like 0.4.0 model syntax changed and broke prior `vive-controls` model usage; for those that were using its built-in model, this is an important fix  **Description:**

It should be possible to use A-Frame embedded without the VR mode UI enabled. After all, embedding often means a heavily customized solution including custom UI to enter and leave VR.

**Changes proposed:**

- Only add and remove `embedded` class from Enter VR element if it exists in the DOM
- Added test for `embedded` component, which tests the component's ability to work both when the `vr-mode-ui` component is enabled and disabled.  Per discussion on #2183, `gearvr-controls` will not be included in core, but will be available as a separate component.  These changes are needed for `hand-controls` to be compatible with `gearvr-controls` and other separate controller components. The separate `gear-controls` component is now available at https://github.com/chenzlabs/gearvr-controls

Once this PR is merged, I can change the aframe reference in package.json back to mainline. > Can you remind me again why are these changes necessaries to incorporate the gear-vr touchpad?

Most of the changes are to properly isolate Oculus Touch specific behaviors to isOculusTouch rather than !isVive (which works when there are only those two, but will fail immediately with successive controllers)
 ok, added:
`// return true so handleButton knows something changed` (squashed commits a bit for convenience) @dmarcos good to merge now? Something strange is happening with the `hand-controls` tests when I try to remove `process.nextTick` from a few places...  runs fine locally with `npm run test:chrome` but then gets failures... will need to revert that  thx - apparently it takes longer than next tick for the entity to load in setup then... aargh something went wrong in rebase... looking at it now @dmarcos OK now @dmarcos ok reconstituted lost jsdoc edit  update to use new hand animations from arturitu via rawgit
TODO: update to aframe CDN URLs once published
TODO: unused poses
 may want to do #2192 first to avoid spurious conflicts, as it uses the hand animation names that are then updated as part of this one rebased but not yet double-checked.  still recommend new CDN URLs to avoid breaking npm builds that already pulled down old code... ran this last night looked ok on Touch... I am guessing this one may be waiting for point release tested working with latest experimental Chromium and Oculus Touch;
using Nightly plus Vive, gamepad id has changed from `OpenVR Gamepad` to `OpenVR Controller` latest version confirmed working with `examples/showcase/tracked-controls` in VR on:

latest Nightly 54.0a1 (2017-02-08), latest SteamVR 1485823399 , OpenVR API 1.02 DLL, Vive controllers
`OpenVR Controller` x2 (when in concert with https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2370)

latest experimental Chromium 56.0.2910.0, Oculus 1.11.0.335615 (1.11.0.335772), Rift and Touch controllers

older experimental Chromium 56.0.2900.0, older SteamVR vrserver.exe 1481163074, Vive controllers
`OpenVR Gamepad` x2
(see https://github.com/toji/chrome-webvr-issues/issues/135#issuecomment-278556238 for details) separating the old-and-new Vive support into
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2370  In current chromium the vive controls do not get tracked anymore using the `vive-controls` component:
They are rendered at their correct position at pageload (!), but do not move.

- There is no error in the console.
- It works in Firefox with *WebVR Plus* extension.
- The controls did work for me with aframe 0.3.2.

Did not test whether this also occurs with the `tracked-controllers` component..

- A-Frame Version: `0.4.0`
- Platform/Device: HTC Vive, chromium 53
- [codepen](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/PbVdbB)
 a few comments...
- I thought, although I could be wrong, that chromium 53 is too old for webvr etc. ?
- I suspect that the issue may be due to this: because of the multiple controller support, each of the individual components (`oculus-touch-controls` and `vive-controls`) do not inject a default `tracked-controls` instance automatically i.e. do not have `dependencies: ['tracked-controls']` -- as well as a change to default `tracked-controls` values not to auto-select the first OpenVR Gamepad which was causing difficulties with Oculus Touch integration.
- now that the default `tracked-controls` instance does not auto-match first Vive wand, it may be safe to reintroduce the `tracked-controls` dependency, but I am not certain that will solve the issue.
- the new Gear VR Touchpad PR does inject a default `tracked-controls` instance on right hand, perhaps @noerw can try using https://rawgit.com/chenzlabs/aframe/f895024d88a41926c2337a5235b77b5be04f76ef/dist/aframe-master.js to see if that makes the right hand work?  or to add `tracked-controls` with no parameters to each hand? @dmarcos @noerw i was unable to reproduce this, however I note that this is precisely the behavior that occurred when the `hand-controls` models were changed this morning without https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2188 ... the missing animations caused errors, and position was apparently not being updated. I see that PR is closed, maybe we do actually want it after all... I tested again, and can still reproduce it.
@machenmusik Your proposed `tracked-controls` fixes did not work.

However, I told you some wrong facts yesterday:
- running chromium 56.0.2902 x64
- the following appears in the console twice. In Firefox directly on pageload, in Chromium once i enter VR mode:
```
components:obj-model:warn Material component properties are ignored when a .MTL is provided (aframe.js:327:8)

THREE.MTLLoader: .setBaseUrl() is deprecated. Use .setTexturePath( path ) for texture path or .setPath( path ) for general base path instead (aframe.js:49259:3)
```

ps: can't reopen the issue.

**edit**: I doubt that its about the model, as it works with aframe 0.3.2, which references the same model (?).
Can you propose some commits which I can test against, since the bug has been introduced between 0.3.2 and 0.4.0? sorry, model for hand-controls changed, i don't think vive-controls did

where is the chromium build you use coming from?  i use tojiro's from webvr.info with your codepen, if I add debug to the scene
```
<a-scene debug antialias="true">
  <a-entity vive-controls="hand: left"></a-entity>
  <a-entity vive-controls="hand: right"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```
and inspect the a-frame view, it is clear to see that the controls are definitely getting position and rotation updates... 

but I think the url(...) syntax may have been deprecated in 0.4.0 and thus no model.... let me confirm  @dmarcos can you get #2194 into mainline?

@noerw can you confirm that this one works: 
https://rawgit.com/chenzlabs/aframe/5feeec6f625013e3381a397ea0433efb0b4c4352/dist/aframe-master.js see #2207  yeah, the version you linked works, as well as current master, thanks!
sorry for the late reply  implement https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2136 so... `tick` has a specific signature `function (time, delta)` which is why calling this `throttleTick` makes sense, it won't work generically for functions that don't have compatible signatures or calling patterns. if one of you would like to make a quick mod to this that does not use the time values passed by `tick` but generically calls `Date.now()` itself, that may make more sense as a generic throttle... > If you debounce the tick and later change the component you might end up with a strange behaviour and then remember / rediscover that tick was being debounced

if you replace tick with function, still generically true.  not sure why you are specifically concerned with tick here

> In this case updateControllerList should be the pne debouced and documented on the method

IMO no, that may be called from other places that should not be throttled


 > updateControllerList: utils.throttle(function updateControllerList() { ... }, 100);

you are assuming, incorrectly, that the only caller to this function is the tick handler.  Consider that other callers may be extremely confused to find that their immediate call attempt (e.g. due to onGamepadConnected / Disconnected) is not made... the throttling should be confined to the intended surface, which is to say the periodic check should happen no more often than X.

BTW, if you only update every 100ms, then your controller pose and state is only updated every 100ms, which is not acceptable from a user standpoint. ticks in general are not throttled by this, just this specific tick handler, which seems appropriate.  per your objection above, in systems tracked-controls I call the throttled handler throttledTick so it is obvious when debugging. @ngokevin agree but original request was for common case of throttling all periodic handling for a tick handler, using the time passed in to avoid superfluous calls to get redundant time values, which is what the PR addresses. (I have some slight concern that generic throttle will be abused and it will be difficult to understand why calls aren't being made when debugging.) I kinda like @ngokevin 's thought, but then it is annoying to not be able to see what throttledUpdateControllerList does.  Maybe this is more clear / readable (if it would work)...
```
throttledUpdateControllersList: throttle(function () { this.updateControllersList(); }, 10, this),

tick: function () {
  this.throttledUpdateControllersList();
}
```
But I am not sure that `this` would resolve correctly here.

Note that this is only more clear when there is a bunch of other stuff being done in the function, rather than just a method call.  I agree that @dmarcos that convention may eliminate the need @ngokevin agree, I left throttleTick in there and made a throttle as well.

case in point, the tick handler has to update and emit, so you have to make a throttledTick function that does exactly what is there anyway, and at that point you may as well use the more efficient form that gets time passed in. This code looks good to me.

You may want to use a window.performance.now polyfill for more accurate timestamps. We wrote [a polyfill](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/blob/master/src/Tween.js#L72) for window.performance.now in tween.js.

Also, this could be useful for users of tween.js. I might borrow the code and include it in tween.js as a utility. @mikebolt thanks, agree - @ngokevin is there a standard way to do in aframe?

should this throttle be published as a (tiny) separate npm module that aframe picks up,
to make it easier to reuse in TWEEN.js etc. ?  a recent change to hand-controls models exposed a weakness when animations are missing;
this PR makes hand-controls defensive i.e. the missing animations won't play, but won't break other things the problem is that animations were breaking more than just themselves, really model errors should not prevent eventing and pose updates  i like this idea. i even got an implementation of this. ok it is 2y old and in pure three.js. but it shows how simple the implementation can be.

  The `gearvr-controls` component interfaces with the "Gear VR Touchpad"
controller exposed by the Carmel and Samsung Internet VR browsers.  
As that controller has no pose,
the `tracked-controls` component cannot provide its usual
functionality (but an instance is added anyway since other components such 
as `aframe-teleport-controls` use that to find controller entities).  Instead,
the `look-controls` component is added to mimic a 3DOF controller using HMD orientation,
similar to gaze-based cursors.

This component adds button mappings and events, but does not currently provide
a controller model since it is assumed that end users will use this indirectly
through higher level components such as the hand-controls component.  

When used via `hand-controls`, as there is only one "Gear VR Touchpad",  
currently this component will only bind to the right hand, not the left. >The application should detect if there are tracked controllers and if not used an alternative interaction method (e.g: gazed based cursor) that better adapts to the capabilities of the device

Yes, this gets back to some of the original conversation on #2124 and #2132.

These changes allow applications to do that easily by using `hand-controls='right'`, rather than having to explicitly include all of `oculus-touch-controls`, `vive-controls` and `carmel-gearvr-controls` and handle them separately which is tedious and scales poorly (what are they supposed to do with Daydream then)?

And rather than having a well-known component responsible for figuring out which controllers are attached and only injecting the right one(s) -- that was `auto-detect-controllers` -- since you guys specifically rejected that approach in core previously, but then we still have higher level like `hand-controls` in core so people can use "out of the box" rather than having to go hunt everything down in the registry. > I have no idea how you're supposed to control your hands with 2 axis. I feel that the touchpad is more appropriate to be paired with a gazed based cursor. 

@dmarcos I just realized, you may not have understood from the description that this is basically what the PR does -- modified the description to make it more obvious that for Carmel GearVR, it is `look-controls` and HMD orientation that is used for controller pose, not the 2D position from the touchpad. IMO, there's no particularly good reason why `hand-controls` needs to be exclusive.  For zero-DOF controllers like GearVR, the hand position and pose can be emulated from player position and HMD (gaze), and the hand model as visual representation and pointing animation can still be retained.  For 3DOF like Daydream, the hand position can be emulated from player position, and the actual controller orientation can be used.

As previously discussed, I think most of this comes up because `hand-controls` is in core and serves as showcase example as well.  If you'd like a switch to enable/disable emulation, that makes sense to me...

ugh, but I forgot that the hand-controls schema has nowhere to put a switch at present :-/ So as things stand there are no examples of what to do with A-Frame on GearVR (and Daydream),  I agree with your statement that the tracked-controls example really calls out for Touch and/or Vive controllers, but I think https://chenzlabs.github.io/aframe-teleport-controls/mesh/ shows that the hand-controls component can still be useful in other situations.  It sounds as though you are asking those looking to support the most numerous VR platforms by far to go outside A-Frame, rather than also having examples of how to use non-tracked controllers as part of A-Frame. Maybe all that needs to change here to accommodate your perspective is that `hand-controls` should not inject `gearvr-controls` -- but this code should still exist in core; if one wants to allow GearVR emulated hand control, then simply do `<a-entity hand-controls="right" gearvr-controls>` (or left) -- and if not, `gearvr-controls` is available to be leveraged directly.  

If you agree, I will happily make that simple change right now the mouse/touchpad emulation is activated for GearVR when using Samsung Internet VR browser, and there is specific hackery to leverage the Carmel gamepad mapping.  The first could be made more generic like the auto-enter discussion, but the second probably shouldn't be.  are you suggesting splitting those into two components? OK, but even with `gearvr-controls` moved out of core, the other small changes (e.g. use !isOculusTouch rather than isVive) are needed for compatibility.  I will close this one, and make a separate PR for the compatibility changes without the GearVR controls. (the `gamepad-controls` comment is interesting though, as it makes the case to include emulated tracking in core to accompany them, for responsive controls more generically supported)  **Description:**

This is a snippet from my code (which uses jquery, not tested with vanilla js), note the workaround at the end and the comments. All attributes passed to the appendObject function are strings.

```
       function appendObject(id, file, scale, position, rotation, scale) {
         console.log(position);
         $('<a-obj-model />', {
           id: id,
           class: 'city object children',
           position: position,  // doesn't seem to do anything
           scale: scale,
           rotation: rotation,
           scale: scale,
           file: file,
           src: '#' + file + '-obj',
           mtl: '#' + file + '-mtl',
           appendTo : $('#city')
         });
        document.getElementById(id).setAttribute("position", position); // this does set position 
       }
  `AFRAME.utils.coordinates.stringify` will produces scientific notation for values near zero. If this ends up in a `y` component of the `to` for a `position` animation, the object will vanish with the console error:

>THREE.Color: Unknown color -0.5 1e-11 -1

The values in the error are the stringified position coordinates. 

The animation works normally if this number notation appears in `x` or `z` but not `y`

 thanks @donmccurdy , now working fine   If it does supports Adaptive streaming then Can you please provide adaptive streaming supported videos for testing? latest master needs #2129 As long as media source extensions are supported it is possible to build a component that could support adaptive streaming. I would not suggest this be part of A-Frame core. So the answer would be no, A-Frame video elements do not support adaptive bitrate streaming out of the box but it would be possible for a third-party component to provide that functionality.  Hi,
I want to build an APK using cordova, were i'm using the A-frame videosphere asset. I know that Chrome doesn't support A-Frame videospheres completely for now, but I hoped that it would be working with an APK. 
But there is my problem : I can hear the sound of my video running but i can only see a white screen displayed on my mobile when i start the APK. Clicking, reloading, moving around, nothing closes this screen...
Maybe Android does not support A-Frame videospheres too ?
If you could bring me more information about my problem, it would be great :)
Thank you ! Hi @Charton100774 , sorry to up this post but I encountered the same problem using cordova and I can't find solution on stackoverflow or web in general :/ 
So I would want know if you have the answer or if you have open a stackoverflow issue that I missed ?  After trying to implement continuous and dynamic animation, I've come so solution via TWEEN:

```
AFRAME.registerComponent('camera-seeker', {
    	init() {

    		let el = this.el;
			this.CAMERA = document.querySelector('#player');
    		this.newCords = {};
    		this.seekAnim = new AFRAME.TWEEN.Tween(this.el.getAttribute('rotation'))
    			.easing(AFRAME.TWEEN.Easing.Linear.None)
    			.onUpdate(function () {
    				el.setAttribute('rotation', { x: this.x, y: this.y, z: this.z });
    			});
    	},
    	tick () {
    		this.seekAnim.to(this.CAMERA.getAttribute('rotation'), 5000).start();
    	}
    });
```

I've tested example from TWEEN github: 

```
    init() {

    		var coords = { x: 0, y: 0 };
			var tween = new TWEEN.Tween(coords)
			    .to({ x: 100, y: 100 }, 1000)
			    .onUpdate(function() {
			        console.log(this.x, this.y);
			    })
			    .start();

	    	requestAnimationFrame(animate);

			function animate(time) {
			    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
			    TWEEN.update(time);
			}
    }
```
Everything looks more less in Chrome, but in Nightly, duration seems to be awkward:

For some reason TWEEN skipping animation framerate and any animation via TWEEN executes regardless duration set.

**Working perfectly without AFRAME, only TWEEN appended in header:**

- A-Frame Version: 0.4.0
- Platform/Device: Windows 10, Nightly 53.0a1 (2016-12-12) (64-bit) I suspect the issue is related to the errors that appear in Firefox but not in Chromium. requestAnimationFrame isn't guaranteed to be called 60 times per second. It looks like some computationally expensive code (resizing a texture) had a higher priority than requestAnimationFrame. Try delaying the code by a second or two and see if that fixes the problem. 

I also strongly recommend resizing the texture yourself, so that it doesn't slow down the client in the future.  **Description:**

Hello,

Currently on a mobile device I can only enter in the VR mode. I can't enter on the classic regular fullscreen mode, which is disturbing because I would like to hide the address bar like in desktop fullscreen option. Why don't we have both icons like in Google's VR script?

 Thanks!  **Description:**
Event names for vive-controls had wrong description

**Changes proposed:**
- Switch trackpad and trigger event names to match correct description  As I understood, one-way event handling between two components should look like:
```
//component A
document.querySelector('#componentB').emit('custom', {}, false);

//componentB
this.el.addEventListener('custom', function (event) {
  //event is new some native event
})
```

Confusion for me is ```event``` parameter. As I saw, it should actually respond with ```{name, data}``` but received object with bunch of private data.

What is the way to properly handle event between components? 

- A-Frame Version: 0.4.0
 Probably I've become too comfort with event system with same input-output. As input to trigger is ```{ name, data }```, output suggested would be ```{ event, data }``` where event containing own properties and data is link to event.data. Anyway thanks for great framework.  both with an initial attempt (which may fail, but works on Carmel)
and also on vrdisplayactivate (e.g. when you put the HMD on with Chromium) am investigating how to correctly add this functionality to all scenees by default, so examples using aframe will just work with Carmel and other browsers that allow entering VR without user action and don't emit vrdisplayactivate; for now, you can use this and just say `a-scene auto-enter-vr` hmm OK, a component version is currently in a PR to a-painter; pointers to add to registry would be helpful.  The original idea was to detect Carmel and auto-enter VR so that A-Frame sites would work unmodified, which would presumably belong as a PR here, in which case it should not be an external component, correct?  Will modify this PR to be scoped to Carmel only since it has no other way to enter VR... OK so... according to Justin, the Carmel UA is indistinguishable at the moment, and the gamepad 'Gear VR' doesn't appear to be available (probably the general issue where gamepads aren't enumerable until first used, for security purposes) -- so the way to have it auto-enter VR for Carmel is to have it auto-enter in general.

To add to all scenes by default, so A-Frame scenes just work with Carmel, I added `auto-enter-vr` last in the list of default scene components (rather than first, which didn't work).

I thought that the `enter-vr-ui` component was about showing the button that lets you enter / exit VR, not actually doing it, so that was related but separate UI functionality.  At present, with both enabled, an A-Frame scene will auto-enter VR< and if/when you exit, you will see the normal button to allow re-entry.  **Description:**
When removing the src-Attribute of the material-component or when removing the entire material component from an entity, the texture remains in memory.

This causes memory leaks (especially on mobile) when dealing with a lot and/or large textures. THREE.js will remove a texture from memory when "dispose()" is called on it.

Like this:
this.el.object3DMap.mesh.material.map.dispose();

Example:

http://lab.immersiveweb.ch/aframe/

Click on the left box: Removes Material (Texture count in stats remains the same)
Click on the right box: Disposes Texture and then removes Material (Texture count in stats drops)


Should we consider adding this behaviour into the Material-Component?

 @ngokevin Can you please post a step by step guide how to fix this problem? I can't quite follow your above answer. Thanks @donmccurdy  Thanks but why on npm is still the old 0.5 version?
https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe  Can confirm, the primitive `models` example throws the same error for me.

It seems to the stem from the `a-obj-model` primitive - removing it allows the scene to render without error.
Also changing the `a-obj-model` primitive to a component like so seems to allow the crate model to render normally.:

In the meantime, this is available as `stats-in-vr` component in registry, if we want to include in core, should probably pull in latest changes Agree this can live as a 3rd party component, and that the original PR is stale now... although really something should be done to the built-in stats to make them not entirely useless in VR.  Fixes #2160
  **Description:**
Right now there is no way to register a src to be loaded as a texture to be sampled by a custom shader.

Something like this or any variation would be nice:

```
    diffusetex: { type: 'src', is: 'uniform' }
    normalmap: { type: 'src', is: 'uniform' }
```

- A-Frame Version: 0.4.0
- Platform/Device: any

This might be also related to #2147  yes, or you can replace the default init/update handling and handle uniforms yourself.  will see if i can post an example ```
    // this shader uses offset and repeat

    AFRAME.registerShader('offset-repeat', {
        schema: {
            // the texture source (probably a video)
            src: {type: 'map'},
            // texture parameters
            offset: {type: 'vec2', default: {x: 0, y: 0}},
            repeat: {type: 'vec2', default: {x: 1, y: 1}}
        },

        uniforms: {
            // the texture value (once the texture source is loaded, update)
            map: { type: 't', value: null },
            // texture parameters
            offset: {type: 'vec2', value: {x: 0, y: 0}},
            repeat: {type: 'vec2', value: {x: 1, y: 1}}
        },

        init: function(data) {

            this.material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({

                uniforms: this.uniforms,

                vertexShader: this.vertexShader,

                fragmentShader: this.fragmentShader

            });
        },



        update: function (data) {
            AFRAME.utils.material.updateMap(this, data);
            this.uniforms.map.value = this.material.map;
            this.uniforms.offset.value = data.offset;
            this.uniforms.repeat.value = data.repeat;
        },



        vertexShader: [
          'varying vec2 vUV;',
          'void main(void) {',
          '  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);',
          '  vUV = uv;',
          '}'
        ].join('\n'),

        fragmentShader: [
          'uniform sampler2D map;',
          'uniform vec2 offset;',
          'uniform vec2 repeat;',
          'varying vec2 vUV;',
          'void main() {',
          '  gl_FragColor = texture2D(map, vec2(vUV.x / repeat.x + offset.x, vUV.y / repeat.y + offset.y));',
          '}'
        ].join('\n')
    });
``` (might be worth making updateMap more broadly reusable for these purposes, but for single texture this is simpler) if type 'map' worked properly out of the box, my example would have been literally just schema and shaders, which was where i thought the line was (and should be). I'm quite new to aFrame, looking to write a simple fragment shader that animates a texture. If I'm following this thread correctly, registerShader is likely to continue to evolve so my best bet is to use registerComponent and work directly with the threejs ShaderMaterial API?  Many thanks! I like the way that example just uses THREE values without worrying about types, maybe that passthrough type plus map (texture) should be the limit of what registerShader() is willing to do #2199  **Description:** @sirkitree [reported](https://github.com/bryik/aframe-vive-cursor-component/issues/2) yesterday that using the vive-cursor component with A-Frame master causes a crash. I thought this was a problem with the component at first, but adding A-Frame's own raycaster component to an entity with vive-controls causes the same crash.

  When adding a url as such:

`<a-sphere material="src:url(...)"></a-sphere>`

I get: 

> No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource

Is it possible that inline urls could be made to allow for crossorigin as  a property of the material?

Reposted here (in case it is not a bug): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40955781/cors-inline-material-for-aframe I actually DO have CORS setup on my amazon server. It works correctly when the file is added as part of the <a-assets> with crossorigin attribute.

`<img id="alibrary" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/..." crossorigin="anonymous">`

The problem is when I try to set the url on the object itself not in a-assets:

`<a-image src="url(...)" position="0 0 -2" width="2" height="2"></a-image>`

I get the following error:
> XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://s3.amazonaws.com.... No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin is therefore not allowed access.
 Personally I don't care too much as I use the <a-assets> as a workaround, but I have experienced CORS issues when using the url on the object directly. If your request doesn't specify an Origin header, S3 won't include the CORS headers in the response. is the issue solved ? I am facing the same problem  still on problem @bhibi I solved the problem I was facing. Can you elaborate your case ? thx @codechikbhoka i had some problem with adding image, .jpg file work flawless but i cant add my .png image with transparent background. I guess I am having the same error, when I put the image link using imgix ( a service similar to cloudinary ) directly in the html with `<img>` tag everything works, however when I put it in the a-frame tag, it doesn't work
`<a-scene>
  <a-sky src="https://example.imgix.net/example/example.jpg?lossless=True" rotation="0 0 0"></a-sky>
</a-scene>
`
This is all what I have in the page, a simple 360 image served from an external source over HTTPS.


I contacted the customer support of imgix and that was their reply

Please help me fix this error.
Thanks in advance. what happens is, when you request a resource from a third party, you have to mention the origin tag in the request. Then only that third party will send you response with Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. So to do this in aframe, you should add crossorigin=anonymous in your img item in your a-asset.

This should work: 

https://gist.github.com/codechikbhoka/3c0135b88ec1fd876377d091a19f92df @codechikbhoka Thank you so much Vivek, That solved it for me! @ngokevin Using the asset management system did not fix the issue. 

```
<a-assets>
        <img id="asset-scene-url" src="{{location.scene_img_url}}">
<a-assets>

  <a-sky ng-click="print()" src="#asset-scene-url"></a-sky>
```

Where location.scene_img_ur is an s3 asset with CORS enabled. Issue still remains.



## FIX can be found above. Add  crossorigin="anonymous" to the img tag within a-assets @ngokevin the problem with **Chrome** (and **Safari**) is probably within [this piece of code](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/16679ab3518d7d07b4c61abd7817d2ca5098da60/src/utils/src-loader.js#L91-L103).

It "checks" that the to-be-loaded src is indeed an image, without setting the `crossOrigin` value. The browser then probably caches the received headers and since it was NOT requested with the `Origin` header, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is not present in the cached response.

Then it proceeds to load the image (using **three.js**' [`ImageLoader`](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/fdc8b669b30323aedd4126ef7d5ef3362203c0fd/src/loaders/ImageLoader.js#L76)), but since this time the `crossOrigin` is set (`"anonymous"` by default) and the header is not set in the cache, the browser cancels it because of *CORS*. @codechikbhoka not able to access your solution. could you please resend it?
https://gist.github.com/codechikbhoka/3c0135b88ec1fd876377d091a19f92df url is not accessible.

Thanks in advance I am still getting trouble with this. I can not use both the inline and `crossorigin` method from an S3 bucket. I have used Aframe React, Vanilla Aframe (mostly `a-image`), the asset system using `<img src=whatever crossorigin="anonymous" />`, and I tried to apply a texture to a plane to try and render out my image but I am not succeeding.   Hello!

I'm trying to get vue/nuxt.js working in tandem with a-frame however a-frame isn't loading properly. Sometimes the scene loads other times it loads content from one template but not from another on other occasions it just doesn't load at all. It looks like the two libraries are racing each other while loading.

Does anyone kmow how to get a-frame working with nuxt.js / vue?

Cheers :)  Hi I wanted to know if this is still in implementation or if there is another component out there that has same functionality to create a "load screen" before all assets are loaded fluidly.  - A-Frame Version: 0.3.2

I am following the instructions of adding to home screen, launching the home screen app but I get a black screen in place of video. Same result also without using home screen.

With remote debugger I get a lot of instances of this:
`[Warning] Invalid timestamps detected. Time step between successive gyroscope sensor samples is very small or not monotonic (aframe.js, line 55911, x24)`

When entering VR mode I get another error:
```

```

I know this has been discussed on #316, but all the constraints mentioned there have been fulfilled, yet it does not work.
 I am having the same issue, same black screen, in fact have ~never~ been able to get <a-videosphere> to work on mobile (iOS 10.x). Followed all instructions verbatim, including adding the metatag, inline-video, pin to home screen, etc. in all permutations. What are we missing here? I am having the same issue. Any chance it is a problem with the CDN? I mean... it shouldn't, but I can't figure out whats wrong at all. Desktop mode works fine. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1846 up Probably this happens because the video file should be served from the same origin - this is how mobile Safari works. Here video file is served from CDN domain.  **Description:**

I wanted to play around with a-frame animations and things looked in stable chrome (54.0.2840.9), but when I switched to the webvr enabled chrome build from https://webvr.info/get-chrome/ my animations stopped working properly. They still did something, but no smooth animation. Best see for yourself, can be reproduced with the anime ui example as well: https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/anime-UI/. (Quite possible this is a webvr issue in chrome, I just can't say. /cc @toji) It stopped working in the latest chrome build for WebVR from 29th October 2016.
In the release from the 23rd of September 2016 animations are working fine: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzudLt22BqGRbHdGOTdiaTBkZXM This might be the issue ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dP9m3WLh2lsBs9jJ9LRwv1l0AtuBQAqGLAV-fUbtz2U)):

  1. a fast easy way to provide some order would be adding a tock() method on components. All tocks() would be guaranteed to run after ticks(). Post processing doesn't need changes to the core, I'm currently implementing it on top of regular master.

2. This can provide some ordering right now. Systems always run after components.

3. Having tick/tock on shaders would be great and would simplify the implementation of complex materials, like using procedurally generated textures etc  Thanks for figuring out the original issue! :+1:  **Description:**

When setting a component schema such as:

```javascript
schema: {
  foo: {
    type: 'string',
    default: null,
  }
}
```

The values set on `this.data` don't reflect the default `null`, instead, we end up with an empty object.

The problem is introduced by [this line](https://github.com/dmarcos/aframe/blob/53eae6d00a6eca53e494b6e3f2887251a36549a3/src/core/component.js#L334):

```javascript
data[key] = typeof defaultValue === 'object' ? utils.extend({}, defaultValue) : defaultValue;
```

The `utils.extend` returns a new empty object.

---

## The Fix

Instead, it should check to see if it's actually an object, maybe via one of these two methods:

```javascript
data[key] = Object.prototype.toString.call(defaultValue) === '[object Object]' ? utils.extend({}, defaultValue) : defaultValue;
```

or

```javascript
data[key] = (defaultValue.constructor && defaultValue.constructor === Object) ? utils.extend({}, defaultValue) : defaultValue;
```

Personally; I prefer the first option as it protects against the mutable `.constructor` property being modified by userland code.

---

_Edit_: Am happy to open a PR; just give the :+1: for one of the two solutions above, and I'll get it done. That works too :)

There's nothing else that reports `typeof` as `'object'` which we'd need to special-case here too?  **Description:**  A component named _namedcomponent_ get registered and works whereas _NamedComponent_ or _namedComponent_ silently fails.

 Add this code:

    var el = document.getElementsByTagName('a-scene')[0];
    console.log(el.attributes);

The resulting NamedNodeMap only contains "namedcomponent". HTML ignores the capitalization of attributes. You can use the capitalized version and register a lower-case component, but not visa-versa.

There is no fix, but the code can and should produce a warning, and this should be documented.
  (@ngokevin this is done right?)  refactor hand-controls per discussion on https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2124 @dmarcos @ngokevin take a look at this refactor, pulling over salient comments from prior discussion...

>> An alternative is to leave oculus-controls and vive-controls to handle the model loading. That would mean some potential code duplication but everything is simple and clear

> the alternative you suggest is basically the current refactor, with `modeled-controllers` basically meaning "platform please detect and inject for me" - so to add autodetect of `daydream-controls`, one would simply add to `prefixMapping` in `modeled-controllers` which would detect the controller via gamepad extensions id prefix

renamed `modeled-controllers` to `auto-detect-controllers` to make its function more obvious @dmarcos bringing the discussion over to the refactor...

> Authors don't have to enumerate the controllers manually. For instance hand-controls (and other high level controls schema) would do the instantiate and configure them in the init method: ```
el.setAttribute('vive-controls' { ... });
el.setAttribute('oculus-controls' { ... });```
The capabilities of each controller are very different. Daydream is only 3DOF, Vive has a touchpad, Touch has two analog joysticks and two triggers. Each application and type of controls should decide what input to use and how integrate it. Integration is not straight forward and there's going to be cases where you cannot simply support all inputs for your interaction model. You cannot for instance do a-painter with a Daydream controlller or there might be an application that uses the two analog triggeres of the Oculus Touch in a way that won't work in a Vive controller. We should favor highly reusable non opinionated components in the core and let 3rd parties to compete on the higher levels of abstraction.

right, for example `tracked-controls` should not assume that tracked controls always have handedness, and it should remain possible to use `oculus-touch-controls` or `vive-controls` explicitly.

it sounds as though you may prefer that `auto-detect-controllers` add every possible type of vendor control and let each of them sort it out individually, but that doesn't seem to scale well to me vs. detecting and adding the right one when asked to auto-detect. >  We should favor highly reusable non opinionated components in the core and let 3rd parties to compete on the higher levels of abstraction.

right.  but `hand-controls` is in the stock package, and if we had a dozen types of controllers, it seems more efficient to auto-detect the right one (with that logic in a different component) than to add 12, which is why this refactor places `auto-detect-controllers` in the stock package; that makes `hand-controls` just an example of how to handle model and events (and delegate auto-detection), which authors can then modify as they see fit. imagine there are a dozen types of vendor controls.  you're suggesting that each entity should drag around 11 dead attribute specifications along with the 1 live one to avoid auto-detection, which although possible seems cumbersome and does not scale well... 

remember, each needs a hand specified, and a flag to determine whether or not to use default model... as opposed to just `<a-entity auto-detect-controllers="hand:left; model:false"></a-entity>`

in addition it allows a badly written one to interfere with other working ones.  

that approach is allowed in this refactor (nothing stops one from doing exactly what you said), I do not believe that said approach should be recommended by implementing `hand-controls` in core that way.  if you would prefer to move both `hand-controls` and `auto-detect-controllers` out of core, that would make sense to me, but then I suspect enough folks would use them that we'd want to move back into core... +counter-example - there are already at least four real types of full hand controllers - the granddaddy Hydras, Vive wands, PS Move, and Oculus Touch - and one partial (3DOF Daydream controller).  That ignores button-only handheld controllers like Oculus Remote and actual gamepads.

Although each has unique characteristics, every one of the full or partial hand controllers can easily provide point-and-OK/Back to support simple experiences, which merely requires loose coordination of button event naming to make possible here. @ngokevin seems like you are saying you'd like to keep this open but unmerged for now, which leaves the current state of aframe supporting only vive wands due to hardcoding.  IMO, merging this PR is better than ignoring Touch entirely (although it could definitely use proper models), with a better pattern to leverage for the immediate and near future. IMO it's actually easier not to have to support simultaneous usage on same entity short term (less to fix with existing vive, and to test), but obviously go ahead and implement if you think it's quicker for you.

Is there a better way to leverage the system.controllers array that `tracked-controls` maintains, rather than eaxh vendor control making its own calls to navigator.getGamepads() ?  At the moment, you need to know exactly what to tell tracked-controls to use, so it seems you can't use a singleton component to get the controllers array (once overall, not once per tracked-controls instance) and then specify which you want tracked via atrribute injection. problem might be too strong a word.

because the hand attribute on OpenVR Gamepad is currently unreliable, vive uses hardcoded id and controller values (and that controller number is relative, not absolute index).  for Oculus Touch, the hands appear to be named differently at present so values could be hardcoded as well, but if they fix the reliability of hand atrributes on OpenVR Gamepad, then vive will have to enumerate

though, a little worried about tick handler for tracked-controls calling getGamepads() every time... times number of instances? > `tracked-controls` should not call `getGamepads` on every tick.

But... https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/systems/tracked-controls.js#L20 ?

right now, if you have both `oculus-touch-controls` and `vive-controls` on an entity, you should only get one `tracked-controls` unless you have both, but won't button events etc. fire on each?  need to know whether the `tracked-controls` instance is the one the vendor control component specified or not? > If it is not present then you do nothing :). The component stays quite and out of the way.

but it still installs event handlers, which tracked-controls will fire on both, right? thanks for the suggestions... am wondering whether there is any actual guarantee that the controllers will not disappear and reappear in different enumerated order for example.   how often does the system tick handler fire? can probably update the controller list at a much lower frequency... OK, take a look at the latest - since you prefer multiple specification to auto-detect at the moment, `hand-controls.js` does it that way, with auto-detect commented out. @dmarcos @ngokevin updated as per your requests.  anything else preventing merge? I believe a general issue remains w.r.t. gamepad access, where the user currently has to use one of them to press a button or something before the browsers will allow access via navigator.getGamepads -- similar to the enterVR issues -- not necessarily for aframe to fix, but it might be a good ideal to allow entering vr to also make the relevant controllers accessible.

In fact if you keep pressing the trigger the animation doesn't change at all.

the animations provided were: pointing, pistol, fist, thumb, touch.

when you press grip: 
pulling/pressing and touching the surface and trigger buttons are equivalent from a gesture standpoint
(although trigger touch is currently emulated from small analog values due to browser bugs),
which may explain what you are seeing;
if inactive surface buttons and trigger, you'll get pistol;
if active surface buttons but not trigger, you'll get pointing;
if inactive surface buttons but active trigger, you'll get thumb;
if active surface buttons and trigger, you'll get fist.

best I could manage with what was provided...
 @fernandojsg crossed comments...
>I just noticed that there're no events for just "touch" buttons as they do on oculus games

Actually there are touchstart/end events, did I forget to mention in docs?

> Is it because the gamepad api doesn't expose them yet?

no, but there is trigger and grip touch emulation (analog values too small to count as press/pull) due to current browser bugs
 looks like `vive-controls` didn't have any tests before, so will need to take a look at a different example... any suggestions? @fernandojsg @dmarcos @ngokevin may have found what looked like animation issue... changing emulated touch threshold helped, seems as though someone is smoothing values, so would take a while to get small enough... try now  **Description:** positive to encourage newcomers to write component and embrace the ECS pattern

**Changes proposed:**
- switched the recommended way (component) up and scene.hasLoaded down as specific-case only alternative.   (this fixes regression that broke https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/ for video playback) that is what I am doing manually, you may not be able to correctly create the video element from just src.  my understanding is that when a string is specified, it will not have a tagName attribute and so will not be passed as either a canvas or video element directly.  am i missing something? (for clarity, the existing a-frame examples work fine with this change, and so do MSE videos) I just came across this same issue - completely breaks [`aframe-video-billboard`](https://github.com/jesstelford/aframe-video-billboard) component (I opened a duplicate PR in #2141 before I saw this one).

> previously components always accepted a string

Which components are you referring to? I can only see this logic within the `material` component, and before #2054, the logic was the same as what @machenmusik has provided above (but in a different place).

> Ensure it has a src set.

What about [when it's `srcObject`](https://github.com/jesstelford/aframe-video-billboard/blob/d985dda5fef90a12662274494ad8dc8e6093ea73/src/component.js#L175)? The aframe code is simplified by skipping those extra checks and passing it on straight to three.js to let it handle the specifics of using a `<video>` element as a texture.

> If it is a URL, then maybe [...]

This PR is good to fix the regression - do you think the new functionality could be done as a future enhancement / a separate PR? (my personal use-case just needs the regression fixed on `master` - I'm using a fork with this PR applied in the meantime) @ngokevin I think the difference of opinion we have is your assertion that the previous behavior always returned string, which @jesstelford described above.  really what happened is #2054 broke video cases other than trivial examples, and we'd like to restore the original (working) behavior for video elements as part of 0.4.0 release while further steps are discussed. for those not aware, it is common video player practice to attach the player logic (event listeners etc.) to the provided video element, so creating a different video element with same src may not yield the same behaviors (i.e. may not play properly) - the same is true for many a-frame elements... > If it is a selector, just return the element. Ensure it has a src set.

i am not sure that it should be a-frame's place to attempt to validate all possible ways an element could be considered valid, that seems brittle and not easy to maintain going forward (e.g. @jesstelford srcObject rather than src).  if you agree with "if it is a selector, just return the element" then merging this PR will help ensure that prior use cases that expected and accepted said behavior will continue to work (not only canvas, but also video)  > If it is a selector, just return the element. Ensure it has a src set.
If it is a URL, then maybe we create a media element for them, setting the src, ensure crossorigin and playsinline. And we append it to <a-assets> so they have a reference to it if they want to control media playback.

I believe the video material handling already does 2; this PR provides 1 other than the src validation per prior comment.  in theory, we could compromise by adding check for either src or srcObject in the case of video, but really THREE.js is permissive and it seems better to just pass through the video element.  if you feel strongly that the check for src or srcObject is truly necessary to merge the pull request, please let me know ASAP. @ngokevin this also fixes #2126, and thanks to https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/systems/material.js#L123, it behaves as you describe, except for "Ensure it has a src set" - primarily due to cases such as @jesstelford where not having a src set is valid.  Rather than coming up with a different fix for #2126, can we work to get this merged?  At minimum, we would need to check for either src or srcObject as mentioned above, if you feel strongly that a-frame should take on the validation burden, but otherwise I think we are all good here... @ngokevin @dmarcos does this still need changes?  if so, only "check for either src or srcObject as mentioned above" or something else as well?

(because existing behavior for invalid video is to warn)
hopefully we are now OK to merge

(@dmarcos @ngokevin added warning if no src or srcObject, this one should be good to go now.) @dmarcos @ngokevin is there something holding up merge of this PR?

  **Description:**
support Oculus Touch in Chromium builds, along with Vive

**Changes proposed:**
- added rotationOffset in tracked-controls to allow adjustment of hand model rotation
- modify vive-controls to understand both Oculus Touch and OpenVR Gamepad, and pass rotationOffset
- modify hand-controls to pass per-hand rotationOffset through vive-controls to tracked-controls tested with Touch, kfarr confirmed I believe.  also tested with Vive wands. original intent was to make hand-controls just work.  but hand-controls is hardcoded to use vive-controls which uses tracked-controls.  maybe what is really needed is a generic modeled-tracked-controls or something, and then vive-controls and oculus-touch-controls could have their own models just like hand-controls.  but that seemed a larger refactor than needed to just get things working... especially assuming that many folks just want to use hand-controls to abstract left and right hand without having to know which kind... my thoughts were:

**tracked-controls** 
... stays as low-level tracking 
... suggest the filtering to OpenVR Gamepad be removed as previously mentioned
... should we consider calling this tracked-entities or similar, since they may not necessarily be controllers?
**modeled-tracked-controls**
... does most of what what vive-controls does now, but no model (or maybe generic model)
... button mapping, determination of which controllers to bind for specified hand
... maybe modeled-controllers would be a better name
**hand-controls**, **vive-controls**, **oculus-touch-controls**
... add specific models and gamepad id filtering (e.g. vive = OpenVR Gamepad, oculus-touch = Touch naming)
 perhaps not, but that makes `tracked-controls` fatter and may inflict upon it model-specific filtering and button mapping -- at the moment tracking is uniform regardless of controller vendor, but button/event mapping may not be... so in theory `modeled-controllers` could use `tracked-controls` generically for positioning, but then inject model-specific components for button/event mapping based on gamepad id pattern?
then again, I may be overthinking it... thoughts on https://github.com/chenzlabs/aframe/tree/refactor-hand-controls
(still WIP) ?

tracked-controls

modeled-controllers ... looks at available controllers and inject mapping
- vive-controls ... has mapping and model, matches specified hand and injects tracked-controls
- oculus-touch-controls ... has mapping and model, matches specified hand and injects tracked-controls

hand-controls ... uses modeled-controllers, which is agnostic

that way, oculus-touch-controls and vive-controls can implement events both common and unique, they select specific controllers to use according to their logic; pattern for others is clear; one can specifically request touch and/or vive as well, at the cost of some duplication between (which originally I was thinking of hoisting to modeled-controllers) @dmarcos I didn't want to bind that up with the hand model in hand-controls, thus the intermediate layer modeled-controllers.

https://github.com/chenzlabs/aframe/tree/refactor-hand-controls 
works for Touch on Chromium, any chance you can test on Vive?  happy to close this and do a pull request for that one if desired, although Touch needs diifferent models... ok you prefer a heavier tracked-controls, fine but I don't think having tracked-controls do modelSrc will suffice given that there are different types of models that could be used etc. (actually i am having similar discussion that video cannot be fully specified only looking at src) - in the refactor I was working on, that seems relatively close to what you describe except that you prefer the modeled-controllers functionality to be merged into tracked-controls; in the meantime I will close this pull request in favor of the refactor.  thanks! actually though, I disagree that authors should have to enumerate all the controller types they could possibly support, including ones that don't exist yet, the framework should handle that internally unless specified IMO... it should be possible for the author to simply say that want hand-controls left and right, and in the refactor, hand-controls does that by using modeled-controllers; the author is free to explicitly use vive-controls or oculus-controls independently. the alternative you suggest is basically the current refactor, with modeled-controllers basically meaning "platform please detect and inject for me" - so to add autodetect of daydream-controls, one would simply add to prefixMapping in modeled-controllers which would detect the controller via gamepad extensions id prefix

(i will submit the refactor as pull request soon so we can transition this discussion) (Further discussion appears in #2132.)  Latest version of aframe v0.3.2 uses tween.js v15.0 which is more than a year old.

It should be safe to update. I just released [version 16.4](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/releases) through Github, but it won't be on npm until @sole updates it.  **Description:**

@dmarcos 
Thanks!
 Are you sure that the phone is centered in the cardboard?
The original cardboard is (in)famous for not holding the phone correctly. That's why I don't use a cardboard-cardboard anymore, rather this one:
http://www.homido.com/en/shop/products/homido-mini
especially when I show it to clients.
  @dirkk0    Thanks for recommending this convenient device~!
However I have tried other websites like the demo:  [https://shopifyvr.myshopify.com/pages/virtual-reality](url)
It works fine on the cardboard.... 
I do not no what goes wrong then...... 
 @ngokevin  I am using HUAWEI Mate 8, and here is my device information, thanks!

 @ngokevin 
Thanks, looking forward to the fixed version! :) FWIW, I am experiencing a similar issue with a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. A-Frame scenes rendered in VR mode using the Chrome browser on the S7 have a "double vision" effect, but other cardboard apps work fine, and even the ShopifyVR link above is OK when using Chrome. I was having this issue on Pixel XL. The problem is that the dpdb within Googles webVR polyfill that a-frame uses doesn't have your devices settings. We have to wait till Google updates that database. 

In the mean time I fixed the issue I was having by doing the following:
- use a local version of the a-frame js
- in that js file find DPDB cache
- copy and paste a device entry in the cache
- change the ua to the user agent string for your device
- change the mdmh to your phones maker and device name
- change dpi to that of your device (this is the Actual DPI X and Y which is at the bottom of your second screen of device information)
- bw is bezel width, change this to the width of your devices bezel. Most phones are 3mm I believe.
- search in the a-frame js file for xhr.open('GET', ONLINE_DPDB_URL, true); then change true to false. This will stop the polyfill from asking for the online dpdb and will instead use the cache that you've edited.

This is what I added for the Pixel XL and it fixed the double vision issue I was having:

  {
  "type": "android",
        "rules": [{
            "mdmh": "Google/*/Pixel XL/*"
        }, {
            "ua": "Pixel XL"
        }],
        "dpi": [537.9, 533],
        "bw": 3,
        "ac": 1000
  },

The entry for your device might be this, I would check the user agent is correct for your device:

  {
  "type": "android",
        "rules": [{
            "mdmh": "Huawei/*/NXT-AL10/*"
        }, {
            "ua": "HUAWEINXT-AL10"
        }],
        "dpi": [365.76, 366.676],
        "bw": 3,
        "ac": 1000
  }, @garethwilliams Thank you for your suggestion, which worked perfectly for getting rid of double vision with my Galaxy S7.  Same problem on Moto G4, I followed the above but also had to add one other line change and I used `ua` (user agent) as my rule not `mdmh` which I'm not even sure what that is because I found this in the code:

```
Dpdb.prototype.matchRule_ = function(rule, ua, screenWidth, screenHeight) {
  // We can only match 'ua' and 'res' rules, not other types like 'mdmh'
  // (which are meant for native platforms).
```

I went for:

```
{
    "type": "android",
    "rules": [
      { "ua": "Moto G (4)" }
    ],
    "dpi": 401.0,
    "bw": 4,
    "ac": 1000
  }
```

I also found this line :

```
this.dpdb_ = new Dpdb(true, this.onDeviceParamsUpdated_.bind(this));
```

and changed `true` to `false` (preventing searching for the DPDB online.
 @ngokevin I'm trying to move this forward with the maintainers of the WebVR Polyfill repo:

In the meantime, I took a snapshot of the 0.4.0.min release and changed the DPDB URL to mine, so you can test it out by loading A-Frame from here:
https://rawgit.com/thoragio/vr-aframe-dist/master/040/aframe-v0.4.0.min.js

Everyone else following this issue, please try it and see if it fixes your stereo-rendering problem (it did for me on my S7). @thoragio looks the same way as the official release on iPhone 7+ @giordyb can you go to the link below and copy/paste the output from it on your 7+?
http://btco-code.appspot.com/debug/screen_test.html
 Here you go:

computed resolution: 2208 x 1242
screen.width: 414
screen.height: 736
screen.availWidth: 414
screen.availHeight: 736
window.devicePixelRatio: 3 @giordyb thanks. There is an entry for these screen dimension already in the DPDB cache:
`{"type":"ios","rules":[{"res":[1242,2208]}],"dpi":[453.6,458.4],"bw":4,"ac":1000}`

So it seems that the blur issue in [2008](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2008) is separate from the stereo-effect issue in this thread. @dmarcos As discussed in Slack, I've submitted the PR to update the DPDB URL to my cache: https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/pull/190  It would be great to add <a-star> component with embeded webgl shader as per can be found in http://stars.chromeexperiments.com/

@ngokevin maybe something like your https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/sun-sky/ without the sky : ) @ngokevin Thanks for sharing.

I would like to suggest some degree of implementation of form controls ou input controls for that matter.
I am aware that VR input is in its very early stages ( leapmotion ) but the framework could branch out a spec for that.

Regards something like this? https://fuleinist.github.io/aframe-vr-survey/
 @fuleinist yes. Something of the kind.
@dmarcos imagine a 360º CMS in which a user can view and input stuff.

For example from 0º to 90º ( approx ) we see a listing. From 90º to 180º we can input data in the form. From 180º to X we can edit another record or navigate to other page. We have only to shift our heads in the direction of what we want to do in the CMS.

BTW: This does not have anything to do with Aframe, but with speech recognition available in the browser we can also add some degree of control in this "vrCMS" xD
 Thumb up for VR CRM : )  It's probably achievable even with a Wordpress
Plugin,  just need someone to develop it.

  **Description:**

I think letting \<a-asset-item> support arraybuffer will be useful for components.
Actually \<a-mmd> I'm working on needs MMD assets data downloaded as arraybuffer.

https://github.com/takahirox/a-mmd

IMO, it's a good idea that \<a-asset-item> supports `responseType` (or just `type`?) attribute like this.

    <a-asset-item id="model" responseType="arraybuffer" src="model.pmd"></a-asset-item>

Adding `XHRLoader.setResponseType()` right before calling `XHRLoader.load()` can enable this feature.

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/96df6c1f22fdf72c392be710d945bb9e8684b05c/src/core/a-assets.js#L99-L113

    var self = this;
    var src = this.getAttribute('src');
    var responseType = this.getAttribute('responseType');
    if (!responseType) { responseType = 'text'; }
    fileLoader.setResponseType(responseType);
    fileLoader.load(src, function handleOnLoad (response) {
      THREE.Cache.files[src] = response;
      self.data = response;
      setTimeout(function load () { ANode.prototype.load.call(self); });
    }, ....
 I'll make a PR if this update sounds good to you guys.
 I plan to write document to describe which attribute should be downloaded
as arraybuffer for my component.

If two components attempt to download the same assets as different type,
the type will be the first attempted response type because of THREE.Cache
(if THREE.Cache is enable. It should be enabled for pre-downloading).

But I don't think it won't be a problem in general
because there may be no case that an asset is needed as two or more different types.

If we wanna avoid this conflict issue,
it may be one of the ways to keep the cache with url + response type key.

  Hi, I added Matrix4 property type #2069
Would you review the code because I'm still new to A-Frame.
LMK if there's any issues.

**Description:**

Add 'matrix4' property type.

Default value is
[1, 0, 0, 0,
 0, 1, 0, 0,
 0, 0, 1, 0,
 0, 0, 0, 1]

Input value is assumed as space separated strings.
ex: '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15'

If elements# is greater than 16, it'll be forced to be 16.
If elements# is less than 16, the shortage will be filled with default value.

**Changes proposed:**

 I prefer row-major format as user input because easier to read for A-Frame users.
They can easily edit in their HTML.

 I've updated.

- export as `utils/matrices.js` like `utils/coordinates.js`
- add `Matrix3`
- type names are `mat3/mat4` like `vec2/vec3/vec4`
- End user sees matrix as row-major format while it's handled as column-major in A-Frame/Three.js
- parse(): row-major space separated string input and column-major array output
- stringify(): column-major array input and row-major space separated string output

I want to discuss
- what type/format of parse() and stringify() input/output/defaultValue should be
  **Description:**
Fixed a typo in example code

**Changes proposed:**
- removed a `</a-mixin>` that shouldn't be there  **Description:**

 isn't this due to stock Chromium lack of support for H264 / MP4?
 Thanks guys! When the stable Chrome (not Chromium) has WebVR abilities, will I be able to play this codec?
 yes - and supposedly there is some tricky way you can roll your own custom chromium build for testing that enables them
 Can you please link me to wherever you heard that?

 see https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2132  As the title says, video playback on mono 360 video on both safari/chrome is laggy/slow when in VR mode. Plays back fine on all other devices and in non VR mode on both browsers (ios safari, ios chrome). 

I saw that in the previous versions the poor quality vr mode on ios was due to an issue in safari with resize. The quality in this versions (.3.2) vr mode on ios is much better. Only issue I've noticed so far is VR mode video playback.

 Creating a simplified version of my site showed me that its not 0.3.2 but something in the rest of my site (1 video sphere, 5 image spheres, and 26 2D videos that can be triggered to play on planes within the 3D scene). Playback of just my video sphere in 0.3.2 is smooth. 

Something must have changed. Going to chase that down and will followup. 
  **Description:**
- Added FAQ per open issue request
- Fixed a typo in a code example
- Adjusted the a-ocean component property from "height" to "depth" since "height" does not have any effect (only width and depth affect the X & Z axes; Y axis is not adjustable by the component).
  Would be good to keep it coherent with existing stats component i.e. make the in VR mode display the situation (FPS at least) cf https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/scene/stats.js#L29 rather than just hiding it.
 see #2162   This seems pretty reasonable. In the way we use Unity, we simply have "components", and "components that happen to be singletons and are accessed in a static way". Coming from this mindset, it seems more important that there is an easy way to access system instances, rather than some sort of automatic registration or association. 

This could look pretty close to your normal component + flag suggestion where we: 

1) Remove the existing system implementation
2) Adding a  `system: true` flag

Where the flag:

1) Enforces that the component can only go on the scene (effectively enforcing a singleton)
2) Automatically puts the instance of this component on `AFRAME.systems` when it is instantiated (instead of the definition)

Auto-instantiation seems like it might be tricky. I feel like it would be better to let users decide when they have a system on their scene (and this allows for non-optional configuration). 
 what @GavanWilhite said plus a "requires: [component, component]" property on components. This will make sure that singletons are created on scene as needed. 

Mind though that systems currently serve not only as singletons but also provide some execution order. At the very least they would have to be separated from common components and run on a different step, as is currently.
 @ngokevin yeah but if foo and baz have ticks() on them it is not guaranteed that the foo-system's tick() will run after the child components, as is the case right now with systems
  Addition of the Matrix4 property type for creation of Matrix4 objects to assist in the creation of quaternions.   not standard as suggested in the docs

  https://aframe.io/docs/master/core/asset-management-system.html#events

I understand that A-Frame nodes can emit a 'loaded' event, so that makes sense for `<a-asset-item>`, but then the documentation says "Images are a standard DOM element so we can listen to the standard DOM events." and then refers to a same-named 'loaded' event. I'm unaware of any standard DOM event 'loaded', only 'load'. Are the HTML <img> elements in <a-assets> augmented with a special A-Frame 'loaded' event which we should use, or should we stick with standard DOM event 'load'?

If the former, then the language should be changed from "Images are a standard DOM element so we can listen to the standard DOM events." to something like "A-Frame extends standard DOM elements, so we can listen to the 'loaded' event that nodes in A-Frame emit when they have finished loading.

If the latter, then the event name [here](https://aframe.io/docs/master/core/asset-management-system.html#lt-img-gt) should be changed to 'load'.

This is my first GitHub issue, please let me know of any mistakes.

  A-frame API is quite explicit rather than implicit so I would make it an attribute of `<a-sky>` primitive. But given the `<a-sky>` primitive is just a sphere I don't know if something like this can be expressed by the primitive API. Does it make sense, @ngokevin?  **Description:**

Just fixes a markdown typo around the link to the minified K-Frame source.

 The link is currently broken on the [live page](https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/guides/building-with-components.html#using-third-party-components). The `k-frame.min.js` link in the **Using Third-Party Components** section points to `https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/guides/kmin`, which is a 404. The current/broken markdown is `[k-frame.min.js](kmin)`. `kmin`, not being a fully qualified URL, is being treated as a relative link from the current page.

The majority of the links on that page are using variable substitution in the form of `[displayed text][variable for href]`. If you look at the other links in that same section (and really the whole file), they are in this format. The variables are defined at the bottom of [the markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aframevr/aframe/master/docs/guides/building-with-components.md).

 Thanks for your response!

I recreated the A-Frame example to play around with setting window.scrollTop to 0.
It didn't work out for me.. Ended up with this piece of code (demo: http://vr.kevindh.nl):

```
<html>
<head>
  <title>A-frame example</title>
  <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.3.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
  <a-scene>
    <a-sky src="R0010471.JPG" rotation="0 -130 0"></a-sky>
  </a-scene>

  <script type="text/javascript">
  var scene = document.querySelector('a-scene');
  scene.addEventListener('enter-vr', (event) => {
    window.scrollTop = 0;
  });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Still showing the navigation bar in VR mode like this:

I'm writing a A-Frame DOM->JSON scene save/loader.

OBJ-Models that have property "obj: url(assets/asset.obj)" (and mtls) get their sources trimmed. When iterating through the elements, you get something like this:

    Object {mtl: "assets/asset.mtl", obj: "assets/asset.obj"}

When loading this back as an element by doing:
    element.setAttribute( propertyName, propertyObject );

A-frame will throw an error:

    aframe.js:62939 Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'querySelector' on 'Document': 'assets/BlackCW_Rand_LOD0.mtl' is not a valid selector.

This is because 

1. The url('') part is stripped and

2. This function

    function assetParse (value) {
      var parsedUrl = value.match(/\url\((.+)\)/);
    ...

is too lax with matching url() and when that fails it looks for an element id immediately. 

What I think A-Frame should do is match the url('') part, then if that fails, match the hashtag ('#') part for an existing element, then finally if all else fails, simply load the argument as the url.

Either that, or provide the original, unmodified string with the url('') in-tact.

Can't.
The device used is VR Ready setup from Mozilla Berlin office. With Chromium downloaded and configured on 27th October.  Its appear that `init()` is getting called with `this.data` not populated when it is early-instantiated via the dependency logic.

`this.data.foo` will be undefined in `init()` for this entity `<a-entity component-that-is-depended-on="foo: bar" component-with-dependency></a-entity>`

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-entity.js#L358

My guess is that the solution may end up involve retrieving the `attrValue` if `isDependency` is `true` before calling this:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-entity.js#L331 Investigating..
 So here is a example for the issue: http://codepen.io/team/altspacevr/pen/395fe11ce0019dba71d64ba6ccc39507/?editors=1000

Trying to play with your test to tell. The reverse order from what you have there is the issue I am pointing at. I tried flipping the order of your calls, but that doesn't affect the test. My guess is that it may have something to do with how the HTML is parsed vs JS setAttribute calls. 
  In Three.js, "renderer.getMaxAnisotropy()" makes it easy to set anisotropy to the max supported value. I wasn't sure how to do this in A-Frame and often set it to 16 (the value for my GPU). Something like `anisotropy: max;` or `anisotropy: auto;` would be nice.

[Anisotropy example (16x vs default)](https://bl.ocks.org/bryik/a82893253ea55f401af114778bc5453b).

**edit:** come to think of it, maybe 16 is the standard max? I'm not sure how much this actually varies in modern GPUs

good news 😃 when I `<ctrl> + <alt> + s` while in VR mode, aframe produced an image file for me and saved it in my windows downloads folder.

bad news 😅 it doesn't look like it's an image of my scene.  just all black (Windows preview)or all white (in Chrome) depending on how I open it

  **Description:**
ISSUE:
 I’ve tried to utilize a combination of assets on my scene which has lead me down the path of buffering and optimization in order to achieve a relatively smooth experience.

Specifically, I’ve tried to attach a 300mb .mp4 to a <a-videosphere/>, and even though the rest of the assets don’t present much of an issue, the video will freeze and hit download bumps every so often.

The conclusion: download all assets before starting the scene.

assets.js checks that all mediaElements have a combination of autoplay and preload=“auto” before buffering, but also, there is no way of monitoring the progress of the download of ALL assets (img, a-asset-item, mediaElements).

**Changes proposed:**
The goal is to have a progress bar that feeds from easily-accessible data.

I decided to make a global object that holds individual loaded/total combinations per asset and triggers a function that adds up all these values to estimate a percentage of progress.

To the current structure of assets.js, I added a few lines that do the following:
- I created the global object assetsElement
- within createdCallback in registerElement(‘a-assets’) I added this.loadedData = 0; which makes progress updates easily accessible
- I add any xhr items to assetsElement
- created a new callback to the xhrLoaded which updates values to assetsElement object for any <a-asset-item>
- I removed the validation for the existence of autoplay in mediaElementLoaded(el), instead, it only checks if preload==‘none’
- in function checkProgress() I add new mediaElements to assetsElement object
-  in checkProgress(), after running through the buffer cycle,  assetsElement loaded value is updated for each mediaElement key
- Both in the xhrLoaded and the mediaElementLoaded the function assetsProgress() is used to add up all the loaded and total values of assetsElement, it returns a percentage which is used to update loadedData in the parentNode (<a-assets>).
- Finally, both the xhrLoaded and mediaElementLoaded emit(‘progress’) to the parentNode (<a-assets>)

USAGE:
- preload=“auto” for any media elements (img, video) will add it to the percentage tally. xhr's are added by default.
- the value of loadedData can be grabbed as follow:
  var loadingAssets = document.querySelector('a-assets');
  loadingAssets.addEventListener("progress",function(evt){
  if(this.hasLoaded){
      console.log(this.loadedData)
  }
  });

PROBLEMS:
- The only way to buffer audio files is by adding autoplay, which starts playing all the audio files at once from the beginning.  For now, I’ve left all audios with preload=“none” and no autoplay
- image file sizes should be accessible as well, just to be consistent.
 @ngokevin is there anything I need to do here?
 When I first removed the autoplay + preload combination I started getting an error related to asset items that didnt have a preload, which is why im treating no-preload tag the same as a "none".  Ideally all media should have a preaload value, but audios are tricky since they don't begin preloading unless autoplay is included, and if autoplay is added then they all start playing while the download is happening.
 That would be great.  I managed to get this working, but after it was
approved on GitHub Kevin dug a bit further and bumped into the same issues
I had found during my work: I can't get a percentage read on
HTMLMediaElements.

This forced me to group these loads in everything XHR and everything that
was media.  The goal of this was to be able to Cache media and minimize
future loads, but that's not happening.

Have you taken a look at the code?  I haven't touched on this for a while
(I jumped on mastering VR in after effects, learning Unity and learning
React)... but it'd be nice to get back on aframe.io

I have a huge interest in getting video to work right on WebVR, and this is
definitely and stepping stone in that direction.

Just to clarify something. Is calling git pull on the upsteam/master to my
local master effectively the same as a rebase of my local master branch
with the upsteam/master branch because of fast-forward merging? Thanks

  **Description:**

Hi, I'm new to A-Frame.

I think this line

https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe/blob/5af7916d8460d7f5ecc61fcdcbc9bf6d3afb6f0e/src/core/a-assets.js#L86

```
var src = src = this.getAttribute('src');
```

should be

```
var src = this.getAttribute('src');
```

correct?

If I'm right, I'll make PR to fix.
 I see, I'll make PR, thanks!
  Questions regarding workflow
Is the following is what you have in mind?

- When one clicks on the context the visual inspector script will be injected into the aframe scene
- It then invokes the visual inspector in the editing mode
  I wanted to throw in a suggestion for this alternative:

```
  AFRAME.registerComponent('component', function( context ){
    //  context = this in the old use-case
    //  anything in this closure is "private" unless returned
    const path = context.data.path;        

    context.el.addEventListener( 'model-loaded', function( result ){
      //  no "this" confusion
    });

    function tick( dt ){
      //  define a tick, with access to everything private
    }

    function reset(){
      //  even custom functionality
    }

    //  return anything required for components
    return {
      schema: {
        type: 'string'
      }          
      tick,                    
      reset,
    }
  });
```
- The function passed in IS the init function. It returns the object normally required by components.
- Allows for private state to be shared between utility functions (update, init, tick).
- Avoids "this" entirely
- Can be implemented as a parallel path if need be: AFRAME.registerComponentFn( ... )
- Or AFRAME.registerComponent can check if the second arg is a function, run that function and use it as its init object, extending existing code.

One last tiny bonus: init function can be passed important things like this, el, renderer, etc so component writers don't need to guess how to deference things like renderer (this.el.sceneEl.renderer...). The init function can pass that ( `function( context, scene, renderer )` ).
 Yup :) This is what I proposed, registerComponentFn or have registerComponent check if the second argument is a function, or I just create a thirdparty thing and use it myself. 

Anyway, I'm happy to articulate the issue and why I think this is an improvement. I first learned of writing JS without using this from Douglas Crockford in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSGEjv3Tqo0&t=6m) (timestamped link).

I'll be the first to admit it's "opinionated". But hey, what interesting person have you ever met that doesn't have an opinion?

# Issue 1: Callbacks and "this"

Here's a typical a-frame component:

```
  AFRAME.registerComponent('component', {        
    schema: {
      type: 'string'
    },
    init: function(){
    }
  });
```

Any time I want to get "data", I have to access "this". Say, then, I need to write callbacks and then use "data":

```
      this.el.addEventListener( 'model-loaded', function( event ){
        event.detail.model.material.color.setHex( this.data );
      });
```

Oops. "this" refers to the function callback. This is one of the most common pitfalls for beginners in JS. So instead, I may try to do the ES6 arrow function (or fall back to "bind" in older browsers):

```
      this.el.addEventListener( 'model-loaded', ( event )=>{
        event.detail.model.material.color.setHex( this.data );
      });
```

A common strategy is to defer "this" into "that"?

```
    const that = this;
    this.el.addEventListener( 'model-loaded', function( event ){
      event.detail.model.material.color.setHex( that.data );
    });
```

That's a bit confusing to read since you have to have two separate "this" to keep track of in your head. Instead, let's simply deference what we need:

```
      const data = this.data;
      this.el.addEventListener( 'model-loaded', function( event ){
        event.detail.model.material.color.setHex( data );
      });
```

But why do this deferencing? Couldn't a function just have passed me this data?

```
    function( data ){
      this.el.addEventListener( 'model-loaded', function( event ){
        event.detail.model.material.color.setHex( data );
      });
    }
```

In fact, let's go a step further:

```
    function( el, data ){
      el.addEventListener( 'model-loaded', function( event ){
        event.detail.model.material.color.setHex( data );
      });
    }
```

Boom. This is totally gone. Was there ever a need for "this" to begin with? Other than attaching everything in it as a bundle? Instead, if we're fancy with ES6 [destructuring](https://simonsmith.io/destructuring-objects-as-function-parameters-in-es6/):

```
    function( { el, data } ){          
      el.addEventListener( 'model-loaded', function( event ){
        event.detail.model.material.color.setHex( data );
      });
    }        
```

That's a single object (what used to be "this") passed into the argument parameter (context) and now we have both el and data, free from deferencing.

# Issue 2: Sharing State

Back to our initial example, we're adding a tick function to our component:

```
  AFRAME.registerComponent('component', {
    schema: {
      type: 'string'
    },
    init: function(){
    }
    tick: function(){
    }
  });
```

Our component needs an animation mixer:

```
    init: function(){
      const mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer();
      //  set it up
    }      
```

Tick needs to access it, but has no way of doing so. We've been forced to attach it to the only shared space, "this":

```
    init: function(){
      this.mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer();
      //  set it up
    }

    tick: function( dt ){
      this.mixer.update( dt );
    }
```

In a closure, this is very easy to understand:

```
    function init(){
      const mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer();
      function tick( dt ){
        mixer.update( dt );
      }
      return {
        tick
      };
    }
```

This has the added bonus of hiding the mixer (private, in the closure) until users of this component absolutely has to have it. If it turns out we need to expose it, we can do this:

```
    function init(){
      const mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer();
      function tick( dt ){
        mixer.update( dt );
      }
      return {
        tick,
        mixer
      };
    }        
```

Anyway, I don't really have a dog in this race. This is just my 2cents, and how I write code, and yes it's my opinion that it's far superior to using this unless it's for performance reasons.
 So I went ahead and tried it myself to see if it was feasible. It, kind of is?

Here's my fork: https://github.com/mflux/aframe
Not sure how you're supposed to try forks. I'll leave that up to you.

There's an example that uses this:
https://github.com/mflux/aframe/tree/master/examples/boilerplate/hello-world-componentfn

My modified registerComponentFn function:

```
module.exports.registerComponentFn = function (name, fn) {
  var NewComponent;
  var proto = {};

  const definition = fn();

  if (name.indexOf('__') !== -1) {
    throw new Error('The component name `' + name + '` is not allowed. ' +
                    'The sequence __ (double underscore) is reserved to specify an id' +
                    ' for multiple components of the same type');
  }

  // Format definition object to prototype object.
  Object.keys(definition).forEach(function (key) {
    proto[key] = {
      value: definition[key],
      writable: true
    };
  });

  if (components[name]) {
    throw new Error('The component `' + name + '` has been already registered. ' +
                    'Check that you are not loading two versions of the same component ' +
                    'or two different components of the same name.');
  }
  NewComponent = function (el, attr, id) {
    Component.call(this, el, attr, id);
    const methods = this.setup({
      context: this,
      el,
      attr,
      id,
      sceneEl: el.sceneEl,
      scene: el.sceneEl.object3D,
      object3D: el.object3D,
      data: buildData(el, this.name, this.schema, attr)
    });

    for (let key in methods) {
      this[ key ] = methods[ key ];
    }

    if (!el.hasLoaded) { return; }
    this.updateProperties(this.attrValue);
  };

  NewComponent.prototype = Object.create(Component.prototype, proto);
  NewComponent.prototype.name = name;
  NewComponent.prototype.constructor = NewComponent;
  NewComponent.prototype.system = systems && systems.systems[name];
  NewComponent.prototype.play = wrapPlay(NewComponent.prototype.play);
  NewComponent.prototype.pause = wrapPause(NewComponent.prototype.pause);

  components[name] = {
    Component: NewComponent,
    dependencies: NewComponent.prototype.dependencies,
    multiple: NewComponent.prototype.multiple,
    parse: NewComponent.prototype.parse,
    parseAttrValueForCache: NewComponent.prototype.parseAttrValueForCache,
    schema: utils.extend(processSchema(NewComponent.prototype.schema)),
    stringify: NewComponent.prototype.stringify,
    type: NewComponent.prototype.type
  };
  return NewComponent;
};
```

Some notes:
- This only works because I had access to Component.prototype. Since it's not exposed anywhere normally on AFrame's namespace, I couldn't write a stand-alone version. If AFrame exposed Component.prototype, I could write a version that's used by third-parties without any other modification to AFrame.
- The function that's passed into AFRAME.registerComponentFn can't actually be the init function because at this stage we're still registering the component. To get around this, I created a "setup" function that gets returned (along with schema). It's not perfect but it works.
- Setup is called on the NewComponent's constructor. Setup returns an init, tick, and anything else and over-writes the prototypes defaults. This is not as fast as calling prototypes, as benchmarks will tell you, but it's good enough for me.
- I couldn't figure out how to initialize buildData for multi-variable schemas. It just doesn't work until I hit updateProperties (but that calls init() so I can't do that before my setup()).

Here's example component:

```
AFRAME.registerComponentFn('test-component', function(){

  function setup( {context, el, attr, id, scene, object3D, data } ){

    console.log( el );
    console.log( object3D );
    console.log( scene );
    console.log( data );

    const mesh = el.getObject3D( 'mesh' );

    const clock = new THREE.Clock();
    const speed = data;

    function init(){

    }

    function tick( dt ){
      mesh.material.color.r = Math.abs( Math.sin( clock.getElapsedTime() * speed ) );
    }

    return {
      init,
      tick
    };
  }

  return {
    setup,
    schema: {
      type: 'float'
    }
  }
});
```

Notes:
-  I really like writing components this way what can I say...  AFrame can be configured to return a bunch of commonly used things to setup() and I just extract them in setup's function argument. 
- Anything declared inside setup() is global only to the component itself and accessible by tick, play, pause, update, etc. 
- Anything declared in the function passed into registerComponentFn is also global to all components of this type, which is really cool because you can have "systems" that handle load order, or batch meshes together of the same component type. You can have one OBJLoader for all obj-models here. You can also define constants for all same-type components.

My conclusions from this exercise:
- I haven't ran benchmarks but I'm willing to bet this will have a performance cost. This might be a deal-breaker for some people.
- IMO it's much more flexible and cleaner than "this" mess. It's functional, and uses language features better.
- A stand-alone version of this is impossible to write without small changes to AFrame (Component.prototype needs to be exposed... probably).

.
 I'm experiencing what I think is the same issue on both Android (Moto X 2014) and iOS (iPhone 6). Cardboard view is very pixellated. Here's a screenshot from the Android: 
![pixelratio1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1204802/20431386/fe90c2ec-ad99-11e6-948a-1c48fcc65fca.png)

As a hack, I tried to change the pixel density from `renderer.setPixelRatio( 1 );` to `renderer.setPixelRatio( 3 );` in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/vendor/VREffect.js#L128. This drastically improves the visuals:

![pixelratio3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1204802/20431433/3988e1b8-ad9a-11e6-96fa-4c381f25ebdb.png)

however performance takes a huge hit, and cardboard view is very stuttery.

You'd presume this is natural since the first one has a `canvas` of 640x360 and the second one has a full HD 1920x1080 `canvas`. However [this photosphere aframe example](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/sky/) also runs at a buttery smooth full 1080p `canvas`, I remote debugged to verify and here's the markup output: 

```
<canvas class="a-canvas a-grab-cursor fullscreen" data-aframe-canvas="true" width="1920" height="1080" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0 10px 10px 0;"></canvas>
```

I also compared with the latest 0.4.0 version running locally at http://192.168.1.35:9000/examples/boilerplate/panorama/ and there appears to be a noticable performance decrease compared to the https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/sky/ version. 

Any tricks, workarounds, ideas as to what I might be doing wrong? Thanks aframe wizards!
 I'm having the same issue on an iPhone 7plus with iOS 10.2 I'm pretty interested in helping with this. Would love iOS support to be fixed for all the projects I'm currently working on – nearly 50% of our customers' use cases require an iOS device + cardboard.

What can I do to help push this along? @ngokevin Is this confirmed to be a WebVR polyfill bug?  Sounds as though there are multiple popular models not accommodated;
perhaps we can accumulate affected models not present in
https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/blob/master/src/dpdb/dpdb-cache.js
(and ideally correct values to be used as well)
? e.g.
https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate/issues/146

https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/issues/164
Galaxy S7 family is missing too

https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/issues/129 Ah. I'm experiencing it on an iPhone 6. Didn't realize that it would be so device specific. I'll take a closer look. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction @machenmusik! There appear to be two avenues to fix
(1) fork webvr-polyfill, modify cache values (or the generated js) and use them
(2) get them to update the DPDB values online and in cache I created a PR with some device settings I found in various GH issue threads:
https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/pull/183

@ngokevin shall we wait a couple of days to see if they implement this, or do you want me to create a new npm package? If the latter, what should I call it (aframe-webvr-polyfill)?

If I go the new package route, what should I do about the `ONLINE_DPDB_URL` URL?
https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ONLINE_DPDB_URL
My preference would be to just disable it and then keep the package up-to-date with any new devices as they are reported. I am wondering if this issue and [2117](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2117) are related or not. I don't know the xdpi and ydpi values for the iPhone 6 or 7+, but the Android phone above (HTC 10) is not in the DPDB cache. So it is not clear if updating the DPDB cache will solve this issue as well, or only the stereo rendering issue in 2117. @ngokevin Yeah, iPhone 6 is affected. It's fine using Aframe v0.3.2 but not in 0.4. @ngokevin @ryanbetts See my recent post in issue [2117](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2117#issuecomment-271859295). It seems that issue and this one are not related.

v0.3.2 was using v0.9.15 of the webvr-polyfill, while 0.4.0 is using 0.9.23 or higher. I checked the repo and quite a few changes were made since 0.9.15. Unfortunately my knowledge of the WebVR internals is not good enough to try and figure out which of those changes started causing the issue. However, given that Kevin first posted this issue on 26 October, I presume the modification happened [around or after v0.9.21](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/commits/master?after=Y3Vyc29yOsgoZn5T6%2B5isKMAu9z1ZdOtiII8KzM0) which was released on 8 October and before 0.9.22 on 31 October. Curiously there were versions 0.9.3 and 0.9.4 released in between those two, and then they picked up the old number sequence again.

The largest chunk of changes (486 additions) was [this commit](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/commit/a6071733261a8bd3ffc7b24239e589bd7646b50d) that lead to the 0.9.3 release on 11 October. I can confirm that on iOS 10.2 with iPhone 7+ reverting back to aframe 0.3.2 fixes the issue. @ngokevin wrote on 4 Jan:
> Thanks! Yeah, we can give it a couple of days.

Well, they merged my [PR](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/pull/183), but it has not been released into a new distribution (remaining at 0.9.25 in NPM). Also, still no reply from the WebVR guys to my offer maintain the DPDB list: https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/issues/184

Does it make sense to take the drastic step to fork the WebVR polyfill repo and revert back to version 0.9.15 (same version 0.3.2 uses) to fix the issue here, and also deal with the Stereo effect issue ([2117](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2117#issuecomment-271859295)) at the same time? Forking like this kind of sucks, but less-than-ideal A-Frame experiences in cardboard on the latest and greatest mobile phones is starting to get old.
 @thoragio 
I've tried to use a custom aframe v0.4.0 with webvr-polyfill v0.9.15, but unfortunately all I get is a white screen when entering VR. The same app works with 0.3.2 though. @nullcode I ran into the exact same problem. I'm glad to hear the problem is reproducible; I thought I was going crazy.

My assumption is that there is an issue with the dependencies. I think when the 0.3.2 distribution was compiled, the dependency versions for webvr-polyfill were different than what are currently being pulled through now when we compile our custom 0.4.0 builds. @thoragio have you found any working combination? I tried webvr-polyfill 0.9.16, master, v1.0.0 (from github tag). The last two does not split the screen in VR mode, very weird. @nullcode no, not yet. I haven't had much time to work on it. What I was planning to try next was to build 0.9.15 with the older versions of its dependencies. IIRC, there were only 2 or 3 and they had not seen too many changes since the release of 0.9.15 so mix-and-matching them to get the original combination will probably not take too many iterations.

I don't want to try building anything after 0.9.15 because I have no idea where the blurry-vision bug was introduced. I am experiencing same blurry/low res textures when browsing page on my Samsung Gear VR in Samsung Browser (webvr-enabled). Did try multiple aframe versions without any luck.
Desktop/Cardboard look nice and sharp. I am using draw component with text-wrap for displaying text. The text is so blurry its unreadable.  I noticed that aframe 2.0.0 displays my images sharp on iphone/android while 3.2.0/4.0.0 display fine on android but very blurry on iphone (safari/chrome). I figured this out guys, it was actually a bug in aframe, not webvr-polyfill, check #2352  Link above doesn't do the job for me in Chrome on HTC 10 with Android 7.

Maybe I'm just expecting too much though :) I was hopeful for a moment (to see some kind of improvement), but adding the antialias-attribute like `<a-scene antialias="true">` didn't change a thing actually. Oh okay, that makes sense! No problem, thanks for the effort! Same on Samsung S8 on Gear VR using Samsung Internet browser inside the headset.. Very blurry images and text its unusable.. BUT using the cardboard or without a headset in VR mode is crystal clear. ....  I've just noticed the same issue on S8 + GearVR especially when importing models. Adding antialiasing to the scene `<a-scene antialias="true">` actually helped quite a lot.  typo: Raycasters ignore invisible materials
  Hello, I'm new to contributing to open source software. How can I help with this and who do I contact?
 Found the Contributing guidelines right after I posted that. My bad and thanks!
  The sound in a 360 degree video is not tracked. If you make a video with the Gear 360 and play it in the Gear VR the Oculus software is tracking the sound when you move your head. Is this possible with Aframe?
 So, demux video and sound and position both in the same direction with Aframe? I guess it would work if both are in sync when the video and sound start playing. I will experiment with it, thanks.

I wonder if the Gear 360 records binaural sound.
 No they were not taken with professional rigs .When you take a video with the Gear 360 it has sound tracking in the Gear VR (I have both). However the video's don't have sound tracking on youtube, for instance. I did see a video once taken with the LG 360 cam that had sound tracking on youtube.

But I think you're right in saying that they don't have binaural recording capacities.
  @ngokevin Thanks for logging this. I remember how long it took for me to figure out that was the cause initially. It should save people some time.

  Caveat: I'm new to A-Frame and don't understand all the implications of why this design decision was made. But I'm approaching it trying to incorporate A-Frame into an existing Webpack application where we're trying to avoid adding `window.stuff` and instead keep everything scoped inside the modules that use them.

The `window.AFRAME` global runs counter to that pattern.

I know it's possible to `import AFRAME from 'aframe'` in an individual module, so that we don't have to introduce a new global to our `.eslintrc`. But that doesn't prevent `AFRAME` from being exposed as a global at all, and opens us up to all the possible bugs and issues that come with that.

The problem with changing this, from what I understand, is that the ecosystem depends on `AFRAME` existing as a global; i.e., third-party components don't need to be ES6 or CommonJS modules that `import AFRAME from 'aframe'` or `var AFRAME = require('aframe')` — they just work. And that's necessary for making third-party components available in environments that don't use NPM or a module system, and everything needs to be imported with `<script>` tags.

I'm coming from the React world where third party components are pretty much all released as NPM modules, but I know that a lot of them also release versions that are backwards-compatible with `<script>` tagging.

Anyway, the last thing I want to be is the ES6 hipster bursting into this community and demanding we all do things differently around here, but I'm interested in knowing what people's thoughts are on this issue. I can see how it'd be a breaking change to make A-Frame conform to the hip new module patterns, but in codebases that use things, attaching a global can be a pretty big concern.
 Yeah, I guess the debate about whether _some_ things can be globals, or if _nothing_ can be a global, is philosophical in a Webpack 1.x context. What I'm concerned about is that A-Frame in its current form won't allow me to tree-shake.

Obviously to take full advantage of that I'd need to be able to `import { registerComponent } from 'aframe'` which is a bigger issue, but I think with an async bundle loader I can still defer loading the whole A-Frame library until after the page with A-Frame calls gets loaded.

Or maybe it'd just wait to attach it to the global until after, and then it'd be fine if it's still hanging around if the user clicks away from that part of the app. But it's still not something I have to worry about with most other large frameworks in the NPM ecosystem that aren't attaching themselves to the window.

Maybe it's not an urgent change; aside from some early tree-shaking build systems I can't off the top of my head come up with a killer app for switching over entirely to the module pattern. As those mature, though, I think it could be more of a pressing issue.
  Is Aframe compatible with the PS4? The PS4 UX seems to be based on webgl for the most part from what I read but I can not load sky spheres with equirectangular photo's in the web browser. The web browser is based on webkit. The vr symbol appears in the lower right by the way.

It would be nice to get this to work because of the PSVR headset release.

Version I tested was 0.2.0.
 [This guy](http://blog.greggant.com/posts/2016/04/07/exploring-and-developing-for-the-ps4-browser.html) says the PS4's browser does not support WebGL (blog post from April 7th, 2016).

FWIW, PsVita definitely doesn't work (tried it myself a few days ago).
 The PS4 actually scores the highest among consoles in WebGL speed, yet Sony appears to be blocking WebGL content purely out of some morbid fear that PS4 users might play HTML5-games with Xbox users.

Im trying to raycast from mouse location opposed to the center of camera. Is there a way to implement this currently? Ive moved my cursor to the mouse location and can "click" when I align the mouse and center of camera over my object. 

I found this component, but it is for pre raycaster functionality.

Im going to keep pushing on it and working on my own component, but wanted to ask if anyone has had any success.

 simply the current direction the user is facing.The position attribute on a-entity is static in html.So if I use document.getSelectorAll(“position”) wasn't the user currently facing position.
 I know what's wrong with my code.I didn't get the camera's rotation, but get the static content inside the camera,so it would always be static null.
  I cannot get the "end" attribute in a-animation to stop the animation...

Currently i have the following Pen demonstrating the behaviour:
http://codepen.io/msj121/pen/obmvrE?editors=1111

The current code is as follows:

```
<a-cube position="-1 0.5 1" rotation="0 45 0" width="1" height="1" depth="1" color="#4CC3D9">
    <a-animation begin="mouseenter" end="mouseleave" attribute="rotation" repeat="10" easing="linear" dur="1000" direction="alternate" from="0 0 0" to="45 45 45"></a-animation>
</a-cube>
```

It does not work even if manually emitting the events as shown on codepen.
 Calling: stop() on the animation itself does indeed work, though it jumps to the end animation instead of stopping in the middle or finishing the animation. That can look very glitchy, but that is an enhancement.
 Calling a-animation.data, doesn't show an "end" value. even on the a-animation above which does have an "end" value

I am using A-Frame with Angular 2.
http://plnkr.co/edit/NQhc7aQ9WmTmNEZFkHpA?p=preview

All images on page 1, 2 and 3 are supposed to be at the center of the screen.

When you drag the image on page 1, and then go to page 2. The location of image on page 2 will be affected (not in the center of the screen),  which is wrong.

Then when you go back page 3, the image is at the center of the screen which is correct.

So the issue is that `<a-scene>` will affect and only affect next page's `<a-scene>` position.
 Let me do a small test without Angular 2

Hello, 
Thanks for the fantastic product for VR/360!

I would like to show 2 A-Frames as a slideshow by using Slick Slider.
But nothing showed, and I removed Slick Slider, leaving just 2 basic sets of A-Frames with "embedded" attribute. The situation remained the same. 

Do A-Frame restrict only 1 in a page?
(For just 1, it works well!)

Thank you!

  I saw the demos are all using images to show text. It will be great to have something like text box.
 Thanks, that is very helpful!
 @ngokevin Thanks! Those are very helpful suggestions. It will be great to add these in the the A-Frame document.

Feel free to close this if need.
 Apparently, [ReactVR will use SDF font text](https://youtu.be/8BHOztuaj-4?t=16m33s). 

Displaying text is a common need, so it would be nice for A-Frame to have a built-in solution. Though @donmccurdy has a point about "different approaches [being] better for different things"; e.g. HTML-to-canvas for foreign languages.

Downsides of bmfont-text:
- character set is limited
- my implementation is hackey and the dependencies are complex
- components (color, opacity) do not work 'natively'
- [offset](https://github.com/bryik/aframe-bmfont-text-component/issues/14) and other issues

Orginally asked on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39936638/cannot-read-property-getorcreategeometry-of-undefined)

I am using A-Frame with Angular 2.

The code is simple, showing a curved image:

```
  <a-curvedimage src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Random_pyramids.jpg"
    position="0 2 -20"
    theta-length="72"
    height="2.6">
  </a-curvedimage>
```

Without Angular 2 router, it works well: [working plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/pqmTU1yaISCijItyVytD?p=preview)

After adding Angular 2 router, I got the error below. [issue plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/NiqSRd6hduE5yCboTVZs?p=preview)

> VM14540 aframe.min.js:75 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property
> 'getOrCreateGeometry' of undefined

[![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cR8Wf.png)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cR8Wf.png)

And I found if I remove these two `theta-length="72" height="2.6"` in the issue plunker, it won't through the error.

I want to use `theta-length="72" height="2.6"` and the router together. What may cause this? Thanks
 @ngokevin can u copy your explaination from Stack Overflow to here. Here I can @ someone who may offer help.
 I had the same problem (but I'm using Meteor + React + aframe 0.3.1).

**I solved it by waiting scene to load before adding content into scene.**

This is how I check if scene is loaded:

```
let scene = document.querySelector('a-scene');
if(scene && scene.hasLoaded) { 
   // scene is loaded
}
```

Try to make setInterval or something.
 @perak thanks,

After changing to the codes below, it won't give error for me. I will ask around see if a there is a clean solution.

```

  show = false;

  ngOnInit() {
    // not loaded

    setTimeout(() => {
      // loaded
      this.show = true;
    });
  }
```
 @ngokevin thanks for reminding the `loaded` event. And also thanks the help from @alxhub and @DzmitryShylovich on Gitter.

``` ts
<a-scene (loaded)="onLoaded()">
  <a-curvedimage

show = false;
onLoaded() {
  this.show = true;

  I'm running into a blank white screen when I toggle on VR mode on some of the Vive examples. In addition, no video data is sent to my Vive. AFrame's APainter works but the following demos do not:

Is this an issue on my end? Or was there an update that caused an issue with these VR demos? I ran into the issue locally as well using AFrame version 0.3.1. I'm also using Chromium version 55.0.2869.0. 
 @ngokevin That worked like a charm. Thanks 🎉

The top and bottom of the code in the following section of the documentation is being rendered as text.

https://aframe.io/docs/0.2.0/components/geometry.html#defining-your-own-geometry

I don't think it's markdown else I would offer some solutions, but aesthetically speaking it should look like this.

```
AFRAME.registerComponent(‘my-geometry’, { // Called on component attach and data update. 

    update: function () { // Grab the mesh. 
             var mesh = this.el.getOrCreateObject3D(‘mesh’, THREE.Mesh);  // Provide your own geometry.
             var geometry = mesh.geometry = new THREE.Geometry();
             geometry.vertices.push(
                       new THREE.Vector3(-10,  10, 0),
                       new THREE.Vector3(-10, -10, 0),
                       new THREE.Vector3( 10, -10, 0) );

               geometry.faces.push(new THREE.Face3(0, 1, 2));
               geometry.computeBoundingSphere();

      },

Probably unrelated to this, but [this line](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/37c33d2cc88de369feff7027f3d1e24b305ef496/src/components/cursor.js#L139) doesn't seem right either as clearCurrentIntersection() doesn't take any argument.

BTW, not sure if anyone tried this component with raycaster as described [here](https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/components/cursor.html#configuring-the-cursor-through-the-raycaster-component), the object selector doesn't work.

 Regarding the raycaster issue, I looked a little further at it, and this line looks suspicious

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/a-entity.js#L358

> self.initComponent(component, undefined, true);

It looks like that the raycaster component was initialized as a dependency, and the above line initialized it without its attributes. If that's right, chances are many other components may also be initialized without their attributes.
 Gonna take a look at this right now!

Probably needs some event listener setup. Which makes me wonder: **what events are generated when we enter/exit stereo mode?**
 Same problem here. Also not working with the examples on aframe.io.

Testing with WebVR Sampels it works though. I also tried to copy the meta tags from there, didn't help:
```
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no">
    <meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
    <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
```

Is there any solution? The Safari devs (and Apple?) are to blame for this issue and I don't see how aframe could fix that. That said, I've worked around the problem by saving all (aframe) sketches to the home screen on my iPhone. I would close this issue if I were you. @gamecubate 
I don't agree, as said if I use those examples: https://webvr.info/samples/ I am able to get to fullscreen (in Safari). I can still drag the navigation bar by dragging the page, but at least initially it is in fullscreen. So there seems to be a way, right? I didn't manage to figure out how though. I found a workaround for everyone who is interested:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2577#issuecomment-296100258  While using A-Frame for a panoramic image I noticed that the image wasn't rotating properly. After some investigation I noticed that it wasn't reading the xmpmeta data to figure out the correct orientation.

Here is an example: http://codepen.io/steven10172/pen/vXJZzE
Here is the desired behavior: http://www.joshuanaylor.com/pannellum/

The pannellum library has a method [(method source)](https://github.com/mpetroff/pannellum/blob/master/src/js/pannellum.js#L445L535) that reads the tags on the image to see what the proper heading, horizon pitch, and horizon roll should be set to.
 This also looks like it does the correction calculations: https://github.com/mpetroff/pannellum/blob/master/src/js/libpannellum.js#L464L490
  It's definately needed, I've hacked the update() functionality in the postproc PR but reusing the Component prototype makes more sense

- A-Frame Version: aframe-v0.3.0.js
- Platform/Device: Android WebView
- Reproducible Code Snippet or Demo URL [highly encouraged]:

A-Frame used to work fine in version 0.2.0
My app runs by default in fullscreen.

When I try clicking on the Enter VR button this error is output in the console:

`a-scene.js:175 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Failed to enter VR mode (`requestPresent`): Unable to present.(…)enterVRFailure @ a-scene.js:175`
 Possibly related to:  #1933
 Also related to https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill/issues/114
 This might be a tricky one. I have bypassed the fullscreen problem, then a problem with the orientation lock not being available on the webview.

The Enter VR mode button then disappears for the rest of the session, without leaving any console log.
Not really sure what to do with that one... Something is clearly not firing when it should be.
 Just the same thing happens to me (same console output) + "Enter-VR" not possible in Chrome 4.2 on an Android LG 5. However with Chrome 4.3 (Beta) works ok...
 I think that is because Chrome Beta supports the WebVR 1.0 spec and prod does not.

Eventually, the webview will support the spec, but there will still be problems with a-frame because of the fullscreen indicator and orientation lock code.
 This is still broken in v0.4.0 and on the master branch. In v0.2.0 it was working perfectly.   **Description:**

"fusing" doesn't work, while "cursor-fusing" does, as mentioned in the cursor docs
  How to listen e.g. OBJ loader loading progress?
We know all loaders in aframe were using THREE.XHRLoader( url, onLoad, onProgress, onError ), which has 'onProgress' to handle XHR progress event. But in aframe, loaders just call THREE.XHRLoader( url, onLoad) with first two vars. Giving us no API to handle loading progress.

I think we need add some apis to do that.

  Hi!

I'm building a WebVR app for mobile using Apache Cordova and, obviously, aframe. This app will systematically be used with HMD on, so I wanted to have the VR mode enabled at startup. I used the `enterVR()` method, but I get a `Failed to execute 'requestFullScreen' on 'Element': API can only be initiated by a user gesture.` warning that prevents me from doing so. The thing is cordova already handles the fullscreen stuff, so I really do not need it to be enabled.

Is there already some option or property to disable this behaviour for specific kind of case like mine ? If not, I'd be happy to help if you would point me out to the right direction. I've looked a bit into aframe sources and couldn't find any reference to the actual method call that triggers this fullscreen API.

Thanks !

Simply open [an example](https://aframe.io/examples/) in your (Android) mobile browser, plug it in your computer and [open the console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/remote-debugging/remote-debugging). Type `document.querySelector('.a-enter-vr-button').click()` and feel my sorrow 😢
 Thank you !

If this is ok with you, I can submit a PR that would basically just add a `noFullScreenVR` property to the `a-scene` entity and check for it before calling the `requestFullScreen`.

The warning does prevent the stereo mode. I'm not sure I understand what you mean by `detect a fullscreen/native/pinned context` though :/
 Well, this is not only cordova related. For instance, this could be useful for other hybrid mobile app frameworks, but also for nw.js or Electron. In fact, any web app that can run outside a proper "browser" and thus can handle at a higher level the process of making the page fullscreen.

Couldn't we just check `(window.innerHeight === window.screen.height && window.innerWidth === window.screen.width)` ? I think this would be a correct way to detect if the app is already in fullscreen or not. What do you think ?
 After some research and attempts in aframe, found out this is related to webvr-polyfill. Also found that [someone raised the issue in June](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill/issues/114) and bumped it.

  I've been teaching workshops/giving talks on A-Frame for 8 months now & I've consistently recommended the `animation` component over the built in for the reasons Kevin outlined at the top of this issue, in addition to being easier for newcomers to grok.

Just wanted to chime in that `<a-animation>` sounds like it does more harm than good being in core & it would be good to remove if it makes maintenance harder (seems like it does) _before 1.0_ (even if that's not on track for 0.8, as that release train is probably happening soon)  hi @darkwing, @cvan. How can a newbie work on this? Is this about creating two a-frame scenes with and without optimize-js and see the different in load-times?  Hotspot functionality in aframe panorama,can anybody guide me or give me some clues on how to make this possible
 @donmccurdy @darkwing   Please make sure the question is considered a good fit for Stack Overflow before redirecting people there or reposting support issues there.  Specifically, this question is unclear and very broad. 

See: [What topics can I ask about here?](http://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic) and [What types of questions should I avoid asking?](http://stackoverflow.com/help/dont-ask)

Thanks :-)
 Sorry for the late response!!

By the "hotspot" functionality I mean,overlaying some graphic markers or icons on specific cardinal points in a vr panorama scene,clicking upon whom will take us to a new scene.
 One more thing,does a-frame already comes with implementation for Yaw,Pitch & Roll or do I have to make it ?
 This is my sample 360ImageView

How do I add Hotspot functionality in aframe panorama,can anybody guide me or give me some clues on how to make this possible

Thanks http://ensoimmersive.co.in/ @ngokevin
can you please share the link of the document adding hotspot 
see this is as example one https://pannellum.org/documentation/examples/hot-spots/ I want to make it same as in A-Frame At least say how to add the pop for those icons http://ensoimmersive.co.in/ How to add text in 360 degree photos using A-Frame 
The text should be like a popup message when the cursor goes to any icons it should popup the text

Example: consider that I am in kitchen when the cursor is goes to kitchen icon it should popup the text "kitchen"

  Is there a method I could use, to cheat the A-Frame framework, to think that a desktop browser (Raspberry Pi's for this case), is compatible with side-by side VR? This would be such a useful thing for non-mobile devices.
 @aframevr anything?
 @ngokevin Technically, that's both. I need it to render stereoscopically on a device without VR capabilities, as desktop browsers identify themselves, and I want to later pass in custom accelerometer values to the framework. On a rPi.
 @ngokevin Thanks, will look into it.
Can I then feed the camera with values somehow? 
 The `isMobile` hack no longer works. https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1009#issuecomment-342028445 Can we please re-open since the isMobile hack no longer works? Development while you don't have access to a VR device.  It is helpful to see what the actual output will look like. ... I'm sure there are others, but that is the one that concerns me. I simply need to see the actual output, and others have also requested it.  "Similar", is just not enough for my case.  I'm not sure the web extension will work for me as I am using Electron. Mono rendering is not accurate enough because I need to manage exactly what is visible from a static camera position.  The distortion causes that to be a little different from the mono view.  I don't see any reason why using electron would prevent presentation on VR hardware, but maybe I'm missing something? Thanks, I only need to support Oculus Rift. OK, so I would need to use Firefox? Of course.  I will look into using firefox in kiosk mode or something.  Is there a firefox extension to simulate VR hardware? I actually have a use case for this too. I need to be able to render content directly to one eye or the other, and I need to be able to debug this to make sure it's working correctly. This is pretty challenging to do with aframe right now. Can we reopen this one? @dmarcos 

Edit: to answer the reasonable question "why would you want to do that?" the answer is that I have a CV application that's measuring pupil response to light and needs to be able to compare pupils.  **Description:**

However webkit-playsinline is still specified in

 @ngokevin  also noticed the video will not auto play in mobile iOS unless muted.

try to fire play() in js but still no luck.
 The blog goes over all of this in detail:

https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/
 Yeah, most rich content involving video will still need a click.

This is how to detect whether you need to show a "play" button or something:

https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/play-returns-promise
 Just for reference. This is a blog post from Apple regarding the changes in `playsinline` for iOS 10 

https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/
 That was the only information I found about why playsinline is no longer prefixed and what policies to follow to make it play. 

Also considering that Desktop Safari doesn't have the same restrictions as iOS does it makes sense to review the article to see if there are additional changes to make Hm. I'm still not able to get this working using the following:

``` @cvan , 

Sorry, should've put that in my original post. This is an issue on Safari on both desktop 10.1.1 and iOS 10.3.2. 

I tried converting as you suggested above, but even after pinning it to the homescreen, I'm still getting black boxes. 

If anyone has a working repo with an example video of this working, that would be super helpful. As the Docs [read](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/primitives/a-video.html#caveats):

> Inline video support on iOS 10 may change this.

 @cvan ,

So to gut-check myself, I just ran this on a live server (on a real, public domain), rather than locally, and it works. For anyone moving forward - if you check this on macOS using a PHP -S server, it will not work. Has anyone been able to trigger audio? 

If I remove the `muted` attribute from the `<video>` element, I am unable to play the video. Adding an `onclick` trigger (via a cube or something), with `videoName.play()` gives an error in iOS 10. 

I'm happy to make a new issue for this, but didn't want to be duplicitous.  Markup:

If I add `muted` back into the `<video>` it triggers the play just fine (but without sound). I'm not sure if this is directly related to this issue, but I'm having trouble triggering audio on iOS devices. I'm listening for click events that play audio assets. I'm curious is anyone else is having a similar issue on iOS devices or if you know of a solution?   **Description:**
It seems that you can no longer set the fuse timeout of a cursor using `timeout`. This looks only partially reflected in the docs.

Anyway, Thanks a lot for the great work that you've done on this project ! It's awesome :smiley: 
  In my ar-scene setup, I want to replace the default camera entity with my own "ar-camera" entity, if the user did not create one in the scene.

So, in the scene's "loaded" callback (play method, actually), I grab a list of cameras, and look for an "ar-camera" entity.   This is all good.

BUT, I also want to disable any camera that is already there by setting active=false.

The problem is that the camera system ALSO has a "loaded" callback, in which it creates a default camera (if there isn't one) and attaches it to the scene.

Unfortunately, the a-node attachedCallback does not seem to run for these new nodes until after all of the various "loaded" handlers are run.  Which means that this.sceneEl in these nodes is not set, so when I call  `cameraEl.setAttribute('camera', 'active', false);` on the default camera that the camera system created, it throws an error inside the camera's init method (since setAttribute calls updateComponent which calls init on the uninitialized component (in a-entity.js).

It seems that there needs to be something in there to check (during init, I guess?) it's it's attached BUT the attached callback hasn't been called?  If so, do the same work (like setting the sceneEl)?
 The problem is that I'm running my code in the "loaded" callback; I have set up an event on "camera-set-active" but it wasn't running for the default camera because the event is fired in its "loaded" callback, before my loaded callback is executed ... at least that's what I think is happening, since my handler isn't running for the default camera.  To solve this, I also ran the same callback once in my loaded callback, which ran into the problem above.
 I know, it's fun (if confusing)...

I was setting the camera-set-active callback up in loaded ... I only want to check for cameras after the scene is loaded, in case the programmer has created an "ar-camera".  I guess I could try a different tack, setting the callback up at init, and watching for an ar-camera, and then creating the ar-camera in loaded.

Although, while this may work, it side steps the larger problem;  I don't think the setAttribute command should be raising an error.  Perhaps "init" on the node should check if the node is attached to the DOM and check for the existence of a scene (if sceneEl isn't set) and set it (as is done in in AttachedCallback) if it's not set.  
 I really don't want to set up a `nodeready` callback on each of these cameras, although I guess I could do that (check if `sceneEl` is null, if so set up a callback to do the "active = false" when it's ready).  Yuck. :)

The code is my argon-aframe stuff (github.com/argonjs/argon-aframe).  The offending code is in the "play" method of ar-scene.js.  Right now, the code in the repo is only using a callback on camera-set-active, which isn't getting called for the default camera ... all the time.  The weird thing is, it was getting called sometimes, but I discovered it not getting called in a more complex app I was building which starts out with an empty ar-scene and adds to it programmatically.

I replaced the addEventListener in that play method with a function that I set on the listener, and call:

```
          var fixCamera = function () {
            var arCameraEl = null;
            var cameraEls = self.querySelectorAll('[camera]');
            for (i = 0; i < cameraEls.length; i++) {
                cameraEl = cameraEls[i];
                if (cameraEl.tagName === "AR-CAMERA") { 
                  arCameraEl = cameraEl;
                  continue; 
                }
                cameraEl.setAttribute('camera', 'active', false);
                cameraEl.pause();
            }

            if (arCameraEl == null) {
                var defaultCameraEl = document.createElement('ar-camera');
                defaultCameraEl.setAttribute(AR_CAMERA_ATTR, '');
                defaultCameraEl.setAttribute(constants.AFRAME_INJECTED, '');
                self.appendChild(defaultCameraEl);
            }
          }
          // if there are any cameras aside from the AR-CAMERA loaded, 
          // make them inactive.
          this.addEventListener('camera-set-active', fixCamera);
          fixCamera();
```

The `cameraEl.setAttribute('camera', 'active', false);`ends up raising an exception because the cameraEl is set to the default camera, which hasn't had it's attachCallback method called yet, so it's not ready.
 Ok, I leveraged the `nodeready` event to work around this issue.  It's kinda ugly though.
 @blairmacintyre working code?
please Seems like there should be a simpler way to allow a-frame users to specify what the "default camera" for a scene should be, rather than them overriding the default camera after it has already been added to the scene.

f.e. `<a-scene default-camera="other-type-of-camera">` and if no camera is specified in the HTML, then the _first and only_ camera will be `other-type-of-camera` without having overriden some other camera.  Hello folks. I don't know if is a bug, but I'm trying to understand how could I change the entity SRC in an animation. I'm using the 3.0 version. 

With my code the entity material is empty.

`<a-entity id="parent" geometry="primitive: plane; width: 0.1; height: 0.1;rotation:0 0 0" position="0 -1 -1" material="src: #menu_hamburger; shader: flat; transparent:true; depth: 1; opacity: 1"><a-animation begin="mouseenter" attribute="material.src" from="#menu_hamburger" to="#menu_mais" dur="1000"></a-animation><a-animation attribute="material.opacity" begin="mouseenter" to="0.5" dur="100"></a-animation><a-animation attribute="material.opacity" begin="click" to="0" dur="100"></a-animation><a-animation attribute="material.opacity" begin="mouseleave" to="1" dur="100"></a-animation></a-entity>`
 Hello @cvan! Thanks for your answer but the problem is still the same. Best!

  **Description:**

(In reference to [this discussion](https://aframevr.slack.com/archives/general/p1473594376000181) on Slack.)

I have a `cursor` in an aframe-react app. I'd like to know when it gains or loses the `cursor-hovering` state and have my app react to it.

If I understood the reply on Slack correctly, there is no way to listen to these events?
- A-Frame Version: 0.3.0
- Platform/Device: all
 My original question in Slack was probably poorly phrased. :) Was supposed to be more about aframe-react anyway. `stateadded` and `stateremoved` were exactly what I was looking for and looks like aframe-react Entities have them as props.

Gonna close this issue. Thanks for the help!
 In my case got strange behavior using jQuery

`mouseenter` `mouseleave` have to be added using `addEventLister` ...weird! 
but `stateadded`and `stateremoved` are working fine.

I tested v2 and v3 of (google hosted) jQuery 

```
$(document).ready(function(){
			// click working fine OK
			$('.clickable').click(function (ev) {
				console.log(this.id + ' was clicked!');
			})
			// addEventListener OK
			.each(function(i, el){
				el.addEventListener('mouseleave', function(ev){
					console.log("dom ev leave " + this.id);
				});
				el.addEventListener('mouseenter', function(ev){
					console.log("dom ev enter " + this.id);
				});
			})
			// jquery mousenter - mouseleave not working KO
			.on('mouseleave', function(ev){
				console.log("jquery leave " + this.id);
			})
			.on('mouseenter', function(ev){
				console.log("jquery enter " + this.id);
			})
			.mouseleave(function(ev){
				console.log("jquery leave " + this.id);
			})
			.mouseenter(function(ev){
				console.log("jquery enter " + this.id);
			})
			// jquery staeadded - stateremoved working fine! OK
			.on('stateadded', function(){
				console.log("jquery stateadded " + this.id);
			})
			.on('stateremoved', function(){
				console.log("jquery stateremoved " + this.id);
			});
		});
```    In the current implementation, when fusing on an entity only the _first_ successful fusing is emitting a 'click' event on that entity. 
When not leaving the entity with the cursor no more fusing will be done. Clicking with the mouse propagates of course further 'click' events.

My expectation would be that also fusing several times on an entity should be processed by AFrame. Sso that a fusing is the same as a mouse click.

Thanks

  Is there any detailed description of the VOX file format, apart from the [MagicalVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=mv_vox_format) page?

Do the links below refer to the VOX format used in MagicalVoxel?

- [Ken's Voxlap 6 Model File](http://fileinfo.com/extension/kv6)

On the homepage of [Ken Silverman](http://advsys.net/ken/build.htm) I found the following description of the file format.

> What's the .VOX file format?
> 
> Both SLABSPRI & SLAB6 support a simpler, uncompressed voxel format using the .VOX file extension. (See the documentation that comes with those programs.) The .VOX format is simple enough to fit a description of it right here. Here's some C pseudocode:
> 
> long xsiz, ysiz, zsiz;          //Variable declarations
> char voxel[xsiz][ysiz][zsiz];
> char palette[256][3];
> 
> fil = open("?.vox",...);
> read(fil,&xsiz,4);              //Dimensions of 3-D array of voxels
> read(fil,&ysiz,4);
> read(fil,&zsiz,4);
> read(fil,voxel,xsiz_ysiz_zsiz); //The 3-D array itself!
> read(fil,palette,768);          //VGA palette (values range from 0-63)
> close(fil);
> In the voxel array, use color 255 to define your empty space (air). For interior voxels (ones you can never see), do not use color 255, because it will prevent SLABSPRI from being able to take advantage of back-face culling.

Is it correct? Is the VOX file format described here the same as the one used by MagicalVoxel/AFrame?

 You can retrieve te url of a video with the youtube api. See https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference#Retrieving_video_information and look at the player.getVideoUrl():String function.

 @ngokevin  I did manage to use mediaelement.js and add a youtube flat video into the scene, but not as  a videosphare. 

Based on what youtube provided, seems the only ways is to render their iframe as a sphere. 
  **Description:**
According to the [documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/core/animations.html#easing) the **easing** attribute controls the pace of an animation. Yet if one uses **easing** and not **easin** in an Aframe scene the entire scene blocks.

 Correct, thanks, not sure how I managed to miss than especially since I used easing before without issues ;)
  I just tried an aframe experiment with the Vive. Having the Chrome console open, the display size on PC screen was reduced, and I noticed the quality in the headset was worse than usual. It seems that the renderer size depends on the size of the original window. It should depend on the hardware (if PC=>Full HD, if smartphone=>HD) instead.
Try launching an aframe on the Vive with a very small browser window to reproduce

  **Description:**
A fix to the cursor.js component to ensure that `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` events fire reliably when multiple objects intersect the cursor's raycaster. 

**Changes proposed:**
- created a new function called `leaveCurrentIntersection` to handle triggering leave events, resetting the fuse timer, etc.
- leaveCurrentIntersection is now triggered in the `onIntersection` function if a current intersection already exists
- leaveCurrentIntersection is triggered in `onIntersectionCleared` only if the event is fired on the currently intersected element
- added test cases to the Cursor test example 
 I've added to the pull request to attach intersection information to all of the cursor event payloads to match the specs of this stackoverflow post:

  We are using a dynamic source attribute to the video tag and that's not working anymore in version 0.3.0. The reason we do this is to stream different bitrate and or resolution video to client devices. The error is: TypeError: r is null,   

...ossorigin")?e:(r=e.getAttribute("src"),r.indexOf("://")===-1?e:extractDomain(r)=...

I suppose it has something to do with the error handling for wrong formatted src attributes implemented a couple of days ago (#899).

Question: can we have the implmentation back from 0.2.0 where a src attribute was not mandated in the video tag? 
- A-Frame Version: 0.3.0
- Platform/Device: all
- Reproducible Code Snippet or Demo URL [highly encouraged]:

<a-scene>
     <a-assets>
         <video id="#video"/>
     </a-asset>
     <a-videospehere src="#video"/>
</a-scene>

```
   [javascript to determine device/os]
   video =  document.getElementById('video');
   source = document.createElement('source');

source.setAttribute('src', src);
video.appendChild(source);
video.play();
```

The above is simpliflied code (there should be some code there???)
 We tested 0.3.0 stable and the difference with 0.2.0 is that there seems to be an added check if the src attribute exists and if not it throws the above error. In 0.2.0 there was no check for the src attribute in the video tag (assets --> video).
 I wonder if autoplay works on the workaround you propose. I will try and see if that works. And by the way, thank you (and the others on the team) for a great framework and the effort you put in it.
  **Description:**
Currently, rStats displays a large white background behind counters under the alarm state. This was added for visibility in #1874, however it's aggressive compared to the rest of the rStat dashboard.

![rstatcolorchange](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7256178/18153870/0ca84576-6fb5-11e6-9bb0-e093bb13bcbe.gif)

**Changes proposed:**
- When a counter/label enters the alarm state, a white text shadow highlights the red text to make it more readible and visible without being as intrusive as a wide white background. The text shadow makes use of 9 levels of shadow to form a composite & dense coloring around the red text.
- This solution was discussed in #1630.

 Sure, I can do that later tonight
 Went ahead and opened a PR to rstats with a CSS class based solution here -> https://github.com/spite/rstats/pull/24

 I'd suggest to wait and see if mobile safari's html5 player will be upgraded to resolve this after iOS10's release
 Having encountered similar problems I usually serve 2 different video, 1 for desktop in high res and 1 for mobile (not just iOS) that is usually significantly lower.  **GearVR camera height incorrect:**
- A-Frame Version: 3.0
- Platform/Device: GearVR
## To reproduce
- Install browser inside GearVR Oculus homepage
- Turn on WebVR (using `internet://webvr-enable`)
- goto https://aframe.io/
- click to enter VR.

You are at height 0, the floor, not 1.8, like Carboard and 2D screen versions.

I see in the documentation: https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/components/camera.html

_"When not in VR mode, userHeight translates the camera up to simulate human height. The injected camera has this set to 1.8 (meters). When entering VR, this height offset is removed such that the absolute position return from the VR headset is used. This is very convenient for experiences that work both in and out of VR, as well as making experiences look decent from the monitor as opposed to clipping the ground if the headset was resting on the ground."_

So I suspect that we need a special case for fixed-position headsets, like the GearVR, to use the 1.8.
 Will this be fixed in the future by default without the component? Or should I put this into my scenes from now on.
 I think AFRAME.utils.isGearVR should be AFRAME.utils.isGearVR(), otherwise it's just checking for the existence of the function (and so it returns true for other browsers).

Does this workaround need a component, or could it perhaps be simplified with something like:

```
if (AFRAME.utils.isGearVR()) {
    cameraEntity.setAttribute('position', '0 1.8 0');
}
```

Like @msj121 I am worried about this breaking in the future though. Also, it fixes your height in fullscreen mode, but it breaks your starting height when viewing inside the initial Gear VR browser frame.
  Took a stab at #1535 ; reuses existing function, avoids unnecessary processing.
 I plan to do so early this week.
 Starting these tests tonight.
  There's been talk of updating the scenes with a more expansive rewrite but I've quickly made some language updates to the guides as they appear now.
 I'll revisit we vs. you vs. passive once I get more sleep.  The guides use both "we" and "you" at the moment, thus their voice jumps about.
  Like the `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` point, adding note that this attribute is automatically added by A-Frame so users don't think they need to add it.
 I thought you had meant section; updated.
  This is very common in other VR framework (e.g. https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/23585). So it will be triggered if the camera nod or shake for more than 3 times. 

It can be very useful to track head gestures. and gather user feedback without a controller.
  I'm trying to use an OBJ model without MTL, and specify the material by hand, using a `material` component. If I put the obj-model first:

``` html
<a-entity obj-model="obj: #my_model" material="color:#ff0000"></a-entity>
```

the material is ignored, and a default material is added (checked with inspector). But if I swap the order and put the material component first:

``` html
<a-entity material="color:#ff0000" obj-model="obj: #my_model" ></a-entity>
```

...the correct material is applied
- A-Frame Version: 0.3.0
- Platform/Device: Chromium + Windows + HTC Vive
  **Description:**
Adds test for Inspector

**Changes proposed:**
None
 Updates:
1.  Added the attributes you suggested; I held off originally to avoid code bloat for sake of test but since we're already using `aframe-injected` elsewhere, probably good to be consistent.
2.  Not adding `remove()` test since default components cannot be removed at present.
  a-videosphere is not working in mobile safari on iOS device.

A-Frame Version: 0.3.0
Platform/Device: iPhone 6 Safari iOS ver 9.3.4

Example page shows a full black screen, finger tab will not initiate video playback.

Compared side by side with with a-video. followed steps in https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/primitives/a-videosphere.html#caveats. a-video works perfectly fine while a-videosphere is not on iOS

```
<a-assets>
      <video webkit-playsinline autoplay loop crossorigin  id="video"  src="city.mp4"></video>
      <video webkit-playsinline autoplay loop crossorigin id="video1"  src="john.mp4"></video>
</a-assets>

<a-videosphere src="#video" rotation="0 180 0" ></a-videosphere>
<a-video src="#video1" width="16" height="9" position="20 0 -10"></a-video>
```
 @ngokevin added iphone-inline-video as well as muted on tag. still has the same problem.

I doubt it's related to user interaction on video play event since a-video works fine once I  pined the webpage to the iOS homescreen.
 wow, videosphere actually worked after I reversed the video content....

the city video is the same 360 video on aframe.io demo page. The other one is just a random mp4 video. Now it's confirmed to be a problem with the video file.

After some google search I believe now this is the root: 

> One important thing to note is that "iDevices" doesn't support all the varieties of mp4. Here is a small list about MPEG-4 and H.264 supported varieties.
> According to Apple official website, iPad or iPhone 4S is only compatible with H.264 or MPEG-4 video format with the following specifications:
> If it is MPEG-4 video, it should meet: up to **2.5 Mbps**, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Simple Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps per channel, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats;

Will try to downgrade the total bit rate to less than 2.5Mbps and will see how we goes.
 No Problem. Works well after rate downgrade. Wish Apple make a better html5 video player in iOS10. This issue can be closed for now : )
 The way we do it;
- Check for the least powerful device to run the video on (we target the iPhone 5S as the least powerful device on iOS).
- Encode three video's from the source material (in our case 3840 x 1920 50mb/s h.265). Reencode to h.264 15mb/s for desktops and mobile devices with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. Reencode to 1920 x 960 h.264 15 mb/s for all other mobile devices except the iPhone / iPad. For idevices use 1366 x 683 h.264 5 mb/s. It runs smooth and looks very crisp.
- For reencoding a video use Handbrake with audio passthrough.  
 Hi @ngokevin, Is this issue good as 'help wanted (easy)'?  Here is a lower resolution version that works on an iPhone 6S with iOS10 10 https://vatelier.net/MyDemo/videosphere-showcase/ 

The video file itself is https://vatelier.net/MyDemo/videosphere-showcase/city_halfres.mp4 that I downgraded using `ffmpeg -y -i city.mp4 -vf scale=2048:1024 city_halfres.mp4`. @cvan you're right it's just the resolution @fuleinist but it can not work on iOS 11, i have try all kinds of solution. is any other people like me ? i have solve this problem with creating a  button to play can you pleas post the code.  i have also try all kinds of solution. The 360 video example on Glitch should have click to play, if I recall correctly...

Generally the issue is browser restrictions on autoplay of video/audio, and not A-Frame. <script>
 window.addEventListener('click', function () {
   var v = document.querySelector('#vid');
   v.play();
 });
 </script>

` <a-assets>
   <video id='vid' src="imgs/video-1920x960.mp4" autoplay>
 </a-assets>
 <a-scene>
   <a-sky rotation="0 -90 0" src="#vid"></a-sky>
  </a-scene>`

have this simple code. it work in firefox , not in safari. can you tell me where is the problem see https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aframe-360-video-example
(try it here: https://aframe-360-video-example.glitch.me ) Not sure GitHub issues are the best place for this kind of support but it
does highlight that more complete and documented examples are needed.
 There is actually a section in the FAQ about this, e.g. https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/introduction/faq.html#why-does-my-video-not-play-on-mobile

Since then, however, the restrictions on autoplay content have spread from mobile to desktop, and it doesn't look like the documentation has kept up with that aspect.

You are right of course that "how do I" questions usually get asked and answered on StackOverflow or similar.

Sent from my Android device with K-9 Mail. Please excuse my brevity.  **Description:** Updates the docs with details about the new properties of the Standard Shader

**Changes proposed:**
- Add details for spherical environment maps
- Add details about the different types of distortion maps
- Update the default value of the displacement bias to something more sensible.
  How does that relate to `<a-assets><img src></>`?  Does having two different attributes add complexity?
 The src attribute has been around for ages and is completely understood by web developers. In my opinion changing the src attribute to asset adds complexity.
 Hey! I'm just into learning A-Frame and came across this. I wanted to comment on this because it really felt weird seeing a "src" attribute used to reference a CSS-ish selector. I mean, src is always used for implicit filenames. 
That said, although I've just started learning A-Frame I see the "src" used like everywhere, so deprecating this is gonna lead to serious code-breaks I think.
  **Description:** The documentation says we can ["customize the raycasting pieces of the cursor...by changing the raycaster component properties"](https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/components/cursor.html#configuring-the-cursor-through-the-raycaster-component). But attempting to restrict the cursor to a certain class using the raycaster's 'objects' property does not work (all entities remain active).

CodePen: https://codepen.io/bryik/pen/VjRgyk
- A-Frame Version: 0.3.0
- Platform/Device: Chrome/Windows
 This may be caused by confusion between the raycaster created by the cursor (as a dependency) and the raycaster added in markup.

I had the same problem with the vive-cursor component and "solved" it by having the raycaster's 'objects' property be set by vive-cursor during initialization.
 > I wonder if it's a component initialization order issue.

Putting the raycaster component before the cursor component [works as it should](https://codepen.io/bryik/pen/PzAGRa).

The code sample on the cursor's doc page could be amended, but ideally the order wouldn't matter.
  **Description:**

Just add some syntax highlighting to the code snippets in the `README.md`.

**Changes proposed:**
- Change markdown code format from indenting to backticks. This allows syntax highlighting.
  **Description:**
## **Changes proposed:**
## 
## 

Update Link href to `mixin` documentation page.
  **Description:**
- A-Frame Version: 0.3.0
- Platform/Device: any

The description of the "update-raycaster" is component is confusing, especially as this is the second tutorial beginners will be reading. Without diving deep into the source of [the image gallery boilerplate](https://github.com/aframevr/360-image-gallery-boilerplate) it is impossible to understand. Most crucial, there is no mention of the element the component is attached to. The "set-image component" should have more explanation as well. 

I can try a documentation update / pull request if desired and not already in the works.
 I think the sequence of tutorials is quite good. One for HTML, one for using / writing components and one for MagicaVoxel which I'm looking into right now.  Just needs some more detail on the components.

In current documentation, 0.3.0+, as of 2016/08/20, the linked Tracked-Controls does not exist, and so the reader gets a 404.
Additionally, within Hand-Controls, the path for both the nonexistent TC and the present Vive-Controls is incorrect

 Steps to reproduce are great but even better, IMO, is a working demo if available.  It's easier to ask for more and get less than visa versa.

 Sure, I'll revert those out.
 @dmarcos do you think anything else needs to be done on this PR?
 Yeah i'll take a look. 
 Environment maps don't seem to emit anything once they are loaded I could check in a setInterval until it passes but that is a little hacky. I couldn't see how you were checking loading for cube envMaps.
 It's fine I will add a el.emit('envmap-loaded') to both and the write tests for both to listen for that.
 I have added tests for environment maps and fixed a bug when loading cube environment maps via 6 urls.
 I think that is everything.
I don't feel comfortable resolving the conflicts as my git is showing me it is the whole file in conflict some how?!  Would someone else be able to resolve it?
 About the example I will put something together later once I have some assets I feel comfortable sharing. The Ninja is from three.js and sky sphere photo has people in.
 I think that has merged correctly.
I had a weird bit where some code had been duplicated. Fixed. PR looks sane. Tests pass.
 Thanks for your help, I'll do a rebase on Monday, taking a day off
tomorrow. :)

  I would like to see the ability to record and add additional cameras to scenes and export the views. Something similar to NVIDIA's ANSEL.
 @cvan @ngokevin was right I am definitely interested in your that too
  **Description:**
## **Changes proposed:**
## 
## 

CHANGELOG.md says "Default camera is now positioned at 0, 1.6, 0 rather than 0, 1.8, -4. In VR mode, the 1.6m height offset as defined by camera.userHeight is removed. (#1474, #1718)"

but in v0.3 doc, still v0.2 value of Default camera position (0, 1.8, -4).

My English is so poor~Sorry

  Hi, i tried updating a-animation from, to attributes with `animationEl.setAttribute('to','0 0 1')`
but it never goes right!
after calling aSceneEl.appendChild(animationEl) , it always take the first value and never the updated value
- A-Frame Version:0.3.0
- Platform/Device:Kali Linux 2.0 / Chrome Version 50.0.2661.86 (64-bit)
 I am having the same issue and I believe a-animation will not respond to data change via setAttribute.

You can try to use component api to bind an a-animation to the object. which has been explained in https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/guides/build-with-components.html

Sample Script:

```
  /**
   * Setup fade-in + fade-out.
   */
  setupFadeAnimation: function () {
    var data = this.data;

    if (data.target.is('set-image-animation-ready')) { return; }

    // Create animation.
    var animation = document.createElement('a-animation');
    var animationData = {
      attribute: 'material.color',
      begin: 'set-image-fade',
      direction: 'alternate',
      dur: data.dur,
      repeat: 1,
      from: 'white',
      to: 'black'
    };
    Object.keys(animationData).forEach(function (attr) {
      animation.setAttribute(attr, animationData[attr]);
    });

    // Append animation.
    data.target.appendChild(animation);
    data.target.addState('set-image-animation-ready');
  }

```
 I wonder what is the reason a-animation does not respond to updates? Will this be fixed or is it so by design?  Looking at this one.
  Minor fixes for ramp up to 0.3.0

  This has been bothering me; need consistency! :)
 We could but it seems a bit out of place; we require a space between `function` and `(`, and then `)` and `{`.  IMO spaces looks much more elegant and easy to read.

 Since you wait for the scene to be loaded... the lights defined in the html will be there already right?
Don't you need to check for lights in the scene at the start of setupDefaultLights, and not create them in the first place then? That would also make it even more in line with camera.

  @ngokevin This issue interests me. Can I help?
 @ngokevin I am thinking that the script could be executed by NodeJS when running `npm start` and then shows in the output the grammar errors and typos. Any thoughts?
 @mkungla I understand your point. I agree, that would be a better way of doing it. Thanks for your feedback.
 @cvan Perhaps we could try it and compare with @ngokevin's suggestions to see which works best.
 @cvan Thanks, it's appreciated :)
 @ngokevin I have been experimenting with Gingerbread and it has been pretty inaccurate on correcting the errors of the MD files in docs. Upon every new line, it wants a capital letter and it tried to change `<a-scene>` to `<a-scan>`.
 @ngokevin Great idea! Should we also trim all the `.md` files stuff like `#`?

  One idea I had and have seen before is, instead of `this.blah, this` all the time, doing `'blah', this` and assuming that `this` holds the function if the first argument is a string. i.e:

```
module.exports.bind = function (fn, ctx) {
  if(typeof fn === 'string') fn = ctx[fn];
  return function bound () {
    return fn.apply(ctx, arguments);
  };
};

bind('onKeyUp', this);
```
 Yep; left off late at night.  Will add tests today!

 Test added.
 Updates made!
  There was a small English grammar error in the FAQ documentation.

Text was: Why does my asset (e.g., image, video, model) not _loading_?
Text is now: Why does my asset (e.g., image, video, model) not _load_?

Closes Issue #1772 
  There is currently a grammar error in the FAQ documentation.

Currently the text says: _"Why does my asset (e.g., image, video, model) not loading?"_

I think it should be changed to either:
Why _is_ my asset (e.g., image, video, model) not loading?
or
Why does my asset (e.g., image, video, model) not _load_?
 @mkungla - Yep, I'll do it today. Because it's such a small change I wasn't sure if it's worthy of a pull request or just a quick change. PR incoming!
  A quick docs search didn't provide information about browser support.  It would be cool to provide a minimum browser version alongside the device / mobile support in FAQ.

We should also consider adding a brief device/mobile support block to the Docs "Overview" page as people will probably want to know this before getting started.
 I agree with CanIUse as a general rule but people look for browser names at a glance, and since the WebVR spec probably chances fairly slowly, it may be worth adding the browser names as keywords.
 Your link 404s for me, btw
  @ngokevin I like it, flexibility is always welcome in my opinion.
 @cvan Does this affect my work in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-site/issues/110 and https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-site/issues/111 ?
 @Coder206 Noted!
 My fork of A-Frame now includes a Service Worker you can check in https://delapuente.github.io/aframe

The experiment allows revisiting demos offline after you already visited it while online, including the index of all demos.

Some of the current problems include:
  - [ ] Dealing with 360º video since cache API does not store 206 ranged responses. 
  - [ ] Adding the SW to the dev workflow in a non-intrusive way. Perhaps caching assets but not js files during development.
  - [ ] Improving first visit experience by pre-caching assets for VR experiences we know the user will visit sooner than later.

Regarding the last problem, I'm worried about space. VR demo experiences tend to be ephemeral but bandwidth consumers. Assets weight is why I prefer to be lazy when pre-caching.  **Description:**
`CustomEvent#target` is a read only property.
The removed line yielded an error when using strict mode.

**Changes proposed:**
- Remove assignment to `CustomEvent#target`
  **Description:**
Fixed a broken-link in documentation.

**Changes proposed:**
## \- Link points to the correct page now.
## 
  @ngokevin made a good point about using `NodeList.prototype.forEach`/`map` which probably wont fly on older Android/iOS.  Stick with the old I guess.
 @mkungla I submitted a PR with Array.from last week but @dmarcos thought we should use `Array.prototype.slice` instead so we could accommodate older browsers.
 @mkungla We could consider adding `querySelectorAll` to the `ANode` prototype which would return an array via `Array.prototype.slice.call(NodeList)` ; that way we're always working with an array when we query.
 Issues fixed.
  Tiny cleanup; `closestScene` starts with the current node so no need to repeat it with the ternary.
  **Description:**
Only literal a-entity elements were counted for aframe stats

**Changes proposed:**
counts all <a-*> elements excluding a-animations,  a-assets and it's children.

Not sure yet how and if this stat is updated when children are parsed / attached.
An alternative is to keep track of entities being created.
An addition could be to give stats on the different kinds of entities.

code review please if this is good programming / performance, ...
  Seeing this on everything on master.
 Closing this as I no longer see it, may have been a caching issue.
  - Shortens code to ones less QSA and one less `for` 
- Using forEach since `this.qsa` returns an `Array`
  re: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/798

Added as an attribute to not muddle the CSS classes, while still able to select with QSA.  This also adds to only `a-` elements as well as the `<video>` created by `material.js`.  

Purposely did not add to meta tag, the original canvas, or the `vr-mode-ui` elements as they're simply for VR mode in/out.

Let me know what you think of this.
 Updated!
 Added to VR elements and metas, updated test.
  I made the issue #1541 in another thread and I notice the same thing.
I tested v0.2.0 and the latest master branch in various devices, iPhone 6, Samsung Note 6, Redmi Note 4g and Samsung S6 with Google Cardboard. They all give the same result as @ngokevin testing.
As you guys mentioned it's the problem from webvr-polyfill but I think this is an important bug to A-Frame too.
My team has been trying to build a demo site with A-Frame but we really can't accept the display quality from the master branch, especially for text display. It's almost unreadable when the font size isn't huge enough on the screen.
It may increase the performance on mobile but I believe the current image quality isn't enough for quality production.
 I would like to reopen this, as it's still a problem on iOS 9 and below.
 This seems definitely not entirely fixed yet. Also on iOS 10 when you switch to VR-Mode when holding the Phone in Portrait-Mode.

I can reproduce it with the following example on an iPhone 6S with iOS 10 like this:
1. Open "https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/sky/" in Safari.
2. Hold your Phone in Portrait Mode & Switch to VR-Mode
3. Hold you Phone now in Landscape Mode --> you will see Blurry Textures
4. Quit VR-Mode
5. Hold your Phone in Landscape Mode & Switch to VR-Mode
6. Perfectly Sharp Textures

Is this still being addressed currently? Let me know if I can help in any way.
  As requested.

With 0.2.0 I can click on the window and walk around with the WASD keys. But with master, control stays with the editor often resulting in WASD characters being added to code accidentally. Autorun makes this extra frustrating.

 I would imagine this is an issue regarding CodePen and not A-Frame.
 @bleonard252 I don't think so, Codepen works fine with A-Frame 0.2.0.
 Oh, yeah. Then maybe it's priority? Idk
 Hmm, adding [a camera with wasd-controls but no look-controls](http://codepen.io/bryik/pen/AXNvYZ) fixes the issue. 

I guess the problem is with look-controls?
 Are you sure this is fixed? I'm still experiencing the problem with the latest dist: https://codepen.io/bryik/pen/bZzXGP
 @ngokevin Do you have a link I could try? How do I test it?
 Dang. The only other clue I came across was that the problem does not occur with the [dist from 26 days ago](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/43cfbc0c18cc1da1d2d0230f75643fdfb2252a28/dist/aframe.js). Not sure if that helps.

Codepen: https://codepen.io/bryik/pen/XKOXWg
 Ya, that works!

The grabby hand is gone though.
  spot and directional light have a target, this lets the user set it with a selector.

when no target is set, the target is added to the light itself, with an offset of (0 0 -1), this intuitively let's you control the spotlight direction with it's rotation. (pointing -Z).
haven't done this with directional lights, so not to break anything, when someone sets directional by position offset, pointing to 0 0 0 by default, or to the new target.

a test is here : http://www.frederickdesimpel.be/test/webVR/Aframe/lighttarget/

might need further tests to see if anything strange happens when removing the component.

Also fixed a bug where spotlight angle was only set with degToRad when it is created, further updates were set in radians.
 Just found out it doesn't work on firefox.

EDIT: The error in firefox with the above test has something to do with [#1483](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1483).
 2nd commit fixes firefox... i didn't set the target on light creation. Which is odd that it worked in chrome then... does chrome fire the update handler multiple times ?

I added a switch case to check for the different cases of the key. Now you can also set target back to null.

[test example here](http://www.frederickdesimpel.be/test/webVR/Aframe/lighttarget/test2.html). try changing the target of spotlight between #redsphere and #whitesphere or null in DOM inspector. If you set it to null, you can also change rotation of spotlight.
 I'm looking into testing... still eluding me a bit...

EDIT: but making progress...
 Hold on.. it still doesn't behave as expected...
 Ok. It should work pretty robust now.

Made the getlight function a method inside the component, so i could set this.defaultTarget.
Moved the spotlight specific setup of that defaultTarget inside the setlight method. It is now added to the light elements object3D group, instead of to the light itself.
Added var self in the update method, so i could reference this.defautTarget in the each function.

Added a temporary fix for [issue #1624](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1624), otherwise i couldn't get spotlight orientation correct.

there's a suite of unit test for light target, as wel as for both bugfixes.

I'll see if i can still make a test example before 0.3 releases...
 rebased and squached..
  **Description:**
Model scale is really off.  Very noticeable in the Rift/VIVE headsets.

**Changes proposed:**
Updates the scene scale so that it's more proportional to the size of the user and contents of screen.
  All references to `parentEl` could be removed here and elsewhere since it's not needed; `parentNode` should cover everything.  Or is `___El` a standard?
  **Description:**
Saw this when looking for info for the docs.

I might be wrong, but wouldn't it make more sense that the object3D is already present when the event is fired?

**Changes proposed:**
first attach the object3d then emit the child-attached event.
  Not sure why git keeps adding the other commits... that's just keeping things synched right?

Anyways, had an error in my previous PR about this docs section, and some more updates:

**Docs: event section of entity.md**
fixed error in list of events
added event schemachanged
fixed error in componentchanged example
 using evt.detail instead of evt directly
added child-attached example
  **Description:**
Issue #1628 

Documentation suggests, that: 

> Positive Y Axis extends down

It's the other way around.

**Changes proposed:**
Literally this:
`Negative Y axis extends down. Positive Y Axis extends up.`
  The goggles icon is a must, IMO.  Users don't care what it takes to get the 3D experience, full screen or not -- they want to be promised VR.
  Much shorter than a `for` loop.

This is the third or fourth usage of `A.p.s.call` -- should we consider a `ANode.prototype.query` method for querying children and returning an `Array` as a standard?
  **Description:** The hand-controls component is adding events twice, once during a manual "addEventListeners()" call in init() and a second time when play() is automatically called after update(). Additionally, a few other changes were made based on [@ngokevin's comment on the issue](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1704).

**Changes proposed:**
- Remove "addEventListeners()" call in init()
- Rename "stop()" to "pause()"
- ~~Move addEventListeners/removeEventListeners into pause() and play()~~
- Fix typo in component docstring ("HAndle" -> "Handle")
 OK. I redid the last commit. The add/remove eventListener methods should be back as they used to be. 

Still new at this, so let me know if the PR didn't update correctly.
  **Description:** I think the hand-controls component is adding events twice, once during a [manual "addEventListeners()" call](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/hand-controls.js#L27) in init() and a second time when play() is called after update().

Also the ["stop()" method](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/hand-controls.js#L34) should be "pause()", right?

I can do a PR, if desired.

  how can i Relative Rotation sky but button stop on that  ?

<a-sky id="sky"  rotation="0 -60 0" radius="5000" color="#fff" >

  I was triggering an animation with sound, exactly using

```
document.querySelector('#gruppo_uno').addEventListener('sound-ended', function(){

    });
```

but on IOS sound-ended does not even seem to work, and i don't seem to get any audio playing.

I tried even with simpler stuff like 

```
  <a-scene>
  <a-entity sound="src: assets/audio/03.vignetta3.mp3; autoplay: true"></a-entity>
</a-scene>

```

but i get no sound from IOS. Any idea?

 Hi.
I encountered the same problem with 0.3.2 version.
 ``<a-sky theta-length="90" src="#sky"></a-sky>`` has no effect.
But the following works:
```<a-entity geometry="primitive: sphere; thetaLength: 90; radius: 5000; segmentsWidth: 64; segmentsHeight: 20" scale="1 1 -1" material="src: #sky; shader: flat"></a-entity>```
  Another small nit to knock down  code.
 If we want to support old browsers without `Array.from`, we should back this out (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1642) and use `Array.prototype.slice` (https://davidwalsh.name/nodelist-array).
 Updated.  Feel free to just close if you don't want it

  **Description:**

  Is there any solution for this problem by now? I have:
- video without sound in iOS Safari
- sound and no video when I pin in it to the homescreen
- video and sound from other sources than the video in Chrome (Dektop)
- no problems in Safari (Desktop) @antesberger i only get video without sound on iOS Safari. Downloading to homescreen gives me sound and video. I'd check the filesize/encoding of your video maybe?

My big issue is that in iOS Safari even if I write my own sound handlers I get complaints from some global component about the `poolSize` that I don't get on desktop. @ngokevin is there a default `poolSize` that gets set only on mobile?

I can't figure out how to identify which entity is playing my random sound (via bubbling up I guess?) and has the default pool size. 

Frankly I'm confused as to how Aframe is even aware I'm playing these audio files, as this warning occurs even when the `<audio>` are outside the `<a-scene>` and `<a-assets>` and triggered via JS.

Aframe version 0.5.0 ```
components:sound:warn All the sounds are playing. If you need to play more sounds simultaneously consider increasing the size of pool with the `poolSize` attribute. +8s
```

Which component is this?  **Description:**

I know set Gemotry.vertices to null is well for performance. but some times i want align entitys on the vertices. this can be very useful..
So, is there any way to get the vertices? or add a callback at later version??
Thanks!~~
: P
 yeah...you're great!~~ I've found the position prop but don't know it flattened outt!
Haha...thank you...
  This is the first I've heard of budo being slow, I think as with most code it's just a matter of benchmarking to determine the culprit. Can you provide more details about what is slow? Maybe a test repo I can try on Windows?
 Just FYI — I noticed you guys are still using budo in AFrame. If anybody is experiencing LiveReload hangs/issues with budo, try installing the following branch which does not rely on tiny-lr, but a custom WebSocket implementation. It should be a bit faster and more reliable and runs on the same server/port as budo.

```sh
npm install mattdesl/budo#feature/livereload-rework
```

See here for details:  
https://github.com/mattdesl/budo/issues/194  Description:
A number of places in the source assumed that the only possible scene would be an 'a-scene' element. In most places in the code, however, the .sceneEl (property on any element contained in a scene) and .isScene (property on a scene) are used. By directly using 'a-scene' (when searching for elements, and so on), we cannot create new kinds of scenes.

Changes proposed:

replace different references with existing alternatives (el.sceneEl, el.isScene)
add new closestScene() method to a-node.js, and use it instead of closest('a-scene')
add new findAllScenes() method to utils.js, and use it instead of document.querySelectorAll('a-scene');
 I'd submitted a PR on this already, but it had extraneous stuff in it.  So, I cleaned out my repository, re-applied the changes an resubmitted.

 Ignore this.  I need to clean up the commit (I can't figure out why it decided all of scene.js was changed, but I doubt you want this in your build).  I'm going to start again.
 I am not sure.  It only did it to that file.  I don't think I'm using hard tabs (using vs-code, I thought it defaulted to spaces).
  Removed misleading camera configurations under examples.
Surrounded cameras with entities where it was causing problems
under examples, like A-Frame Logo, Curved Mockups etc.
  Hi!
A frame looks like a really good framework, but I have some issues with the API.
I see that there are only position, rotation and scale attributes but no transform matrix. There are many cases where handling this data as one transform matrix is quite easier (currently having such a case myself).
I guess internally these are combined to a transform matrix, so this should only be an API extension.
However I see a problem with this because then the parameters position, rotation and scale are interlinked with the transform matrix.
Is this intended design or just some missing feature?
- A-Frame Version: 0.2.0

 @ngokevin 
Thanks. It seems I have to dig a bit deeper to do this via three.js. Writing a higher order component sounds like a good alternative but a bit unnecessary to decompose a matrix to then compose it again.
 > Yeah, I would just apply the matrix to the Object3D.

In this case other components like those provided by `networked-aframe` don't react to changes, as in modifying the transform of an Object3D directly won't sync over the network. `networked-aframe` only works when using the a-frame APIs directly to update data and avoiding the underlying Three.js objects (f.e. only using `setAttribute('position', ...)`.  **Description:**

The Flat vs VR explanation on "Device & Platform Support" is great.

However, a doc about "UI Controls" in general, 
incorporating the user's motion (WASD, touch, etc.) and view (look-controls, etc.), 
would be _extremely_ helpful!

There are so many potential inputs and outputs for A-Frame now, 
even without considering physics, 
it's very difficult to define suitable interfaces for all potential devices.

Even just a list of all available options (both for looking and for moving) would be very useful.
- A-Frame Version: 0.3.0 / Master Docs
- Platform/Device: N/A
 That works!
 This may be beyond the scope of AFrame docs, 
but it sure would be nice to have a page, even a community-maintained wiki page, where devs could keep track of the ever-changing HTML5 browser issues that directly affect AFrame scenes. Basically, a list of "gotchas" that apply to relevant HTML5 APIs.

For example, iOS requires a user event to trigger audio. That requirement actually got _more_ specific in iOS9--now it apparently requires a touchend/mousedown event (a touchstart event won't suffice anymore).**

These issues are often poorly documented (good luck learning about that iOS9 change in Apple Docs!), and often they narrowly impact advanced HTML5 techniques utilized in AFrame scenes. 

Maybe a resource exists elsewhere for this, but I haven't seen it. 

A simple (github) wiki page, linked to from Docs in the Community section, would be a great start. 

I have a feeling it would naturally be used and maintained without much effort. It could prevent a lot of needless headaches, help devs more efficiently maintain their scenes when something like that iOS9 change occurs, and create another incentive for devs in general to pay attention to the AFrame community.

**fixed in iOS9.0.3
^--(these are exactly the details I'm referring to, haha)
  **Description:** Just ran into this while testing pause() on a component attached to the same entity as vive-controls.

**Changes proposed:**
- Change "removeEventLister" to "removeEventListener"
  **Description:**
As of now passing a .dds `src` to a material will cause the component to interpret it as a video and not work properly.

Is there any intention of implementing DDS support into aframe?

In the meantime is there any workaround to get .dds files to load properly?

Thanks!
 So I guess that's a `no` on a first-party implementation.

Gonna go the custom component route then, thanks.
 @Pupix 
Was wondering if you got this to work? I'm trying to wrap my head around it and can't load in the .dds texture at all. Any help would be most appreciated @JunkYardRobotBoy I've made a custom component as kevin suggested. 
Something like this

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('texture', {

    /** CONFIG ***/

    schema: {
        src: { type: 'src' }
    },

    /** LIFECYCLE ***/

    init() {
        this.texture = null;

        this._loader = new THREE.DDSLoader();
    },

    update() {

        this.texture = this._loader.load(this.data.src);

        // Do whatever with this.texture here
    }

});

```


and use it like so

```js
const entity = document.createElement('a-entity');

entity.setAttribute('texture', `src: url(${paths.texture})`);
window.scene.appendChild(entity)
``` @Pupix 
Cheers! Thanks for this. Trying to set it as a cube-env-map on some gltf models now!
Thanks heaps!  **Description:**

Today when i test demo on https://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe, I found that all the components's demo in my phone are bad!  This is big trouble becase last time in a month ago them are very well!
Now, I test the example in https://aframe.io/examples/ , also bad!
what happen?? when i put my phone horizontal, and click webVR button into VR mode, the screen's orientation is displays vertically.. I mean that screen split in two pictures in horizontal, but every picture displayed vertically, and DeviceMotionEvent also works bad!

the error is like this:
![wrong_01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9690703/17029900/c03e1cb8-4f9f-11e6-8223-57137300e9ec.jpg)

In fact the right result should be like this:
![right_01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9690703/17029530/1cb28ecc-4f9e-11e6-8b67-b5576bf63d4f.jpg)

I have some test, and find that if I put my phone horizontal before the web complete! then it works fine in horizontal, but i can't rotate my phone to vertically, becase the problem will happen again! if I put my phone horizontal after the web complete, it works bad with wrong orientation!!

er.....someone understand????? this bug not happen in iphone's safari!~
- A-Frame Version: Latest version
- Platform/Device: Android 4.4.0 Sumsung Galaxy Note2 N7100
 oh no...not just my device... I have test  some other device ....and all bad! so.. is the file "https://aframe.io/aframe/dist/aframe.js" or file "https://aframe.io/aframe/dist/aframe.min.js" had modified??? 
And i have test some other example at "https://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe", I find some example use other file address like "http://drawvr.com/tron/aframe.min.js"..the problem also happen...so I don't know if the last version have the problem or the bug always exist... (in fact i remember last test the demos are fine in one or two month ago! but now i'm not sure!!  ~~(_._)~~~)

Thanks for reply..... please Identify the problem. in Android device, chrome..version?? er... my device's chrome version is 51...other device's version unknow. But the examples all rendered well!!

step:
1. put your android device vertically and visit examples at https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/anime-UI/ or other website.
2. when the webpage load complete, click "vr mode" button.
3. put your device horizontal!  <== running bad! two pictures split along Xaxis but every picture's orientation along Yaxis...
 @michael829 

> oh no...not just my device... I have test some other device ....and all bad!

can you post 
1. Android Versions
2. Which mobile browser
you tested and have this problem. 

@dmarcos I can reproduce  this on Android 4.4.4 browsers with WebKit engine, Firefox works still fine.
So probably problem is coming from some latest updates for android 4.x. Since when I now powered up my testing (also Samsung) phone, it  made lot of updates including "Android System updates" and both Android Browser and Chrome got updated and indeed after these updates seems that orientation is messed up on all WebKit browsers, while it was working before just fine. Definitely worth investigating since this problem now persists on `master`. 
 oh Thanks god...!~  this problem are happen to Android webkit browser....my tested device are android and browser are webkit browser... no firefox..you know, most people are use webkit browser... so I didn't expect it works fine on Firefox and have no test on Firefox... so sorry...

And.. I have't update my device since last june....my Android version is Android 4.4.4...Chrome version is 51.0.2704.81 ...

Thank you for reply...very thank you!~
  **Description:**
Fixes https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1129

I suspect this one will require much more work.  I've run tests and all passes but things to consider:
-  Is this a breaking change moving forward where API docs must be updated?  Is it work the breaking change?
-  What other components may need updating to accommodate an array instead of a NodeList?
  should this be implemented as a component/system?
 I'm gonna try to take a look into this, hopefully will have a PR for this soon
 @ngokevin yeah pretty much! 
If it was possible, we'd have to do some weird stuff to the DOM to add a <meta> tag (then also some verification step), which, as a concern, might be better left off for the user to take care of themselves.  **Description:**
Fixes #704 

**Changes proposed:**
- One reservation here is that the `value` method can get called many times and that this warning may become overwhelming.  Let me know what you think.
  **Description:**
Many examples use the `begin` attribute instead of new `delay` attribute so I've fixed them to avoid warning.  I've also updated a broken image path.
  **Description:**
The "Declarative" links on the A-Frame Examples page are 404'ing  :(

**Changes proposed:**
- Remove said links until the examples are in place.
  **Description:**
WebVR uses the OpenVR SDK and thus supports the HTC Vive. I've tested it myself :)

**Changes proposed:**
- Add HTC Vive to list of compatible platforms on the index page.
  Not really an issue but... Wouldn't it be better to rename the cursor component to reticle, and have a regular cursor component as well ?
 yeah, a regular cursor would be the mouse cursor when on desktop...

Or come to think of it... in VR you can have both a gaze reticle, and a virtual mouse cursor if someone makes a vr GUI element with a 'mouse' or for instance text area cursor..

renaming might indeed be cumbersome, but the longer you wait...
  As dependencies where update last time around release of 0.2.0 then it would be wise to check over and update these for 0.4.0 since only some got updated for 0.3.1. Since some dependency updates may fix some issues, introduce new issues and some dependencies currently used are about become deprecated (or have their dependencies which are about to become deprecated)!

  @rafaeleyng #1629 _merged to master_ 

```
// Setting it on element
<a-entity sound="src: url(river.mp3);"></a-entity>
// Using asset managment
<a-scene>
  <a-assets>
    <audio id="river" src="river.mp3">
  </a-assets>
  <a-entity sound="src: #river"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```
 @rafaeleyng since aframe depends on threejs and browsers limitation of the WebAudio API then most of it's behavior comes from there. You can't really compare images and audio since one is resource and other is buffer! So if you re enter the room then you see new request since request is made to reconnect the buffer. At this point there isn't cross browser way how to switch between cached audio buffer for audio element after it is initialized so therefore audio buffer is reloaded which is not a blocker since buffer does not download entire resource (as with images). So if you have audio file with 1 hour of sound track then your audio is not downloaded entirely but based on browser buffered some seconds ahead which is expected when you user might visit the scene only for few minutes. Difference between using aframe asset management or using audio source directly on element is that asset management will make sure that audio stream is ready to play as soon as scene is rendered while specifying src  on element  will first render the scene and then attends to buffer the audio.
 so therefore based on issue `How to use correctly assets management for audio?` I don't find that this issue should be reopened since it does not direct real issue and it is covered how to use that! If something is unclear bring your questions into [slack](https://aframevr.slack.com/messages)

A quick step by step for brand new users/beginners to get them started with A-frame.
 Yup.  Totally understand the endorsement aspect.  Just wanted to get something down for the total beginner when they are looking at the docs and then work from there.  Most important is to get this in the right place for new people in the funnel when they learn about A-frame, wherever that may be.    

Sounds like when you read it, it was longer than it ideally should be?
 Do you think there is a path for beginners to start now with A-frame or do they need to wait until the next version?
  When debugging the frame rate on an iOS device, if the frame rate is less than 30 the text is red against the pink background making it difficult to read. Can the background or the text colour be more contrasting?

 i second that.

now with the editor coming, maybe style it more like the editor gui ?

i may try something later this week...
 I know this is closed, but.. the red text is still unreadable.
 I opened a PR to try to solved this by highlighting red text with a white background to make it more visible & readable. Take a look at #1874!

Before:
![screen shot 2016-08-29 at 9 15 06 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7256178/18075899/ef7b9a26-6e2d-11e6-9ebe-ec6811f1f098.png)

After:

 Sure @ngokevin 

I played around with a few arrangements with text shadows and here's an approach I found:

Red text backed by a composite white text shadow (10 levels of shading)
![rstatcolorchange5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7256178/18115678/1f2afa3c-6ef6-11e6-9be5-19e894677ae1.gif)

Its similar to my original attempt with the white text background, but less agressive with shadowing where it needs to be. What do you think?
 Definitely! How's this @ngokevin ? Lowered the overall blur radius to 1/3 the size of the last example and kept about the same shadow density to maintain readability.

![rstatcolorchange7](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7256178/18138133/32cb99b0-6f60-11e6-8c08-33a49aa9b380.gif)

```
 Cool! I went ahead and opened a PR for this new solution in #1880 
 Revisiting this issue now that https://github.com/spite/rstats/pull/24 is merged in to rstats. Thoughts on how to proceed @ngokevin? :)
 Cool, just opened https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1885 for this!
  **srcChanged**
I had to update audio src which caused these warnings.
`THREE.Audio: .load has been deprecated. Please use THREE.AudioLoader.`

Although this is not big issue I came across another problem that I could not play previous audio again.
so changing `src` on same entity back to audio which was already played causes

```
The buffer passed to decodeAudioData contains an unknown content type.x
EncodingError: The given encoding is not supported.
```

This happens since Three. `THREE.XHRLoader.load` returns for already played audio cache which is instance of `ArrayBuffer`, but THREE.context.decodeAudioData expects instance of `AudioBuffer`

**Changes proposed:**
- use THREE.AudioLoader  instead of THREE.Audio.load 
- Do not let `Tree` to cache audio files
 @dmarcos  

> Can we maybe initialize this in the init method?

Yes, I added commit which initializes `AudioLoader` in the `init` method now.

> Why do we need to remove from cache the audio to play it again?

Consider following scene using current aframe.js and that you have some tracks like `1.mp3` and `2.mp3`

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no,user-scalable=no,minimal-ui">
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aframevr/aframe/master/dist/aframe.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<a-scene>
    <a-entity sound="src: 1.mp3; autoplay: true" position="0 1 0"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
</body>
</html>
```
-  As you load your scene track 1 will start playing
- Now modify DOM  audio src to `src: 2.mp3` and you'll hear second track
- When you modify DOM back to `src: 1.mp3` you get silence and following errors

```
The buffer passed to decodeAudioData contains an unknown content type.{url}
EncodingError: The given encoding is not supported.
```

If you now use following aframe.js which has this PR applied

``` html
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkungla/aframe/sound-AudioLoader-test/dist/aframe.js"></script>
```

So removing file from TREE.Cache removes these errors and you can shuffle the tracks without any problems. 

It seems to be problem with TREE.js Cache which passes ArrayBuffer to AudioLoader.decodeAudioData while last expects instance of AudioBuffer. I have opend issue at TREE as well about that and keep eye on where it goes. For now I find that using  `THREE.Cache.remove(data.src);` is securest way to ensure that aframe's audio src can modified, setting new sources and setting it also back to already played source.
 @ngokevin I'll go over all filed issues and collect some additional information before I file new issue about sound component what we talked about. Since this PR improves a lot compared to masters `if (srcChanged) { sound.load(data.src); }` and it self does not introduce new issues then I find that these other questions should handled separately.
  **Description:**

Docs for 'position' component state the following for the y axis: "Positive Y Axis extends down.".  I believe the positive Y axis actually points up, which would be the expected orientation for right-handed coordinates.

    @rafaeleyng hey I built an app very recently that did the exact same thing you are working on.  I know I ran into a simular issue though I can't remember exactly how I fixed it.  Do you have a repo I can look through your code to help you with the issue?

I think ultimately I had ended up doing 8 different sky's and preloading the assets on them then used show - hide to toggle which one you were in.  This ended up not leading to crashes though I never tried as high as 20 assets.

I also used curved-images as my navigation component and a combination of cardboard tap and look at mechanisms to trigger the scene change.  If your code is proprietary I may not be able to help look through and find an answer, but I remember when I kept changing the source on the same sky that I was having the "appearance" of a memory leak where the RAM continually got larger.  When I toggled between seperate sky's I hit a max roof that memory never got higher (around 250mb)
 @rafaeleyng Cool I'm at work at the moment I looked around the code but nothing jumped out at me.  I'll try to clone it down and run later.  But you might figure out the issue before then 😄.
 @rafaeleyng honestly I didn't like the solution either.  I was just on a deadline to get that walkthrough working by a certain day for the apartment complex that wanted it.  Because of that digging further into the why's behind this weren't an option.  

If you want to keep this issue open as you further deep dive the reason's I think that is very reasonable.  Hopefully I can get some time this afternoon to look into it myself now that I do have a bit more time to readdress the issue.

I'll probably instead of cloning yours just come up with the minimum example to show it and start deep diving the aframe source.

Good to hear you have it working well now though 😄 
Happy coding!
 @rafaeleyng no worries sorry we didn't get a more in depth solution to this. I know I had asked @ngokevin about this before but we never got to the bottom of it.  Maybe texture caching isn't working as expected.
  A spotlight entity doesn't orient itself with a lookat component.
 Looks like the threejs spotlight has a .target object by itself. That also explains why you can't set a spotlight's orientation.

Either the orientation and lookat components will have to take this into account ( which would nicely abstract this away from the user), or an additional component that sets this target is required.

Or maybe the light system can keep track of them.
 been playing a bit with a quick spottarget component... if the spotlight.target is added as a child of the light, and it's pos set to  0 0 -1 orientation works as expected ( with the spot pointed along it's -z axis)
 I've been having some of these same issues when using `SpotLight` from THREE, in general. There seems to be a lot of confusion and discussion about using targets and both @BenJenkinson and @WestLangley left comments detailing a history of these issues [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/7132#issuecomment-154400735) and [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/5870#issuecomment-69117498), respectively.

I don't know if that's going to be of any help, however.
 by adding the light.target to a given object, you get tracking for free :-)

I'm almost done with a component for (spot) light targets. Will have to check if it works for directional lights too, which also have a .target.
 I'll look into it. To have all the options you need a seperate component, but maybe the basics of it can be included in the light component yes.

Maybe tagetobject (selector) and a targetoffset, so you can also give a coordinate in worldpos (relative to scene if you don't specify an object.

And have it default to be added to the light itself, with an offset of (0 0 -1), so it looks down -Z  ? and regular rotation works

been a while i worked on that... will have to see if all that can be added to light component in a clear way

All that being said, there is also still [this issue](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1624)
 or scratch that... just being able to set the target object is sufficient. You can always create an a-entity , hook that up and set the world position or any offset with that.
 Works like a charm now: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1728
  the cone of a spot light seems to be a unit higher then it's origin :
http://www.frederickdesimpel.be/test/webVR/Aframe/spot-bug.jpg
 not sure if it is the spotlight itself that is in the wrong place or the editor's cone visualisation.
 Is this related to #1621?
 no this is just about the position of the object
 @fernandojsg i don't seem to have it around anymore... should be easy to recreate, it was just a spotlight and a sphere to check it's position...

can't seem to get into the editor anymore for the moment, so i can't recreate it now.
 @fernandojsg i have a scene that clearly shows the problem:

http://www.frederickdesimpel.be/test/webVR/Aframe/test11-spot-showbug-spotPos.html

the yellow line is from the light aframe element position, the white line is from the position of the light itself attached to the elements object3D. it is exactly one unit too high.
 Made a temporary fix [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1728#issuecomment-239141088). The functionality to the end user should be as expected. The real cause can be hunted upon later...

  **Description:**
I'm guessing this is an intentional feature, 
but it would be _great_ if there were a way to disable it or easily work around it.

The "Begin" property for animations is chained to the actual animation loop.
If Begin is set to "5000", and if the animation is set to loop indefinitely, 
there will be a 5000ms pause between each iteration of the loop.
## 

I think TweenJS addresses this. In addition to allowing "wait" time to be chained into a loop (essentially, the same as "begin"), TweenJS has the option to begin a looped animation "paused" and simply wait to fire it.

Is there a simple way to delay the start of a looped animation in AFrame _without_ incorporating that delay time into every iteration of the loop?

Thanks!

 > I think TweenJS addresses this.

Sadly, it does not.

> Is there a simple way to delay the start of a looped animation in AFrame without incorporating that delay time into every iteration of the loop?

Only if you write your own mechanism to replace what is currently used within [`a-animation`](https://github.com/msimpson/aframe/blob/d023bcb88cb5aa22a3d8af25eab591992dfeb0cd/src/core/a-animation.js#L142).

In general, this is a duplicate of #1401. And note: `delay` has been added instead of using `begin` as a delay (in master). Although, `delay` in this case would behave the same and a wait is incurred upon every loop. This is simply how tween.js is written.
 Ah, I didn't see #1401 when I searched. Sorry bout that. I appreciate the update though!
 Great!
I've been running setTimeouts to control certain animations as a workaround.
Not ideal.
  just wondering... since these are the same shortcuts... will this replace the browsers inspector? can' t we have both?

  I'm especially interested in controller events. That may need to be distinct from cursor/mouse events though. Oculus Touch controllers in unity include three types of events: [Button, Touch, and Near Touch](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/game-engines/latest/concepts/unity-ovrinput/#unity-ovrinput-usage-buttontouchneartouch). 

I would imagine those translating to:
- `gamepadbuttondown` / `gamepadbuttonup`
- `controller-touchstart` / `controller-touchstop`
- `controller-neartouchstart` / `controller-neartouchstop`

Little verbose but meh. The "Near Touch" events potentially come into play with physics, where you want to be able to push objects around but also 'grab' them with a button press. Grabbing is hard if the thing rolls away every time you make contact. :)
  This addition would close #1578

 You would still get full snapshot from tag related to release if you want to get snapshot of the repository. 
`$ git checkout tags/<tag_name>`
Isn't point of **release** something which is production ready, which this case is only `dist/*`

Other option would be to use [GitHub API Upload a release asset](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#upload-a-release-asset) which enables you to upload extra archives under release downloads like I uploaded, see example aframe-0.2.0-dist.zip at [Example Tag 0.2.0](https://github.com/mkungla/aframe/releases/tag/0.2.0).

Since you can upload release assets any given point then you could upload cleaner dist archives for also for actual 0.2.0 version.

```
curl -u <your-github-username> -XPOST -H "Content-Type:<archive-content-type>" --data-binary @<archive-name> "https://uploads.github.com/repos/aframevr/aframe/releases/<release-id>/assets?name=<archive-name>"
```
 @dmarcos Yes I do use browser files in cases where it is appropriate/required to use them and these cases I'm only interested on dist files and most annoying is to manually select dist and LICENSE when you really do not want to have other `src` files included your production env, almost all projects which can be used with browser files follow one of the patterns, for instance [twbs/bootstrap - releases](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) and [Facebook/react - releases](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases). Most use second method I described here, as you see there is `-dist` archive uploaded for each release. For instance there is also github account [components](https://github.com/components) which is creating dist packages out of popular repositories and started since many of these did not distribute clean archives by themselves, which is slowly changing these days and commonly one or other method is used. Up to date various packages from vendor space [components](https://github.com/components)) were downloaded a lot before original repos started to use cleaner distribution packages. End of the day it comes down to that if your library can be distributed as browser files then release archives should contain only production files and if your library should be used only with npm and bundled for production, then archives don't matter anyway. 
While my personal opinion is that since full snapshot of release can obtained from git tag or npm then archives could be really just distribution files, but if there is any possible argument why One could be interested to find in archive full snapshot then suggestion would be to use .gitattributes only to exlude same pattern like you ignore in  `.npmignore` for consistency and have a release post hook to upload third archive with only dist files, so:

```
# .gitignore
# Directories and files to ignore from release archives
examples export-ignore
tests export-ignore
.gitignor export-ignore
.gitattributes export-ignore
```
 Eventually .gitattributes should be present anyway, perhaps not only to discuss under this pull request what should release archive look like, but what should initial .gitatributes look like. In this case just give this pull request new title. Some suggestions would be then.

```
# .gitattributes
# Directories and files to ignore from release archives
examples export-ignore
tests export-ignore
.gitignor export-ignore
.gitattributes export-ignore

# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization
# JS files must always use LF for tools to work

```
 @dmarcos the extra zip is uploaded via GitHub API. My previous comment includes `CURL` example how to upload extra archives to releases, I also made example tag under my fork where you see third archive see `aframe-0.2.0-dist.zip`: [Example Tag 0.2.0](https://github.com/mkungla/aframe/releases/tag/0.2.0) which is uploaded via API not with .gitattributes. I also mentioned above that perhaps indeed just use this method to upload extra archive and use this PR just for initial .gitattributes for other purpose. Example contents above.
 `*-diff binary*` would keep your diffs clean
 @ngokevin 

> The one you posted, is all that does is just add EOF newlines?
- `* text=auto * eol=lf` will not only add correct line feeds if missing, but also corrects EOF if any of the files end with incorrect line feed so if contributors used editor inserts `CRLF` instead of `LF` then upon `git commit` git will show self explaining message: 

```
warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in aframe.js.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.
```

This is real life example since latest state of `master` branch `/dist/aframe.js` seems to have  `CRLF` line feed instead of `LF`. As we all know we are past of the age of _Carriage Return_ and should exclusively use `LF` instead.
- `binary`
  Would tell which files git should not attend to create text diffs. This will make your repo cleaner and eventually commit objects smaller. for instance `*.png diff=exif` option would let you actually compare diffs of images if really would need that.
- `-diff` just don't generate diff object for file or pattern

As conclusion of this PR for me it seems that #1578 should be detached from this PR and discuss whether to upload 3rd archive via GitHub API as release asset like React and others too or not. 
And use this PR just use for `.gitattributes`. Are you going to use it and if yes then initial contents can be commited to this PR. If you are certain that you will not use `.gitattributes` for any purpose then this PR can be closed.

 @ngokevin ready to go.
 Aight everything it is!
  Been trying to set rotation on a camera after it's been moved using setAttribute.  Every time I apply a value, be it a string ("0 0 0") or an object ({x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}), the value won't update or change.  Editing things like position work fine.  Rotation is the only one causing an issue

[Example](https://butt.githubusercontent.com/assets/2099658/16422311/8c0fb7c4-3d1d-11e6-9aca-d4bec1f1239f.png)

For reference, the HTML structure for Camera is:

```
<a-entity>
    <a-camera id="camera" position="0 1.75 2" rotation="0 0 0">
        <a-cursor color="#2E3A87"></a-cursor>

  Where do you see Oculus Touch and Daydream controllers fitting into these layers of abstraction? I see that `hand-controls` depends on `vive-controls`, wondering if those need to be more loosely coupled.

The component API (`<a-entity hand-controls="left"/>`) seems super clean though; presumably we can change the layers of abstraction later without breaking that.

EDIT: Maybe Daydream controllers would need to be separate components, since they're not 6dof.
 I was having trouble getting both Vive controllers working, but finally figured it out. Turns out the receiver for my wireless mouse was being detected as a gamepad and somehow kept taking the place of the second vive controller. Removing the receiver and restarting my computer solved the problem.

The tricky part was that [Tojiro's VR controller demo](https://toji.github.io/webvr-samples/XX-vr-controllers.html) and Steam VR detected both controllers without issue.

**edit:** Actually, I disconnected two receivers (one was for a mouse, the other for an Xbox One controller). I'm not sure which was causing the problem.
  I imported equirectangular photo correctly but its displaying a little wrong, i can't explain whats wrong exactly but you can see it on screenshot.

And here is how it looks on Ricoh THETA website: http://imgur.com/eqfCzaV

Theta360 uses three.js and WebGL too but their image looks better.
 Ok, i'll try that, it definitely looks like that is my problem. 
Thanks, will report what i found.
  There's some pretty detrimental bugs related to the version of threeJS that prevent proper material decoding of collada.

WebVR also doesn't work properly on the 0.2.0 release.
 Oh wow! That is soon. Thanks

  Shouldn't this repo use .gitattributes to have bit cleaner release archives?

**Possible contents could be:**

```
# Exclude git files and other files starting with .
.* export-ignore
# As in .npmignore
examples export-ignore
test export-ignore
```

> Besides these suggested above almost everything besides `dist` `LICENSE` and some essential files could be ignored, since that won't affect `npm` and usage of release archives becomes handy only when you want to use browser files in production. As in development you would never use release archives anyway!

 See [Example Tag 0.2.0](https://github.com/mkungla/aframe/releases/tag/0.2.0) release archives for example what release archives would contain. I can create a pull request as soon it's confirmed that only `dist/*`,`README.md`, `LICENSE` should be included in release archives.

 I think it'll be useful to allow users without a headset to swipe up and down to look up and down. Is there a way to enable that ?   as a developer, I like the idea of `link`,  as it feels a bit more intuitive  Very cool. It works in nighlty, nightly actually started working again
after today's oculus upgrade. I noticed that if I start in sunrise.html the
labels for the Oculus controllers overlap.

edit: similar to this BUT instead of hovering/waiting to load you can Tap/Click on them instead? https://aframe-gallery.glitch.me/  The ability to customize the UI of A-Frame would be nice, at the beginning maybe through `aframe.css`?
  **Description:** How To Load *.fbx
- A-Frame Version:0.2
- Platform/Device:chrome,firefox ie....

Thank You
 @HUKE1987 you'll probably want to convert it to another format, THREE.js support for `.fbx` is limited. You can do use a Blender to do this, or upload the model to Clara.io and export it as `.obj`, `.dae`, etc.
  **Description:**

I found that `fog: false` wasn't working with the following:

``` html
 <a-scene fog="type: linear; color: #AAB; far: 30; near: 0">
    <a-entity geometry="primitive: sphere; radius: 50" material="src: url(../_skies/greencubes.png); side: back; fog: false;"></a-entity>
 </a-scene>
```

However, `<a-sky>` plus `material="fog: false"` _was_ working, so I dug into the sky primitive [source](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/extras/primitives/primitives/a-sky.js), and found it was using `shader: flat`

So I added `shader: flat` to my entity, and everything works:

``` html
<a-scene fog="type: linear; color: #AAB; far: 30; near: 0">
    <a-entity geometry="primitive: sphere; radius: 50" material="src: url(../_skies/greencubes.png); shader: flat; side: back; fog: false;"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

I feel we should call this out in the [docs](https://aframe.io/docs/0.2.0/components/fog.html).

  **Description:**

Cursor events like enter/leave don't fire properly when another object is behind the targeted object. If the cursor leaves an edge of the object that "overlaps" another object, the leave event does not fire. If the cursor leaves an edge of the object that has nothing behind, the leave event fires properly. 

It seems like we need a way to make cursor/raycaster ignore certain objects. And/or the inverse: an option to ignore all by default. I'll upload a sample scene. In meantime, here's the markup.

 Here's a test scene: https://jcarpenter.github.io/aframe-bugs/cursor-20160620/index.html Roll over the green sphere and the white box to see what I mean.
 Correction: I'm on master.

I did some more digging into this, and discovered the same problem with cursor-mouseleave. I experimented with restricting raycaster to a single class of objects (`cursor raycaster="near: 0; far: 5; objects: .live"`), and it resolves the problem.
 Errr.. -almost- resolves the problem. Restricting raycaster `objects` to one class helps, but now I have several buttons side-by-side, and am hitting similar problems. It looks like `cursor-mouseleave` is global, not per object. If I move my cursor off an raycaster-active (?) object A, but another raycaster-active object B is behind it, intersecting with the ray, the `cursor-mouseleave` on object A does not fire.
  **Description:**

Am trying to setAttribute on an implicitly defined attribute of an element. All entities are automatically assigned a rotation attribute. I'm trying to edit it. Everything works if I manually define a rotation attribute, but things break if I don't. Here's a test case.

``` html

  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Transition Test 2</title>
    <script src="../_js/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <a-scene>

      <!-- Rotation not set -->
      <a-entity id="greenPlane" geometry="primitive: plane;" position="0 0 -2" material="color: green; side: double"></a-entity>

      <!-- Rotation set -->
      <a-entity id="yellowPlane" geometry="primitive: plane;" position="0 2 -2" material="color: orange; side: double" rotation="10 10 10"></a-entity>

    </a-scene>

    <script>

      var greenPlane = document.getElementById('greenPlane');
      console.log( greenPlane.getAttribute('rotation') ) // Returns blank
      console.log( greenPlane.getComputedAttribute('rotation') ) // Returns Object
      greenPlane.setAttribute('rotation','z', 30); // Fails. Object disappears.

      var yellowPlane = document.getElementById('yellowPlane');
      console.log( yellowPlane.getAttribute('rotation') ) // Returns Object
      console.log( yellowPlane.getComputedAttribute('rotation') ) // Returns Object
      yellowPlane.setAttribute('rotation','z', 30); // Works. Object rotates 30° on z axis.

  **Description:**
Repeat need not be an integer, like underlying threejs material:texture property.

**Changes proposed:**
Change repeat values to parse as float instead of int.
  **Description:**
Currently it seems only images and videos can be used as texture sources for entities.

This PR adds the ability to use a canvas as the texture source for an entity. It includes a less-than-graceful hack so that THREE.js treats the canvas as a video and handles the continuous update of it.

**Changes proposed:**
- adds loadCanvas to systems/material.js
- adds isCanvas to validateSrc in /utils/src-loader.js
- adds an example.

Kind regards,
Matt
 Hey up, I've made those changes. Would you prefer I collapse all changes to a single commit and force-push or is multiple commits OK? (BTW, cheers for the ace library!)
  **Description:**

Enables post scene rendering operations in aframe.

**Changes proposed:**

Extends a-scene element with a .renderTarget(to be set by a component/system on demand) to enable the rendering of the scene in a texture.
Adds a tock() method on components/systems where post scene rendering logic can be performed.
An example showcasing the functionality is included.

https://wizgrav.github.io/aframe-clubber/demo/
 @dmarcos implementing the final compositor as a system does away with the need for ordered execution of behaviors so this PR provides all that's needed for post processing. This setup is more proper since there can be only one compositor active. I also included the example as there is no need anymore for further PRs for ordering as discussed with @ngokevin . 

Ordered execution could be implemented with something complex like the graph approach or something as simple as using a boolean flag on components to switch between behaviors.unshift/push in a-scene's addBehavior, but that's now unrelated to post proc and can be decided at a later time
 VREffect additions submitted to three.js dev mrdoob/three.js#9172
 @dmarcos Yeah that was very responsive and kind of them actually. I'll include the latest VREffect from three/dev in this PR. Also, a guy from the slack channel asked me and so I've also made another example. The approach taken on that, while not as efficient as I'd like, is more akin to the effect composer from three.js. Post effect components are very easy to write as they're just wrappers over the various three shaders. They just provide a shaderMaterial to the compositor system for blending to screen and a namespace to update uniforms. Should I include that as well? 

http://wizgrav.github.io/aframe/examples/test/post-processing-grain/
 @fernandojsg I've updated the compositor to use VREffect instead of the vanilla WebGLRenderer for outputting to screen, can you check the examples now? Unfortunately I don't have an hmd available currently. I hacked a bit on webvr-polyfill and vr-mode-ui to enable vr on desktop and got an image that looked proper but failed to make the view rotate. I'll check on a mobile later on

UPDATE: I have the suspicion that vrHMD.submitFrame(); in VREffect is the culprit here
 @fernandojsg I patched VREffect for hmd frame submission to be performed manually. I haven't updated this PR with the changes, which will also have to be propagated to three.js. Please check the live examples to see if it fixes the issue.

http://wizgrav.github.io/aframe/examples/test/post-processing/
http://wizgrav.github.io/aframe/examples/test/post-processing-grain/
 @fernandojsg I think the issue with the single eye rendering was that the renderer's viewport was left on the second half of the frame in VREffect.render(). I've now updated the live examples to deal with this as well. Does firefox still use the pre-1.0 webvr api? In that case it would not trigger the issue with the frame submission. Chromium on the other hand does, are you certain that the chromium build can't playback videos? In any case I'll make another example without video when I get back home in the afternoon
 Ok at least we're getting somewhere, this seems like a size mismatch between renderer and renderTarget at some point in the pipeline(probably due to the dpr handling). We can debug it further later when I get back from work, if you're available on slack
 The last commit adds several stuff in VREffect, notably the ability to manually submit the canvas to the hmd and also graceful access to the hmd.requestAnimationFrame to take advantage of the higher fps. An alternative approach would be a single method to get the hmd object back and call the methods on that directly but having VREffect handle the functionality seems more natural. The autoSubmit flag will be necessary in any case. The frame has to be submitted to the hmd after post proc has finished, as it is right now it writes the scene into the texture and immediately submits the canvas without any data in it.

Render target size setting is done more tightly now, I'd appreciate some feedback from people with hmds to see how it actually works (I don't currently have access to one)
 @ngokevin the compositor is better implemented as a system. This is more in line with existing component sets like @donmccurdy physics. Besides being more logically correct as there can be only one compositor in the scene, It also aleviates the need for ordered execution for post processing.

I also thought that we could get away with a two liner for having a minimum of ordering guarantees. Something like defining an "important" boolean flag on components that would switch between unshift() and push() to the behaviors.tick/tock arrays in a-scene.addBehavior. This would at least provide us with the level of flexibility unity has with its LateUpdate() and with minimal code impact. Or we could go to the more flexible but also complex graph based approach. Post processing doesn't currently need any of these approaches though, it can work as it is using the component/system combo.

Right now I'm extending VREffect for submission to three.js. There are several things needed in there to actually work in hmds. Some changes will be needed in a-scene as well, most notably tapping the .requestAnimationFrame on the hmd instead of the window to enable the higher fps on the headsets. So I think we'll have to first see if/what they accept before carrying on
 Added update() for systems to allow dynamic reconfiguration of the compositor. Took out the example for now, you can check out one with the current dist here http://wizgrav.github.io/aframe/examples/test/post-processing/ 
 @fernandojsg  @ngokevin  should a simple example be included in this PR as well? 
 @fernandojsg Was wondering if it might be faster to review if we unbundle the post processing effects - with each PR having its own effect.  Bloom, film grain, technicolor etc - kind of like http://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/#shader-glow  
 @AnnCaryn that won't be necessary, the effects themselves are not included in the PR, just the core functionality to enable them. The examples posted in this thread are not included either, they just reside on my gh-pages for reference. Components providing the various effects will be provided by third parties after the core is enabled
 @fernandojsg have in mind this pull request as well https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/9848 this will be needed for some effects that need per eye calculations, like godrays which need to calc the 2D sun position from the camera matrix. There is no easy way around it with the latest WebVR spec because these matrices will come directly from vrDisplay. I think it does not pose a problem with this PR as some solution will have to be included in VREffect anyway and that will trickle back into AFrame. The comments in that pull request are interesting though as VREffect seems to be on the way to becoming redundant in future three.js releases. Some thought should be put in that prospect so it doesn't catch us off guard
 @ngokevin @dmarcos @fernandojsg rebased the PR. A minor check was added to VREffect. This was needed to pass test "a-scene (with renderer)". a-scene calls somewhere VREffect.cancelAnimationFrame which in turn tries to call the non existent vrDisplay.cancelAnimationFrame. I suspect this is an issue with webvr-polyfill and should go away with an update of that. In the meantime the check is really minor and won't affect anything else
 @cvan I'm dying for post processing support personally and would love to see this get merged soon @ngokevin  @wizgrav  @johnnyshankman in the meantime you can easily put in some postproc by overriding scene.render() check an example here https://github.com/wizgrav/copernicus/blob/master/src/main.js line 230 is where it's done @ngokevin I can rebase the PR to the current master in the w/e if everyone's ok with the functionality @wizgrav ~Can't get your approach from copernicus to work in a personal project.~ See update.

Anyways, yes I'm super happy with this PR and I'll be following along to see where this goes. Thank you @wizgrav and @ngokevin!

**Update:** _Got it to work! Thank you!_ @wizgrav @ngokevin I got a little antsy and rebased this branch locally with aframe's current master. Additionally, I made that one fix with `layer.leftBounds.length`. After those two things this branch runs really well 👍 

I don't have push rights to wiz's fork of aframe so I can't push my rebased+modified branch to his `tock` branch myself unfortunately but I do have the code. @ngokevin @johnnyshankman I don't know why the null/undefined issue happens so I set the test against a generic false value, I don't expect any sideffects from that @dmarcos I'm not sure I understand. You mean keeping the tock infrastructure in but not actually calling it in render()? @dmarcos I understand why you want to keep something so core as simple and generic as possible, I'm thinking more from a convenience standpoint. The video recording is a good example

Maybe we could add a boolean property to the component, to denote that it shouldn't execute when the renderTarget is not enabled for the current frame. Then the "postprocessing" attribute check would just toggle the renderTarget on/off. What do you think of this scheme? 

I insist on landing this because I feel that this feature has been discussed for a way long time (in my sense of time) it's been a year and I'd prefer to come up with a solution in this PR so the feature lands, it will give the projects coming out using the framework, a big increase in quality.  The scene.renderTarget setting could also be done by the final compositor system itself utilizing both tick and tock. It sounds ok @dmarcos removed renderTarget handling from scene, that can now be set by a component/system, example here https://wizgrav.github.io/aframe-clubber/demo/

One minor thing I found was that system update is not called when changing attributes from the dom inspector, only with setAttribute(). I used to override setEntityAttribute to do that but took it out cause it caused a test to fail. This is unrelated to tock though and could be fixed in another PR. @dmarcos rebased and also proposed mrdoob/three.js#9848 to threejs. It's as minimal as it can be and If accepted, it will solve all issues concerning post processing in VR(proper godrays and such). @dmarcos ~~just saw that ArrayCamera has landed in three dev and that is indeed the best way to handle it, so I'll wait for when AFrame utilizes WebVRCamera to get the twin projection matrices after the scene renders. In the meantime tock is ready and sufficient for most effects as we are now~~ I think we're ok as we are now even for view dependant effects. ArrayCamera will give a nice boost though so I'm looking forward to it @dmarcos yes I made the checks for layer.leftBounds and layer.rightBounds less strict as  @johnnyshankman reported that they were undefined instead of null which the original code checked against. I hadn't experienced that myself tbh so I can take it out and if encountered again we can open a new issue. Though I don't expect side effects even if we leave it in @dmarcos reverted VREffect. Also updated the tock related tests  **Description:**
The shader component refuses to animate. 

For example:

``` html
<a-sky color="#73F7DD" shader="standard">
<a-animation attribute="shader" begin="2000" from="standard" to="noise"></a-animation>
</a-sky>
```

When I run that, at 2000ms, nothing changes.

I've tried animating `attribute="material"` as well, with no luck.

I can animate other sky components, 
and each individual shader works fine as a sky component, 
but the shader type won't animate.

As a work-around, I can make a second sky entity with a different shader type and animate the visibility settings of each sky entity. However, I'm not sure if the invisible shader is costing GPU. 

Let me know if I'm missing something obvious here--I'm relatively new to A-Frame.

 @ngokevin thanks for the suggestion, and I think you're right about a delay-set component.

However, I can't seem to implement the one you suggested. 
Tweaked a minor comma issue or two, but still no luck.
Tried using it on other components, which also didn't work.
I assume it's a minor error in the script somewhere? 

FYI: The component script is in the body of the page, above the a-scene.
(I registered another custom component in that area and it worked fine, 
I assume that's a reasonable way to do it.)

I super appreciate your help on this, by the way.

Here's what the code looks like currently:

``` html
<script>
AFRAME.registerComponent('delay-set', {
  schema: {
    component: {type: 'string'},
    delay: {default: 3000},
    property: {type: 'string'},
    value: {type: 'string'}
  },

  init: function () {
    var data = this.data;
    var el = this.el;

    setTimeout( function () {
      el.setAttribute(data.attribute, data.property, data.value);    
     }, data.delay);
  }
})
</script>
```

``` html
<a-sky color="#73F7DD" delay-set="component: material; property: shader; value: noise"></a-sky> 
```
 SWEET!

Now we're in business....
  **Description:**
just curious about when tablets like Nexus 7 will be supported for VR mode.
currently, there is misalignment between the split screens. I'm assuming bc its not supported yet.
- A-Frame Version: 0.2.0
- Platform/Device:
  Nexus 7 - Android 6.0.1
 I have the Dive 7 using with Nexus 7. 
In VR mode, i see double. Can't seem to get it aligned. Ive tested with other VR sites and they work. 
Just wanna confirm that this is something related to the framework. 
 +1 On Nexus 7, en Chrome I see not only the Vr Mode but also I'm not able to move using gyroscope :(
I have a patch to detect Tablet, but is not enough for using the gyroscope, any Ideas? Actually this happens on a Nexus 9 too. http://codepen.io/tinchoforever/pen/ZLyEbj  This on a tablet (nexus 7 or 9) or Ipad should be 1) Enabling by default devicemotion camera 2) on vr mode, go full screen. On Aframe 2.0, 1) works and 2) says your device doesn't support webvr mode.  I have been checking Google WebVr Poly and it works there perfectly. My guess is that this is something inside how Aframe decides to use VR Mode and Gyroscope Control of the Camera by default. And here with Aframe 2 
http://codepen.io/tinchoforever/pen/ggROwL Aframe 4
![aframe-4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/719504/22203403/acb54944-e14b-11e6-81d3-f91fe1efd0aa.gif)

 In Aframe 4, I'm only enable to move the camera using touch but no movement. The expected behavior should be
1) Vr Mode should go to full screen on tablets.
2) Moving camera with Device Motion should be default on tablets too. I've opened a proper ticket for this. 
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2309  `getComputedAttribute` returns the same thing as `getAttribute` when called from a system `init` method.  

Reason for this behavior is `a-entity.getComputedAttribute` only applies mixins and defaults if the attribute is a component.  It checks if the attribute is a component via `this.components`, and the components haven't been attached yet when system `init()` is run.  

Or maybe this is intended behavior, and the workaround is to not rely on schema defaults when accessing a component via a system?
  Pressing the escape key while not in VR throws an exception; no user-facing effect, but it is frustrating while debugging with _Pause on Exceptions_ enabled.

  Hi, 
After the update of the Android version on my device the videosphere stopped working on my project but also i doesn't work on your examples that are online. When I enter I see the screen black (I have the play button so that it starts when I click on my demo so it's not the autoplay). It worked ok before the update.
- A-Frame Version: The latest version (06-14-2016)
- Platform/Device: I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus and I had Android 5.1 until last Thursday that I received an OTA update with Android 6.0.1 (now I have Chrome version 51.0.2704.81, I don't know which version had before). 
 Hello @KevinGrandon @fernandojsg @almossawi @ngok in my understanding this is a major issue as none of the devices we tested worked. 

I'm mentioning you because I get no response and I saw my issue disappear from the listed issues.

Are you working on a fix for this or i should look for another option?

Thanks in advanced!! 
 I took a quick look and found that the wakelock request is throwing `DOMException: play() can only be initiated by a user gesture` on my Android phone using Chrome 51.0.2704.81 and Android 5.0.2. This leads me to believe there may be a regression somewhere regarding the EnterVR mechanism. Like an event hand-off resulting in a new call stack containing the `play` call, instead.
 @dmarcos The need for a user gesture to initiate video playback is understood, but not the problem. The issue is that such a common error could result due to the original callstack from said gesture being lost due to an event handoff, `enterVR` in this case. That handoff is asynchronous and therefore spawns a separate callstack which then initiates a wakelock request. That request then attempts to play a video, but fails as its callstack didn't originate from a user gesture but a custom event. That's my concern.
 Not sure if this has been addressed but Im running into the same issue. I have multiple videos that I am trying to move though in a "choose your own story" style experience. It only happens after the first video. I can use the scene loaded event to play the first video-sphere, but every subsequent video is hindered by this limitation. Working as expected on a Galaxy Note 4 on Android 4.4 with Chrome 54, but not on a Galaxy 6 running Android 6 and Chrome 54 as well. 

Its almost amusing to me that Android originally allowed this functionality while Apple didnt and now they have complete swapped stances as the iOS 10 allows gesture-less media playback. 

edit:
I am starting my videos from a beacon thats being selected by a fuse on the cursor. Shouldn't that be considered a user gesture as the user has to focus on the beacon I have set up as my "play" and then I am calling the play from the click event? What is the difference between a fuse click and a touch click? 
 I'm still having the same issue in Chrome / Android 6.0 / aframe 0.50 nearly a year after this issue was first reported. Any updates on this? I'd love it if someone could point me to a workaround at the very least.  I can't even get the [official sample](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/videosphere/) to work correctly. 

In my code, I can get the video playing if I force a user-initiated click before putting the scene in VR-mode, but then the video freezes when I enter VR-mode - as documented in #1345. @dmarcos - Sorry, I should have included that info. A Samsung Note 5, recently updated to Marshmallow.  @timmhayes does this one work for you? https://fuleinist.github.io/aframe-360-video/ In Chrome on the Note 5 I see nothing but black - no video. But it plays as expected on Firefox. I see the image straight off, but since the video does not appear to have any motion I can't tell if it is actually playing. I replaced your codepen video with the [one from the A-Frame 360 video example](https://ucarecdn.com/bcece0a8-86ce-460e-856b-40dac4875f15/) and it did not work, however I think there may be an issue with that video. It seems to have the correct mime type, but will not play directly in Chrome (using Android & Windows) - it downloads instead. I think that might be the cause of some of my issues.

The video in this fork works as expected in Android Chrome, in that the click listener successfully starts the video:
https://codepen.io/callmetimm/pen/awNovw Nope, not when I specify a `<source/> ` element with proper mime type as seen [here](https://codepen.io/callmetimm/pen/RgaWjW). But like I said, it looks like the mime type is being served.

I looked more into it. The a-frame video is being served with the following header: `content-disposition:attachment; filename=city-4096-mp4-30fps-x264-ffmpeg.mp4`. This is causing the download issue. I guess that I had the same issue. It took over a day to find the root cause. [This](https://github.com/vire-co/aframe/blob/video-wakelock-fix/vire.md) is what I have documented about the fix:

> The `webvr-polyfill` version `dmarcos/webvr-polyfill#a02a8089b` used
in aframe `0.5.0` is an old version that causes a weird issue on some
mobile devices (like the Samsung Galaxy S6). These devices stop
playing mp4 videos, which are used as textures ('a-video' or
'a-videosphere') as soon as the VR mode is active. After the issue
appears it is often not possible to play any mp4 videos anymore until
the device is restarted. The `webvr-polyfill` contains a so-called
wakelock that keeps the mobile device awake, when it is not receiving
any touch events (when it is in a cardboard for example). This
wakelook uses a video to do the trick. My guess is that the browser don't
let the device fell asleep, when some video is playing. However the
old version of the `webvr-polyfill` contains some mp4 video data (as
base64) for the wakelock, that causes the problem on some mobile
devices as described above.
>
> The first attempt to solve the issue was to replace the video data in
`vendor/wakelock/wakelock.js` with the mp4 data from a recent
`webvr-polyfill` version (`0.9.34`). But the aframe build process
doesn't seem to do something with `vendor` folder.
>
> Therefore the version of the "webvr-polyfill" was switched to
"^0.9.34" in the `package.json` (same version that is currently used
by the aframe master). This second attempt fixed the problem.

You find the changes for the fix here: https://github.com/vire-co/aframe/tree/video-wakelock-fix

I also released a custom aframe build of the `0.5.0` version, if you like to try out if the fix helps in your case: https://www.npmjs.com/package/maxweber.vire.aframe I've just tested it, the issue does not appear with the master branch. Most likely because the master branch is also using a recent webvr-polyfill version (0.9.34).  **Description:**

 I'm going to go out on a limb and assume you're attempting to steam an MP4. In which case, an MP4 will not stream unless it has been configured for fast-start:

> In order to play MP4 files while they are still downloading ... you'll need to move the so called 'MOOV' atom to the beginning of the file.
> 
> The MOOV atom is in essence a block of data, containing an index of the rest of the file. Most authoring tools will place this data on the end of the file, because the size of the block will have to change dynamically as changes are made to the video. If the atom was right at the beginning, the entire file would have to be rewritten for a lot of smaller changes.

You can accomplish this using FFmpeg or qt-faststart, see:

  Two of the pages in the 0.2.0 docs are wrongly formatted. They have been fixed on the master branch. Github won't let me change them when I'm looking at the 0.2.0 tag, because I'm not on a branch. If someone points me in the right direction, I'm happy to fix it.

- A-Frame Version: 0.2.0
  I tried to play with the [Composite Example](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/composite/) in the project and found that texture quality is different between the v0.2.0 release version and master branch when in VR Mode on Mobile, both iOS and Android.

In release/v0.2.0, the texture quality is fine and working properly in VR Mode on Mobile.
In master branch, the texture quality is downgraded and all images are blur in VR Mode on Mobile.

I made two html pages which have the same source code but includes the two different versions of Aframe framework.

  Question related to #1338, I follow that BufferGeometry is more efficient than standard Geometry, but, why is creating a BoxGeometry first and converting it to BufferGeometry better than just creating a BoxBufferGeometry? Are the _____BufferGeometry subclasses less efficient than BufferGeometry?

Physics for aframe-extras have broken against aframe/master – [I construct CANNON.Shape instances by looking at the THREE.js geometry](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/lib/CANNON-mesh2shape.js#L29-L50) type. ____BufferGeometry is useable, but there's not much to go on with plain BufferGeometry instances. 
 If BufferGeometry really is preferable, we could work around this by preserving the original `geometry.parameters` values (geometry type, cylinder radius, etc.) in the new geometry's `userData`.

  <!-- script_that_appends_elements_to_scene.js -->
</body>
```

[Example here](https://sandbox.donmccurdy.com/vr/platforms/). In that case, I use the syntax, `el.setAttribute('position', v.x + ' ' + v.y + ' ' + v.z);`. Not sure why I had to do that, I was wondering if it was because the element hadn't been appended to the scene yet, or because the DOM hadn't finished loading.
 Thanks guys for the quick reaction!!

It appears it did work, but I was initializing images at the origin (so I was not able to see them directly), and the mistake came from the fact that the DOM inspector doesn't show the position anymore, as you can see here.
The project's code is here if you wanna check: https://github.com/tbalouet/tumbvr

 I'm having this exact same issue, tried everything suggested and in aframe 0.3.0 from (https://aframe.io/releases/0.3.0/aframe.min.js) will not work. When I switch to a version back (https://aframe.io/releases/0.2.0/aframe.min.js) it works. 

Tried both techniques for set attribute
 Hey, I am facing this issue in 0.8.0. My 
`<a-sphere id="ball" position="-1 0.59 -4"></a-sphere>`
already exists in the `<body>`. On click of this ball, I want it's position to change to, say -3 0.59 -3. I tried 
`document.getElementById("ball").setAttribute('position', '-3 0.59 -3')`  `document.getElementById("ball").setAttribute('position', {x:-3, y:0.59, z:-3})` `document.getElementById("ball").object3D.position.set('-3 0.59 -3')` 
but none of them seem to work. @namrathasubramanya perhaps the [event-set](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/event-set/) component could help?

Also, try [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aframe) for questions.  Both `animationstart` and `animationend` are essentially useless without a proxy component to dive into the event data. You simply cannot employ either of these events in a sane manner from the `begin` or `name` properties of the `<a-animation>` or `<a-event>` elements, respectfully.

Therefore, I propose adding an `on-end` and `on-complete` to the `<a-animation>` element. The `on-complete` property specify one or more event names which emit using the same logic as `animationend`. While `on-end` would specify on or more event names which emit `onStop` of the internal `Tween`, only; covering those animations which ended abruptly via the new `end` property of the `<a-animation>` element.

If this is agreeable, I can craft a PR.
 Okay. I'll try to attack the problem from that direction, instead. Maybe an `<a-event-proxy>` element could be of help, here.
 @ngokevin FYI, this is what I'm using now:

```
  document.registerElement('a-event-proxy', {
    prototype: Object.create(AFRAME.ANode.prototype, {
      attachedCallback: {
        value: function() {
          this.el = this.parentNode;
          this.el.addEventListener(this.getAttribute('name'), this.handler.bind(this));
        }
      },

      handler: {
        value: function(event) {
          var conditions = this.getAttribute('matches');
          if (conditions) conditions = AFRAME.utils.styleParser.parse(conditions);
          for (key in conditions) 
            if (event.detail.target.getAttribute(key) === conditions[key])
              this.emit(this.getAttribute('emit'));
        }
      },

      detachedCallback: {
        value: function() {
          this.el.removeEventListener(this.getAttribute('name'), this.handler);
        }
      }
    })
  });
```

```
<a-animation begin="fade-out" attribute="material.opacity" from="1" to="0" dur="2000"></a-animation>
<a-animation begin="fade-in"  attribute="material.opacity" from="0" to="1" dur="100"></a-animation>
<a-event-proxy name="animationend" matches="begin: fade-out" emit="fade-in"></a-event-proxy>
```
 Can you place a components on `<a-animation>` elements? If so, that would be perfect in this case.
 Okay. I'll give that a go, instead.

experiment with webcomponents-lite polyfill,

 The [webcomponentsjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webcomponentsjs) seems no star and no fork on github https://github.com/dlmma/webcomponentsjs , seems not reliable.

The patch is changed to use `webcomponents.js/webcomponents-lite.js` instead of outdated `webcomponents-lite` npm. The possible approach is build a customized version from https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs that only include the custom element polyfil.

Though with current https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs version, it failed A-Frame auto tests (but seems work well on examples by manual test). 

Might need help to identify what's the issue around the polyfill.
 @gasolin @ngokevin I am not 100% sure of the coverage of the WebReflection polyfill at this point (it has been a while), but I can assure you that the WebComponentsJS polyfill strives to be as accurate as humanly possible, and is relied upon my millions of web pages.

May I ask why you are seeking another polyfill besides the most widely used?
 FYI: X-Tag uses the webcomponentsls-lite build of the polyfill for our Core lib, so I know that one works well in prod.

I am trying to upload assets using the asset uploader but getting failure. 

Just says, "Can't Upload"

What am i doing wrong?

If someone wants to utilize A-Frame and will need to have on-going assets uploaded, what is the best option to do this? I would like to just upload them to my Amazon S3 and then have A-Frame look at them as the src for when using for example <a-sky> tag, but seems to produce CORS issue. 
 Nevermind I got it working! 
 I was unable to get the asset uploader to work.... I ended up uploading my panorama images to Amazon S3 and was able to use them as the src and this worked fine. 
  I gave it a once-over, the rest looks good.
  A few geometries which were left out.
  I'm wondering, have you tried transcluding (composing) scenes together by using ShadowDOM and the `<content>` (or the new `<slot>` in WebKit) element? If so, did it work, and how did you handle those cases?

Because, for example, I'm supposing that you are relying on `attached/detachedCallback` in order to construct an equivalent behind-the-scenes scene graph in Three.js. I am doing the same thing (constructing a virtual scene graph from custom elements, but in my case the graph is not made with Three.js) over at http://infamous.io.

The problem that I face is that when I try to transclude things into shadow DOM that everything just falls apart. It seems like the root elements (in my case, `<motor-scene>`, in your case `<a-scene>`) may need to keep it's own shadow DOM and have absolutely no nested shadow DOM, and that the user-land HTML, which may or may not contain nested shadow DOMs, needs to be able to work completely independently of the behind-the-scene tree structure, and that we'll need a way to traverse the user-land nested shadow DOMs in order to gleen the structure that we need to create (for example, to render with Three.js, etc), and then we need to construct that actual structure in our shadow DOM (if we intend to have elements in the dev tool for inspectability).

In your case, you are considering only WebGL. My case is more tricky: rendering to DOM (CSS 3D) is a required ability, and that DOM will be mixed with WebGL like what Famous was making (but has abandoned) over at http://famous.org.

TLDR: I am wondering if you guys have thought about transclusion in webcomponents (shadow DOM) and how you're dealing (or will deal) with it.

To get more of a sense of my problem, I also asked a [similar question](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/504) over at w3c/webcomponents.
 @dmarcos 

> AFRAME only uses the custom elements API
> how does your approach work across different browsers with no shadow dom implementation?

Same here, it works fine when we ignore shadow DOM (f.e. in browsers that don't have that).

My custom elements also do not use Shadow DOM, but the concern I express here is a little different: What if users want to use their own shadow DOM then they transclude our custom elements?

For example, suppose an end user writes this:

``` html
<!-- This is "light DOM" -->
<div id="scene-container">
    <a-sphere ...></a-sphere>
</div>
```

and then that user procedes to add a shadow DOM to the scene-container:

``` js
const el = document.querySelector('#scene-container')
const shadowRoot = el.createShadowRoot()
shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
    <!-- This is "shadow DOM" -->
    <a-scene>
        <content selector="a-sphere">
        </content>
    </a-scene>
`
```

This isn't a very good example, but shows the problem. What will happen is that the `<a-sphere>` element will be transcluded (placed) into the inert `<content>` element of the shadow DOM. The result is

``` html
  <!-- shadow DOM -->
    <a-scene>
        <content selector="a-sphere">
            <a-sphere ...></a-sphere>
        </content>
    </a-scene>
```

which results in the behind-the-scenes "flat DOM" (the thing the browser actually renders):

``` html
  <!-- flat DOM -->
    <a-scene>
            <a-sphere ...></a-sphere>
    </a-scene>
```

That's what I'm wondering about, if you guys have considered what would happen when a user writes HTML like that.
 @dmarcos Here's a better example. Suppose I want to make a layout component (using Custom Elements) that will accept AFrame elements and transclude them into the layout, where the layout's root element is an `<a-scene>`. Following is basic layout component (this better shows why one would use Shadow DOM as have above, in the context of a custom element component). Imagine that this simple component's goal is to use A-Frame in order to build a UI that has a header, footer, sidebar, and content area:

``` js
// awesome-layout.js
import 'aframe' // registers all the <a-*> elements

export default
document.registerElement('awesome-layout', class AwesomeLayout extends HTMLElement {
    createdCallback() {

        // give the component a shadow root, so we can transclude things into our component (similar to React).
        this.shadowRoot = this.createShadowRoot()

        // this is the content of our shadow root (similar to the render() method of a React component).
        this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
            <div class="scene-container">
                <a-scene>
                    <a-entity position="...">
                        <content selector="[header]">
                        </content>
                    </a-entity>
                    <a-entity position="...">
                        <content selector="[sidebar]">
                        </content>
                    </a-entity>
                    <a-entity position="...">
                        <content selector="[content]">
                        </content>
                    </a-entity>
                    <a-entity position="...">
                        <content selector="[footer]">
                        </content>
                    </a-entity>
                </a-scene>
            </div>
        `
    }
})
```

Now, this component can be imported and then used in a new component (we'll use React in this example) that will define the pieces that go in the header, sidebar, content, and footer areas of the layout:

``` jsx
import './awesome-layout' // registers the <awesome-layout> element
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

// render <awesome-layout> into the body of the page:
ReactDOM.render(
    <awesome-layout>
        <a-image header ...></a-image>
        <a-plane footer ...></a-plane>
        <a-plane sidebar ...></a-plane>
        <a-plane content ...></a-plane>
    </awesome-layout>,
    document.body
)
```

This is a contrived example, but you can get the gist of the concept: we've rendered an `<awesome-layout>` element, and in it we have placed four items that will get transcluded (placed) into the ShadowDOM of the `awesome-layout`. As you will be able to guess, the `a-plane` and `a-image` elements will be moved into the corresponding `a-entity` elements of the `awesome-layout` component. Keep in mind that when calling `parentNode` on one of the transcluded elements after is has been transcluded will result in a reference to the `<content>` element, not the `<a-entity>` elements. So it seems that for a ShadowDOM-compatible solution to exist, the fact that `parentNode` may be a `<content>` element and not a `<a-*>` element has to be taken into consideration (same with the upcoming `<slot>` elements).

We can also note that it makes sense for the `a-plane` or `a-image` elements to be transcluded into the `a-entity` elements, but it may not make so much sense for them to be transcluded into any other type of elements.

So, that's basically the idea I'm working with, how to handle transclusion so that the custom elements still work and so that a behind-the-scenes scene graph can be constructed properly (in your case with Three.js, in my case with a custom implementation).

Cheers! :]
 (Also note, in the current state of things, `<content>` elements from ShadowDOM v0 are being replaced by `<slot>` elements in ShadowDOM v1, and the `<content>` element selector doesn't seem to work in Chrome, but you can reproduce the issue by not using a selector and having only a single `<content>` element, in which case all the element outside of the shadow root will get transcluded into the single `<content>` element.)

There's also the issue of end users possibly appending new elements into the `awesome-layout`, in which case I believe some extra logic is currently needed in order to place those into the ShadowDOM. I believe this might be fixed with slots in v1 though.

> @trusktr how does your approach work across different browsers with no shadow dom implementation?

I'm planning to use polyfills for now, but I think by the time my library is ready (when it has it's first docs up and demos) then by that time all browsers might already support ShadowDOM natively.

On another note, I believe I have a solution to the problem (which your shadow-dom-using users will eventually run into), but I haven't implemented it yet. [The solution](https://github.com/infamous/infamous/issues/40) is not too difficult of a change to make with regards to my library, which I'll do soon...
 Wait, nevermind, that solution only covers cases where children are invalid, but if a `<motor-node>` child is attached to somewhere other than a `<motor-node>` or `<motor-scene>` then there's no way for the child to know the problem when distributed into a closed Shadow tree.

There has to be some other thing I can do to complete the solution, as parent-to-child observation only solve half of the problem when the parent is indeed one of my elements.
 @dmarcos @ngokevin Here's two jsfiddles that illustrate the problem.

This first example is basic, and works: https://jsfiddle.net/trusktr/1ecfha5h

In this second example, we are using ShadowDOM in a very simple way, and the example fails to work: https://jsfiddle.net/trusktr/1ecfha5h/1

I believe it's important for the A-Frame elements to work with ShadowDOM because ShadowDOM is (currently) an important part of the future of components in the web.

I'm beginning to tackle this in my own lib; I'll report back on how I solve it.
 Hey guys, the way I solve ShadowDOM in `infamous` is actually super easy. I am using MutationObserver to detect changes in children. Then, f.e., if a child is added to a node, and the parent also has a shadow root, then in my JavaScript scene graph I simply add the child to the parent as normal (just like you do) but then I also put something like a `isDistributed` flag to true on the child if it matches the selector (v0) or slot name (v1) in the shadow root. 

In parents with shadow roots, I add a `shadowChildren` collection to them which contains the top level elements in the shadow root. It is easy to update this list using a MutationObserver on the parent's active shadow root (in v1 ShadowDOM there can only be one shadow root).

It is just some book keeping.

When traversing the scene graph for rendering, you normally traverse to children. However, you simply traverse to `shadowChildren` if you see that a parent node has a root.

With some event tracking on the `slot` elements, you can then keep track of where a node got distributed too. So when you get to a node with a slot, you will have book-kept which nodes are `distributedChildren` for example.

What you end up with (using my method) is the same tree with parents and children which mirrors what you see in the "light DOM", and then you also have these extra collections representing the composed tree.

When creating world transforms, you would do those based on the composed tree that you traverse.

> We want AFRAME to reach the largest possible browser base without much performance hit and minimum bloat in the code base. We keep en eye on the shadow DOM but we have not played with it in the context of AFRAME but we are defintively interested. @trusktr how does your approach work across different browsers with no shadow dom implementation?

In browsers with no ShadowDOM, not to worry. People don't have to use ShadowDOM in those browsers, or they can supply their own polyfills if they do.

The thing is, you wouldn't be forcing people to use shadow Dom, you would only be compatible with it for users that have those browsers, otherwise A-Frame would continue to work just like before. It entirely an opt-in feature for users that have compatible browsers.

If you search for "shadow root" or similar at http://GitHub.com/trusktr/infamous you will probably find my implementation of the book keeping. 

I recently just added WebGL, which is currently only rendering from the "light tree", not looking at the shadow Dom stuff yet.

When I get more time, I can explain it better by pointing to code references and examples once my WebGL is using the ShadowDOM book-kept stuff... It might be tempting to write components using aframe-react because the component model is perhaps nicer and cleaner than with shadow DOM, but writing with shadow has the result that new HTML components can be used everywhere other than with React.

I'm still pondering on how to do this as cleanly as possible with my Elements while still providing an imperative API that would work if the custom elements are disabled.

That's one thing I've been working towards is allowing an option to disable DOM so that no DOM is outputted of using the imperative API, rendering straight to WebGL with no DOM overhead). I'm thinking of how to decouple the SahdowDOM features from the imperative features in a way that the imperative stuff will work fine without shadow DOM. This will make the API flexible for use in many ways, even outside DOM. @donmccurdy 


> A-Frame does not, by default, write attribute values to the DOM. If an entity's position changes on every frame, A-Frame will only add the position attribute to the DOM once, and after that all updates are virtualized.

I saw that in aframe-react, it passes non-string values to setAttribute. This is what I've been planning to do in infamous too. 👍 

> Being able to run A-Frame in DOM-less environments, e.g. serverside, is not built in. I would be curious how that goes for you, if that's something you're planning to try.

I'm planning to do SSR stuff, but more like outputting HTML from the server, then the HTML becomes live on the client, so that will work. If I actually want to _run_ it on the server, I'd probably use Chrome headless or something, so it'll still work.

---

Anywho, those points aren't necessarily related to ShadowDOM, in the sense that they don't prevent A-Frame from being ShadowDOM-compatible. Because, for example, if I add a shadow root to a parent `a-` element, then the children will be distributed somewhere into the shadow tree. A-Frame could have `MutationObserver`s and `slotchange` event listeners that detect the distribution of nodes and A-Frame can then update the virtual scene graph (the "sort of virtual DOM" you mentioned) based on those changes, regardless of what `setAttribute` does.  Should fix #1036.
 @ngokevin 
Okay. I'll try to expand what exists for a-animation to cover it.
 @ngokevin 
Tucked it in at the bottom of the file and based it off the `click` event `begin` test.
  **Description:**
Allow movement through a scene using the arrow keys in addition to ASWD, which only really make sense for people who have played first person shooters on PC in the past.

While using a mouse and arrow keys together feels awkward position-wise, it seems like a good idea to allow it for the initial experience.
- A-Frame Version: Any
- Platform/Device: Desktop w/ Keyboard
 Did a quick test on an example and I believe this can be closed with @donmccurdy 's PR
  This may have been requested before, but I can detail a complete use case which may be helpful for further discussion. @ngokevin recently added the `data` attribute to his `aframe-template-component` to help solve my JSON loading scenario. Given that addition, I was able to reach the following solution:

```
AFRAME.registerComponent('manifest', {
  schema: {
    src: { default: '' },
    assets: { default: [] }
  },

  init: function () {
    var el    = this.el;
    var data  = this.data;
    var name  = data.src.substr(1);
    var asset = document.querySelector(data.src);

    asset.addEventListener('loaded', function() {
      data.assets = JSON.parse(asset.data).assets;
      el.setAttribute('template', 'src: #images; data: manifest');
    });
  }
});
```

```
<a-scene>
  <a-assets>
    <a-asset-item id="manifest-data" src="assets/manifest.json"></a-asset-item>
    <script id="images" type="text/x-nunjucks-template">
      {% for i in range(0, assets.length) %}
        <a-image src="assets/images/{{ assets[i] }}"></a-image>
      {% endfor %}
    </script>
  </a-assets>

  <a-entity position="0 0 0" manifest="src: #manifest-data"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

But as you can see, I'm forced to attach the `template` component only after the `mainfest-data` asset has actually loaded due to the timing of the `template` components rendering. This is understandable given what it accomplishes, however the need for the `manifest` component to act as a `loaded` and data bridge could be reduced, and eventually removed, if `<a-event>` was usable inside an `<a-asset-item>`. The result would become more like this:

```
<a-scene>
  <a-assets>
    <a-asset-item id="manifest-data" src="assets/manifest.json">
      <a-event name="loaded" target="#container" template="src: #images; data-src: #manifest-data"></a-event>
    </a-asset-item>
    <script id="images" type="text/x-nunjucks-template">
      {% for i in range(0, assets.length) %}
        <a-image src="assets/images/{{ assets[i] }}"></a-image>
      {% endfor %}
    </script>
  </a-assets>

  <a-entity id="container" position="0 0 0"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

Of course the `data-src` attribute would need to be added to the `template` component as well, but allowing events in this manner would be a step in the right direction. Also, I have only scratched the surface in regard to asset loading in this framework. So this may not even be possible given the lifecycle at hand.
 @ngokevin 
Thanks for the quick reply. I'll use that pattern in this case, instead. You should also publish that separately, too; it's quite a useful component.

It's nice when a project's license is included as a comment at the top of the pre-built source file. That way it doesn't have to be added manually, and the only thing required to legally distribute the file within another application would be the file itself.
 Shall the license be added to the minified version as well, or just to the regular build? Hi, I'm interested in tackling this issue. Is there anything else that should be known about this issue? @ngokevin is this still needed to be worked on?  The logo demo on master is currently broken and `parentEl` is `null`, so looks like this is still an issue
 Still hitting this but here's what I've noticed with the A-Frame Logo demo where this happens twice:
- `self` is `<a-entity light="" data-aframe-default-light="" position="" rotation="" scale="" visible=""></a-entity>`;   `parentEl` and `parentNode` are both null
- When inspecting the DOM to find elements, they're gone; instead there's:  `<a-light type="directional" color="#FFF" intensity="0.45" position="4 2 1" light="" rotation="" scale="" visible=""></a-light>`

If elements are being created/swapped then a reference isn't being updated which is why `parentNode` is null.
 I'm running into this too, while working on lighttarget. parentEl not defined. Only on firefox. Seems to happen mainly with lights.

Edit: if i comment out 'this.system.registerLight(el);' in light component, the problem goes away.

investigating further...
 Could it have something to do with this:
In systems/light.js:
32 `sceneEl.removeChild(defaultLights[i]);`
a regular DOM removechild deletes the element, but what happens to the light component on it then? maybe first some cleanup is needed with the threejs scenegraph ?

Or maybe parentEl / parentNode are never set on those default lights...
  **Description:**
If I want to make my object half of its original size, it would be nice to set the scale attribute as one value like `scale=".5"`. Currently this will only scale the object along the X axis, so I have to use `scale=".5 .5 .5"`. I think it would be handy if there is only a single value to assume that it is meant to apply to all three axes.

  aframe isn't working in Internet Explorer 11 (Windows). Is this a known issue?

Here I attach a screenshot with the error:

```
var evt = new CustomEvent(name, data);
Object does not support this action
```
- A-Frame Version: 0.2.0
- Platform/Device: Internet Explorer 11 (Windows)
  ![image](http://i.imgur.com/xzZInXY.png)
 According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent) the CustomEvent constructor is not supported by IE. However, basic support does exist and can be utilized through the following [polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent#Polyfill).

```
(function () {

  if ( typeof window.CustomEvent === "function" ) return false;

  function CustomEvent ( event, params ) {
    params = params || { bubbles: false, cancelable: false, detail: undefined };
    var evt = document.createEvent( 'CustomEvent' );
    evt.initCustomEvent( event, params.bubbles, params.cancelable, params.detail );
    return evt;
   }

  CustomEvent.prototype = window.Event.prototype;

  window.CustomEvent = CustomEvent;
})();
```

However, [Microsoft states](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/documentation/dev-guide/dom/dom-event-constructors/) that, "As of Microsoft Edge (build 10240+), the `createEvent()`/`initEvent()` constructor pattern for synthetic events is deprecated and has been replaced by the DOM L4 event constructor pattern," which includes the `CustomEvent` constructor. So while A-Frame is technically using the correct code in regard to modern browsers, you will need to employ a polyfill to combat this issue until Edge is the lowest common denominator.
 @msimpson Okay, I fixed it with this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-event-polyfill. You're right. Maybe it's a Microsoft issue. I think this issue can be closed.
 @ngokevin 
I think A-Frame usage will grow beyond WebVR, alone. Given your React bindings, it may become a staple for THREE usage in that community. So support for IE 11, which is included alongside Edge in Windows 10, is probably warranted as it's not going anywhere anytime soon.

However, I'm not so sure that the polyfill itself should be included with A-Frame by default. It would probably be better to encourage its usage in the documentation for IE 11 and below; somewhat like Bootstrap with Respond.js. That way you don't force it upon most people or collide with their inclusion of it separately.
 It should be mentioned that in A-Frame 0.3.2 the only thing needed to work in IE11 is the above mentioned polyfill.

IE11 works great for displaying 360-degree images, amongst other things.
 One more gotcha which is quite specific, but since this seems to be the top google result for "aframe ie11" I'll just throw it in here.

We had all our assets protected behind a login, and in IE11, using aframe, would not load slash-absolute URLs for images (as in `src="/my-image.jpg"`) and thus the whole specified domain was required. Then, the images would not load because three.js adds crossDomain="anonymous" when fetching textures, the whole debacle resulting in several "$s could not be fetched" errors. Only in IE11, not in Chrome et-al.

This can be avoided by protecting all site assets but not the images.

  This is not working with version >=0.3.0 I have tested in firefox & chrome in Android. It is not working. When I change the afrmae version to 0.2.0, it is directly going to vr mode. The following code seems to work with v0.4.0 in Firefox Nightly when `auto-init-vr` component is attached to the scene. Unfortunately Chromium still requires user interaction before it can auto-trigger VR mode:

```
AFRAME.registerComponent('auto-init-vr', {
    init: function () {

        var scene = this;

        scene.el.addEventListener('loaded', function () {
            setTimeout(function(){
                console.log('Automatically entering VR...');
                scene.el.sceneEl.enterVR();
            },1000);
        });
    }
});
```
Note that I changed the component name since the original name collides with an internal component in v0.4.0. The `setTimeout` isn't exactly very elegant - is there a better way of detecting when the entire scene is ready? `auto-enter-vr` in 0.4.0 does what you want, but is configured by default to only enter if VR display is Gear VR (for Carmel browser which has no other way to enter VR) Is there any way for `auto-enter-vr` to have the GearVR be over-ridden? We are trying to jump through multiple small scenes, but we have to enter VR manually each time, which is inconvenient on Cardboard!

None of the "old" methods of calling a script of setting a `setTimeout` or `loaded` work on 0.4.0, so this is extra-frustrating. @cvan Do you have an ETA, or a hint? I'm sorta stuck and it's driving me bonkers.

Our main platform will be cardboard and cardboard-like devices. Vive and Rift aren't really on the map for now :) sorry about the bugs :-/ @cvan not sure `display: all` works correctly at the moment, https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/scene/auto-enter-vr.js#L50 ... 
the original intent was to leave blank for all, but unfortunately the parsing just fills in the default... which is unfortunately still GearVR.  if you've got fixes forthcoming, they haven't appeared in master yet > auto-enter-vr will go away in next version in favor of the link component and system

we will presumably still want the `vrdisplayactivate` and `vrdisplaydeactivate` enter/exit behaviors (assuming that browsers fire the events) @Silver-Seagull try:
https://rawgit.com/chenzlabs/aframe/fix-auto-enter-vr-dist/dist/aframe-master.js
https://rawgit.com/chenzlabs/aframe/fix-auto-enter-vr-dist/dist/aframe-master.min.js
with
`<a-scene auto-enter-vr="display:all">`
 @cvan & @machenmusik Thank you for the help and tips - however the app isn't entering the split-view as it should.

I feel a little out of my depth (to say the least) and I may have posted out of turn. Looking at our code, I think the view is not Cardboard, but an a-frame page in a Cordova app using the Crosswalk browser. I assume the WebKit-based browser is why this is not working?

:edit:
Running the code now, definitely a Crosswalk-based project in Cordova. On desktop, the VR/cardboard button disappears, which looks like it fired. @cvan It looks like it's a WebVR block, as browsers (save Carmel?) won't allow that sort of action unless it comes from a human.

Thank you for the help and suggestions - hopefully `link` comes along in the January roadmap as planned ^_^  Example for getComputedAttribute (attr) is incorrect. It reads 
   `entity.getAttribute('geometry')`
when it should be 
   `entity.getComputedAttribute('geometry')`

Supporting the glTF Loader alongside the Collada Loader.

**Changes proposed:**
- Adding the glTFLoader
 @ngokevin auto and loop are working, @dmarcos named the system gltf-animations -- gltf-model seemed confusing given it's the name of the component (3d model, data model), and there's no actual data associated with this system, more of a controller.

There's some other features I'd like to add (like play/pause animations associated with particular objects within a glTF scene), but seems like the most basic functionality is best for the initial PR.  Let me know if there's anything else I should add/remove/change.  
 Per @dmarcos going to start off putting this in a component for now because of the glTF library overhead : https://github.com/xirvr/aframe-gltf 
 Converted to 3rd party component: https://github.com/xirvr/aframe-gltf 
  I was kind of confused when I first saw it until I realized that it wraps the whole material definition so registerMaterial does make more sense, especially for devs who are already acquainted with three.js. The ambiguity with the schema's "type" property is not so nice though. Maybe a synonym like "kind" or something could be used to select the material and geometry components variations. 
 it would be ambiguous when you define the schema parser, there's already a type property there
 hmm then that's a non issue I guess
  maybe a proxy component could handle this by passing it's data to the system when the component inits? The system would just have to init itself in a dormant state until the first time a component accesses it
 I'm using a proxy component (exactly like @wizgrav's suggestion) for physics. Works OK but that means the system will be only half-initialized while its components are loading. One possible fix would be initializing a-scene components before the rest (is there a defined order now?).
 > is there a defined order now?

I was curious about this, myself.
 Explicit definition for the initialization order of components on a whole scene context is not implemented yet, the .dependencies property handles that on a per entity context, but there's a relevant discussion about it here https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1152
  Is there a solution to getting audio to play in iOS browsers? Audio is working on desktop and Android devices. I saw a similar issue posted here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38645716/cant-play-sound-on-ios

 I too would lovvvve a solution to this.  Any help out there? https://howlerjs.com has Audio Sprites which is pretty much 'skipping around in one file' as far as I understood it, so implementing this might not be as painful. I think one member of the A-Frame community (jostrem) successfully implemented Howler with iOS. If you search for Howler in Slack, you'll find it. i am trying to trigger sounds from within an aframe scene interaction, but it won't work on ios.  

Everything says you need a user interaction on ios to play audio, but i can't find a working example of that. I created a prototype, which is working on my 3rd generation iPad.
I'd appreciate if someone with a newer iPhone or iPad could confirm that it
works for them.

Thanks for trying to get this to work!  I will use it on my live site if we get it working at all. It worked for someone in the Slack community ... did you look ('gaze') at the cubes? ha...i didnt realize i needed to gaze at the cubes...nor turn off the silent lock switch.  Did both of those and it works!  cool.  would this work with a large audio file? I guess so, didn't try it out yet.

  This needs review as I had to alter the prototype to use `defaultComponentsFromPrimitive` in `registerPrimitive` instead of simply `defaultComponents` since Object.create will override the `defaultComponents` from the `a-entity` prototype. This, if allowed, would cause test failures as `getAttribute` subsequently returns `null` for those overridden attributes (i.e. position, scale, etc.).

(i don't have my own favicon set though, so in my case I don't mind A-Frame providing the icon)
 I the only reference to the A-Frame logo is:

```
var MOBILE_HEAD_TAGS = module.exports.MOBILE_HEAD_TAGS = [
  Meta({name: 'viewport', content: 'width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no,user-scalable=no,minimal-ui'}),

  // W3C-standardised meta tags.
  Meta({name: 'mobile-web-app-capable', content: 'yes'}),
  Meta({name: 'theme-color', content: 'black'}),
  Link({rel: 'icon', sizes: '192x192', href: 'https://aframe.io/images/aframe-logo-192.png'})
];
```

@donmccurdy yes exactly. I don't mind it either, but I guess people want to set their own and if I explicitly set it in HTML, Chrome is showing sometimes the A-Frame icon and sometimes my own.
 I'm having the same problem. And the favicon is stuck in my app, I can't use my own. I've cleaned my cache and tried everything. Strangely, this only happens in Firefox and IE. I explain the issue here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37312783/favicon-only-showing-up-in-chrome

Am I missing something?  I've tried everything to get a videosphere to play inline on a webpage without putting it in an iframe.  When I put the code in my site the videosphere always fills the entire page, which I do not want.  Can this be done or am I just banging my head against a brick wall?
  Oh....I've some problems with this dae animation model....@ngokevin thank you for the sample... now the models works fine in my project! but is there any articles about AFrame's animations?? if I want use other format animation file, what can I do? like this: http://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_lights_hemisphere.

 I can reproduce this here: https://sandbox.donmccurdy.com/vr/walls/

For either one of the `<a-box/>` elements:

``` javascript
sceneEl.remove(boxEl);
sceneEl.appendChild(boxEl);             // no effect, no errors
sceneEl.appendChild(boxEl.cloneNode()); // works
```
 Seems fine that it stops working _while_ it's detached, what's a bit unexpected is that it doesn't re-initialize when it is reattached, unless you clone the node first.

If there are issues preventing an entity from being re-attached, once `remove()` has been called on its components, maybe we should throw an error if we can detect a recycled entity being inserted?

  Following the discussions with @ngokevin @dmarcos @donmccurdy and @fernandojsg :

Enable post processing by extending components with a .tock() method which runs after the scene renders.

A-scene maintains a .renderTarget and switches rendering to that in the presence of at least one tock behavior.

A graph based mechanism is employed to allow for explicitly definable execution ordering for both tick and tock behaviors.

Components can define two way connections in the graph using the properties .precedents and .following, similar to .dependencies.

Sorting to define the execution order takes place only in registerComponent() and batching is done efficiently in a-scene using caches.

The graph based mechanism works fast and comfortable for the developer. Cyclic dependencies in the graph are errors and throw exceptions.

An example utilizing most of the functionality added by this PR at http://wizgrav.github.io/aframe/examples/test/post-processing/index.html
 This is really neat! Nice example.

As far as the API, it feels strange having DOM events hooked into the render loop, firing every 8-16ms. I'm not sure exactly what to recommend though. Other ideas:

``` javascript
// 1.
sceneEl.setPostProcessingCallback(function () { /* ... */ });

// 2.
sceneEl.addPostProcessingCallback(function () { /* ... */ });

// 3.
AFRAME.registerComponent('my-component', {
  prerender: function () { /* called only if my-component is attached to sceneEl */ },
  postrender: function () { /* called only if my-component is attached to sceneEl */ },
});
```
 @donmccurdy you proposals #1/#2 were also my original thoughts. I went for emit because it seemed to be more consistent with the patterns used in the library. I'm almost certain that performance shouldn't degrade with dom events. Of course this needs investigation but 8/16ms is still a good chunk and we have to take into account that postprocessing will have a big cost itself so the events will probably be a negligible fraction of that
 based on @dmarcos comments I added a post method on components. Behaviors are split in tick and post types and handled separately. Performance has indeed improved noticeably(from 50% -> 40% on my box for the example) so this seems like the optimal path to take.

I also added a postPriority property on components. This is intended to facilitate common post proc setups where several components will produce their own renderTargets containing bloom, godrays, ssao etc and then a composer component can pick these up and blend them to screen. Prioritization happens only on post behaviors(which should only be a handful) and sorting happens only once per frame if there was a change in the post pipeline.

Finally an event is emitted when the sorting happens to indicate that the pipeline has changed. This can be picked up by the composer components so they can reconfigure themselves. I'm not sure about this one maybe a simple timestamp could work. What are your thoughts on this, and the whole pr in general?
 @ngokevin sorry for the mess with dist and such, I was having great pain with npm and setting up the build in general. I'll fix everything
 I also included the tweaked VREffect inside lib/three.js until it is fixed in three.js itself. I see no reason why they wouldn't do the tweak themselves. The VREffect render() should match the signature of the base WebGLRenderer since it's a wrapper of it. Another note of interest is the use of depth textures. I think it recently landed on three and fortunately they implemented it as a property on the renderTarget so when aframe upgrades to the latest three.js all that will be needed to utilize depth textures will be

`this.renderTarget.depthTexture = new THREE.DepthTexture()`

and of course resizing it along with the renderTarget itself
 @ngokevin I'm not sure a postproc effect can be described like a shader, it's more of a setup. For instance bloom commonly uses a separable gaussian blur so it would need at least two passes. Good bloom would also entail downsampling several times, blurring, and blending again on the way up. I think components make for a natural expression even if meant to be attached on the scene only. But I don't know I haven't yet looked over all of aframe's source and patterns so you'd know best
 @ngokevin another thing that should be taken into account while brainstorming is that customisation logic ends up in the composer usually. Postproc steps that provide intermediate renderTargets like bloom and ssao tend to be straightforward and so could be cast in place as reusable components. Only the composer needs special treatment, both for doing the composition of all the rest and also to apply the simple effects like vignette aberations, ascii etc At least for production one shouldn't use extra passes for these. Well maybe a final fxaa step if antialiasing is desired but this is straighforward as well.

The way I imagined it with postPriority would be for all steps that produce renderTargets from the scene's rendering would be left at their default zero priority. The composer would be at one and check for all post components with less priority than him and finally fxaa at two would check for the composer, again based on postPriority
 Yeah I understand your concerns. Defining post specific components seems to be the cleaner route then unless there would be a reason for post components to also run some logic at tick time. To be honest though I cannot think of such a case right now, I need to think about it
 Ok so I tried to think of cases where it would be useful to have a component that taps into both tick and postRender and something did came up. I've updated the example which you can see on http://wizgrav.github.io/aframe/examples/test/post-processing/

The alpha channel of the render target can be used to pass information to the post processing chain, the most common case being masking of objects. In the example the pulse component sets up properties on its underlying mesh. The postproc component then traverses the scene and adjusts the opacity according to these properties. It also handles cleanup when it's removed from the scene.

Alternatively the pulse component could setup it's opacity by itself but it would need to know the state of post processing. It could do that by listening for something like the "post-modified" event.

I'm not arguing in favor of either approach, it would be convenient to have both options availble.

I would also like to mention something, and I know you're going to hate me @ngokevin , but it really needs to be said. It is inevitable that components will need to be extended. At some point, a component will need to access the results of computations performed on another component on another entity. A way to guarantee the order of execution will be needed. I'm sorry if I've missed something, I still study the source but I think there isn't something like that in currently.

Doing something like postRenderPriority may work for postproc because it's by nature limited in scale but for tick behaviors I don't think it's appropriate at all. The solution unity came up for this situation was to add a LateUpdate method which runs after all update methods. So aframe will also need a tock() to go along with tick(). Again excuse me if I'm missing something. This does not concern this PR, it's something else all together but it's relevant and I feel that it should be taken into account
 Following the line of thought from the previous comment, if a tick()/tock() pair is indeed desirable, the api could get some symmetry with a postTick()/postTock() pair for the post processing, getting postRenderPriority out of the picture. Two lanes for the post processing should cover most cases. The third fxaa step I mentioned could be integrated in the compositor itself in postTock(). So that setup could also work
 @ngokevin @dmarcos Added tock() on components as a straight equivalent of unity's LateUpdate. A similar pair is implemented for post render as postRenderTick, postRenderTock. These should be enough to guarantee the order of execution so postRenderPriority was removed. The post-modified event is still emitted as it is useful for reconfiguring the compositor when the post chain changes.

The example at http://wizgrav.github.io/aframe/examples/test/post-processing/ was commented and updated to reflect all functionality in the PR. Some crude bloom was added to highlight the post tick/tock pattern, you can toggle the effect by right clicking. Ascii is always on now. 
 Hmm, I split the example but I'm not sure I did the right thing with the dist files. I did a checkout on the last commit before I touched them. Can you suggest how could they get out of the PR completely?

There's also the issue with VREffect being included in lib/three.js which is not so good. I can try making a PR to three so they can fix it on their source but to be honest, requiring such a core part of aframe from an examples/ folder kind of makes me nervous. Since you control the revision of three included anyway, maybe you should consider including VREffect.js in aframe's source somewhere.
 Yes I agree. Do you want me to do it here?
 the bulk of lint errors come from lib/three.js cause of the inclusion of VREffect.js, I'll take it on it's own file out as we said but should we ignore it in lint checks?
 @ngokevin  Rebased and squashed. Did also the minor changes needed for renderTarget support in @dmarcos  VREffect.js in vendor/
 @fernandojsg This is how I think the post processing could work with both flexibility and efficiency. Here's how the markup would look like

`<a-scene post-process="gloom, nightvision" gloom="intensity:0.5" nightvision="intensity:0.33"></a-scene>`

In this imagine that gloom would generate a texture that needs to be additively blended with the base rendering but nightvision is a simple equation applied to the frag color. The gloom component would do it's processing in tickPostRender and produce the texture. It would also define a postInfo property(not part of the components prototype) that would contain a unique id, uniform definitions for intensity etc and the fragment shader text it needs for the composition later kind of like

.postInfo: {
  name: 'gloom',
  uniforms: {
    'srcTexture': {type: 't', value: this.gloomTexture} // Produced by the component
    'intensity': {type: '1f', value: 0.5} //Settable by the component in it's update()  
  },
  fragmentText: 'void gloomPostProcess(in out vec4 currentColor, vec2 uv){ currentColor += texture2D(gloomInfo.srcTexture, uv) \* gloomInfo.intensity; }'
}

The "post-process" component, the compositor, would collect this information and create it's shader with a setup like

{
  uniforms: {
    "gloomInfo.srcTexture": gloomComponent.uniforms.srcTexture,
    "gloomInfo.intensity": gloomComponent.uniforms.intensity
  },
  fragmentShader: '
    sample2D sceneTexture; // scene.renderTarget
    varying vec2 vUv;
    struct gloomInfoStruct
    {
       sampler2D srcTexture;
       float intensity;
    } gloomInfo; // This is generated by the compositor based on the uniforms from gloom component

```
void gloomPostProcess(in out vec4 currentColor, vec2 uv){ 
       currentColor += texture2D(gloomInfo.srcTexture, uv) * gloomInfo.intensity; 
 } // This comes from the gloom component itself

void main(){
    vec4 color = texture2D(sceneTexture, vUv);
    gloomPostProcess(color,vUv);
    nightvisionPostProcess(color, vUv);
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color.rgb,1.0);
}
```

   }'
}
Nightvision would not need to produce a texture so it would just provide uniforms for control and it's shader chunk. When you change attributes text components would set their uniforms in their update() and the compositor who has them by reference would apply them with no further intervention
 when you say switch, you mean taking out the nightvision completely or just playing with it's intensity to make it apply more or less? In the former case yes the post chain will change and the compositor shader will need to be recompiled but if you just want to toggle the effect setting the intensity in the attribute will just update the uniform. Having some redundant calculation is less wasty than having separate passes for stuff like vignette and such

The fragmentText will be part of the gloomComponent's definition. The compositor will generate the gloomInfo struct text and include the fragmentText from gloomComponent + dynamically generate a main function to apply all components in a chain. The order will be defined in the post-process="" attribute itself. Some conventions are used, the components will have to provide a unique prefix (postInfo.name) for themselves to aid the compositor in its dynamic generation of text. 

The fragmentText of gloomComponent will be defined with these conventions in mind, that it will have access to a gloomInfo struct based on it's unique name containing it's uniforms and it will need to provide all the rest and name it's main function as gloomPostProcess so the compositor can call it, this function will have a common argument signature, kindof like shadertoy does with it's mainImage()
 Yes you can check out exactly that with bloom in the example. It's actually generating the bloom texture in 5 passes at lower res renderTargets (I wanted to try out kawase bloom but the same would apply for separable gaussian blur as well) Components that need to create textures will do that in their tickPostRender() with whatever setup they opt for. Their output(s) will be made available to the compositor via each child's postInfo.uniforms. They'd still need to provide some fragmentText to the compositor for the blending. Bloom would need to add while ssao would need to modulate etc. The compositor would be the only component that defines tockPostRender so it would run after all the others. It would be the compositors responsibility to output to screen.

There's still one caveat. Some effects need the final composited frame to work on. Fxaa or glitch for instance. For these instead of a postInfo, the child component will provide a function with a signature of postProcess(inRenderTarget, outRenderTarget) and again it will be the compositor who will apply these functions from each child component after he's applied his dynamically generated uber shader for all the components that don't need separate passes for the composition. 

The first of these, separate pass, type of components will get the composited frame as inRenderTarget, a couple of renderTargets will ping pong between them and the last component will get null as it's outRenderTarget so it renders to screen. This will all be orchestrated in the compositor component's tockPostRender() and is reminiscent of the effect composer from three. But overall the design will be much more efficient as most effects will be merged. Just think that with a common setup that includes bloom, ssao, godrays, vignette, and colorize we're saving five full res passes(three for the blendings of intermediate textures and two for the minor effects) compared to effect composer. This is huge gains
 We could have a mechanism like the one I described as standard for post processing in aframe, ie have the compositor built in and child components defined with a registerEffect(). I like the idea that it could instead be implemented on top of the existing component infrastructure though. This would make it easily exchangeable if a better scheme comes up afterwards. I'm always in favor of simple and flexible cores
 @dmarcos @ngokevin is right, the postproc related stuff, addition of a .renderTarget to scene and a switch to render on that instead of the screen are pretty much imposed by the apis provided by three itself. This PR has come to mostly concern with defining the order of execution of behaviors that need to run every frame. I'm leaning towards the, maybe not ultimately flexible, tick/tock mechanism because of the precedent in unity. It seems like a safe choice that's at least better than what is in currently. Of course just because unity did it doesn't mean it is the final answer
 @dmarcos reusing the dependencies property you mentioned makes sense and is attractive as an option. It is not enough as it is though as it ensures that controls will run before position for a single entity only where what we really need is all control behaviors from all entities executing before the first position behavior of any entity. Maybe not for the specific case but you should check unity's LateUpdate() for the rationale behind the need for ordered behavior groups/types. It's all about entity data interchange. 

We could accomplish that by making scene.behaviors a dynamically updating structure. Symbol order would be calculated when symbols are registered and using that behavior groups will be sorted when new symbols appear in addBehavior and be efficient. There may be issues with circular dependencies but those will be logical errors and should be caught anyway. 

For post processing we could use tock() to tap on the post render side, allow systems to tap into it as well and define the compositor as a system to ensure it would run after all post component behaviors. I'd prefer this scheme than having to define numeric priorities, what do you think @ngokevin?
 Following the discussions with @ngokevin @dmarcos @donmccurdy and @fernandojsg :

Enable post processing by extending components with a .tock() method which runs after the scene renders.

A-scene maintains a .renderTarget and switches rendering to that in the presence of at least one tock behavior.

A graph based mechanism is employed to allow for explicitly definable execution ordering for both tick and tock behaviors.

Components can define two way connections in the graph using the properties .precedents and .following, similar to .dependencies.

Sorting to define the execution order takes place only in registerComponent() and batching is done efficiently in a-scene using caches.

The graph based mechanism works fast and comfortable for the developer. Cyclic dependencies in the graph are errors and throw exceptions.

Post processing adapts naturally to the graph and becomes flexible and easy, aided by a-scene's new methods .getBehaviors() and .getPrecedence().

An example utilizing most of the functionality added by this PR can be seen at http://wizgrav.github.io/aframe/examples/test/post-processing/index.html
 While fixing the tests, I found some issues that you should take note of @ngokevin @dmarcos. In a-entity.test.js components are manually cleared with "components[componentName] = undefined". I thought that this was the same as "delete components[componentName]". Apparently it isn't, the keys are still enumerable with an undefined value. I iterate the component keys to do the topological sort and undefined values were not handled. Should I handle these or just fix the tests to use delete instead?
 As the dependencies property was already defining a graph, the concept is not foreign to the framework, it's more of an upgrade and generalization of an existing mechanism. 
 Tidied it up, graphing related functionality is isolated in utils/precedence.js. The most drastic changes are in a-scene, the batching of components, but at least they have been done with potential future generalization in mind. The way the graph sorting is setup already makes it generally applicable. It can be used with systems and could even be used for shaders, geometries and anything that maps names to definitions. Wherever it makes sense it would be trivial to add it. 
 Graphing is generally useful so I took it out into it's own package https://www.npmjs.com/package/precedence-maps and pull it as a dependency. The package also provides ordered stores so the code in a-scene is much cleaner now
 @ngokevin yes I was also thinking about splitting it. The only issue is that the PRs would conflict with each other. They both touch this.behaviors in a-scene.js which is split in tick and tock. We could do the ordering as the first PR for tick() and then do tock(). All the graphing logic now resides in the precedence-maps npm package so we could also do some commentary there. You can also take it under a-frame's umbrella if you want. It bases of toposort which seems like a legit package, so I don't see much worry there.

Should the example for tock be a PR on it's own? 
 it's certainly possible but mind that the example actually depends on the order guarantees. As the bloom component gets added/removed by bloom-toggler it's execution order will change. This means that the compositor component(post-process) which outputs to screen will blend the current scene's frame with the bloom texture from the previous frame. We can probably workaround that by also removing and readding the post-process component in order as well
 Ok I'll start off with a new PR for tock() then
 @cvan the tock() method and the behavior ordering overlap on some parts. Should I merge both in this one? Otherwise I think the tock PR would need to go first @cvan #1564 is rebased and clear for merge  **Description:**

I'm somewhat baffled. `webvr-polyfill` is in the package dependencies, but the VR button in the examples invariably reports `Your browser does not support WebVR. To enter VR, use a VR-compatible browser or a mobile phone.`

Isn't this exactly what the polyfill is supposed to alleviate? I can run the webvr-polyfill samples in the same browser with no trouble.
- A-Frame Version: d969ecb7
- Platform/Device: Google Chrome 50.0.2661.94 (64-bit) (OSX 10.11.4)
 I believe the intent of that polyfill is to make WebVR experiences compatible with normal desktop and laptop computers by allowing mouse and keyboard usage in place of owning a VR headset. A JavaScript polyfill would never be capable of bridging a hardware support gap between the browser and the headset.

To use WebVR with an actual VR headset you'd need to get a compatible browser from here: https://webvr.info/

The examples you see from A-Frame which have that button disabled are actually navigable with a keyboard and mouse due to that polyfill, and that button triggers the hardware VR headset mode in opposition. 
 I'm not familiar with the underlying implementation details, but the [webvr-polyfill](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill) definitely allows you to use at least a cardboard mount with a mobile device that includes an accelerometer.

Try https://toji.github.io/webvr-samples/03-vr-presentation.html?polyfill=1 on desktop Chrome (stable): you will see "Enter VR" and clicking it will get you the split render you expect to see.
  **Description:**

The way three.js examples (loaders, controls, effects) are currently required with an explicit node_modules path breaks the ability to build aframe from source when aframe is installed as a dependency with npm3 (flat dependency structure). This scenario should be supported given requiring from source instead of prebuilt is sometimes more appropriate (e.g. avoiding duplicate THREE object in prebuilt file if another three dependency exists in the project outside of aframe)

**Changes proposed:**
- Do not provide explicit node_modules path, allowing browserify/webpack/etc to find the appropriate three location
  i got this error when i require aframe using node: referenceError window is not defined any help?
- A-Frame Version:0.2.0
- Platform/Device:windows 7 64
 if aframe is not expected to work on node why the library exist in node package manager?
 so the require directive for Browserify not for nodejs? 
  This is just a fix which worked for me -- but it seems that all `cursor`-related events are now firing without the `cursor-` prefix as of `0.2.x`. For example `cursor-mouseenter` is now working as `mouseenter`.

If this is completely wrong, feel free to close this, but if not, the relevant doc has been updated in this PR.
 Ope, should have opened an issue I guess
 Hi, I've been looking through your showcase and just realized your showcase source doesn't have the latest version. It still has cursor- prefix. 
Thanks for the great library btw.

Will increase performance when attributes or objects are increasing

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5349425/whats-the-fastest-way-to-loop-through-an-array-in-javascript
 Thanks for the question. More recent result shows normal for loop is better, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17989270/for-loop-performance-storing-array-length-in-a-variable

At least I learned micro-optimization seems harmful :/
  The docs for declarative-events read as so:

```
<a-entity id="cube" mixin="cube"></a-entity>
<a-entity>
  <a-event name="click" property="material.color" target="#cube" value="red"></a-event>
</a-entity>
```

The code applies this by doing: 

```
if (attributeName.indexOf('.') !== -1) {
  attributeSplit = attributeName.split('.');
  targetEl.setAttribute(attributeSplit[0], attributeSplit[1],
                                   attributeValue);
  continue;
}
```

The issue here is `attributeName` is `property` and `attributeValue` is `material.color`.

There are two possible solutions is either changing the docs to do

```
<a-entity>
  <a-event name="click" "material.color"="red"></a-event>
</a-entity>
```

Or updating the code to look for the property's value and then do an attribute split on it then get the actual value from the value property.

Maybe other approaches are possible as well.  Just was able to adjust the code in both these ways to get it working locally.

  hello！ I met the same problem， same issues 1021 (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1021),
i think, this is not a limitation of iOS,i find a example that can play, but, Internal testing products，so i can't public sorry! I try to modify aframe texture, use THREE.Texture, end up in faliure! Can be modified？ thanks！
 This issue has been resolved，thanks！ 
 @liuxiaoyue did you find a solution? Can you share it
 Seems like this issue has been resoved (or worked around) in other contexts: 
- For [THREE](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/9754#issuecomment-268186791)
- For [GoogleVr](https://github.com/googlevr/vrview/pull/105)

I couldn't figure out yet how to build the required custom material to handle such a video format in a-frame, but I think the hard work has been done already. so how does one know when bgra fix is required?  

wondering whether it makes more sense to enable detection and remediation in core/default shaders (so if similar problem arises for different elements, can set bgra property or similar) Seems like there are actually 2 problems:
- FlipY  on OSX and iOS (fixed by `vUV = vec2( uv.x, 1.0 - uv.y );`),
- Channel R and B mixed on iOS (fixed by `gl_FragColor = texture2D( texture, vUV  ).bgra;`) [issue comment here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/9754#issuecomment-266309206) are you sure? `FlipY disabling in my tests was required for MacOs Safari 10 also.`
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/9754#issuecomment-273515995 (need to understand also if this is just for video, or also for image, canvas, etc.) Anyone have any insights as to how to go about turning the workaround proposed at https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/9754#issuecomment-268186791 into an A-Frame material? This is an issue affecting a project I'm hoping to use A-Frame on, but I'm a bit stuck on how to implement a fix for this. Looking at this some more, I also wonder if it should be patched in core as @machenmusik suggests.

Following the lead of VR View (see googlevr/vrview/pull/105), the `loadVideo` method of the `material` system could set the necessary texture properties required for the fix. Borrowed code from VR View:

```javascript
if (Util.isSafari() && videoType === VideoType.HLS) {
  // fix black screen issue on safari
  videoTexture.format = THREE.RGBAFormat;
  videoTexture.flipY = false;
} else {
  videoTexture.format = THREE.RGBFormat;
}
```

I suppose then each of the core shaders would then need to implement the same logic as VR View, i.e. choosing between `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial` and `THREE.ShaderMaterial`, depending on whether or not the texture source is an HLS video playing on Safari. Borrowed code from VR View:

```javascript
if (texture.format === THREE.RGBAFormat && texture.flipY === false) {
  material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
    uniforms: {
      texture: { value: texture }
    },
    vertexShader: [
      "varying vec2 vUV;",
      "void main() {",
      "	vUV = vec2( uv.x, 1.0 - uv.y );",
      "	gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4( position, 1.0 );",
      "}"
    ].join("\n"),
    fragmentShader: [
      "uniform sampler2D texture;",
      "varying vec2 vUV;",
      "void main() {",
      " gl_FragColor = texture2D( texture, vUV  )" + (Util.isIOS() ? ".bgra" : "") + ";",
      "}"
    ].join("\n")
  });
} else {
  material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texture });
}
```

_or_, perhaps there should be a new core `video-material` shader that is recommended especially for use with videos that implements this logic?

Does that make sense, @dmarcos? I couldn't work out how to fix this with just a custom shader material (using `registerShader` in my app), as the `ShaderMaterial` fix needs to have access to the video texture that the `material` system has loaded. had anyone confirmed that only video on iOS (and HLS video, not MP4 video) suffers from the defect?  there is not just one shader appropriate for all video, and if other significant BGRA sources exist it may be worth adding BGRA support directly to core shaders, controlled by bgra boolean property for example @machenmusik I've certainly only experienced this issue with HLS on iOS, MP4 video worked perfectly for me, as does MPEG-DASH via Shaka Player on other platforms. Sadly, HLS is the only adaptive bitrate solution you can use on iOS.

@dmarcos I think you and I are talking about the same thing -- a core shader in A-Frame to handle video textures. @dmarcos i think the question is, when it is too late to change the texture format? @robinnorth there is not just one shader appropriate for all video really, although you may only be using one, they would all need the change OK, I've been able to get a custom video shader to display HLS video correctly on iOS and macOS Safari after patching the `loadVideo` method of the `material` system in A-Frame core to set
```
texture.flipY = false;
texture.format = THREE.RGBAFormat;
```
when in Safari.

Here's my custom shader code (based on the `flat` core shader):

```javascript
AFRAME.registerShader( 'video-shader', {
    schema: {
        color: { type: 'color' },
        fog: { default: true },
        height: { default: 256 },
        offset: { type: 'vec2', default: { x: 0, y: 0 } },
        repeat: { type: 'vec2', default: { x: 1, y: 1 } },
        src: { type: 'map' },
        width: { default: 512 },
        wireframe: { default: false },
        wireframeLinewidth: { default: 2 }

I haven't been able to figure out how to do this without patching core though, as `flipY` really needs to be `false` before any video textures are loaded, due to this WebKit bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163866 > patching the loadVideo method of the material system in A-Frame core to set `...` when in Safari.

@robinnorth those workarounds should only be applied when you are playing native HLS video though, right?  otherwise you break MP4 etc. ? @machenmusik yes, you are correct. It's only HLS video that suffers from the bug in Safari. VR View handles this by checking the file extension of the video source to see if it's `m3u8` and thus HLS (see my [earlier comment](aframevr/aframe/issues/1416#issuecomment-290424762) that summarises their implementation). more generally speaking it is not safe to bake the behavior into the shader without parameters, since an app may legally switch between playing MP4 and HLS - also, that check should probably also look for mimetypes since not all HLS streams use .m3u8 suffix another thought - do you need to flip Y in shader, can you invert Y scale of playback surface?  the bgra accommodation is the thing that absolutely needs shader changes This shader could be modified to check the source of the video texture applied whenever it changes (in the shader's `update` method) and then set the vertex and fragment shaders according to whether or not the HLS fix is required.

I suppose you could invert the Y scale of the playback surface (and then invert the face that the texture is rendered on), but in both the Three.js and VR View  examples, they've just flipped Y in the shader. Any progress on this, or a workable workaround? I have to put out a major project on Friday that was originally going to use an a-videosphere with HLS on iOS. I have the advantage of knowing that it won't switch to MP4 in this implementation. Any ideas? I believe there is a workaround described in a previous comment.  I don't think anyone has submitted a PR for the necessary core changes yet, so you may need to use a forked version in the interim. I've tried the shader listed above. It's not working for me. I've already patched the core. With my new patched core, If I use 'flat' shader on my videosphere, the video plays on iOS, but upside down and weirdly colored. So the core appears to be patched correctly. Now, the shader's job is to unflip it and color it correctly, if I understand. But if I use this shader, I get blank screen in both ios and desktop safari. So there must be some issue with the shader. @quickhand In the short term, you need to define `IS_SAFARI` and `IS_IOS` to be able to use my example shader code (they're constants that get defined elsewhere in my app):

```javascript
const IS_IOS = /iP(hone|ad|od)/i.test( navigator.userAgent ),
    IS_SAFARI = /^((?!chrome|android).)*safari/i.test( navigator.userAgent );
```

In the longer term, if a PR is welcome for the core changes required for `loadVideo` (cc @machenmusik, @dmarcos), I can submit one, as I'll need this fix for my project too.   @robinnorth I had already defined the constants, so it's not that. Still nothing appears. It's baffling. No errors in the console, and  I don't even know how to go about debugging it. I'm getting desperate, as my project has to launch tomorrow :-/ Thanks for your help, and let me know if you have any ideas how to approach this. @quickhand can you put together a JSFiddle test case? Also, I've just looked back at my prototype and realised I'm using just a plain `a-sphere` for some reason. My usage is (I'm using aframe-react):

```jsx
<Entity
    primitive="a-sphere"
    geometry={{ radius: 5000 }}
    material={{ src: '#video', shader: 'video-shader' }}
    scale="1 1 -1"
    rotation="0 90 0"
/>
```

It's also worth making sure you've defined `utils = AFRAME.utils` before the shader definition, and also that the shader is defined before you try and use it. Yes, I had defined utils = AFRAME.utils as well. And I am also using a plain a-sphere. Also using aframe-react :)

As I said, release is tomorrow, and two days later I leave my job, and the country. So I won't be able to mock up a test case for a while. Thanks for all the help, but I had to give up and switch to .mp4 on iOS. Amusingly, I'm now using HLS on everything except Apple systems. I chose HLS over MPEG-DASH because of the lack of Apple support (and used hls.js to add support to non-apple browsers). So much for that! Safari is the bane of my existence. @robinnorth: A JSFiddle would really help to know how you are putting together the custom video-shader.  I have the same issue. HLS on safari and mobile renders black screen for the video though the audio works. Appreciate your help. Nice work, @machenmusik. Really happy to see this make it into core! I think this can be closed now, as iOS 9 support doesn't seem possible  **Description:**

Remove repeat text
  I'm a Dvorak user who is annoyed by having to switch modes every time I want to test out something with the WASD controls. I'm wondering if there has been any thought put into alternative keyboard layouts? I was thinking about making a PR for a new `dvorak-controls` component, but ultimately it'd just get used in development since the vast majority of production users will use QWERTY. I also had the idea of changing the `wasd-controls` component to something more general (`keyboard-controls`?), which could potentially allow the user to swap between WASD and Dvorak modes, maybe with some (optional) small text in the lower left that would appear on hover?

I'm willing to work towards a PR for this, I just wanted to open the issue to see if anybody else had any ideas, or if anyone has pursued this line of thinking as of yet.
 Hi! Dvorak user here as well. :) I think this will be fixed in #1248. It's a larger PR but the relevant part is that using the newer KeyboardEvent.code API lets us map hotkeys by _locations_, without considering keyboard layout. This works better for ZQSD layouts as well. 

(only applies in browsers that support KeybardEvent.code, though - otherwise there's no good way to support both modes simultaneously)
 Excellent! Thanks @donmccurdy!

- A-Frame Version: 0.2.0

 It loads perfectly every time in firefox, so maybe just a chrome bug?
 It's only happening in my editor but I'll try make a minimal repro step, or just show you it running.
 This seems to be a [three.js issue](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/8666).
  **Description:**
Control a texture's position (offset) and wrap. My use case was that I wanted to put a transparent texture on a sphere at a specific scale and location. To do this the ThreeJS way, it meant using repeat for scaling down the texture, an alternate form of wrapping so that the texture doesn't actually repeat, and the offset for controlling where the texture goes.

**Changes proposed:**
- Expose "offset" as material property as a space separated list of length 2 (default "0 0")
- Expose wrap as material property as a space separated list of length 2. Values are strings and are can be valid ThreeJS wrapping keys. For less verboseness on the user's end, "RepeatWrapping" and "ClampToEdgeWrapping" is not valid, but "Repeat" and "ClampToEdge" is (the code adds "Wrapping" automatically).
- If wrapping is not set (there is no default), and repeat is used, there is no change to AFrame behavior. Wrapping won't be set unless using repeat - and if repeat is used RepeatWrapping is also used
- If wrapping IS set, the new user defined wrapping will be used regardless of if repeat is utilized or not
 No worries! I'm really just learning AFrame, and this was one of the first things I tried to do, saw it wasn't possible and dug in. I wasn't thrilled with the way I did it cause I'd forsee more and more props being stuffed in here, so I'm glad its being rethought.
  **Description:** Aside from adding a missing "to", I have slightly rephrased a sentence in the concept section.

**Changes proposed:**
- Add missing "to"
- Rephrase: 

From: "These components would be able to be mixed and matched and even be used with other vehicles..."

To: "These components could be mixed and matched and even used with other vehicles"
  I see this when using the `obj-model` component. The `intersection.object` returned by the `raycaster` doesn't have an associated `el` inside even though it's being set `onload` inside [`obj-model`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/obj-model.js#L50) through the [`setObject3D`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/58bbdaf05bfe4d3564a4e8ec85c6806e6197bf25/src/core/a-entity.js#L40) method.

However, upon closer inspection, it seems that `el` is only being set in the `THREE.Group` wrapping the loaded object. Whereas the `raycaster` is only concerned with returning the `Mesh` inside that group which is missing an `el`.

~~Maybe this can be solved inside the `obj-model` component, and others like it, by removing the `Group` wrapper. I'll investigate further.~~

Actually, considering multiple objects contained within a file, `setObject3D` would need to traverse the children inside that returned `Group` and add an `el` to each instead. 
  **Description:** Fixed 2 typos in index.md

**Changes proposed:**

1) change a-cube to a-box

2) add a missing "to"
  if you do a `<a-animation begin="200" dur="1000" repeate="indefinite">` then the repeated will also stagger its delay by 200 milliseconds making it impossible to stagger a animation through a group.

Suggested that an animation should ignore the delay after the first run on the animation if it is set to repeat the animation.
 This makes me wonder whether there should be a separate `delay` instead of overloading `begin`, as well.

I use a shield tv to view a-frame sites and it works well, except the viewport is pointed down at the ground, I assume because the orientation API returns a vector pointing straight down. It'd be good to categorize android tv devices as not mobile. Possibly this is a webvr-polyfill bug?
- A-Frame Version: 2.0.0
- Platform/Device: [Shield Android TV](http://www.webapps-online.com/online-tools/user-agent-strings/dv/brand728783/nvidia-shield-android-tv)
 Also, I think iPads and Android Tablets shouldn't be reported as mobile. Either that, or have the option to change away from VR display? Maybe click and hold the cardboard icon to show a little menu that flicks to thumbpad navigation on a scene?
 Makes sense. I'll create the PR. Is #975 the best place to discuss control refactoring (adding thumbpads)?
  **Running a MozVR example (ie. https://mozvr.github.io/panorama-viewer/) is much slower than running a native oculus app with the same functionality on the same device. The result is heavy lagging and motion sickness.**

Note: I am currently testing to pinpoint the reason and will respond here if I find it.
- A-Frame Version: Unknown. The version running the mentioned example in april 2016.
- Platform/Device: Chrome for Android / Samsung Galaxy S6.
 I am not so sure about that.
I tried today the twgl library and that has no issue with lag on the same device, browser.

I tried this link: 
http://pano-dev.autodesk.com/pano.html?url=jpgs/ecead6d6-ef44-450c-ad9b-229bad61c0ad

It works very responsively.
  I believe the second case is about being able to randomize multiple properties in one invocation. Could parenting accomplish this ?

```
<a-entity random="property: material.color; min: 0 0 0; max: 1 0 0">
  <a-entity random="property: material.roughness; min: 0; max: 1">
    <a-entity  random="property: geometry.primitive; oneOf: box circle sphere"></a-entity>
  </a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

Would this also work for the first case ?
 @ngokevin: Does this not work on rotation or position ? https://aframe.io/docs/guide/building-a-basic-scene.html#Interacting-with-the-Box
Hm, I thought children get their components from parents.
Could the component itself check if and what its parent entity randomizes and then add this to a list of randomized properties ?
 I guess it is not ECS. There must be a recognized way then how ECS addresses this issue. Time to read.
Perhaps worth pointing out in the docs that parent-child only applies to rotation, position, scale(?), eg. that spatial transformations are an exception which take into account hierarchy.

  Interested in getting your thoughts on this. I have a relatively simple use case for `<a-grid/>` that doesn't quite work because of the mapping order.

**Use case:**

``` javascript
/**
 * Flat grid.
 */
module.exports = {
  defaultAttributes: {
    geometry: {
      primitive: 'plane',
      width: 75,
      height: 75
    },
    rotation: {x: -90, y: 0, z: 0},
    material: {
      src: 'url(../../assets/grid.png)',
      repeat: '75 75'
    }
  },
  mappings: {
    width: 'geometry.width',
    depth: 'geometry.depth',
    src: 'material.src'
  }
};
```

You can't actually adjust the size of the grid above, because `width` really needs to map to **both** `geometry.width` and `material.repeat.x`, and the same for `depth`. I see two ways to fix this:

**Idea 1: Array Mapping Targets**

``` javascript
  mappings: {
    width: ['geometry.width', 'material.repeat.x'],
    depth: ['geometry.depth', 'material.repeat.y']
    src: 'material.src'
  }
```

**Idea 2: Invert Mappings**

``` javascript
  mappings: {
    'geometry.width': 'width',
    'material.repeat.x': 'width',
    'geometry.depth': 'depth',
    'material.repeat.y': 'depth',
    src: 'material.src'
  }
```

Anyway this is sort of a broken example (`repeat.x` / `repeat.y` don't even work, it needs to be `"75 75"` as a string, but inverting the mappings might also open up more interesting possibilities down the road:

``` javascript
mappings: {
  'geometry.width': 'width',
  'geometry.depth': 'depth'
  'material.repeat': function (data) {
    return (data.width / data.density) + ' ' + (data.depth / data.density);
  }
}
```
  Since I am using the template component, I was following this. Let me just add that I agree that it makes sense to have no third party dependencies (other than three.js) such as templating engines in the "core" or "extras". But let me also add that it can only be beneficial to a-frame as a concept to keep an as open as possible mind about what it is about. Its strength is extensibility. Some people may want to use it for performance conscious web games, some for data visualization, some or many for quick to code VR experiences, some purely declaratively, some mostly imperatively or with an important procedural component. So the core message is already pointing to "all of the above", at least in my small mind, and that is a positive. I think a-frame is doing a good job at that as well.
What I feel should be part of the core is support of a higher than asset level of reuse, probably just reuse of what is referred to as snippets.
 Glad to see that there was a deep exploration of where the boundaries ought to be at #930 . In the end, components may be just bundled with other components and/or with core based mostly on popularity. So it makes sense to me to keep core rather pure.

Working on a thick line component using THREE.Meshline at http://codepen.io/anon/pen/MyQrdK I would like to use the dimensions of the current scene canvas within the update function.
However, the canvas does yet not exist when update() is called first.
@donmccurdy on slack came up with a functional workaround using the "loaded" scene event which we used here:
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vGdwoq
I also tried to register the component only after the scene "loaded" event is fired but then the registered component was not retroactively applied to entities with the new component even after a scene.reload. Here is a page where I commented out things which were not working:
http://andreasplesch.github.io/aframe-pages/test/meshline/

Is there a way to trigger the update() function globally across the scene ? 
Would it be possible for aframe to call init() and update() the first time only after a canvas is created ?
 Thanks, this should be helpful.

I was sort of looking towards not to have to use event listeners.

Is there a way to trigger a component's update() function globally across the scene ?
Would it be possible for aframe to call components' init() and update() the first time only after a canvas is created ?
 Here is a way to force an update of all components of a selection of entities:

```
var all_meshlines = document.querySelectorAll('a-entity[meshline]'); // choose selector
[...all_meshlines].forEach(function(entity){

  entity.updateComponents();

});
```
 It took me a while to find the updateComponents() method. Should it be documented ?
 My use case was that the components uses canvas.width in its update . So I want to update when the canvas becomes available or when there is a change in size using events outside of the component.
 Is there an example ?
 Thanks. Will take me a while to understand what is happening there. Why consider updateComponents() not public ?
 It does make sense to keep all in the component, and thanks to the example I see how to use events there, with bind.
  This came up as part of my Controls refactor, thought I'd make a separate PR out of it.

Fixes #986.
  Interesting do you think this is related to #1334?
  I looked into this some. It seems that Three.js r75 changed VREffect.js's render function to check that full screen mode is enabled before it will render in stereo mode. As a result Android is fine, because it supports the Full Screen API, but Safari can only render in mono because [it does not.](http://caniuse.com/#search=fullscreen)

A change will need to made made to VREffect.js in order to fix this.
 Great! Good to know he's got a fix for it.

To get it working I had this function return false.

Given more mobile devices may have webvr browsers in the future, this function may need renaming.
 Yes, we have an A/VR headset that has mobile on it already and are not able to use the head tracking. It's not cell phone based which also causes a problem. Any advice on being able to have the browser recognize our device as unique would be helpful and to also connect to the head tracker. 
 This appears to still be an issue with the samsung internet vr browser (it works fine with the oculus browser), it is set to mobile mode when it shouldn't be Looks like the isGearVR function isn't being used inside isMobile check anymore [here](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/739427d84099dd0d92b83dcdf878f032cc7fe81b/src/utils/device.js#L38). The [Gear VR User Agent String](http://developer.samsung.com/technical-doc/view.do?v=T000000203) should still match that regex so that doesn't seem to be the issue.

 (when I tried this a long time ago, there was no perceptible change in performance, so I didn't do a PR -- but things may have changed since then)  Thoughts on adding a `three-model` loader for the THREE.js JSON format? It's not as bleeding-edge as glTF (and I'd love to see that get traction) but since THREE.JSONLoader and THREE.ObjectLoader are bundled with THREE.js by default, it wouldn't add much cruft.

[Work In Progress](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/loaders/three-model.js)

The format also [supports animation](https://sandbox.donmccurdy.com/vr/animation/), although I don't completely understand THREE.js's new animation system.
 Oh cool. Can't find it but nbd, I want to try loading some of the 3 Dreams of Black examples. They might be an older format though, they show up but no animation for me.

  **Description:**
  On Current master branch previously working animation examples no longer behave as expected.
- A-Frame Version:  Master
- Platform/Device:  All

Evidence:
1. Checkout Master
2. `npm run dev`
3. Visit animation unfold example.

Expected: Each plane should individually animate delayed from each other.
Seen: The next two planes to animate appear to be 'attached' and share rotation values until the next one is kicked off.

Maybe this behavior is now expected with the updates to primitives and the example code should be updated?
 Aframe-logo animation: the flat plane connecting the Slants in the A is no longer positioned appropriately as well.
  **Description:**
  Adds a method to an entity to understand both 'attribute' and 'attribute.property' and returns the     appropriate value in either case.
**Changes proposed:**
-  Remove special casing of circumstances from animation.js
-  Adds native method to element to understand this syntax.
 @ngokevin I opted to add the functionality to the element to understand the component attribute rather than write more special cases into animation. If you would prefer a different approach please let me know. This is in reference to #1334 
 Hold off on this... even though all the tests work there are visual regressions in the system.  Found when going to some examples will dig deeper.  A bit strange that all animation tests work when the actual components themselves don't.
 Hmm the visual regression occurred upstream and not from this PR I will open a new issue.
 Absolutely.  The rest of the refactors are addressed other than changing to the function to get with dot notation because it supports both and that name might be misleading?
 Sounds good. 
 @ngokevin yea I wanted to see why the last refactor didn't pass the integration test even though it did local before I added another test case.  Not sure if this was due to github having issues still so wanted to push the doc refactor first and ensure tests were fine before adding another.

Hmm same issue again, but not occuring on local.
 @dmarcos sorry didn't get around to trying last night.  I had tried to download a different version of firefox so I could get it to fail on my local, but I never got it to.  Had to wrap up some other stuff on a project today will be revisiting this again in a few hours and figure it out.  As I will need to use an entity generator to get a component to exist on the test.

Is it passing on all tests locally for you as well then failing on travis?
 @dmarcos Sorry with all the stuff going on and catching up with work I just haven't had the time to address this.  I can close it and re-open after I finish the feature/animateColor PR.  Or someone can pick up where I left off here.  I know its probably bugging you to have lingering PRs. 
 @dmarcos I applied the upstream changes here.

This build seems to be failing due to docker not installing from NPM properly.  This is a problem with NPM itself and not this branch.  https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9418#issuecomment-170244027

The problem seems to be intermittent waiting to see if this shows up somewhere else.  Or just this branch I could try closing and opening a new PR.  Waiting to see what ya'lls suggestions are.
 Cool those adjustments seem solid tests are still good.  Ping me if anything else gonna step off for a bit for dinner ect.
  +1. If we identify the most common issues, we could even write a drag-and-drop MTL validator perhaps. Or, really less validation than just warning about things THREE.MTLLoader doesn't support.
 I want to help.

  **Description:**

I tried out aframe on a macbook 12", it rendered at about 10-15fps. Would it be worth testing `window.devicePixelRatio > 1` and setting the canvas resolution to half the screen resoltuion, so that it only renders at half the resolution, then upsamples? It should get us banging against 60fps again, with some degradation in quality.

Ideally this would be autodetected, so that if you have retina + a strong GPU, it doesn't downsample.
 I did some experimentation, and calling `renderer.setSize`, you can dynamically downsample the scene. In a similair way to how valve are reducing the render resolution to make sure you stay at 90fps, you could do the same with aframe. People are used to netflix dynamically reducing the resolution when the network is congested, hopefully they would see adaptive downsampling the same way in aframe.
 No progress on this yet I guess? Even a manual option would be great to have. Even for non-VR use. 

Example scenario: laptop attached to a 4K monitor.
 This seems to be one way to achieve this, and if you go to extremes you even have an artistic effect. :-)
https://jsfiddle.net/dirkk0/0fdzqcsk/
 progress on this ? I'm developing on a 2016 Retina MBP for Smartphone/Daydream VR devices. Of course you want to preview your progress on the MBP screen but when I do so the MBP is constantly stressed out to render the scene (literally melting) and I still just get low fps. My current workaround is to use a 72dpi external monitor which normalizes the situation so I think its ok for me for now. The only problem is that the MBP loses its mobility but yeah somehow more of a luxury problem at the moment I guess.  **Description:**

  small typo, although it tripped me up trying to read it
  How are we testing performance gains here? Just against the performance-test scene? Be interesting to get some before / after metrics. Also - please make sure the flag can be turned on, because the editor needs it. ;)
  This is also a good opportunity to reduce the number of faces and vertices by reducing the number of height segments.  The lower the number of height segments the less distortion you get on an equatorial projected image as the src attribute.

-  Adds the detection of a color as an attribute
-  Adds a partialSetAttribute for color
-  Adds a conversion from rgb object to hex (maybe these belong in utils?)
-  Adds two unit tests for start and finish to ensure the color is properly tweened

…nent
 I think all feedback is resolved and I went through a refactor phase.  It should be ready to squash the commits if everything else is approved.
 @ngokevin @dmarcos Updated with a new approach to support both `color` and `material.color`.  I feel better about this approach.  Will add in some unit tests to ensure no regressions are introduced around the 'material.color' property.
 Updated with refactors as suggested and added the red to blue test case.  Should probably go through another refactor phase and then add an example and update the docs?

Will probably update a bit more tomorrow.
 Excellent did we want to update the docs in animation.md to explain color animation support with a short snippet?
 I am guessing a `test-animations-color` is different from an animation example?  It looks like `test` example namespace folders are all ones that provide stats and seem to be attempting to put some burden on the system?
 Sounds good I'll follow the examples of the other test-examples and put some color on it.  I had been playing around with some pulse animations that domino event emissions. Just to see if too many animations on color would cause a problem.  Never really saw an issue, but I didn't add stats to the scene.

The gif animator messed up feeling of smoothness lol but it ran smooth before turning to a gif xD
 @ngokevin Sorry about the delay I got really sick last week.  I added the readme entry and a test-animate-color.  Once this is ready I can add the test we talked about to the other PR that ensures a from color is correctly retrieved when animating a color and the from is not defined in the a-animation.
 @dmarcos yea I just need to alter @ngokevin suggestions.  I'm digging into now.  Not sure if you guys seen the news but weather has been pretty crazy in Houston the last few days.  I'll be pushing an update up shortly.
 @dmarcos We all do here too haha.

@ngokevin I adjusted the requested changes.  The only thing that may be missing I can think of now is a link to the example on the index page that is on localhost:9000 when you start the server.  I'm guessing I should probably add this yes?
 @ngokevin alright I updated the demo to a little more fancy of a demo.  I also opened an issue because you can't use begin delays to stagger because they calculate the begin delay on a repeat meaning the "stagger" animation eventually gets out of sync.  

This can be updated to remove the intervals once the bug is fixed there.
 Cool once you give it one more look over and are ready let me know and I'll squash the commits
 @ngokevin adjusted to mixins, new file structure and stats attribute.

 This is concerning the ability to scan the QR code to set the proper focal distance? That's what I'm looking for if that's available.
 @cvan Hi Chris, am I right in reading that the latest WebVR polyfill contains the code for lens distortion and device configuration for different cardboard headsets? Do you know when aframe will update to the latest version or which branch we can get a preview from? Thanks for the help!
 Thanks for quick response. I'm using Ionic and Browserify and I wasn't setting the config early enough it turns out. The back and settings button aren't responding to touch when I play a videosphere currently (iOS sim and device) - I'm going to experiment outside of Ionic and see if I have the same problem.
 The cardboard UI controls aren't working using the current master of aframe - tested using iOS webview on sim, device and then just a plain project ran in Safari. Pressing the back button does nothing, pressing the settings cog dims the screen for the duration you hold down. Sorry if this is more of a polyfill issue? Let me know if I can help out in anyway too
 To answer my own problem.. the version of the WebVR polyfill currently being used will not show the Cardboard UI, it's fixed in a newer version. The problem is in

```
CardboardVRDisplay.prototype.beginPresent_ = function() {
...
if (this.carboardUI_) { //Should be cardboard not carboard
    this.cardboardUI_.listen(function() { 

  }

  Superfluous variable, changed in doc, needs to be changed in the codepen but I imagine you'd want to do that through your account.
  - Bump THREE to r75 (fixes #1186)
- Update Torus Knot to fix tests and reflect changes in r75
- Remove deprecated scaleHeight parameter from Torus Knot schema
- Update the order of constructor arguments for THREE.TorusKnotGeometry
- Add torusKnot to relevant geometry schema properties
- Fix the Geometry Gallery example
 @dmarcos yes, unfortunately these changes are required to update Three to r75.
r75 changes the TorusKnotGeometry constructor, which breaks the test suite and causes a deprecated property warning for scaleHeight.
  `<video>` assets can contain a `poster` attribute specifying an image to be displayed before the video has loaded, or before it has been played.

When adding a video as a material `src`, it would be beneficial if the material could look for and display the  `poster` image. This should allow for the `src` attribute to be left empty when the video is not playing, so that memory is not used to load a video that is not being played.

The current workaround is to use an additional `<img>` asset containing the `poster` image, and to dynamically switch the material `src` to the `<video>` `src` when needed.

There is no documentation for loading an .OBJ with .MTL in <a-obj-model>. 

Looking at the source code, you need to specify the path to the .MTL-file. But doing exactly that, lets say with 

```
    <a-obj-model id="model_base"
                 src="models/model.obj"
                 mtl="models/model.mtl">
    </a-obj-model>
```

Results in a very unhelpful error message:

```
aframe.js:56776 Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'querySelector' on 'Document': 'models/mamiya/kens-rage-mamiya.mtl' is not a valid selector.
```

The error happens because of this:
Text in a "src" attribute, like src="myurl" is automatically converted into "url(myurl)". The function srcParse() recognizes this and treats it accordingly. For "mtl" attributes, this doesn't happen. They are not transformed into "url(myurl.mtl)" and not recognized in srcParse().

The <a-obj-model> apparently gets an attribute called "obj-model" set somewhere, and it's set to

```
obj:url(models/mamiya/kens-rage-mamiya.obj);mtl:models/mamiya/kens-rage-mamiya.mtl
```

You can circumvent it by using it like this:

```
    <a-obj-model id="model_base"
                 src="models/model.obj"
                 mtl="url(models/model.mtl)">
    </a-obj-model>
```

...but this doesn't seem to be the best solution since it's a bit inconsistent.

I've never contributed to open source projects so far but I'd like to start. If this is an issue that you'd like to have fixed, I'd like to look into it.

 @MrTrustworthy we got it to work with relative paths: `/blueshoe.mtl`
 There's an example with both an OBJ and MTL file here. Does this syntax work for you? https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/examples/test-model/index.html

I also like the syntax:

``` html
<a-entity obj-model="obj: url(...); mtl: url(...);"></a-entity>
```

And does your .MTL file reference any external texture images, or are the OBJ and MTL the only files involved?
 @masom @ngokevin I'm not able to access the original code until monday, so I won't be able to test the other options you mentioned until then. I can follow up with an answer then if needed.

But as far as I can see, it seems to be solved. Thanks for the quick reactions.
 @ngokevin I'm having this problem because the blender file is fetching my computers directiories of the textures instead of fetching the ones from A-Frame assets. How do I fix this? I've read somewhere that I should use a relative path, what does that look like? 
Thank you for your time @donmccurdy I already did that and it hasn't worked. Can you check this out please? https://glitch.com/edit/#!/vr-hq?path=views/index.html:27:46 i have 4 textures and none of them works, that's why i asked here

 I'm using a MacBook Pro and Chrome. Also tryed a Collada file, still no textures  Have seen a couple questions around this in Slack, but haven't found an example or gotten around to looking into it yet. Normal maps ought to be referenced inside the .MTL file, like texture images, but it's not clear whether THREE.js supports this.

[THREE.MTLLoader:368-379](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/loaders/MTLLoader.js#L368-L379)
 The THREE.js loader looks to be pretty limited for OBJ/MTL. They don't really support many of the MTL semantics.

The closest MTL semantic would be 'bump', but it was designed for scalar (greyscale) images. It was expected that the normal was recalculated in the shader. However it's probably safe to use it for normal maps, if you could get them to tweak the OBJLoader.js... 

Normal maps are kind of sticky though. They come in a few flavors. World space, object space tangents, 2 and 3 channel. A-Frame would have to take some kind of stance on what its 'standard' is.
 Couple hours of struggling with this, and yeah I agree with that take. THREE.MTLLoader is missing pieces (definitely won't read bump syntax in `.mtl` files coming from Maya LT), even though THREE.MeshPhongMaterial supports quite a bit.

Fun find in the process though, Autodesk's free [FBX Review](http://www.autodesk.com/products/fbx/fbx-review) viewer displays `.obj` and `.mtl` files, and hopefully is a good sanity check on whether the files themselves are just nonstandard (which is sometimes also the problem with free models online..)
 Progress! Sort of.

I'm having a bad time with bumpmaps in OBJ/MTL in general, even with Autodesk FBX Review.

But, the THREE.js JSON formats seem pretty reliable. And converting other formats to THREE.js isn't too bad, there are [THREE.js converters](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/utils), [exporters for different modeling software](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/utils/exporters), and [Clara.io](https://clara.io/) which is working fine + free.

Wrote up a [three-model](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/misc/three-model.js) component to load those in A-Frame, and have a quick test with bump maps working.
  ## Description:

Fixes #975, #848, #543. ~~Includes @bnolan's PR #1056 for pointerlock.~~

Proposed in #975, this attempts to address a couple issues:
1. Integrating third-party controls is a bit problematic.
2. Adding pointerlock as an option (default or no) would be awesome.
3. If a physics implementation is added, collision detection on the player would be a nice-to-have. The abstraction makes this much easier.
## Changes proposed:
- Add `controls` component to fetch user input from input device components and apply position/rotation to the object.
- Add device-specific components `wasd-controls`, ~~`gamepad-controls`~~, ~~`touch-controls` (touch-to-move)~~, `hmd-controls`, and `mouse-controls`. Probably not all of these should be enabled by default, but they could be.
- ~~Adds `velocity` component to update position over time. (Not necessary to the PR, but makes physics integration easier).~~
### Usage:

**Default:**

``` html
<a-entity camera controls></a-entity>
```

**Custom:**

``` html
<a-entity camera controls="rotation: custom-controls hmd-controls gamepad-controls mouse-controls"></a-entity>
```
## Interface:
### Controls Component

No exposed interface, but the basic implementation is:
1. Iterate over rotation controls, by order of precedence, finding first active control and setting rotation. 
2. Iterate over movement controls, by order of precedence, and get velocity relative to heading.
3. Apply rotation to velocity, to get absolute velocity.
4. Set velocity.

Developers can modify the `movement` and `rotation` properties to enable/disable input devices, or change the order of precedence.
### Movement Controls
- **isVelocityActive()** – _(required)_ Returns true if this control is actively in use. For example, a connected gamepad should return false unless the left joystick is tilted.
- **getVelocityDelta(dt)** – Returns an incremental THREE.Vector3 velocity change, with values [-1,1]. In general, this will affect the X and Z axes.
- **getVelocity()** – Returns a self-sufficient THREE.Vector3 velocity. May not be necessary, I can't think of a need.
### Rotation Controls
- **isRotationActive()** – _(required)_ Returns true if the control is actively in use. For example, mouse controls would only return true if the mouse is currently moving. HMD controls can probably return true any time an HMD is detected.
- **getRotationDelta(dt)** – Returns an incremental THREE.Vector2 rotation change, with X and Y rotation values. To be roughly calibrated, these should be near the range [-1,1].
- **getRotation()** – Returns a self-sufficient THREE.Vector3 (XYZ euler) world orientation, in degrees.
## Pending:
- [x] I'm assuming `controls` should inject the other components if they aren't present, rather than specifying all 5-6 in HTML.
- [x] Need to polyfill KeyboardEvent.code, which tangentially happens to fix #333 (ZQSD controls) in Chrome.
- :heavy_multiplication_x:  ~~Maybe `mouse-controls` should be split into mousedrag and pointerlock components?~~
- [x] Inject velocity component automatically
- [x] Deprecate look-controls and wasd-controls.
- [x] Rename movement -> position
- [x] Update all examples to use the new controls.
- [x] Update the default camera configuration in `systems/camera.js`.
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Unit tests
- [ ] Resolve conflicts with #1474 
- [ ] Consider adding `touch-controls` back in.
## Demos:
- Within A-Frame, updated the "Controls" demo.
- [Wall collision detection](https://sandbox.donmccurdy.com/vr/walls/) with gamepad/wasd/touch movement.
- [Motion sickness-inducing physics demo](https://sandbox.donmccurdy.com/vr/playground/) with ramps and moving platforms, because hey why not.

Side note, on physics integration, the wrapper around input controls is actually less critical than the `velocity` component. An example implementation (2nd and 3rd demos above) is [kinematic-body.js](https://github.com/donmccurdy/sandbox-aframe/blob/master/src/physics/kinematic-body.js), and the key need is having access to rotation/position/velocity data.
 - Added `AFRAME.registerComponent()` :white_check_mark: 
- `controls` is good. :white_check_mark: 
- ~~re: "universal-controls as a dependency" – I was hoping to do the opposite of that, and have `universal-controls` append the others if they're missing. But I don't think I can do that through the dependencies, since we'll only know which controls are specified as properties at init().~~
- ~~`default-control-scheme`, I don't think I understand how that would work? But yes it would be nice for them to be added automatically.~~
- ~~Still need to find a way to inject missing controls when user only specifies `controls`.~~ :white_check_mark:  
- ~~Renaming `controls="movement: ..."` to `controls="position: ..."`. I might disagree here - "position" sounds good, but "positionEnabled" and "positionAcceleration" don't make much sense. Maybe "motion", which very helpfully almost rhymes with "rotation"?~~ 

---

General update – Added an `AFRAME.registerComponent()` and a `controls` system. The abstraction and the systems API seem really nice (props there!). ~~My only issue is that the controls system doesn't actually have anything to do.. It categorizes controls just fine, but then the `controls` component already has a list of movement/rotation controls in its schema, so it doesn't really need to use the system. Maybe the system provides an active input controls, if any, to the controls component?~~ The system currently just supports validation.
 Updated the "pending" list in original post, I think those two things are all I have in mind. 
 Oh, yes docs would be key. I'll at least start them in this CL then.
 Quick update, I've patched `<a-camera/>` and all of the examples. Remaining TODOs are updating Documentation and writing unit tests. Is it worth it to start on those now, or want to iterate on the API more or do a more line-by-line review first?

EDIT: Also, I can't reproduce the crashing-on-enabling-pointerlock thing you mentioned. :/
 First pass at docs (for the component, not the controls system) up now. Didn't seem like enough content to merit separate pages or a new section, but open to ideas.
 Some unit tests added now, but still need to get the HMD position tracking in there.
 I think I'm caught up. The core functionality all has unit tests, and `hmd-controls` has positional tracking (which I haven't manually tested, but THREE.VRControls makes it seem pretty simple).

Maybe still some API questions to resolve:
1. The parent `controls` will reorient `getVelocityDelta` to the rotation heading, but not `getVelocity` (used only by `hmd-controls`). That's possibly unclear from the names, but makes sense in context.
2. Use of "position" (e.g. `controls="positionEnabled: true"`) and "velocity" (e.g. `component.isVelocityActive()`) feels inconsistent. Not sure what names to use that would be both meaningful and consistent, though.
 **re: getVelocity[Delta] and heading** So far, four components update position: hmd, gamepad, keyboard, and touch. The last three (using `getVelocityDelta`) all are relative to heading – pressing <kbd>W</kbd> or <kbd>DPAD_UP</kbd> should move in the direction you're looking, not just `z=-1`. But HMD position changes (using `getVelocity`) are absolute. 

But now that I think about it maybe that's fine. The word "delta" implies that it's a change from some original velocity, whereas `getVelocity` does not.
 Ok, not sure what you mean about steps (like, simulated bipedal lurching?) - i assume that's to eliminate any misconceptions that WASD is acceptable for VR lol? Anyway, pushed `keyboard-controls` back up and removed it from the default set.
 re: `getPosition` -  yeah i'm ok with that, just makes it a bit trickier to detect imminent collisions in physics land later on. we could always compute a velocity based on that `getPosition()` result, so that the component author doesn't need to worry about scaling by `1000/dt` (to counter the scaling in `velocity`) themselves.

~~re: comfort snap controls – cool. Ideally that would use `getRotationDelta()` I think - maybe we shouldn't scale the delta by `dt / 1000` so it's absolute? Or maybe you just account for that in your component. This all sounds like it can fit in the controls framework OK though.~~ Oops no, it's not scaled by `dt / 1000` like I thought.
 Guess I was wrong about rotation – it's already absolute. `getRotation()` does update yaw/pitch now, so if your comfort controls are using `getRotationDelta` I think you should be good.

I'd agree that HMD + Vive controllers are the main use cases, but it would be nice to be able to support third-party flat experience controls. Added `getPosition`, and `hmd-controls` are now using that. It converts position to velocity under the hood. Focus being on HMD controls, this is hitting the limit of what I can actually test with just a Cardboard. Hoping to have my HMD in a couple weeks.
 Ok that sounds good, done.
 Great! I haven't had the chance to read through the WebVR 1.0 changes but will do this soon. I got my Rift yesterday ( 🎉 ) so I can test the positional tracking as well now.
 Rebased to to the WebVR 1.0 changes – starting on updating `hmd-controls` now.

Also, somehow we ended up with `rotation-enabled` and `position-controls-enabled` .. those should both be `*-controls-enabled` i think right?
 Will profile on performance a bit, my first thought would be maybe `velocity` is updating before the controls component, or after `position`, and so the HMD is delayed by 1 frame? Is there logic somewhere that makes sure position/rotation have updates from all the components before they're applied? Maybe we need that for velocity.

Reasoning on `getPositionDelta` is that the player might not start at 0,0,0 in the scene, so `hmd-controls` can't necessarily return an absolute position. Unless we just want it to initialize with `getAttribute('position')` i guess. The flow now:
1. `hmd-controls` gets position from the HMD.
2. `hmd-controls` compares position to last position, and returns the delta.
3. `controls` sets `velocity` from the delta (`velocity = delta * 1000 / dt`).
4. `velocity` updates `position`.

EDIT: Which is exactly what you said on the flow anyway lol, yeah.
 Ah this gets back to what you said about not wanting any easing with the HMD though. Hm. Maybe we should just turn off easing by default anyway? Or I'm fine w/ going back to `getPosition`, but `hmd-controls` would need to ~~be re-zeroed if you teleport or something~~ check current position on every tick.
 Velocity won't keep going if HMD loses tracking - easing is very slight, so you'd stop almost instantly. I think removing easing (or just default=none) would be no problem; might as well let the input component do that if it's needed.

Jank-wise, it does look like the velocity component is consistently `tick()`'ing before controls. So the HMD is a frame behind. Is there anything in place to force `position` to update later, and can we do the same for `velocity`? Maybe position/rotation/velocity should be part of a system or something.
 Sounds good. I had to solve a similar problem with my [physics system](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/physics/system/physics.js#L66-L79) using an `addBehavior(<component>, <phase>)` API, but that might be overkill here.
 That sounds fine, I'll pull out velocity.

You mentioned getting some jank from hmd-controls – is that rotation, position, or both? I'm not noticing anything definite, but if it's rotation then there's an issue unrelated to velocity we'll want to track down...
 Removed velocity, that seems pretty harmless. I also just turned easing off by default – maybe that was the issue with the jank feeling? I'll test that out in a bit.
 Found the latency problem-- `hmd-controls::tick()` was called _after_ `controls::tick()`, so HMD updates were out of sync. Might want a different solution once #1437 is resolved, but for now I've moved the main controls update into the controls system, so that it's guaranteed to happen after `hmd-controls` has had a chance to update its `THREE.VRControls` instance.
 Updated w/ ____ControlsEnabled → _____Enabled renaming.

One other change, at least in the current state of things — `hmd-controls` and `mouse-controls` do not support touch events, whereas `look-controls` does. I removed that while the touch-to-move component was in the PR, which has since been removed. Do we want touch events back?
  Should close up issue #1216. Increased default segmentsTheta and segmentsTubular to make round primitives more round (or smooth).
 segmentsPhi is actually how many triangles are rendered per SegmentsTheta (how many segments built for each trapezoid (?) that makes up the ring) so it doesn't make the circle more round, at least according to the docs.
 Thanks for the heads up, I'll make sure to remember that next time!
  **Description:** Plane and box primitives now have default width, height, and depth of 1

**Changes proposed:**
- change geometry component and docs

for real this time!
 No problem, I guess I'll have to go read Pro Git now
  Changed geometry.js and amended docs
 Noticed additional changes to make aside from geometry.md, want to make sure I didn't miss anything else
 Sorry, I'm new at this (have only used Mercurial solo in the past). I thought I'd close it, then reopen after I fixed the commits on my repo. I guess it doesn't work that way?
 I can't re-open, so I'll open a new one. Thanks for the help!
  Changed from 8 to 32. Also changed the documentation for geometry to reflect changes in src.
  I just had this issue while learning how to develop for aframe (found the answer here, thanks!). I imagine this is also what many non-developers may be experiencing.
  Cvan, have you published the WIP build that adds the padding to the bottom of the html? I'm having the same issue on a build that we are about to go public, and while not ideal, at least being able to "swipe" to remove the URL bar is better than the offset (low) stereoscopic rendering due to the URL bar For those interested, the temp/crude solution as described is to create scrolling and that gets rid of address bar.

for example 

`var html = document.getElementsByTagName('HTML');
html[0].style.position = 'initial';
                        html[0].style.overflow = 'scroll';
                        var canvas = document.querySelector('.a-canvas');
                        canvas.style.top = '1000px';` Is anything being done on this? It's quite a critical problem for us. @cvan Unfortunately unless I'm reading it wrong that PR only seems to add support to what's already there for android webviews. We are trying to fix the full screen / urlbar issue on ios in safari and chrome (on iphone 5/SE, though i believe the reason chrome doesn't work is different to why safari doesn't work) @cvan Thanks for that - yeah we've already added that add to home screen component, and that works, we're just trying to find ways with less friction.

For anyone else coming across this, this is what we've found definitively:

*IOS on iphone 5, 5S, SE*
- Chrome and Firefox and safari all refuse to hide their url bars / go full screen 

*IOS on iphone 6+*
- Chrome and Firefox still refuse to hide their url bars / go full screen
- Safari works great and hides the url bars

*Android on various*
- Chrome, Firefox and Samsung browsers work great and hide their url bars.

We've tried all the hacks - scrollTo, the hack mentioned in the @renhyl 's comment above, and everything else we could find online. There's currently no proper solution to this on iOS, other than to use the pin to homescreen option - whereupon full screen works just fine.

We also came across some weirdness implementing @renhyl 's code above as it would work to hide the scrollbars, but exiting VR was buggy and sometimes impossible. All in all it detracts from the user experience and we decided pinning was the least friction causing option.

Our app is in latest A-Frame, and ios versions were 9 and 10. @ngokevin @cvan, I don't think @MagicIndustries should need to leverage the homescreen in this scenario unless this is a specific-to-iOS Chrome bug. I have a working demo in-browser with inline video + audio etc. fullscreen on iOS10 Safari and Android Chrome. It's very smooth without downloading to the homescreen. 

My only issue at the moment is bulleted above -- iOS chrome does not get rid of the URL bar when going landscape *or* when going into VR mode. 

This will cause the renderer to squash and look weird. I cannot recreate the issue using Chrome's simulator for iPhones, but it's consistent on the real hardware.

_Update: Confirmed with iOS 10, iPhone 6S on current iOS Chrome build using aframe.io examples. Not sure if I'm misunderstanding what Google considers 'fullscreen' but it seems like this should work https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/fullscreen/. Also can't confirm if this issue happens in Android Browser + Android Chrome but I don't think it does._

 I'll add that even hacks that go fullscreen on the iphone 6/6s/7 will sometimes not work on the 6plus and 7plus.  Because Apple treats the plus as some sort of super-mini iPad (it's like the worst of both worlds, I hope the iPhone8 acts like a phone, not like this).    I'm in

 PR: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1270
  So, anything more happen with this.  I was looking at shadertoy this week, and was thinking how completely awesome it would be to have an AFrame component to simply using shadertoy shaders in AFrame.  It seems that the core part of using shadertoy shaders is setting up the extra shader inputs;  a component that took care of this for you would be make it much easier for folks to create shaders there and leverage them in AFrame.  

I could imagine going further, and using the shadertoy api so that you could just put the URL/ID of the shader as a parameter and the component could pull it directly. Well, _I'm_ interested, but that doesn't mean it's a priority for y'all. :)

There appear to be a bunch of uniforms and so forth missing that a typical shadertoy shader looks for  (e.g., 
```uniform vec3      iResolution;
uniform float     iGlobalTime;
uniform float     iChannelTime[4];
uniform vec4      iMouse;
uniform vec4      iDate;
uniform float     iSampleRate;
uniform vec3      iChannelResolution[4];
uniform int       iFrame;
uniform float     iTimeDelta;
uniform float     iFrameRate;
struct Channel
{
    vec3  resolution;
    float time;
};
uniform Channel iChannel[4];
uniform sampler2D iChannel0;
uniform sampler2D iChannel1;
uniform sampler2D iChannel2;
uniform sampler2D iChannel3;
```
) which is why I was asking what the status was.  Or, do you assume folks will just change references to these in the shader? I was looking at posts like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36983769/export-from-shadertoy-to-three-js

Anyway, I'm not encouraging you to spend time on this;  was just curious if more had been done on it, in case I decide to poke more at it. while we're on the subject (I had forgotten all about it) did you want to do something with ShaderFrog too?

http://codepen.io/machenmusik/pen/WRLjxK  Cool, I was also thinking it would be useful to get the full intersection data in events. I got it working in my cursor-hitpoint branch, with an example: https://github.com/amberroy/aframe/commit/593ab4c   
  **Description:**

Add uv attribute to detail in click event.

**Changes proposed:**
- Add uv attribute to detail in click event.
- Don't propagate uv attribute up to parent elements
  A second data point for Windows 10 with Edge:
- Most run fine (e.g. Hello World).
- Anime UI loads but from a [different perspective](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9kmhkXbM5H8WDF0OWFjVVoxWWs/view?usp=sharing) (?). A similar thing happens with the "Shopping" and "Logo" demos.
- Cursor & Hover runs, but the cube does not change when I look at it (as it does on Chrome).

The change in perspective in the Anime UI example made me curious. Changing the camera position to "1.75 1 1.2" and then back to default fixes it. Also the div that holds "exit VR" is duplicated many times. Weird. 
  I'm using Angular 2 and did npm install aframe --save-dev to include it in my node_modules.

In the index.html I include the script <script src="node_modules/aframe/dist/aframe.min.js"></script>

and I use aframe in one of my htmls as follows: 
<a-scene>
    <a-sky src="image_location.jpg" rotation="0 -130 0"></a-sky>
</a-scene>
- A-Frame Version: "^0.1.3"
- Platform/Device: Tried it on MacOS and Ubuntu 14.4
 For navigating through my application generally. Instead of clicking once on any button I have to click twice to go to the next page regardless if it has the VR image or not.

Anyway, I upgraded the version of aframe from 0.1.3 to 0.2.0-rc1 that was added two days ago. And now it doesn't do it anymore (It navigates normally with one click).

Thanks,

Ahmed
 So the flow is as follows:
1) running the home page 
2) clicking on a button to go to the html that has the a-frame tags and shows me the VR photo.
3) There are some other pages of info and static data non a-frame related

Using 0.1.3 version of aframe, once the script is included in my index.html. The whole application becomes slower and I should click on the button twice to navigate to the a-frame image.

I tested this in the Xcode iOS simulator and an iPhone 6, did not get a chance to test a 6S or newer devices.
 I'm not sure. I didn't know that was an issue, but I can try to setup a test. Do you know if it is only a problem with Webkit based web views on iOS or if it also affects Twitter's Android app?
  Here's a working example (it's using the version of aframe installed with `npm install mozvr/aframe#dev`:

https://desolate-island-90618.herokuapp.com/#!/

It has the same structure as the official Panorama example: https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/template-sky/

But if you click the VR button while on a phone, you just see one image instead of two.

Is this a bug or there's something wrong with my setup?
 I did `npm install aframevr/aframe`. It works: https://desolate-island-90618.herokuapp.com/#!/

Thanks again, this is the fastest-replying repos I've seen.
  I'm experiencing the same issue on iPhone 5. 
 @ngokevin, fair enough.
 How slow is "laggy"? <30 FPS?
 @ngokevin hmm, I get >30 FPS with Anime UI on my HTC One M8 using Chrome. However, I did notice instability (browser crashes) and stuttering with Firefox.

edit: tested the same demo on a Nexus 4 and it ran even smoother in Chrome (lower res.) and slower in Firefox (~10 FPS).

Here's a copy of Anime UI (with stats turned on) [for others to try](http://www.wsundine.com/a-frame/mobile-perf)
  With the current code when an animation is removed from a component the animated property is set to the initial value.

This behavior could not be the desired one in some cases, i.e: when you want to stop an animation before it ends keeping the property value. Maybe I´m wrong and there is a better way for doing this, let me know in that case.

See https://github.com/IagoLast/totem for a working example when this feature could be used.
(Note that totem uses a modified a-frame version where the `setInitialValue` line was commented.)
 @dmarcos yep, for me this would be the expected behavior
  Changes proposed:
- Iterate up object tree to the element that is attached to the dom.
 Ok sweet, made those changes! :+1: 
  It'd be great if the [original event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Events/click) (with shiftKey, screenX, screenY) was passed to the node that registers for `onClick` as an `originalEvent` property. I tried adding this to `cursor.js` but thought you might have a better idea of how to do this?
 Something like:

```
  document.querySelector('a-entity').addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    alert(e.originalEvent.shiftKey);
  });
```

To detect when someone shift-clicks on an element, or uses the second mouse button, etc.

emitted possibly when the asset finishes loading but before it is processed
and rendered. If that's true, maybe it means we need another event?

 To add a bit:

In the case that all the assets are loaded from the disk cache, the "loaded" event either doesn't fire or fires so early on that it's hard to set up another event handler at such a place in the load sequence that you can actually catch the event happening.

One solution could be just to add a flag "assetsLoaded" somewhere under AFRAME. that is globally visible. That flag would be set when the "loaded" event is triggered. That way we can skip setting up listeners in case assets are already loaded.



 `<a-assets>`
`<a-asset-item id="model-obj" src="the-source..."></a-asset-item>`
`<a-asset-item id="model-mtl" src="another-source..."></a-asset-item>`
`</a-assets>`

`document.querySelector('#model').addEventListener('model-loaded', function() {`
`   console.log('loaded');`
`});`

UPDATE:
That works, according to https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/obj-model.js#L51

The event is called 'model-loaded' not 'loaded'. And I have to listen on the entity which represents the model, not the asset. I don't think model-loaded is the right event name. A-frame docs say it is "loaded" but the bug persists. The event is fired way before the model is loaded. See `model-loaded` in https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/components/obj-model.html  Description: I added a loading event listener on <a-assets> per @ngokevin's advice, and received two events even though I had one asset.

Also, we should clearly define whether adding a listener on a-assets sends a notification for each loaded asset or a single one once all assets are loaded.
- A-Frame Version: master
- Platform/Device: Mac OS X, Firefox Dev Edition 46

Code:

`<a-assets>
  <a-asset-item id="n-obj" src="nefertiti.obj"></a-asset-item>
</a-assets>`

`<script>
  document.querySelector('a-assets').addEventListener('loaded', function() {
    console.log('assets loaded')
  });
</script>`
 Btw, I changed networks from slow (office) to fast (home) and I cannot
reproduce this in a fast network. Even more interesting, I'm loading the
asset from the localhost webserver.

  Changes proposed:
- Fix a small typo in the Animations docs
  It would be useful if entities that are defined as using components which don't exist yet would get those components automatically added to them once they've been registered.

For example:

``` html
<a-entity somecomponent="foo: true"></a-entity>
```

`somecomponent` hasn't been reigstered yet, so it's not active, but is tracked somehow by the system.

``` javascript
AFRAME.registerComponent("somecomponent", {
  init: function(){
    // Wow!
  }
});
```

As soon as the component gets registered, it'll be attached to the entity that previously registered it.

The main use would be components loaded asynchronously (say, from a registry) or maybe components that are being generated dynamically via some dark voodoo magic.
 sounds good but what about dependencies, how would they get honored? If components register asynchronously there will be issues, I think that promises fit here somehow
 Also topological sorting could be applied to the dependencies graph to calculate the registration order
 If registration is expressed with promises, as new component definitions come in asynchronously, the dependencies defined in them can produce more promises and then it's all a matter of chaining them
 Maybe depending on a component could be sync if it already exists, and have a deferred promise if it doesn't exist yet, which can resolve after something registers that component?
 A-few initial questions (not sure if I will have the time to contribute, but am going to try): 
- What would be the most minimal example of this?
- Will this be handled differently based on type of component?  For example:
- \* <a-hyperbolic-star></a-hyperbolic-star>
- \* <a-box turn-into-a-hyperbolic-star="resolution:20;"><a-box>
- \* <a-hyperbolic-grouping-thing><a-box></a-box></a-hyperbolic-grouping-thing>
- \* (etc?)
- Where would this functionality live in the existing code?  Are there any requirements/suggestions around how it should be hooked into the existing system?
 I think combining your suggestion about keeping lists of entities that need component initialization along with promises that resolve to component definitions could do the trick here. When an entity requests an unknown component it creates an entry in a map, allocates a new list and puts the element in. At the same time a promise is created that when resolved with the definition it would iterate the list and initialize the components on each entity contained therein. Some checking would be required because the entity may have removed the attribute in the meantime. If a component definition contains dependencies then these would create more promises and the processing of all of these should be chainable with Promise.all(). I feel this could work and I'd love to give it a try but right now I'm very tied down with work.
  A client recently complained that mouse movement in A-Frame felt wrong compared to ie. mouse movement in YouTube's and Facebook's 360 videos. He want to "drag" the canvas around with the mouse, rather than to "push" it. He also wanted a slightly faster movement for the mouse, as he felt the experience was a bit "sluggish" with the default setting.

Changes proposed:
- Add a property called reverseMouseMovement to the look-controls component with a default of false. When set to true, mouse movement will work reversed.
- Add a property called mouseMovementSpeed to the look-controls component with a default of 0.002 - the current hardcoded setting.

I was unable to find any tests that covers the look-controls component, so I have not included any tests for my change.
 @dmarcos I think it would be very useful to have configuration for wasd-controls in. 

@ngokevin Sure, I already did, the solution with both modifications is live at vrlab.dk, and my custom look controls look like this: https://github.com/RSpace/vr-lab/blob/master/src/js/utils/custom-look-controls.js

But I'd prefer not to have duplicate 99% of look-controls next time :)
 @ngokevin What does that mean? What should I do?
  A client recently complained that you could only move horizontally, not vertically, with touch. I see a comment about explicitly only allowing horizontal touch movement, but I don't understand why.

Changes proposed:
- Add a property called allowVerticalTouchMovement to the look-controls component.
- allowVerticalTouchMovement defaults to false.
- When explicitly set to true, vertical touch movement will also work.

I'd be happy to submit another PR where vertical movement is always allowed, but I didn't want to break the defaults when there might be a good reason for it being as it is.

I was unable to find any tests that covers the look-controls component, so I have not included any tests for my change.
 Fair enough, that's why the PR is adding a setting where it's disabled by
default. Let's at least make it an option, I think it works fine on vrlab.dk
?

  I think there is a typo in the Animations documentation for the fading cube example.

Currently:

``` html
<a-entity id="fading-cube" geometry="primitive: box" material="opacity: 1">
  <a-animation attribute="material.opacity" begin="fade" to="2 2 2"></a-animation>
</a-entity>
```

The `to="2 2 2"` should be `to="0"` or `to="0.0"` I think?

I can throw up a PR to fix it.
  vec2 only showed up in 4 places in the repo, two were commented out examples and the other two were the switch where Vector2 is created with threejs in src/core/shader and the other is where vec2 is initialized in src/core/propertyType.

I installed and ran aframe after I made changes and opened up a few of the boiler plates and showcase (figuring lightroom would have plenty of shaders in it).

@larouxn also tested saying: "Cloned it myself. Ran the npm test tests, started the server, and checked out a few examples. No errors anywhere as far as I can tell."
 @ngokevin and @dmarcos thanks for helping me clean up this mess!
  I would argue .DS_Store and node_modules are unnecessary additions as they're already in the .gitignore and thus can never be committed in the first place. However, .npmignore is a good addition.

 Thanks @larouxn! Opened a pull request for this against the Master branch.
  Added a .npmignore that stops `npm install` from downloading the tests and examples folders. Do we still want tests cloned via npm? Do most users embedding A-Frame in their project use the tests? Is there anything besides examples that we want ignored? I suppose the ignoring may be able to be done within the package.json instead.

Note: this does not stop `git clone` from grabbing tests and examples.

On Android, stereo upon clicking the "Enter VR" button is not working
```

Worked for me o_O
 I tested Chrome 48.0.2564.95 on Android (Nexus 5x) and entering VR caused the app to go full screen, but no stereo.

On Firefox 45.0 for Android, entering VR caused a crash report dialog. Still trying to figure out if I can get a stack trace from the example before it goes down.
 Any progress on this? I'm noticing that on my iPhone 6S the latest aframe does not do splitscreen.
  Good day,

How i can disable on passing through objects or plane?
  @cvan But `x-tag` requires additional polyfills for mainstream browsers for now. Maybe too early to use this name?
  Same to https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1119
 @larouxn I am going to answer you here of #1119 why. If you have `npm install` before, then you are using a v1.1.0 which defines their dependencies more explicitly, This is, you have `lolex` and some other ones installed before. Now they shifted to v1.2.0 and only put them into `peerDependencies` that wouldn't install by default. A fresh install would reproduce.
  yeah, the third time :0
 @ngokevin Shall rebase soon.
 All cleared.
   You may want to reopen this PR against Master. The Dev branch was deprecated yesterday. [397e05d](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/commit/397e05dd83535023eb5f07dde7549f45eb0b845b)

Strangely, I wasn't able to reproduce the `Error: Cannot find module 'lolex'` error running `npm test`.

  I propose adding a `fit-texture` component, that automatically scales planes with textures (eg. `a-image`) to fit the image texture without distortions.

Right now, the user has to manually set the width and height if they don't want the image to appear stretched. This is not ergonomic or intuitive, as newcomers to aframe would possibly expect the behaviour of standard html `img` elements, that display images undistorted. Even with the knowledge, it's not really efficient to set dimensions by hand.

The `fit-texture` should be applied to `a-image` by default and can optionally set to other `a-entitites` and may be disabled on `a-image`'s by setting`fit-texture="false"`.
It is possible to set only one side (width or height), and the component will scale the other one accordingly.
If both sides are set, the component will use `width` as base side and emit a warning that it doesn't make sense to set width and height, unless you set `fit-texture="false"`.

I kept thinking wether it is necessary to merge this component into master or not. But I think it adds much needed comfort to use image textures in aframe. Take a look at `examples/primitives/images`!
In future, we might want to approach this differently, but at the moment I thought I'd leave this here for you to discuss/decide :)
 @ngokevin 

> Then maybe once we have lazy-loading curated components, this won't even need to be a standard component. Does that sound alright?

The lazy-loading for curated components sounds really interesting!
But somehow I still feel images and videos should default to being un-stretched/un-distorted, how ever this may be accomplished in the end (this component or else). But I also understand that you want to keep the core functionality to a certain limit and avoid potential clutter.
Not so easy, but that's why I opened this issue, to discuss how to deal with this.

PS: With some minor adjustments the component should work for video textures too.
 @dmarcos You are right, it's more problematic with non-rectangular geometries.

> If we are going to implement a fit-texture it should be implemented at the material component level`

I was wondering about that. The _fit-texture_ functionality needs to change the geometry (width/height eg), so that the texture fits nicely. Now, If implementing _fit-texture_ into _material_ as you suggest,  _geometry_ would need to know, wether there is a texture loaded, and if thats the case, use its properties to apply changes. Unless we want to change geometries from inside _material_, which I am not sure about, wether thats good/clean.

Would it therefore not be better to make it a part of the `geometry` component, instead of the `material` component? like so:
- if _material_ loads a texture, save it (or it's dimensions) somewhere.
- if _geometry_ updates at some point, it takes a look if it has a _fit-texture_ property/attribute (or registers a listener for texture changes?)
  - if _geometry_ has _fit-texture_: check if there is a saved texture.
    - if there is a saved texture: use it to apply transformations based on the specified geometry (plane, sphere, torus)

What do you think? From an user point of view, it feels more intuitive to use _fit-texture_ via the _material_ component. But from an implementation pov it makes more sense to do it inside _geometry_? Does that make sense?
 @ngokevin personally I disagree, but that's totally ok :)
Had a lot to do recently and got distracted with other projects and haven't had this PR on my mind anymore. Will do some more fun stuff with aframe again in the future though!
 @ngokevin 
I understand your reasoning, and in your shoes I might have decided the same way.

> Would be awesome if you can publish it in a repo or code snippet!

Sure thing, I put it on my todo list!
 Here you go, the NPM package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-fit-texture-component

    a-entity's `removestate` expects `is` to return the index of the state it's searching for (or false if not found). Change 46990787ada92f62af3ddde1869a077125107811 updated `is` to return true if the state is found rather than the state's index, which breaks `removestate`. Now, `removestate` does not remove the correct state if the state exists.

I think the fix here is to revert 46990787ada92f62af3ddde1869a077125107811.

This issue effects the cursor's hover functionality, and likely other important scenarios that rely on state changes.

 squarshed em!
  There's no option to disable video loop. Please add `loop="false"`.
  Example:

```
<a-sky class="pano" opacity="1" position="-9999" transparent="true" id="pano-1" src="/pano-0.jpg?1a2f7bc" material="color:#FFF;shader:flat;src:url(/pano-0.jpg?1a2f7bc);opacity:1;transparent:true" geometry="primitive:sphere;radius:5000;segmentsWidth:64;segmentsHeight:64" scale="-1 1 1">
</a-sky>
<a-sky class="pano active" opacity="0" position="0" transparent="true" id="pano-2" src="/pano-00.jpg?fdf7a6f" material="color:#FFF;shader:flat;src:url(/pano-00.jpg?fdf7a6f);opacity:0;transparent:true" geometry="primitive:sphere;radius:5000;segmentsWidth:64;segmentsHeight:64" scale="-1 1 1">
</a-sky>
```

In the code above `#pano-1` won't show. Instead, you'll see only white (`#pano-2`'s white shader?).

Is this a bug or `a-sky` can't be transparent?
 I ran into the same issue recently. While I'm not sure if it is supposed to be possible to set opacity on a-sky elements, creating a plain a-entity that worked like an a-sky ended up working for me:

``` html
<a-entity id="sky" geometry="primitive: sphere;radius: 5000" material="side: back; src: url(./pano.jpg); repeat:-1 1" ></a-entity>
```

You should then be able to change the opacity by doing something like:

``` javascript
document.querySelector("#sky").setAttribute("material", "opacity", 0.5);
```
 @ngokevin , I don't see how your point is pertinent to the transparency issue. I am still experiencing this. Can you reopen this card?

I tried the @K4orta solution, didn't work.

I also built my own shader, and as soon as the opacity is less than 1, the object disappears from the scene. The only way to fix this is setting the material="depth:false", but this generates other problems for me.


It is not related to the shader or the geometry, it is something related to the render :( Thanks for clarifying @donmccurdy. 

For my case, where I have several a-sky switching opacity when a user interacts, some of them with transparent PNGs and others with transparent 3D objects, I think I will leave the issue behind, I spent 2 days trying to fix this :( There seems to be no perfect solution.  - Fix the Enter VR Modal so that it stays open when trying to click the Learn More link.

   Is it possible to do this in some way? I noticed that using normal CSS doesn't work.

How to, for example, hide and show the elements with CSS?
 @dmarcos Oh, okay. Thanks for the info (I found out though that the attributes for `material` are exactly like CSS. So I'm using those.)
 > properties on CSS are discarded by many browsers

@dmarcos Is that statement outdated? MDN says that [all the modern browsers support custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*#Browser_compatibility).

> We would have recreated CSS with complete different semantics.

That's totally fine. For example, SVG has `fill`, `stroke`, `stroke-width`, etc, which are SVG-specific. A-Frame-specific properties would be fine.

> background, padding or border have unlabeled complex values but it would be very confusing in the case of components

Instead of `background` you might have `--material-texture`, etc.

Just an idea, but

```html
<a-entity light="color: #AFA; intensity: 1.5" position="-1 1 0"></a-entity>
```

could be written as

```css
/* apply to all a-entity elements  */
a-entity {
  --light: color: #AFA, intensity: 1.5;
  --position: -1 1 0;
}
```

With simple parsing of the property values, you'd apply them just like with attribute values. This is, in fact, very similar to SVG where some features that can be specified via attributes can also be specified via CSS. In SVG:

```html
<rect transform="rotate(45 50 50)"></rect>
```

or

```css
/* apply to all rects in a similar way with CSS */
rect {
  transform: rotate(45deg) transform-origin: 50px 50px;
}
```

---

TLDR: it's totally doable from what I can tell! By the way, I saw @ngokevin's MSS, which is similar and useful!

I also forgot to mention that it's simple to get the property values to JS: 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables#Values_in_JavaScript

This could be done in a `MutationObserver` callback that observes a stylesheet for changes. > Have you tried a MutationObserver on a stylesheet? I could not apply them to CSSStyleRule elements.

I believe you'd have to watch for changes in `characterData`.

> What would be the advantage of using CSS over the current mixins mechanism?

Maybe that the property syntax is official, part of CSS, so more flexible. One example: styles for regular elements as well as a-frame elements can be contained inside a single stylesheet. There's existing tooling for CSS (stylus, less, sass, postCSS, JSinCSS, etc).

> Why does `visibility: hidden;` not work? Mixins are close enough to CSS, we can break expectations and we don't have to support all the functionality and intricacies of traditional style sheets.

That's true and a good point. It's not easy to tell Custom Elements how to behave whenever they have `display: none` if those elements render with WebGL rather than with normal DOM styling. Downsides are less tooling for MSS and something new to learn (a designer may already know CSS, and now needs to learn MSS). Regardless, MSS is super nice, I definitely have to say! Inspiring. :)  There was a space in the `wasd- controls-enabled` attribute which ended up evaluating to `wasd-="" controls-enabled="false"` which isn't valid.
 It looks like it's already fixed on master :sweat_smile:

~~Will file an issue.~~ edit: @legendtang was faster: #1097
 Here we go for this! We need a better way to stringify those types indeed.
 Close due to dev deprecated.
  Enabling manipulations of objects based on loaded texture, like actual/native image width and height.

You could do stuff like:

``` .html
<a-image id="testimg" width="10" src="test.png"> </a-image>
```

to set the base width of the image, and then:

``` .js
var testimg = document.getDocumentById('testimg')
testimg.addEventListener('material-texture-loaded', function (e) {
  var widthHeightRatio = e.detail.texture.image.height / e.detail.texture.image.width
  var width = testimg.getAttribute('width')
  testimg.setAttribute('height', width * widthHeightRatio)
});
```

To dynamically set the height to fit the image texture.
I am testing this behaviour in a component called `fit-texture` to make `a-images` etc. automatically fit the image texture once it's loaded, without explicitly setting `width` and `height`.

Btw: We need a way to let the user to use image textures without them having knowledge about the actual dimensions of an image to look good when rendering. The example above is a bit hacky my taste, but works until we have a better solution.

Either way, It's useful to have the texture in the event detail.
 @dmarcos done! Haven't done commit squashing before, learned a new thing today :)

I noticed it was reported in https://github.com/kmees/karma-sinon-chai/issues/26 and the latest version has fixed the issue. So it is time to bump this dependency version?
 In the meantime, doing a manual `npm install lolex chai sinon sinon-chai` worked for me to start `karma`/`npm test`.
 @ngokevin From what I've seen, the v1.2.0 of karma-sinon-chai doesn't fix that issue since they use `peerDependencies` instead of `dependencies`. As @nylki said, we need to add them as more explicit dependencies.
   @dmarcos It is. Those had been fixed and I noticed that this should be merged into dev. I'll open another one.

Thanks!

   I can run the lint task by itself but it doesn't output anything. I had to commit with --no-verify. Not sure if it's a Windows thing. Will investigate.
  I just did `npm install aframe` and I get the following errors:

 @ngokevin Thanks. That dev version works fine.

 Apologies - forgot to label (feature request)
 @subsumo if you wanted to take a shot at this, a small component wrapping THREE.js's [Orbit Controls](https://github.com/mattdesl/three-orbit-controls) might be the way to go.
 Thanks guys, I'm on it

  Detaching an animation from the DOM kept the event handlers registered, resulting in the animation still being triggered even if it had no DOM parent.
 @ngokevin Yep, I'm trying to setup the test environment on my machine and writing some tests for that behaviour.
 The issue is a little bit deeper / more complex than anticipated by this hastly PR.
  Hi, to everyone!!!! Wouldn't be nice to work a-frame with knockout.js? I mean if there was an example where the properties of the a-frame objects were binding with knockout.js models.....
  Why not use the same conventions like Borismus webvr-boilerplate ? Like the icons more too.

I'd like mobile non-vr fullscreen as well

having something that can be styled within the html page would be nice too.
  **I bumped to same problem with 0.7.0.**

Component init is called twice when primitive has `component` under `defaultComponents` and mapping keys to same `component`  :thumbsup: Thank you!
 Wakelock is not working for me either: Nexus 5X, Android 6.0.1, Chrome 58.3029.21, A-Frame 0.5.0  Fixes #848.
 I think another component makes sense - but my vote would be for pointer lock to be the default interaction component on desktop. The drag-to-look is an inferior user experience imo.
 I think first-person-controls should be WASD + mouselook on desktop, cardboard stereoscopic on mobile. Do you have a locomotion solution on mobile?
 re: @ngokevin (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1060#issuecomment-191054349)

When you're in VR you probably want pointerlock to only rotate the Y axis to allow sitting down experiences. Outside of VR you want pointerlock to be the replacement of the HMD so full axis rotation.
 I disagree with @dmarcos, I think pointerlock is suitable all the time, not just fullscreen, but I'm happy to make a seperate component for proper pointerlock + wasd + arrow keys (for the germans) and we can abandon this PR.
 Ok cool, let me know what the plan is :D
 I've been playing with the pointerlock in the scenevr editor, and there's a few things that need a change:
- It shouldn't grab mouse on right click
- It shouldn't fire the click event on objects when clicking to get focus
- If you grant 'always allows' permission in firefox, you have to left click then hit escape to get pointerlock (I dunno if theres a way around this, it is fine in chrome)

Shall I make pointerlock a setting on look-controls? 

`look-controls="pointer-lock: true"`

I think it's a shame if most people don't enable it by default, but we can only recommend people enable it in their scenes.
 Sweet sounds good, I'll try to remake the pointer lock controls as a
component.

 @bnolan if we go in the direction of #975, I've merged this PR into that refactor [here](https://github.com/donmccurdy/sandbox-aframe/blob/master/src/controls/mouse-controls.js).
  A-Frame: fe79cca5cd919b959135fe01faf2bba490ee2096

Launching WebVR with the goggles goes into full screen but does not launch the stereoscopic screens.
 I just checked out 476f406 from cvan/aframe and it does not seem to fix the issue. 
 I did. It had installed 1.09 and it didn't work. I installed 1.07 as well just to see but no dice. 
 Moto X first generation
 Reporting in on this issue: I experienced the same full screen but no goggles issues using a Nexus 5X (Chrome) and an iPhone 6S (Safari).
 It also appears like the cursor isn't centered anymore ( appears at the top of the window when switching VR on)
    Seems to work on latest dev.

```
    let position = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0);
    this.el.setAttribute('position', position);
```
 Cool, I'll add support for arrays.
 :+1: 
 As a dev who's been doing some hobby game creation, I'm pretty used to indexes in arrays of three items being used for `[x, y, z]` co-ordinates, so I it'd be useful; to have.
 In math too, you have a Euclidean vector defined by the order of components. It's never [z, y, x]. The order is pretty much consistent across the board. 
  How do you guys feel about this? I know it still needs some work. I'm not super happy about passing a string of "x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3" and it could be a bit more robust considering all the possible errors parsing input.

Does this make sense for core or should it be a separate a-frame component?
 Sounds good to me!

  Seeing the same thing:

```
WARNING in ./~/aframe/dist/aframe.js

 Fix this by adding this into your webpack config under `module`:

``` javascript
module: {
    noParse: [
      /node_modules\/aframe\/dist\/aframe.js/, // for aframe from NPM
      /node_modules\/cannon\/build\/cannon.js/, // for aframe-extras from NPM
    ],
    loaders: [
    // ... your loaders here ...
    ]
}
```
 For those still seeing this error: Using the full absolute file path to the file `aframe-master.js` in your node_modules should work. For example:

```
noParse: [
    '/node_modules/aframe/dist/aframe-master.js',

```

  Hello!

There are build errors when requiring aframe in a JS file after installing via npm (for use with something like aframe-react). Lines 10-14 in 'aframe-core\lib\three.js' have requirements for aframe's local npm installation of three-dev, pointing to '../node_modules/three-dev'. However, when aframe is installed via npm, three-dev is installed in the project's node_modules, causing the below errors:

Removing the '../node_modules' from the requirement works for my case. Will this still allow the project to build when installed without npm?
  Fixes #1038 
  It would be nice to be able to register custom property types. This would enable things like 

``` javascript
  schema: {
      enabled: { default: true },
      templates: { type: 'array', default: [] },
      timing: { type: 'range', default: [0, 50] }
    },
```
 Having to do ...

``` javascript
    schema: {
      enabled: { default: true },
      templates: { default: '' },
      timing: { default: '0 50' }
    },

    update() {
      this.data.templatesReal = this.data.templates.split(' ');
      this.data.timingReal = this.data.timing.split(' ');
    },
```
 Thanks! Please consider adding an array default type though. 
 I'll get that together tonight or tomorrow. Thanks again.
  It would be great if videos could be streamed to aframe instead of the entire file. Is this possible?

  Right now, there can be conflicting animations running. Imagine you have two animations:
- a animation that triggers on `click` that has a duration of 4 seconds and scales an element up
- another animation that triggers on `mouseleave` and scales that element back to its original size in 1 second

Once the user clicks on the element, the element animates, eg. 2 seconds, but then the user decides to cancel the zoom/scale by moving the cursor out. The second animation then triggers and scales the element back to the initial size. So far so good.

However, the first animation is still running in the background! And will eventually fullfil its animation by setting the element to the increased scale, Which results in a strange flicker because the other element scales down. etc.

I propose automatically cancel sibling animations that modify the same attribute.
Additionally, there could be a `cancel-other` attribute to `animation` that simply cancels other animations in the same scope.
 I would imagine the `end` attribute needs to support multiple events, as well. For instance, given #857, this type of scenario will inevitably surface:

```
<a-animation
    attribute="opacity" begin="mouseenter" to="1" dur="1000"
    end="mouseleave, custom-stop-event, ...">
</a-animation>
<a-animation attribute="opacity" begin="mouseleave" to=".25" dur="1000"></a-animation>
```

Edit:
After reviewing the code, this is already available with `begin`, and `end` would simply work the same.
  Currently in `dev` branch (at least in the built version under `dist`) animations are always triggered when the scene loads, regardless of `begin` attribute. After one run, the animation behaves as expected (i.e. triggered only by the event in `begin`).

This is not happening in the latest official release.

Example of animation:

```
<a-animation attribute="scale" begin="play" dur="500" direction="alternate" repeat="1" from="1 1 1" to="1 2 1"></a-animation>
```

  This commit broke mobile VR for me. I'm on Samsung Galaxy Note5. When entering VR mode, the screen goes into landscape, but it's fullscreen, not side by side.
 @meta-meta https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1065 should fix this.

EDIT: reported here: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1052
 Oh cool! Should have searched the issues instead of git-bisect :-)
  Fixes #975.

More comments there. Issue is that `gamepad-controls` and `look-controls` are incompatible on the dev branch, and it's not something I can work around within my component.

I could also package my own fork of `look-controls` _into_ `gamepad-controls`, and that would be fine, or not sure if you all want to embed gamepad support officially into A-Frame?

In any case though, it would take some change like this (where both controls are passive when inactive), or else the two controls need to be aware of one another, which gets messier.
 sort of, but with [a few issues](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/975#issuecomment-189099197). 
 Cool! I guess I assumed that would be too much of a refactor to consider right now, but I can clean up that solution and get a PR to review/consider later today or tomorrow.
  I am using the `texturePromises` array to store a promise that resolves to the texture once the image is loaded by three.js.
To emit the `textureLoaded` event, a `.then` is added to the `texturePromises[src]`.
 Hey @dmarcos  @ngokevin. I made changes according to your comments. @dmarcos the indentation in the line is correct (because of the Promise resolver function).

I also added the `material-texture-loaded` event to video texture loading, and added a `video-ended` event.
 So many comments!
I renamed the event and added a new entry to the docs.

Regarding tests:
I'd be happy to include a test, but I am not sure how you are doing it, I have only had some moderate experience with _mocha_. Also I am not sure what should be tested here (testing if event is actually triggered?).
 Hey again,
@dmarcos The emitted event now yields an object as detail: `{src, element}`. For image sources there would be only a `src`, for video sources the event returns `src` and `element`. I figured for consistency reasons it would be better to use an object here and always include `src`, although you could get it via the video element. This way you can simply do stuff with `event.detail.src` without worrying if it is a video or image.

@ngokevin I added a small test and However I am not able to run the unit tests here (`Error: Cannot find module 'lolex'
` on `npm test`). I added a test.jpg to the test directory to have a valid `src`, hope that's ok.
 > do you have your devdeps installed for testing?

 @dmarcos yep its the new test i added that fails, but unfortunatelay I have problems with the test environment. ~~Maybe someone of you can take a look at the test. (Maybe the path to the real image is wrong)~~
fixed it!
 @dmarcos passing now.
 @dmarcos phew, should have created this PR after your changes :)

Just took a look at the changes.
There are now flat/standard shaders, which both use `loadImageTexture()` via their own `loadImage()` function that are identical. This is no problem, as your loadImage() functions are very concise, but if I would copy paste my loadImage() functions to both files, it's a bit too much redundancy for my taste.

To reduce unnecessary redundancy I thought about defining `loadImage()` in _texture.js_ and export it to be used as `utils.loadImage()` in both shader files, where it is being called via a `bind()`.

This version is now commited for you to review. I could do the first approach, if you prefer to have individual `loadImage()` and `loadVideo()` functions to each, _flat.js_ and _standard.js_. I prefer the commited approach.
  ^ Both FF and Chrome will throw uncaught exceptions within promises. Unfortunately the old polyfill library was polyfilling Chrome even though it had native Promise support.
 Done.
 Fixes #796 btw.
 I prefer using global within the browserify environment as it maps to window and would still work in a node environment.
 @dmarcos the other polyfill was checking "Object.prototype.toString.call(P.resolve()) === '[object Promise]'", which came out as [object Object] in Chrome. Technically you could still use the other library as long as we did the polyfill check ourselves.
 Its kinda funny because we only need this polyfill to support IE http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises
  If calling `getAttribute('rotation')` on a camera, it returns `null` unless the camera element has the attribute `look-controls`.

Example: https://jsfiddle.net/mqt8dtLL/

I don't know if this is expected behavior, but if it's not a bug at least it would be nice to have it documented.
 Thanks @ngokevin 

One question, I'm tinkering with A-frame and reporting the bugs I'm seeing. Do you prefer me reporting bugs over the latest release, or over the `dev` branch? 

Cheers!
  Hi all, 

I want to tell a image-based story in VR, by using multiple images with sound following each other. It should be so that the user can "click" or gaze at an object to see a new image with new sounds (to achieve viewing from another perspective). One solution could be redirecting to a new page with new html, but I don't see a possibility to add those interactions. Is it possible to achieve this? 

Or is it possible to fade from one a-scene to another?

Thanks,
Dylan
 I'm sorry, it's the latter: different scenes. 
So it would be possible to gaze at an object and change (show/hide) entities like a-sky and a-entity with sound? That would create a new "scene". 
 Until multiple scenes are supported, you could certainly do something like:

``` .html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>multiplse pseudo scenes</title>
  <script src="aframe.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

  <a-scene>

    <a-camera position="2 0 3">
      <a-entity cursor="fuse: true; maxDistance: 30; timeout: 1000">
      </a-entity>
    </a-camera>

    <a-entity id="scene1">
      <a-cube color="red" onclick="nextScene()"> </a-cube>
    </a-entity>

    <a-entity id="scene2" visible="false">
      <a-cube color="green" position="0 2 -5"> </a-cube>
      <a-cube color="yellow" position="5 0 -5"> </a-cube>
      <a-cube color="blue" position="0 0 -1"> </a-cube>
    </a-entity>

  </a-scene>

  <script type="text/javascript">

  function nextScene() {
    document.getElementById('scene1').setAttribute('visible', 'false')
    document.getElementById('scene2').setAttribute('visible', 'true')
  }
  </script>

</body>
</html>

```

Instead of setting the `visible` attribute in the `onclick` function, you could also add `a-animation`'s to eg. trigger transparency etc.
 @dlnkprs btw. I just updated my code above to include cursor/click behaviour.
 @nylki thank you for the code provided. It works perfectly. Even with sound being played only when clicked: 

`<a-cube color="red" position="-2 0 0" onclick="start1()" sound="src: radioactiveshort.mp3; on: click"> </a-cube>`

However the fuse doesn't work. It's essential for the experience (not having to leave the environment to touch the screen on mobile). Is there a way to achieve the following effect? (recorded from JauntVR app)

![Image of Yaktocat](http://i.giphy.com/3o6gb181K4CMOUoLQI.gif)
 @dlnkprs A-Frame is still in heavy development, so it should work in the future, but I noticed some glitches with the fuse cursor as well.

You may want to try the dev branch though, it includes many improvements and new components.
If you use _npm_ you can do `npm install mozvr/aframe#dev`.

I did a small demo for you (using the dev branch of aframe) showing the _fuse_ cursor and `a-animation`'s to fade in/out the pseudo-scenes:
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pyzjPL
 Hi @dlnkprs, do you mind me asking how you did that animation around the button? I really like that experience! Cheers. (sorry I know it's off topic)

 I have the same problem, and I already spent 2 weeks. Should I just wait APPLE to change it?
  Helpful to know when model assets have finished loading.

For example, to get @ngokevin's shadow component working with .OBJ models:

``` javascript

module.exports = {
  schema: {
    cast:     { default: false },
    receive:  { default: false }
  },

  init: function () {
    this.update();
    this.el.addEventListener('modelloaded', () => this.update());
  },

  update: function (previousData) {
    var data = this.data;
    // Applied recursively to support imported models.
    this.el.object3D.traverse(function(node) {
      if (node instanceof THREE.Mesh) {
        node.castShadow = data.cast;
        node.receiveShadow = data.receive;
      }
    });
  },

  tick: function () {}
}
```
 Oh, looks like there's a very similar change in #961 — no particular preference about the event name.
 (was originally requested by https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-obj-loader-component/pull/2)

'*load' or '*loaded' both seem fine.

As far as prepending "obj" and "collada", the only hassle would be needing to listen for unique events from each different model format. Could also do `emit('modelloaded', {format: 'obj', model: object})` though.

  Only getting a few frames per second on a modern PC / Nvidia 970 system both on desktop monitor and via Rift DK2. All other a-frame examples work smoothly except for this. I tried navigating to the source mp4 video and it plays back fine at a high framerate so it's not the source image. Is it just me or are there known performance issues with videosphere?

Referring to this https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/

Update, tried another site and this site works at full framerate so it may be something to do with the aframe example itself:

much better (smooother) on my machine than the above

Using firefox nightly  47.0a1 (2016-02-21)
  `this.listener.context.close()` is all that's needed to free up the Audio Context and allow more sounds to be loaded when loading and removing sounds dynamically.

Seems like we want to remove the sound and listener from the scene as well to free resources. Does this happen automagically?
  I would like to use a-frame in the desktop browser (firefox)
- without headset
- with a stereo monitor/tv (preferably line-interleaced left/right separation)
- with the possibility to view stereo-3d images, e.g. side-by-side JPEGs or MPOs created by stereo photo cameras.

I tried it with Firefox nightly (47.0a1), but when I click on the "start vr" icon there happens nothing, except that the icon dissapears.

As said, I have no headset connected. I could have access to a Zeiss Cinemizer Oled. Is this suppurted as well ? AFAIK this behaves like a stereo capable monitor.
 Additional information:
I use firefox with Linux with Nvidia gfx-driver.
"glxgears -stereo" renders with stereo-3d on my monitor, so maybe firefox' Web-GL could use this also.
 I may be out of my depth on this particular topic, but it seems like WebVR only supports [two device types at the moment:](http://mozvr.github.io/webvr-spec/webvr.html#devtypes) the HMDVRDevice and PositionSensorVRDevice. While I'd think it possible to add stereoscopic monitors as a device type, I don't know if A-Frame is the right place to get it added. Have you looked into the WebVR [Reddit/Slack/mailing list?](http://mozvr.com/#community)?
 Thank you for the information. I will try in the MozVR mailing list.

My first thought was that a-frame could make the output e.g. using canvas and mix the left and right image as needed. But probably a-frame is one or more layers too high.
 Of course. As I said, I may be out of my depth with what actually renders and positions the stereoscopes, but it's a worthwhile discussion.
 @ngokevin How is stereoscopic rendering possible now in A-Frame without a headset? There's [no longer `stereoRenderer`](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1740) exposed from `a-scene`.

The https://github.com/oscarmarinmiro/aframe-stereo-component is about a different thing: how to render certain objects to show up only for one eye or the other. Update: found this hack https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1919 
> Hacky way is to set `document.querySelector('a-scene').isMobile` to `true` and remove the orientation modal overlay.

But it doesn't work as intended, causes ```Uncaught (in promise) Error: Failed to enter VR mode (`requestPresent`): No VR hardware found.```

Using desktop Chrome with WebVR enabled via flags (`chrome://flags/#enable-webvr`). Will try disabling it. No, the same error with `chrome://flags/#enable-webvr` disabled and `isMobile` set to `true` to hack A-Frame to make it use the stereoscopic renderer:

Thanks to https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/issues/205#issuecomment-304369146  I can't get the 360 video example to work on my iPhone.

https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/videosphere/

I tried Chrome, Safari and FireFox.

I also tried my own 

http://www.philspitler.com/test/VR/360.html

Neither of which play video on mobile.
 uhh I still can't get it to work 
 sarthakdas I do have this working with the current a-frame version, but I can't provide an example until I get some time off my day job.

In a nutshell I am transcoding to m4v, using the start button technique to satisfy the user interaction requirement (play then pause a short video asset to the a-video), then switching the video asset src whenever the video needs to change. That seems to work well. the example has been updated recently, 
and should include click-to-play behavior now

if you're saying 
https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/videosphere/
doesn't work, 
can you provide more information? 
e.g. browser, phone model, OS version

if you're saying your own code doesn't work,
but the new example does,
feel free to remix the example...  Currently transformations are applied using the object's center as origin, instead of world's `0,0,0`.

However, in https://aframe.io/docs/core/animation.html we can read:

> [...] to define a 5-meter orbit on an entity about the Y-axis that takes 10 seconds, we can offset the position and animate the rotation. [...]
> 
> ``` html
> <a-entity position="5 0 0" rotation="0 0 0">
>   <a-animation attribute="rotation"
>                to="0 360 0"
>                dur="10000"
>                fill="forwards"
>                repeat="indefinite"></a-animation>
> </a-entity>
> ```

What this produces is for the entity to rotate over the Y axis over its own center while remaining at `5,0,0`, and not _orbiting_. See [this example on JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/ew7b34x7/)

To achieve an orbit, users must nest entities and set the orbit radius as a position in the nested entity. See [this example](https://jsfiddle.net/ew7b34x7/1/):

``` html
<a-entity>
  <a-animation attribute="rotation"
    to="0 360 0"
    dur="10000"
    ease="linear"
    repeat="indefinite"></a-animation>
  <a-sphere position="5 0 0" radius="1">
</a-entity>
```

I can make a PR with the changes to the docs if you wish so.

PS: Of course, it would be great if users could define the origin of transformations as an attribute of the animation / entity.
  What order will it go in? mixin1, mixin2, entity? Or entity, mixin1, mixin2?
 On the topic of merging vs replacing, I agree that it'd be more useful to merge.

Also, it'll be funny to see the first issue with recursive mixins causing crashes.
  This might help: https://www.talater.com/open-source-templates/
  I'm taking a stab at this right now. I'm also trying to add a pause hotkey for 'p'. Would it make sense to add a resume() method to components?
 @ngokevin this seems to be solved with 'sound.playSound()' and `play()` calls `playSound()` if there is active buffer `this.data.autoplay` is true
  As you can see [in the docs](https://aframe.io/docs/primitives/a-camera.html#Replacing_the_default_scene_camera), the default camera is actually offset a little and isn't directly in the center.
 Wait, nevermind, that's only when it's auto-injected. My bad.
  Adds support for base64 uris.
  A data-URI scheme for base64 images [consists of multiple characters, one being a colon (`:`), the other being a semicolon (`;`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme#Examples).

Thus, one cannot use base64 urls directly, as the semicolon & colon are parsed as their own key-value set in a component. This could become a problem for many, including me, if they wish to dynamically generate images on the fly.

The problem is here, in the style-attr module, where the style attribute string wholesale splits the string by semicolon and colon:
https://github.com/joshwnj/style-attr/blob/master/index.js#L21

There needs to be some way to ignore semicolons within a `url()` property. I'll raise an issue in the style-attr repo for now.
 Raised an issue in style-attr: https://github.com/joshwnj/style-attr/issues/2
 Just got patched. https://github.com/joshwnj/style-attr/pull/3
 Semver sorted it out already, but I'll put it up there.
  In HTML:
`<a-assets>
  <img src='img-link' id='img-01'>
</a-assets>
<a-entity id='img-entity'>
</a-entity>`

In JS: 
`(function(){
var img = document.createElement('a-image');
  img.setAttribute('width', "1.5");
  img.setAttribute('src', '#img-01');    
  window.onload = function(){
    img.setAttribute('src', '#img-01');    
  };
  var entity = document.getElementById('img');
  entity.appendChild(img);
})();`

So I am trying to append a-entity with a-image on both document.onload and window.onload. However the image is black. An example is [here](http://codepen.io/SantanMaddi/pen/RrdRQq) for reference.

The fault is because texture is used even before it is loaded. If I am correct, the texture should be loaded/ready at least on window.onload. Unable to get around with this issue, any suggestions for it?
 Thanks @ngokevin 
  My use case: Click X to show Y. Hover Y to do Z.
Y is set to hidden by default using visible = "false". X has a click event listener to show Y (set Y visible = "true"). Y has a hover event listener to do Z.

Problem is:
Even when Y is hidden, if I accidentally hover on the invisible area, it still triggers Z. In the example below, even if I don't click X, the hover events still works on Y.

Code:
//Click X to show Y
document.querySelector('#X').addEventListener('click', function () {
            document.querySelector('#Y').emit('show');
});

//Hover Y to show Z
document.querySelector('#Y').addEventListener('mouseenter', function () {
            document.querySelector('#Z').emit('fadein');
});

//Mouse leave Y to hide Z
document.querySelector('#Y').addEventListener('mouseleave', function () {
            document.querySelector('#Z').emit('fadeout');
 });

(BTW, I was a UX design intern at Mozilla in 2013 :-) Great job on A-frame!)
 @auxdesigner have you tried to determine if them target item was visible in the event listener?

You could decide to only emit when needed.
 I've had a similar issue.
I have the same structure as you but I can't get X to read my click event.
Both Y and Z are "visible: false".   There's a change on the dev branch that breaks one of my examples. Code:

``` html
<a-entity camera
          rotation="0 0 0"
          look-controls
          gamepad-controls>
</a-entity>
```

(actual scene i'm testing is [here](https://github.com/donmccurdy/sandbox-aframe/blob/master/examples/platforms/index.html), but has `look-controls` removed temporarily)

In that example there are three ways of rotating the camera: HMD (w/ `look-controls`), mouse (w/ `look-controls`), and gamepad right joystick (w/ `gamepad-controls`). In v0.1.\* this just worked, because my update() function in `gamepad-controls` was always called last, and I was careful to only update rotation when the gamepad was in use. On _dev_ that seems to have changed – `gamepad-controls.tick()` is called first, and `look-controls.tick()` overwrites my rotation regardless of whether any HMD or mouse events are happening. I've [tried to work around this in my code](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-gamepad-controls/blob/feat-lock-rotation/gamepad-controls.js#L191), but it gets very messy quickly and I don't see a good solution without asking users of `gamepad-controls` to _also_ use some new custom version of `look-controls`.

I don't care much about the order in which component `tick()` calls should be made (that seems too complicated), but it would be great to make it easy for demos to support multiple input devices – I don't want to target a demo _only_ at users with an HMD and a gamepad, for example, and ideally the default controls with A-Frame would be passive when they're not in use.

Can think of a couple ways to get around this:
1. Controls should always export their state to position/rotation components, and not hide state internally. `wasd-controls` already does this, but it might be harder for `look-controls` because we want that dolly pitch/roll/yaw abstraction.
2. Controls should only update state if they're in use. E.g. if there's an HMD `look-controls` should be permanently in use, but between mouse events it should avoid overwriting `rotation`.

Would you take a PR for one of these, or can you think of another way to have controls play nicely together?
 Tried to enable/disable components in a branch [here](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-gamepad-controls/blob/feat-lock-rotation/gamepad-controls.js#L191-L274). Short story, it didn't really work because once my component disables `look-controls`, I can't tell when to enable it again without tracking HMD and mouse movement myself.

Of my original two suggestions now, I'm feeling like #&zwnj;1 (export state) isn't worth the trouble, but #&zwnj;2 (passive when inputs aren't changing) would probably be safe and simple enough.

I like the idea of composing controls, though, would need to think a bit about how that could work.
 Sort of. Assuming I want to make a demo that supports a gamepad, but doesn't require it, I might add `wasd-controls` to your example:

``` html
<a-entity gamepad-controls>
  <a-entity camera look-controls wasd-controls></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

That works if you use the gamepad for both movement and looking around, or if you use an HMD + WASD controls, but not for gamepad + HMD. And you can't switch between keyboard and gamepad, because you'll be rotating the camera relative to its translation vector.

A second (less important) issue is that gamepad controls needs to know the rotation of the (inner) element to get a heading for movement, but there's probably a workaround for that.
 I am starting to think that @dmarcos's suggestion about managing multiple controls from a separate component is the way to go eventually. Like, `wasd-controls`, `look-controls`, and `gamepad-controls` could _only_ be tracking the state of user input, and some other component (`navigation-manager`?) can look at that state and figure out how to update the camera's position/rotation. That would seem much better when you get into more game-like demos with jumping and wall collisions, since you wouldn't want that collision logic distributed across all of the input components.

^That's all a bit more complicated though. I mostly just want to preserve optional gamepad support in v0.2.0 at the moment. 😬
 Reading through #1056, and thought I'd contribute a strawman to the discussion. Here's one possible approach to supporting multiple input methods in a way that should be [somewhat] extensible/customizable.

``` javascript
AFRAME.registerComponent('navigation', {
  schema: {
    movementControls: { default: ['wasd-movement', 'touch-movement'] }, // order by precedence
    rotationControls: {default: ['hmd-rotation', 'pointerlock-rotation', 'mousedrag-rotation'] } // order by precedence
  },
  tick: function () {
    // Rotation:
    // (1) find first enabled rotation controller
    // (2) get rotation vector
    // (3) orient camera

    // Movement:
    // (1) find first enabled controller.
    // (2) get velocity vector.
    // (3) orient velocity by rotation/heading
    // (4) update position of camera
  }
});
```

_MovementControls Interface_
- `isEnabled()` – Returns true if component is enabled and supported by the client.
- `getVelocity()` – Returns a velocity vector, relative to any object rotation. if the `W` key were pressed, this might be `[0,0,1]`, regardless of any HMD orientation.

_RotationControls Interface_
- `isEnabled()` – Returns true if component is enabled and supported by the client.
- `getRotation()` – Returns a rotation vector, which will (1) orient the camera, and (2) orient the velocity.

### Default/stock controls

``` html
<a-entity camera navigation></a-entity>
```

### Custom/extended case

To add a custom gamepad interface, I would define `isEnabled`, `getVelocity`, and `getRotation` and then decide how precedence should compare with other controllers:

``` html
<a-entity camera
          gamepad-controls
          navigation="movementControls: gamepad-controls wasd-controls touch-controls;
                      rotationControls: hmd-controls gamepad-controls pointerlock-controls;"
</a-entity>
```
 Alrighty so I went and built this.
- _Universal Controls_: parent component that manages the interface-specific components. [Source code](https://github.com/donmccurdy/sandbox-aframe/blob/master/src/universal-controls.js).
- Implemented an assortment of interface-specific controls, including all the default A-Frame components, plus gamepad, pointerlock, and touch-to-move. [Source code](https://github.com/donmccurdy/sandbox-aframe/tree/master/src/controls).

**Cons**
- The extra abstraction layer complicates things for new users, and I could see where that might be a deal-breaker for inclusion in the core library.

**Pros**
- Third-party controls (e.g. gamepad) play nicely w/ A-Frame's defaults, because only `universal-controls` actually gets to modify the entity's position/velocity.
- For game-friendly features like static collision detection (e.g. prevent player from walking through walls) in the core framework, the extra abstraction of `universal-controls` helps immeasurably. If gamepad, keyboard, and touch-to-move controls all modify player position directly, they also have to _all_ check for obstacles, and that's a mess.

Just for fun, [here is a demo](https://sandbox.donmccurdy.com/vr/walls/) implementing various controls (gamepad, keyboard, pointerlock, touch-to-move) with collision detection on the walls using CANNON.js. [Source code](https://github.com/donmccurdy/sandbox-aframe/blob/master/examples/walls/index.html).
  will it ever be possible to combine regular html5 syntax with aframe as in this example":

https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/curved-mockups/

These curved mockups are curved panel images of pages, but is it possible to add regular html inside a div and attribute aframe properties to is such as curved panel or sky?
 @cvan thanks for the help. My goal is to take an existing website, and break out certain aspects of it into aframe: example: having subreddits in vr that change vr environments based on their subreddit
 @cvan technically, with the dom2screenshoot, couldn't you map a users position on the screenshot to an action in an iframe? example: In cardboard they see the image version of the page, and they hover over a button to trigger the js to actually correspond with the iframe and reload a new view?
  +1 on killing the dev/master workflow. One master, staggered releases. Maybe some feature branches for crazy people (though why not do that in your own fork?)
 I've seen projects just set monthly/quarterly milestones that bundle up all the changes made for that period.
  I have a post about squashing commits if you think it would be a useful reference:  https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git
 Oh sweet, I didn't know that :)

When visiting AFrame website on my iPhone 5C with iOS9 and switching to landscape mode it first enters the fullscreen and then immediately exists it. My own experiments and http://vr.chromeexperiments.com work fine so I guess it must be some code modifying DOM in your examples triggering change of layout.

Here is the video showing the behaviour: https://vimeo.com/155153964/48dd611c61

<a-scene>
<a-entity position="0 1 0">
    <a-cube look-at="#focal" position="1 0 1" width="0.5" height="0.5" depth="0.5"></a-cube>
    <a-cube id="focal" position="0 0 0" width="0.5" height="0.5" depth="0.5" color="blue"></a-cube>
</a-entity>
  </a-scene>
```

The gray cube should be looking at the blue cube, it is actually not taking into account the 1 meter elevation of the parent.

 Looks like THREE.js problem:

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/core/Object3D.js#L264
  The rotation matrix of the object3D gets reset between `update` and first `tick`.
If you put the `lookat()` into the `tick` function the element does actually `look-at` the element.
It is sufficient to set the look-at vector on the first tick to stay, which indicates that the reset to "0 0 0" happens only once. (tested with a simple counter).

I added some log prints to see if the rotation gets reset.

``` .js
   tick: function (t) {
    this.tickCount++;
    // Track target object position. Depends on parent object keeping global transforms up
    // to state with updateMatrixWorld(). In practice, this is handled by the renderer.
    var target3D = this.target3D;
    if (target3D) {
      return this.el.object3D.lookAt(this.vector.setFromMatrixPosition(target3D.matrixWorld));
    } else if (this.tickCount === 1) {
      console.log('rotation in first tick', this.el.object3D.rotation);
      this.el.object3D.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(this.data.x, this.data.y, this.data.z));
      console.log('rotation after setting it again to lookat vector:', this.el.object3D.rotation);
    }
  }
```

![lookat_2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1710598/13368420/6c2e7780-dcea-11e5-9fef-d6899aeb9b9a.png)

Any idea what changes the rotation between update and tick?
(You may notice as well, that the rotation from `update` doesn't match the rotation from `tick` and even has a differnet `_order`, might give some clues.)
 @ngokevin To test it, I set rotation, position, scale and visibility all as dependency. It helps but actually only postpones a reset to `0 0 0`,  it must come from somewhere else. Investigating further.

UPDATE: I think it _could_ have something to do with `raycaster`.
Although my testing `a-box` has no `raycaster` set, it is still initialized and put onto the element. Why is that? Is it supposed to have a raycaster element or is it a bug?
see,
this:
`<a-box width="1" depth="2" height="0.5" color="#999" look-at="-2 15 -9" position="4 0 1"></a-box>`

becomes this in the registration process:
`<a-box raycaster="" geometry="primitive:box;height:0.5;depth:2;width:1" material="color:#999" width="1" depth="2" height="0.5" color="#999" look-at="-2 15 -9" position="4 0 1"></a-box>`

And it isn't solved by putting it into `dependencies`. The raycaster ticks are also getting executed on the box.
 To avoid overriding issues, it may work to calculate the proper rotation in the look-at component (rather than use .lookAt() ) and then setAttribute on the rotation component, and let it do the updating of the Object3D rotation ?
Three.js calculates the rotation here:
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/core/Object3D.js#L262
 Using look-at to a vec3 on a wrapper around the camera component does not seem to work. In the codepen below, moving the camera with keyboard should keep the camera on the red sphere but it does not.
In addition, when using a selector instead of vec3 the scene does not get drawn at all. Preliminary debugging (in codepen ...) suggests that tick() may never be called in this case.

  The autopplay function don't work on ios mobile. How can we start the video to play on ios? 
  Hi, there are some bugs for hover function:
- hover works only with `<a-cube>`, not with other element such as `<a-plane>`
- `<a-entity geometry="primitive: box;”>` doesn’t work even though it creates same as `<a-cube>`
- `<a-cube>` doesn’t work if the position is far from origin

please check this video:

  Hi,

For a project of mine, I'm using jquery to add event listeners onto my components to add my own logic, the only one that I was able to get to work was 'click', I would like to be able to use 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave'. Are these not supported? And if they are, where might be able to find documentation on them and other available types?

Thanks!
  @cvan I agree Rust's is great. It seems to be working well for the Servo project.
  This may only affect `metaKey` – see issue #3 here: http://bitspushedaround.com/on-a-few-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-hellish-command-key-and-javascript-events/
 Ah, that's an issue too, but different cause: shift key changes `KeyboardEvent::key` case, so it might be "a" on keydown and "A" on keyup, which similarly breaks everything. I'm running a fork of `wasd-controls` [here](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-keyboard-controls) (for proxy-controls support), and am leaning towards using `KeyboardEvent::code` rather than `key`, since (1) it's case-insensitive, and (2) it has nice default behavior w/ Spacebar.
  What if you went more with the way SVG does `<defs>`. Specify entities with an ID in some specific area, (maybe in assets?) and then have something like `<a-use href="someid"/>` to use them. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use
 Also, I think "templates" and "mixins" seem like they could be merged into one concept since they're doing similar things. Not sure if that's on topic for the thread, though.
 I actually like that idea more than templates, even. Only complaint is that it seems that this could all be accomplished with components somehow, rather than having both mixins and components as basic composable units in the markup.
 Nice! I've been thinking of implementing a server that does server-side rendering of scenes for the purposes of a puzzle game of sorts. Though I guess I was second-guessing that lately because of the issue of losing VR on navigation. :/
  Proposal to add 'preserveDrawingBuffer' option to webgl renderer from a-scene.

Will need a good attribute name or any better suggestion?

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/989
 not yet. Trying it now.
 by looking at the code.
https://github.com/Jam3/threejs-generate-gif/blob/master/test.js

It will need to run `gifGenerator.addFrame();` in each frame and it will need start the requestAnimation. Might not be a good fit for aframe integration.
 I agree with let the user decide (the same as `antialias` for example) instead of add it by default, as `preserveDrawingBuffer` can impact the performance.
From the webgl spec (https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/):

> On some hardware setting the preserveDrawingBuffer flag to true can have significant performance implications.
> 
> While it is sometimes desirable to preserve the drawing buffer, it can cause significant performance loss on some platforms. Whenever possible this flag should remain false and other techniques used. Techniques like synchronous drawing buffer access (e.g., calling readPixels or toDataURL in the same function that renders to the drawing buffer) can be used to get the contents of the drawing buffer. If the author needs to render to the same drawing buffer over a series of calls, a Framebuffer Object can be used.
> 
> Implementations may optimize away the required implicit clear operation of the Drawing Buffer as long as a guarantee can be made that the author cannot gain access to buffer contents from another process. For instance, if the author performs an explicit clear then the implicit clear is not needed.
 @dmarcos something like this? 

``` html
<a-scene preserveDrawingBuffer='true'>
```

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/blob/a3855a35634bc6120c569788f20a7534c1eb4c5d/src/core/a-scene.js#L587
 @dmarcos Nice! +1

I don't see any test for antialias 

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/dev/tests/core/a-scene.test.js#L185

Will create renderer component and test for antialias and preserveDrawingBuffer.

sidenote:

if the user changes 

``` html
<a-scene renderer="antialias: true; preserveDrawingBuffer: true; ... ">...<a-scene>
```

to 

```
<a-scene renderer="">...<a-scene>
```

on runtime. 

The renderer still uses antialias and preserveDrawingBuffer right? Because it is only registered on init. The only way to make the antialias and preserveDrawingBuffer change on run time is to recreate the renderer. We don't want to do that right?
 I created a small component for the a-scene in order to make a screenshot. But it does not seem to work and when creating a new WebGLRenderer the output of the scene is blurry and the generated image is black. What am I doing wrong?

```
AFRAME.registerComponent('renderer', {

    init: function () {
        this.el.renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ preserveDrawingBuffer: true });
    },
    remove: function () {
        this.el.renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ preserveDrawingBuffer: false });
    }

});
```

```
var scene = document.querySelector('a-scene');
var canvasData = scene.renderer.domElement.toDataURL('image/png');
```
 Uh oh.. I see: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/core/scene/a-scene.js#L301 - I think I should not just replace the WebGLRenderer as I did. 

```
AFRAME.registerComponent('renderer', {

    init: function () {
        var antialias = this.el.getAttribute('antialias') === 'true';
        this.el.renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ canvas: this.el.canvas, antialias: antialias || window.hasNativeWebVRImplementation, alpha: true, preserveDrawingBuffer: true });
        this.el.renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio);
        this.el.renderer.sortObjects = false;
        this.el.effect = new THREE.VREffect(this.el.renderer);
    },
    remove: function () {
        var antialias = this.el.getAttribute('antialias') === 'true';
        this.el.renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ canvas: this.el.canvas, antialias: antialias || window.hasNativeWebVRImplementation, alpha: true, preserveDrawingBuffer: false });
    }

});

Hm... still no luck. Image is white (at least not black like it was before ;-)).
 Interesting, if I set preserveDrawingBuffer: true directly in aframe.js when the WebGLRenderer is created, it works. I can take a screenshot of the scene. Looks like a-frame does not like swapping the renderer in the component as I did. Any ideas?
 Current version of aframe 0.3.2 / three.js 0.76.1 does not need to set preserveDrawingBuffer: true anymore in order to get a screenshot of the canvas by doing  

var canvasData = scene.renderer.domElement.toDataURL('image/png');

I double checked and the screenshot is always taken and I tested a lot.
 @chriscar That's not working for me. Here's a Codepen example: http://codepen.io/fabricius/pen/KNNWVL

I get a blank png with the dimensions of the window, just as I do in any other way when preserveDrawingBuffer has not been set to true.

What _does_ work for me though, is the upcoming screenshot component in the next release of A-Frame. At least it works in this example (press Ctrl+Alt+S to take screenshot): http://codepen.io/fabricius/pen/aBBJwp

Slightly outdated documentation here: https://aframe.io/docs/master/components/screenshot.html
 @RSpace I played with your Codepen and you're right. In my case manually taking a screenshot is not an option, I create one programmatically, after uploading a 3d model. It's wired, it still works in my code. When I got time I should check why it works...
 @dmarcos Good tip about `sceneEl.components.screenshot.capture('perspective')`. I wish that method  wouldn't initiate the download, as in my case I take the base64 image and submit to a server.

I might do a PR to change the behaviour or make it more configurable, but for now I also have had to comment out https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/scene/screenshot.js#L65 and the following line, as those shaders results in WebGL shader compilation error. I don't get the compilation in the Codepen example I did, only in my own app.

It must be related to the fact that I use webpack and include A-Frame with `require('aframe/src')` to be able to debug into A-Frame. Does browserify do anything magic related to shaders when it produces the master dist file?
 @demarcos Same here, thanks about the hint! In my use case I would need to submit the image data to the server as well.
 @RSpace - I did a little fix so you can now get a canvas object with the rendered screengrab, by doing `sceneEl.components.screenshot.getCanvas()` - from where you should be able to do a .toBlob() and send off to a server or whatever. :)
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2316 @toychicken Thanks, I did something along those lines in my local copy of the component to get it working - will be great have it in core.

However, I still have the WebGL shader compilation error in my webpack-based build, so for now the screenshot component is still not useable for me. great job worked with
```
sceneEl.components.screenshot.getCanvas('perspective').toDataURL('image/png')
``` Hi! Hi! I am trying to take a screenshot for contents in a-scene using A-frame. With the current screenshot method, it only takes the rendering of the 3D model in the scene and not the camera feed. Any ideas how I can take a whole screenshot? @dmarcos Here is my website: https://esmolan.github.io/
I am building a AR project where when using A-Frame, I can project gTLF models, etc. However, I want to take a screen capture of them alongside the camera feed from the webcam. 

Allow me to explain, even when using the `ctrl+alt+s` to trigger the screenshot, it only captures the 3D model with a white background, not the render of the webcam. Image link: [https://ibb.co/hCudTT](url)

Same issue: [https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/issues/358](url)

I just want a way to capture a screenshot with the webcam using A-Frame. I know that with three.js its possible, but its hard to play with custom markers and loading animations to gTLF models.  @dmarcos How can I bring the camera feed into THREE?  @dmarcos I will still try! Thanks for the help :)  Has anything like this been implemented yet? Is there an event that gets triggered when all the assets load?
 Nevermind, found the `loaded` event: https://aframe.io/docs/core/asset-management-system.html#Events
 great news
  Is wanting this warning a result of an API change?  I know this is a simply attribute check but it seems like extra processing for something that probably doesn't happen very often.
   it is showing in chrome but not webvr chromium

```
WebGL: INVALID_VALUE: texImage2D: no video
255aframe.io/:1 [.WebGLRenderingContext-0x7fa76bfa72a0]RENDER WARNING: texture bound to texture unit 0 is not renderable. It maybe non-power-of-2 and have incompatible texture filtering.
```
 How do you get around this at all?
 And, what's the upstream issue, please?
 Since CDNs virtually always mean cross origin and since Chrome is a very popular browser and based on Chromium, isn't the scope of the underlying bug tremendous?
 My particular issue had to do with caching. Disabling cache in my browser made it download the images again and thus it was resolved.
  Hi, I would like to have multiple a-scenes within a page so that I can have multiple 3d models mixed in with other html.
 What about embedding iframes for the time being?
 This is probably the reason we'll need to abandon A-Frame for our project. It stinks, but we can't use the iframe solution.
 Maybe it is just a-videosphere, in that case?
 @cvan what's the specific secret sauce for getting multiple a-scenes to work on a page? I've tried "embedded" but both of my scenes will not render (they each render if I include only one at a time). I am using v0.4.0. @dmarcos Thanks for the clarification :-) The embedded use case is my most common, and iframes are not a viable workaround (anyone who has worked with a client's CMS probably knows why).  I don't think I'm the only one with these kinds of requirements.

A-Frame is so useful and well-designed, I would hate for this issue to be a sticking point that hampers its adoption. I realise this is long-closed, but wanted to add some thoughts now that Three.js does seem to support rendering multiple instances on a single page (at least it happily does it in my test page).

We're currently evaluating what framework to use for some 3D visualizations to augment our existing 2D visualizations, which were written using D3.  At first glance A-Frame looked ideal; we can quickly set up the basic scene in HTML, then use our existing D3 knowledge to quickly build up the complexity, easily attaching interaction handlers to objects, etc.  And then I realised the show stopper: We can't have multiple A-Frame instances on a page.  We display multiple visualisations at the same time to the user, so it's a deal breaker.

I appreciate A-Frame has a VR focus so it isn't your priority, but you guys have a really powerful general purpose 3D framework which gives a useful abstraction on top of Three.js and can be combined with the power of D3.  It's a great combination outside of VR which isn't covered by any other framework to my knowledge.  So supporting this has my vote.  I have issues while I want to play 360 video example in browser of my mobile device (https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/videosphere/).
It shows me a message: You cannot play this video. Please try with another video file.

It works normally on desktop.

Please help. Thank you.

 The bug is not fix yet. What are the options for shader?
  Phone: Motorola moto e
android: 4.4.4
Browser: chrome 47.0.2
 I fix this issue by changing shader: flat to shader: standard

 <a-entity visible="${cursor-visible}"
              position="0 0 -${cursor-offset}" 
              geometry="primitive: ring; radiusOuter: 0.016; radiusInner: 0.01"
              material="color: ${cursor-color}; shader: flat; transparent: true; opacity: ${cursor-opacity}"
              scale="${cursor-scale} ${cursor-scale} ${cursor-scale}"
              cursor="maxDistance: ${cursor-maxdistance};">
    </a-entity>
  "Animations and transitions in A-Frame are defined using the <a-animation> element as a child." I would suggest to have animations as components. 
 Makes sense. I was looking for a way to programatically set animations like `element.setAttribute('animation', {from: "0 0 0", to: "1 1 1" });` which seems not possible then. I can do `anim.setAttribute("from", "1 1 1")` which becomes pretty verbose.

(Update: I also felt the Entity-Component model would be cleaner this way. But you would have to change the "only one component of a type" principle or make the animation component more complex. Hm.).  
 Ok.
  A-Frame fails to load in legacy builds of Firefox Nightly. It throws a `NS_ERROR_STORAGE_CONSTRAINT` error to the console from `line 56980`: 

``` javascript
[56979] var ls = storage(); 
[56980] if (ls && (parseInt(ls.logs, 10) || ls.logs === 'true')) {
[56981]  debug.enable('*');
[56982] } else {
...
```

Temporary workaround: remove the variable initialization from `line 56979`: 

``` javascript
[56979] var ls; 
```

Supporting old Nightly builds is probably low on the priority list for A-Frame (and understandably so). I thought I'd raise this issue anyways, in case it crops up in any other browser environments / edge cases. 

Repro: 
1. Install an [old build of Nightly.](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/) (I tested the issue in [44.0a1](http://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/2015/10/2015-10-18-03-02-50-mozilla-central/firefox-44.0a1.en-US.win64.installer.exe) and [45.0a1](http://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/2015/12/2015-12-09-03-02-28-mozilla-central/firefox-45.0a1.en-US.win64.installer.exe). Issue may also exist in earlier builds.) 
2. Visit [aframe.io.](aframe.io)
3. A-Frame fails to load - no canvas is created and the center of the page remains blank. 
 Ahh, interesting. Thank you for the fast response! 
  It would be useful to be able to wrap unreprojected images from a fisheye lens around objects.
Very wide angle (fisheye) lenses produce circular images within a rectangular video or photo frame.
While the video output of simple wide FOV cameras can be preprojected to equirectangular video, this is computationally expensive and is difficult to do in real time.

The edge clamping of most texture shaders distorts these images unacceptably when wrapping them around objects.

A shader which pins the the center of the image to a specified point on a sphere and wraps the image with no edge clamping would make it simple to take live video feeds from simple cameras and present them as non-stereo VR images.

Wrapping around various elipsoids would allow alternate map projections.

It would be useful to be able to specify a radius from the center at which an alpha channel clips the image.
  The complex CSS-like syntax for some attributes is extremely strange.

For example:

```
wasd-controls="enabled: true; acceleration: 120"
```

Do I have to manually concatenate strings to update the `acceleration` value? Are there special setters?

I think of a-frame as great for beginners and this feels like complexity creep and diverges from the HTML metaphor in a way that isn't self-documenting.
 @ngokevin I guess my concern is that for novices, "introducing" non-standard metaphors may be more confusing than it is useful. At some point it's more useful to just have people write script. Or maybe have a `<wasd-controls>` element with top-level attributes and a `target` attribute to connect it to an entity?
 Also a bit concerned about the performance implication of overloading setAttribute, unless it's just using the `attributechangecallback` to do your logic
 @ngokevin I was under the impression the goal of A-Frame was to be a markup-driven way for novices to experiment with VR. If I'm knowledgeable enough to know entity-component, why would I use custom elements? I probably know a programming language and markup-based authoring would only get in my way.
  I trigger an animation on `mouseenter` which works consistently, but the event handler for `mouseleave` does not seem to fire consistently
example: 
http://bl.ocks.org/enjalot/8be32e6f1f32920ba841
  `mouseleave` events don’t fire if the `mouseenter` event has yet to finish. so, in the following code example, if a user focuses their `a-entity cursor` on an object but leaves before the animation has finished, the`mouseleave` animation doesn’t play, at all:

```
<a-animation attribute="opacity" begin="mouseenter" to="1" dur="1000"></a-animation>
<a-animation attribute="opacity" begin="mouseleave" to=".25" dur="1000"></a-animation>
```

In tween.js, `override:true` might to be appended to the `props` argument to fix this.
 live example: http://misterburton.com/local/ideo-sf-panorama/

switching to `<a-entity id="cube" geometry="primitive: box"…` now to see if it fixes the issue.
 Right, the expected behavior, in my mind, is that a `mouseenter` animation
that has yet to complete before the `mouseleave` event is fired should not
complete.

Example: if an opacity animation that is set from 0 to 1 has only reached
.5 on enter when the cursor then rolls off, it should animate from .5 back
to 0 on leave.

 both events fire here on quick rollover/out, but only if i use `<a-entity>`, not if i use `<a-cube>`:

```
document.querySelector('#cube').addEventListener('click', function () {
  document.querySelector('#cube').emit('fadeIn');
  console.log('click');
});

document.querySelector('#cube').addEventListener('mouseleave', function () {
  document.querySelector('#cube').emit('fadeOut');
  console.log('mouse leave');
});
```

the only remaining issue is that the fadeout animation simply doesn't fire on mouseleave, at all:

```
<a-animation attribute="material.opacity" begin="fadeIn" to="1" dur="1000"></a-animation>
<a-animation attribute="material.opacity" begin="fadeOut" to=".25" dur="1000"></a-animation>
```

 Hi @misterburton, if you found a work around could you please share. I am going through the same issue. Cheers.
 Hey, @coleholyoake. There's no fix that I know of, particularly as this issue is still open. That said, I've yet to try the latest aframe build. Let me know if you happen upon a fix, and I'll be happy to do the same. Cheers.
  Why should this be removed?  It is needed so that layouts behave on iOS 9 and above.  Yes it won't be recognized on devices other than iOS, so thus the warning.  It is only a warning after all, not an error.
  In iPhone 5s/ios9.2 with all browsers full screen doesn't work. 
In Safari in particular, canvas doesn't resize right.

This issue persists with a texture for `<a-sky>` via the `src` tag as well.

I could fix this issue by removing `shader: flat` from the sky material component:  

```
<a-entity geometry="primitive: sphere;
                      radius: ${radius};
                      segmentsWidth: ${segments-width};
                      segmentsHeight: ${segments-height}"
            material="shader: flat; 
                      src: url(${src});
                      color: ${color};
                      fog: false"
            scale="-1 1 1">
  </a-entity>
```
 @i3games Thanks for including a fix in your post! This just saved me after 2 hours of debugging on Android :)
  If separated, it would be important that it's still possible to use both on the same element. Otherwise we'd end up with demos that work either on HMD or desktop but not both. Is there a clean way for two separate components to know when the other takes precedence?

  Maybe it'd make sense to have it be configurable? Though I think that lock-by-default makes the most sense.
 I see your point, but from what I've seen in most examples and projects around, it's usually aframe taking over the page, and other content showing up seems to show up less frequently.

If it's configurable then it'd be easy enough to go one way or the other either way. Maybe since it's currently not lock-by-default it'd make sense to have the locking opt-in so as not to mess up existing projects.
 @dmarcos @cemkod Yeah, I think that having a clear path to mixing different control schemes would help a lot. And I suppose that it would make sense to have the current default stay, but have it actually be composed of individual components to make customization easier.
 I haven't tested this but my no-click-look-controls component is only enabled on mouseover and the way it calculates rotation _should_ support multiple scenes on a single page.

https://github.com/alexrkass/aframe-no-click-look-controls/blob/master/index.js#L145-L152
 @dmarcos Yeah, only problem with them is that it doesn't seem to be locking the pointer on the screen. D:
 @RangerMauve true, sorry I conflated pointer lock with mousedrag.

pointer lock on focus would make a good default.
 I added quick pointerlock support, doesn't seem to break safari and works in chrome / ff.
 Any updates on pointer lock? I would really like to use it for my project but existing (two exactly) components doesn't work. aframe-no-click-look-controls is very nice as it allows to limit axis movement, but it doesn't work at all with aframe >=0.3.0. And also, it's big too.

So, what can I do at this point? Thanks, I was refering to older version aframe-no-click-look-controls. I tried to use a blob, registering a component. Console doesn't report any error, but it doesn't work. Please note I'm not using node.js, just straight call to javascript in HTML file.

]);  The big problem here is that raycasting as implemented in three.js is unavoidably slow. By default, it loops through every single object in your list, and then through every single face on any object that matches both the bounding sphere and the bounding box. Even if you use an [octree](http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_octree_raycasting.html), it still runs at O(n) through every single face...unless you have a `BufferGeometry`, in which case it does nothing or breaks, since it's just not supported in the provided octree raycasting code.

To make performance matters worse, however you do it, the search is undirected so it has to find every single object that intersects your ray and then sort them by distance to find the first hit. It has no way of ignoring potential objects that are farther away than your best solution so far.

One alternative is to try [GPU picking](http://brianxu.github.io/GPUPicker/), which is MUCH faster. But it has a couple of problems:
1. It gets pretty complicated if you want to get anything other than the id of the object you've selected. If you want the position and normal of the point of intersection, that's more information than you can squeeze through a single 4-byte pixel.
2. It requires a `readPixels` call, which causes GPU/CPU sync, potentially a pretty large delay, enough to cause serious jank.

I'm considering a more optimized CPU-side approach, which is to use octrees at two levels: one for bounding spheres and boxes of objects, and then one for each geometry instance. For each object that matches, the ray would be transformed into the local object space, and then the search would proceed at O(log n) through the triangle faces of that object. The search would run depth-first, prioritizing octree nodes that are closest to the origin of the ray (and within the max distance, of course). In theory, this should allow you to stop early - not after the very first match, but a hell of a lot less than every single node, object and triangle. The object-level octree would have to be updated every time an object moves, but 

I have some concerns/questions about this approach:
1. Will the geometry octree take up too much memory?
2. Will it take too long to generate the geometry octree the first time?
3. Maybe there's some way to represent it compactly in a typed array or two, so it can be generated in a worker and transferred over, addressing both of the above?
4. Are there any other uses for such a data structure, as long as we're going to the trouble?
5. What about morphing/animated geometries?

Does anyone have a better idea?
 Incidentally, there is already an [issue](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/5691) for this at the three.js repo, but it has not had much attention.
 @dmarcos Yes, I do think that aframe needs to raycast fewer things, as [noted above](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/829#issue-126553429): in particular, photo spheres. Until this gets fixed in three.js (if ever), a photo or video sphere will match every single time and require searching through every single triangle on every frame.

Also, I agree that this should be addressed over in three.js, but the existing implementation is mostly useless (not to mention undocumented and hard to find) and the discussion over there seems to have been lost in the pile. I figured we could discuss it over here since this community seems a bit more focused. If I could get some feedback on the idea, I can make an attempt to fix it and make a pull request over there, or even publish it as a separate repo.
 Could it be that hidden objects are also included in the raycasts?
I tried to create a multi-scene environment in A-Frame by hiding/showing objects, every added object seemed to slow it down more, even when the object is hidden. I know, this approach isn't ideal, but it appeared to be the best way to have multiple "rooms" currently. 

I also had strange behaviour when a hidden object was on top of a shown object, when the shown object was being clicked, nothing happened, but the hidden object did seem to pick up clicks.
 The unclickable items because of overlaying hidden objects is fixed in the latest dev.
I tried to speed up raycasting a bit locally, see:

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/compare/dev...jerbob92:dev

Not sure if it's the right approach but it seems to be smoother on my HTC One M9.
 @jerbob92 Looks like a big step in the right direction.

BTW, are you guys building geometry for a single-color background "sky"? Might it not be much more efficient to just set the clear color?
  I started working on this: https://github.com/xirvr/aframe 
Working off of: https://gist.github.com/xirvr/275483488ea35d85b895f7f44de7afdf 
 Given the large overhead for the glTF loader / parser / etc from the ThreeJS library, @dmarcos and @ngokevin recommended starting with this as a 3rd party component.  I converted the above branch changes to: https://github.com/xirvr/aframe-gltf 
  Same issue here. 
- Device: Epson Moverio BT-200
- Browser: Firefox 45
 @dmarcos still having this error. I'm using a samsung s7 edge with firefox.

Edit: I was able to almost get rid of the error by going into`aframe.js` and changing `util.max_timestep` and 'util.min_timestep' Is this bad. What should be done to solve this error.  
 I'm having this error occur too using an iPhone 6 Plus. I'm not currently using Aframe but I'm using the WebVR polyfill so I feel like it's potentially related to that.
 It is clearly related to WebVR polyfill. See webvr-polyfill.js:5706:

```var deltaS = timestampS - this.previousTimestampS;
                if (deltaS <= Util.MIN_TIMESTEP || deltaS > Util.MAX_TIMESTEP) {
                    console.warn('Invalid timestamps detected. Time step between successive ' +
                    'gyroscope sensor samples is very small or not monotonic');
                    this.previousTimestampS = timestampS;
                    return;
                }``` This appears to be still an issue: https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/issues/201

If anyone can follow up there with more info (what are the timestamps? are they not updated or too small/large?), I'll check it out Closed via https://github.com/googlevr/cardboard-vr-display/pull/9 -- will be in the next polyfill release. To clarify, this just silences the messages and only displays once. In testing, was getting messages for this in iOS and Firefox for Android, but the pose estimation was still working just fine, so this clears out the console a bit. If anyone has issues with this warning AND poses are not working, would love to learn more!  Hi ngokevin,

Would following warn message be sufficient in this case:

_core:schema:warn Unknown component property: primitive box_

I would alter the code like this:

```
Object.keys(propData).forEach(function (propName) {
    if (!schema[propName] && !silent) {
-      warn('Unknown component property: ' + propName);
+      warn('Unknown component property: ' + (propName != '' ? propName : propData[propName]));
    }
  });
```

If you find it OK, I will create pull request for this.
   Disabling antialiasing was a method we employed to make Firefox OS TV games more performant.  Can we close this based on perf > image quality?
  Would love to see this feature, @ngokevin .  AFAIR allowfullscreen was disabled in JSFiddle for fraud protection. @oskarkrawczyk - any thoughts? 
 I'm amazed that I've not removed this for fraud protection (as @zalun has done with jsfiddle), since jsbin seems to attract some pretty wonderful fraud.

Anyway, I digress. @ngokevin where would you expect to go to full screen? In an embedded bin or from the jsbin editor?
 @ngokevin Ah, cheers for clarifying. I got a notification from twitter (on a dead account I have under my name), from @darkwing. 

Worth closing the issue if it's not an issue anymore? 
 @zalun Correct. But now that it's impossible to remove JSFiddle embed UI in the embeddable it might as well be re-enabled.
    As a user, I agree that mixin is a better name for the same reasons.
  Hey I know this is closed but it appears the the issue reappears if someone is using Microsoft Edge as a browser on the first load. Not sure if this counts as a problem or not but thought I would mention it as is a bug for something I'm building for clients.   Still seeing this in Chrome. Any progress or is this a browser issue?
 @ngokevin  Is that issue still there I'm not able to reproduce and experience this issue!?
  Unfortunately this new animation system doesn't have any docs yet :/

Experimenting with loading animations as part of a three.js JSON model a bit here: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/loaders/three-model.js
  Test case for 0.5.0:

The yellow square with opacity: 1 works fine. The yellow square with partial opacity does not appear unless the DOM elements are re-ordered:

````
<html>
<head>
	<script src="aframe-v0.5.0.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body style="background-color: black">
	<a-scene>
		<a-plane material="color: red; opacity: 0.5" position="0 1 -2"></a-plane>
		<a-plane material="color: yellow;" position="-0.6 1.6 -2.1"></a-plane>
		<a-plane material="color: yellow; opacity: 0.5" position="0.6 1.6 -2.1"></a-plane>
		<!-- Move red plane here and it works -->
	</a-scene>
</body>
</html>
```` I have an issue where a fadeIn / fadeOut of a simple plane in front of the camera is making other elements with transparency disappear. Is this the same issue?

I'm adding the fade plane dynamically, so should I be trying to add it to the top or the bottom of the DOM to try to beat this?

I should note the fade plane ends up being a child of the camera currently.

And since this is something I'm working on at work, if there's anything I can do to help move the final solution forward just let me know. I have no idea where this would start though :)
 Is there a reason that the standard solution to this (sorting transparent objects based on distance to the camera), is actively disabled by AFrame? Admittedly it doesn't always work but in most situations it works way better than manually controlling the render order. Especially in head-tracked VR, where the user's head can be anywhere.

At least having the option to turn it on would be great.

I'm referring specifically to a-scene.js:486
```
renderer.sortObjects = false;
``` Consider turning it on by default with an option to turn it off. Having it off works well for 3DOF experiences with no movement, or very fixed movement, but the addition of 6DOF or even teleport will break most manually-ordered objects.

The case where sorting really breaks down is with intersecting (or self-intersecting) objects, since the sort is per object, not per triangle (though in the wider world where compute shaders are available, sorting per-triangle is sometimes used). To support manual ordering of some objects for those cases you could then expose threejs's `Object3D.renderOrder` property if it's not already.

The accepted answer here has a good explanation of the problems and potential solutions (including one of the replies which talks about the render queues):
http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/609021/how-to-fix-transparent-rendering-problem.html Can you post an example or screenshot of what happens when the order is not by Z index, to see the ugly effect? Interesting. Thanks. So sorting order for transparency is the order in which the nodes are found in the scene tree? Maybe it can be configurable with an attribute, like `sort-order="3"` to not have to worry about tree order. Does Three.js have any such feature? Or does it too rely on tree order? Tree order is (I assume) used in the case where `renderer.sortObjects` is set to false (like AFrame currently does). Unless you're controlling the camera viewpoint very carefully this is almost never what you want as a global setting. Is there some reason why the `renderer.sortObjects = false;` line still hasn't been removed? Seems like such a simple fix that would cover 95% of cases, and there's a reason why the default value is true in three.js. I'll submit a pull request if it's just because no one has got around to it.

For anyone looking for a quick workaround, see [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42003726/2501624). @adelespinasse I tried using sort objects once after seeing it in this thread and the results were very poor in VR. Render order would change as I turned my head, causing the order of objects to flicker back and forth. Have you had better results? @wmurphyrd It's worked for me so far, but I've only tried it with very simple toy scenes (like, 3 non-overlapping convex translucent objects). Did you have concave or overlapping objects or anything?

I don't know the details of how the sorting works...  are objects always sorted for every frame, or is it done opportunistically when there's time or something? And are objects sorted separately for each eye?  Personally, I think white or an off-white color would be most appealing as a default.
 What would be a good workaround for this in the mean time? A solid colour skybox? @ngokevin this is closed by #3277   @ngokevin I've updated your `shadow` and `shadow-light` components for A-Frame v0.2.0 and the THREE.js changes [here](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/shadows). Performance seems OK with directional lighting, but [bad with point lights](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/issues/50). 

Having trouble with some of the parameters though – shadows have been offset or weirdly scaled in my tests so far.
 @donmccurdy 
Try settings your shadow bias to `0.02` and increasing your map size to a width and height of `2048`. I find tweaking the bias stops the light bleed at the edge of objects and a higher map size will help that jagged look. Also, you may want to drop shadow darkness; it seems that it's legacy at this point.
 @msimpson thanks! that does look sharper but the shapes of shadows are still wrong. maybe i'm misunderstanding how directional lights should be positioned, but haven't found a good example yet.

Example here - the shadow seems to only come from the end of a longer object : /

That's really odd. I've not seen that before. Actually, can you reproduce that in a fiddle or something so I can see how that's happening?

http://codepen.io/msj121/pen/gMMyrO

Just figured I would let you see it in action; sadly, something is wonky on codepen or I made a stupid mistake....

Try it for yourself:

```
<a-scene>
  <a-sphere shadow="cast:true;receive:true;" position="0 0.25 -4.5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
  <a-box shadow="cast:true;receive:true;" position="-1 -0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" width="1" height="1" depth="1" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
  <a-cylinder shadow="cast:true;receive:true;" position="1 -0.25 -2" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
  <a-plane shadow="cast:true;receive:true;" rotation="-90 0 0" position="0 -1 -3" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
  <a-entity shadow-light="type:spot;angle:45;castShadow:true;" position="15 25 15"></a-entity>
  <a-entity camera="active:true" wasd-controls="" look-controls="" position="0 0 0" rotation="0 0 0"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```
 I wouldn't complicate the light component any further with shadows. I have a pr in the works which uses three components: a shadow-scene, shadow-object and shadow-light component, to be used on the respective elements. With the shadow-scene you can globally set shadows on or off and set the type.

Will continue on it after aframe is updated to use the latest threejs.
 Any update about shadows?
I really want A-Frame official shadows support~ @donmccurdy Yeah, I confirmed `aframe-extras.shadow` works now, thanks. But I found a bug and have a feature request so I'll send PR to it.

And it seems like shadow will get in 0.5.0, that sound p good to me :D
 As for me(Three.js user/contributor and Web contents creator),
adding the shadow stuffs into existing light is more natural than separating them.
  @caseyyee is that still valid?  Hi, my obj files are rendering flat in the following example (white object), is this a problem with my lighting? 
[Example Site](http://kliang3.github.io/)
  Has this been fixed yet?  Still happening, even in embedded example. When selecting a text outside canvas, you can no longer rotate the view.

  This would be pretty cool to have. Maybe if the component took the first child `<svg>` tag, then used the [data-uri trick](http://getcontext.net/read/svg-images-on-a-html5-canvas) to convert it into a texture? 
 Mostly interested in this because it could be a declarative alternative to what's being worked on in https://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe/pull/41
 [https://threejs.org/docs/#Examples/Loaders/SVGLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#Examples/Loaders/SVGLoader) @7dir  - any update? Even rough code would be appreciated; save me from re-coding the wheel. Thanks @ngokevin, @morandd  ping
update regestry please
https://github.com/7dir/aframe-svgfile-component  @ngokevin Have you all decided whether this will be a new physics implementation, or try to integrate cannonjs / oimojs / etc with A-Frame?
 @donmccurdy I think that's being discussed [here](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-physics-components/issues/7)
 @RangerMauve oh! Cool thanks I missed that.
 I'd put a vote for cannon, I've found it predictable and reliable. If you set the global friction to 0.0, then you can slide past boxes when you run into them. The newest cannon supports running the physics at a lower frame rate than the renderer, and just interpolating the inbetween steps, which might be useful. Ammo is a beast, it's really big. Oimo is a pretty legit option, but cannon has better documentation, and @schteppe is a pretty responsive dude.
   Is this feature still considered or is there a workaround to achieve this behavior?

 that's just a regular event? so something like this in indicator.init()
would work?

this.parentNode.addEventListener('model-loaded', function() {
  this.parentNode.removeChild(this);
});

  whats difference between #578 and this?
  Until someone else documents it elsewhere, for the record this seemed to work by adding this to the entity:
`onClick="location.href='https://google.com'"`
 I'd like to have `href` component, which support normal link

`<a-spere href=“http://www.example.org”>`

or support anchor, 

`<a-cylinder href=“#box”>`

Click this object and it will focus on the object with `id="box"` [with the animation]

So each object could be used as a normal html linkable element.

It will be nice when cursor moved onto the object, the cursor changes it shape.
 added simplest example: 2 objects with href component https://gasolin.github.io/aframe-href-component/basic/index.html
 Anyone knows what's the status of this? The FAQ says "Link traversal support was introduced in the WebVR 1.0 API and A-Frame 0.3.0. There is a link component that can trigger navigation and built-in support for knowing whether the user is navigating from another WebVR experience.", but I can't find any other mention of the link component in the documentation. Does it exist? 
 I'm also wondering about this too; I've been waiting to update my A-Frame projects to 0.3.0 for months so I can implement link traversal. According to this discussion on Stack Overflow it was a mistake, and link traversal actually hasn't been introduced yet: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39311524/a-frame-link-traversal-support
Here's hoping it gets added soon.
 is there an update on href?
doesn't seem to work for me . Hello, I'm looking for an example of opening a new a-scene (defined in a separate file) through a link. Is that something that version 0.5.0 can handle?  any follow up or solution?
 Just for reference, I experimented with using PhantomJS to render a page continuously and stream it in as a video. From there you could forward click/keypress events back to Phantom. This works, but it's not very practical because phantom is very process intensive and can only render every so many milliseconds so the frame rate of the page is extremely low.

It sounds like some sort of new browser API will be the way to go.

  I'm curious to know, when React adds stuff to the DOM after it's diffing process, will that stuff be picked up by A-Frame?
 @ngokevin

So without using aframe-react, if I have aframe and react from CDN loaded in the page (and that's all), then I can just start writing React components without needing to do anything special? For example

``` js
class Foo extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <a-scene>
      </a-scene>
    )
  }
}
```

Do you know how A-Frame detects new elements in the DOM to read from (and then render based on what it sees)? Is it using some browser APIs? Or something custom?

EDIT: I answered my own question after looking at the source: It's using document.registerElement (the polyfill if not available)! This is awesome. So people can use anything like Mithril, Mercury, Om, CitoJS, etc, to output elements to the DOM (elements with names that match those registered by A-Frame) and then A-Frame will automatically detect those and update the rendering.

This is really cool!! This is probably the best use of `registerElement` I've ever seen, and a good idea that I'd like to borrow for what some of us are working on at http://infamous.io.
 Cool. It's really awesome stuff! This makes me think of regular HTML elements in a whole new way. :smile: 
 @ngokevin ECS?
 Oh, yes, it's also what [Famous](http://famous.org) was doing before it got abandoned. A scene graph in Famous was made up of instances of a `Node` class (entity), and onto each Node could be added various components (tranforms, meshes, event handlers, etc) that could be independent or interact with other components on the same node. They were also making something called Famous Framework, which was their attempt to make a declarative HTML layer on top of their Engine. But they weren't using `document.registerElement`!

I wonder how I overlooked all this time that custom elements would be the perfect communication mechanism between a rendering engine (Three.js, Famous, Babylon, etc) and a DOM manipulation library (React, Mithril, etc).
  iOS devices wont play videos in case there was not a user click event.
So i use a start button.
Unfortunantely the animations already start uppon document.onload and are no longer in sync.
 @ngokevin how can this be configured with a scene component?

@cvan sounds good. i also love the idea with different timelines. :-)
 With begin i have to use integer (Delay (in milliseconds) or event name to wait on before beginning animation.) Is it possible to begin animation on click?  As discussed in #347, I moved some of the browserify-specific dependencies so they're properly installed during a bundling process. 
  Try to move the camera around:
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eJvNvb

For me it seems as if the sound position is only calculated based on the cameras starting position/rotation. As soon as you move around or rotate the camera, it's no longer correct
 @ngokevin this issue seems to be solved but issue have left open since commit message was not correctly formatted to auto close this.
  I feel like this should work, but doesn't, and I'm not sure why. I can load a gif fine in an a-sky object, but it only displays the first frame instead of animating properly. 
 Thanks. Can I turn this into a feature request?
 I would also like the feature of playing .gifs on a surface. 
  Right now `aframe-core` depends on `browserify-css` as a browserify transform. It works magically when you depend on the CommonJS version from npm using browserify. But, other bundlers do not support this.

Tools like jspm/rollup/webpack/whatever need to rely on the UMD build. Webpack users can set up loaders (like `transform-loader` or `ify-loader`) to work with the CommonJS export, but this might not be immediately clear to consumers.

Eventually it might be worth transpiling the static assets (like CSS, GLSL, etc) on pre-publish so that webpack/browserify/jspm/etc users get the same CommonJS export.

One option which is currently a work in progress:
https://github.com/livejs/transpilify

Other ideas discussed here:
https://gist.github.com/mattdesl/aaf759da84cc44c22305

This issue is really just to discuss any other ideas/approaches, and how this might affect development workflow, etc. Or, maybe no change is needed, and docs just need to provide more details on other bundlers. 
  When trying to make a dome I noticed that neither phiStart, phiEnd, thetaStart or thetaEnd have any impact on the sphere primitive (as otherwise described in the documentation: https://aframe.io/docs/components/geometry.html#Sphere)

Codepen:
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/wMgmYV
 Ah, my bad got a little late
I still think the issue is there, though:
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/wMgmYV
 It's no problem for me right now. In my case I found I could use a cone in stead (I guess a cone also performs better as it has less segments), but thanks for looking into it and good it's on it's way :) Will definitely be useful!
  I started fiddling with the example on codepen, first thing I tried was adding a model from Blender. I uploaded that file on my own website's server, but it didn't load. At first I thought it was because I was exporting non valid files. SO I made various other models and exports.

However, I found that loading the tree1 model from the secured server from aframe did work ( https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/_models/tree1/tree1.dae) I then tried loading the same file from my server.
Loading the same file in codepen from my server doesn't work (http://www.jon-ibe.be/aframe/tree1.dae)

After loading an html file from the same folder on my own server with the same code as the codepen I saw the models loading correctly.

http://www.jon-ibe.be/aframe/aframetest.html
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/OMbmyz?editors=110

So hence I'm "blaming" this on the security restrictions.

Maybe it's a logical thing security wise, but I didn't see any documentation on this.
 Ok, thanks for the clarification. Makes sense now.
I have no idea where I could set this up on my websites server, I doubt I have access to this function. I'll ask the provider. 
For now I'll do my experiments on my own, I just liked the quick and easy way of editing a live Codepen.
I'll close the issue since it's not A-frame related.
  Can Panorama image rotate by the position of MOUSE ?

I have downloaded the example/template-sky,  with drag to rotate the sky panorama images. is there a way to rotate the image by the position x,y of mouse 
  Rather than the scene being centred around how the user is holding the VR device I'd like to fix the scene based on compass directions (north, east, south, west') in order to use A-Frame for an augmented reality project.

I'm not sure whether this is possible and I haven't been able to find any info on the topic. Please can someone point me in the right direction?
 Thanks for the quick reply Josh, although I've only just noticed it in the avalanche of Christmas emails.

I'll look into creating a mini-spec, it could be a useful AR tool for developers :)
 Peter, I'd be interested in that too.  I've got "look at using A-Frame with our argon.js AR toolkit" on my todo list, but it'll be a bit till I can do it. 
 I suspect that aframe-artoolkit just uses the artoolkit, not device orientation, so it doesn't matter to them.  I would agree that we should definitely use the absolute real-world device orientation of the device if we have it.  Codepen:
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vLyzYq?editors=100

The cylinder to the left represents the way that a-curvedimage is currently implemented. It has a scale of 1 1 -1 to be able to show a given texture nonmirrored along the horizontal axis inside the cylinder. This has the side effect of only letting light from _outside_ the cylinder illuminate it.

The cylinder to the right has a scale of 1 1 1 and as you can see the light illuminates it correct, but if you were to apply a texture to it, the texture would be mirrored along the horizontal axis.

For now I've solved it by using the cylinder to the right and then in photoshop mirror the original texture so it looks correct after being mirrored back in a-frame
  Apologies if this is missing the obvious, but I'm trying to add aframe as a project dependency based on the instructions listed in the README:

```
$ npm install aframe
```

And inside `index.js`:

```
require('aframe')
```

However, when I try to run browserify (installed globally), I get errors related to dependencies:

```
$ browserify index.js

Again, apologies if this is barking up the wrong tree but I'm out of ideas.
 Hi,

It's because you don't have it in your node_modules directory I suppose. Go to you aforce node_module and then try npm install. This should install all dependencies from aforce directory. good luck!
 Thanks for the pointer. I suppose I'm still wrestling with this: if someone adds Aframe to their project purely as a dependency, shouldn't Aframe install its own dependencies as well? I might be stretching here, but I think that's a reasonable expectation when adding a utility to a project.
 No problem :) Right it should be. I had the same problem. Unfortunately if you are adding it to your own dependencies then it doesn't run all other stuff - just downloading aforce. Thats it. 

Did you manage to handle that error ? :)
 Yes, the tip you provided worked. However, I believe my point still stands: Aframe should install dependencies necessary to its functioning as part of the install process.
_Edit:_ or, if I'm making too many/too broad of assumptions here: at least amend the install instructions to cover this case. I'll admit I'm not terribly familiar with package management best practices, and the error received is fairly inscrutable.
 Thanks @cvan! I've been poking around was thinking of moving some of the dependencies necessary for building from `devDependencies` to the regular `dependencies`—am I totally off-base? Happy to test and PR.
 Took a stab at this—[I moved the dependencies.](https://github.com/mattpolicastro/aframe/commit/a72b7f17a31a3eb0819aa9ddc9574d245b6c784e) Can't say I've given it terribly rigorous testing, but:
1. Added my tweaked `aframe` as a local dependency
2. Parent project's `index.js` contains `require('aframe');` to make sure it bundles the necessary files
3. Ran `npm install` grabbed all of `aframe-core` as well as the browserify plugins
4. Ran `browserify index.js` and got a successful output
 Apologies for dropping off the map for the past few days—thanks for addressing, @cvan!
  Just try the cursor & hover example on a mobile device and it does not work. Interaction does not work on mobile devices?

  Sound component was added in https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/pull/326/files . There are no examples on how to use it. Do we need changes to templates to be able to use it?
  When we are in VR mode and redirect from page 1 to page 2 , page 2 opens in normal mode. 
 Guys got it, So this is not a A-Frame issue, makes sense thank you very much. 

As an alternate : Do you think an implementation which allows you to set the screen mode during page load either as URL param or a HTTP post parameter will help within A-frame. I believe such feature will only make it more agile to use for solving complex business problems. Anyways thank you very much.
 Hi! How can you request full screen? I always get the error message that it needs to come from user's input, which is why I can't force it, even with a cookie telling me I was in VR before
  Does this works as a VR HMD?
  I'm currently working on implementing [three-bmfont-text](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-bmfont-text) as a component.

It will look like this:

``` html
    <a-entity bmtext="text: Hello, World!;
              font: demo/fonts/Exo2Bold.fnt"
              material="color: #66E1B4"
              position="0 2 0"></a-entity>
```

A couple problems have come up and I'm not sure whether AFrame can support it yet:
- The BMFont file specifies the path to the `map` texture, so the user should not need to specify `src` in the `material` attribute. However, it seems like AFrame expects this is the only way to set a map on a texture?
- `this.el.object3D.material.map` is undefined, so I can't even override it programmatically ? 
- Is there a way to handle async (resolve, reject) with AFrame components? Changing the font will trigger some XHRs that may or may not succeed
- Pure bitmap font is pretty useless in VR/3D, instead most users will want to use a SDF font. However, I am not sure how `material` can use a custom shader specifically for this component.
- `update()` is called immediately after `init()` with no `oldData` parameter, is that intended? 
- The default scale is huge since it is in pixel units (not world units). I could apply a scaling matrix to the geometry every time the text changes, but that is a bit expensive. Is there a way I could override this scale, maybe by attaching my text mesh to a parent Object3D with its own scaling, so that the user can expect that `scale=1.0,1.0,1.0` looks similar to the rest of their primitives
- This component expects some other defaults for `material` like `side: double` (not 100% needed but it will be the common case)

Maybe I should register a second component like `textmaterial`, `bmmaterial` or `bm-material` (is that valid HTML?), so that I can listen to changes in `color` and trigger updates in my custom SDF shader.
      Sorry for the weird pull request before. 
  A simple request from France, if it would be possible to have the Z key mapped to the W action, and same thing with Q for the A, it would allow a seamless controller for AZERTY keyboards
 I was thinking of trying a general `keyboard-controls` component that emits arbitrary keyboard events on the target element (as opposed to `wasd-controls` focusing on movement) and the `e.key` polyfill seems like a really good way to go.

Apologies if this is horrifying and framework-ey, but any thoughts on using some sort of event-binding syntax?

Example:

``` html
<a-model src="player.obj"
         keyboard-controls
         sound="src: pew-pew.mp3;
                on: keydown[key=f]">
</a-model>
```

Same thing could apply to more complicated actions like animations or WASD navigation, perhaps.

I tried something similar in gamepad-controls [here](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-gamepad-controls/blob/bfa349214cb1ac9acedc0824e27adb2e4881770a/gamepad-controls.js#L215-L219), but i'm not entirely sure about the idea.
 Oops, just noticed the `<a-event />` syntax. That also seems nice, although I'm less clear about whether it would make sense for keyboard bindings.
  Cone entity method is described here:
https://aframe.io/docs/components/geometry.html

Codepen showing that nothing happens:
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bEexvM
 It works for me, can you give a try? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/OMXdZq
 Ops sorry I just didn't notice that you wrote `...using a cylinder...` :)
  I was thinking of making a component for setting constraints on where a person could walk based on a mapping of some sort. It'd be useful if the component could just be attached to something that already has the WASD component and listen to when the person gets moved.

It'd be nice if I could make code that'd look something like:

``` js
this.addEventListener("move", handleMovement);

// ....

function handleMovement(event){
 var position = event.data.position;
 var previousPosition = event.data.previousPosition;

 if(!canMoveTo(position)){
   this.setAttribute("position", previousPosition);
 }
}
```
 Thanks! Is there something in the docs related to that event that I must have missed?
 Ah! Totally didn't register that part. Thanks!
  Objects randomly overlap with each other 

Example : check out http://www.vuutu.xyz or if this is taking time for DNS replication, please check out http://www.justdeliver.us

login and you should be able to see your facebook photos as a curved image. If you mouseover a picture, it overlap.
 Sorry about this trouble, been playing on this environment. Give me sometime and i will compile if nothign with some screen shots and some codes. Will provide more details.
 Its most likely that i might be screwing it up somewhere , I am looking into it now but just wanted to keep you in loop as well :

I am looping through all the facebook photos as a curved image , The logic is simple

Each subsequent image position 'position="0 '+s+' 0"' where s += 2 (until R no of rows as defined by application are reached) and rotation is 'rotation="0 '+q+' 0" ' where q += 20

This way i am building towers high of the pictures each 20 degrees apart. However on the mouse over when i scale the image out it randomly sometimes comes in front and hides the object behind it (which i am expecting it to do ) but then sometime the image behind it appears on top of the scale out image

 Should be solved now. Try it please.

## 

Regards
 I am looking at the site right now, but mouse over does nothing at all.
 Cursor focus should.
 Yes, Do you want me to update the A-Frame version ? With the existing version it is still an issue.

You can check it out @ prototype : http://www.vuutu.xyz
 Dead code is fixed. I have for now disabled the scale property, until i can resolve the overlapping issue. Thanks. Will reopen the issue in case something from framework is missing. Thanks.
  Could not find any property to add labels or text to an existing shape.

1) If it exists please mark this as a question for answer / also please guide me how to find this information on my own in future and not bother you.
2) If not please suggest if this can be added as an enhancement.

Regards,
Kapil
 Super thanks.
   I seem to have forgot to add the files. I'm still learning git. Sorry for that.

So is doing **npm start** after changing the files enough to test the changes I made?
 I'm afk now. No worries, I understand. Will do once I get back.

  I branched this off @cvan's PR, #310. Features changed:
- Move `opt.live` to `consts.LIVE` so that it doesn't get sent as an option to budo (don't want to duplicate reloads or anything)
- Remove the build step in `npm run dev` since it's now superfluous. Even if a local `build` directory doesn't exist, budo will still serve our watchified (incremental) `src/index.js` bundle during development
 `watchGlob` added to `budo@7.1.0`, small example here:
https://github.com/mattdesl/budo/blob/master/docs/api-usage.md#http-server

I updated this PR.

Things to note:
- I made sure the `open` and `live` options being passed are booleans rather than string/number
-  `watchGlob` only needs to specify files that won't be picked up by browserify's `require()` algorithm. Because `polymerize` emits its HTML dependencies, watchify/budo will trigger an `'update'` and LiveReload when one of the templates changes.
- Now the `watchGlob` is just looking at the `examples/` folder

The only file that isn't triggering a live-reload now is `VRLoader.js`, but I can't find any require references to it.
 K, should be fixed with `dev` now.
 Actually, since they are (always?) converted to strings, it has to be something like this:

``` js
  live: 'LIVE' in process.env  // To disable: `LIVE=0 npm start`
    ? String(process.env.LIVE) === '1'
    : true,
  ...
```

The env vars are a bit clunky. Maybe just enable live reload by default and move the live/open flags to a new PR. I think `--` is a cleaner approach and also easier to type.
  Running npm run dist generated 0 byte files for dist/aframe.js and dist/aframe.min.js

While trying to debug the issue I found multiple problems with this line :

```
mkdir -p dist/ && npm run browserify -s -- --debug | exorcist dist/aframe.js.map > dist/aframe.js && uglifyjs dist/aframe.js -c warnings=false -m -o dist/aframe.min.js
```

```
npm run browserify  -s -- --debug
```

This command above runs and exits with exit code 0, but doesn't print anything to STDOUT

but this does print the browserified file:

```
npm run browserify  -s
```

Any ideas?
 @cemkod What happens when you run this?

``` sh
npm run browserify -- --debug
```

Also, what versions of npm and node are you on?

``` sh
node -v
npm -v
```

@cvan What does the empty `-s` option do in this case? It looks like a typo that shouldn't be there?
 @mattdesl 

```
npm run browserify -- --debug
```

No output, exit code 0

node v0.10.25
npm 1.3.10
 You need `npm@2.0` or higher for the `--` feature to work. Might be worth documenting in the AFrame readme.

https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script#description

You can do something like this to install a newer version:

``` sh
# latest version
sudo npm install npm@3.x -g

# or, v2 is also pretty good
sudo npm install npm@2.x -g
```
 Fixed! Thank you @mattdesl, @cvan 
  It'd be cool if we could point to an arbitrary video tag in the markup for video playback. The specific use case would be for when you use `getUserMedia` or WebRTC to get video feeds. Currently only urls are supported from what I understand, but I think that supporting arbitrary video tags will let people make even cooler things.
 Thanks for the pointer, didn't notice that. Does it handle the video changing content over time properly? For example if the `src` changed or if a MediaStream got attached?
 Cool! I'll play around with it when I get the chance. Thanks!
  I'm planning on making a psychedelic game and one of the things I want to do is apply trippy filters on the entire screen when certain things happen. It'd be nice if there was a way to specify a fragment shader that would be applied on the final buffer before rendering it to the screen. Maybe it'd make sense to attach it to a camera?
 Awesome! Can't wait. Any clues as to what variables will be present? Or will it all be user defined. I think that having similar variables to shadertoy will improve the hackability 
  I've tried both mp4 and webm format, but at least on my Galaxy S6, it shows up black.
It looks fine on desktop

 Sadly none of these examples work on a Nexus 5 (Android 6.0.1) with Chrome for Android 49.0.2623.91.  Just a black screen on every example.
 From further testing I have discovered that video textures work as expected on Android using the latest Firefox mobile browser (45.0.1) in non-VR mode but when you switch to VR it crashes the browser after 1 second.  Nexus 5 (Android 6.0.1).  Video textures in Chrome still show black screens for me.

Great framework by the way.  Really like it.
 @villalard me too.
 @cvan Chrome 49.0.2623.91
Video source: http://www.wearevr.tech/content/clients/concepts/vr_cinema/index.html
 @villalard Does that link work for you on Android devices because it doesn't for me.
 @SonarSystems Hi, it works in Firefox for Android but not Chrome for Android.  Version numbers are above in the thread.
 @villalard Thanks for the very quick response, it worked :D 

I will try it in my own implementation tomorrow.

Do you know when Chrome will get fixed for this?
 @cvan Thanks for the link.

BTW I am working on a A-Frame tutorial series, should be ready within a week or 2
 @cvan @villalard Do you know if the videos have to be encoded or formatted in any particular way for Android, as when I play a video on Firefox on Android, it plays but when I click the VR Goggles button, it switches to VR mode for a second then crashes. 
 @SonarSystems I am having the same issue as noted above in the thread.  Please excuse my simplistic answer but I think it's just that stereoscopic views and video textures is just too much for the browser to take at present.
 @villalard I thought that but the wearevr link you shared works on my Android phone in Firefox. Hence why I thought maybe the video is to big or a wrong format.
 @SonarSystems I don't think it's an encoding issue because the video textures display in non-vr mode - I think that as soon as the second video instance gets created (stereoscopic) it just maxes out the memory allocation that the browser has set.  I will try to bring the video filesize down to see if this helps.

Again, apologies for making general assumptions in a technical forum - my knowledge of what is going on in the background is very minimal.
 @villalard Thanks for the response, your feedback is much appreciated. It's weird because the other link works.
 @cvan Every time I debug using Firefox, when it crashes the console disappears on my computer because of the crash. Can I save the log some how?
 > @villalard Thanks for the response, your feedback is much appreciated. It's weird because the other link works.

@SonarSystems I have re-encoded the videos in my test (http://www.wearevr.tech/content/clients/concepts/vr_cinema/index.html) but the crash still occurs when going into stereoscopic.  I have tried all the other examples listed on this link and they all crash Firefox when going into VR mode.  Can you tell me which example you are talking about that you say works?
 @villalard Well they were all working but now when I go onto it none of them work. Could you send me the original encoded files and I will try them please. You can send them to support@sonarsystems.co.uk

Cheers
 Hi everybody, 
I am also trying to make a VR video working on mobile (iOs and Android) with videosphere, however as I am a very beginner in this field, I don't quite understand, I got that I have to set this metatag <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"> and also set the webkit-playsinline, but how do we do those?
I mean, where do I paste the metatag and what do I write to implement this webkit-playsinline? 
And I don't understand what "Pin the webpage to the iOS homescreen" means... As you see I do not understand a lot....any help would be soooo welcome! 
Thank you very much in advance, I am so lost! 
 This problem didn't solve before,Not going to study aframe.
 Thank you for your contribution, the video can be played however I am not able to have it displayed in a double screen for VR...  I would say it is the webkit-playsinline which does the work?
Does somebody know the code to implement the webkit-playsinline?
Thanks! 
 Here, take this... it should help you on your way:

 Any news on this? Pretty big use killer for Cardboard
 > I could be convinced to add to A-Frame support for autoplay playback for Chrome for Android via some "Play" button if we detect any videos in the scenes on the page

I guess this is what I'm hoping for. Are we under the impression there will never be a way to run videosphere automatically on page load without hacks? Sorry, new to js.
 Has anyone had any luck getting videosphere to work in a iOS WebView? I have:
1. Enabled allowsInlineMediaPlayback in the WebView
2. Added the `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">` tag and `webkit-playsinline` property to the video element
3. Tried both `autoplay=true` and `autoplay=false`

I've also tried to add the videosphere demo on the A-Frame website to the homescreen and open it and I still can't see the video.
 so far, I had not luck on my side :-(
so if I sum up with all of what has been said, the code to implement would be something like that? : 

```
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>360 Video</title>
<meta name="description" content="360 Video — A-Frame">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
<script src="aframe.min.js"></script>


<a-scene>
  <a-videosphere src="draft3.mp4" controls webkit-playsinline ad-outlet="video" autoplay="true" loop="true" rotation="0 180 0"></a-videosphere>

</a-scene>
```

let me know! 
 The `webkit-playsinline` property should be applied to the video element.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>360 Video</title>
    <meta name="description" content="360 Video — A-Frame">
    <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
    <script src="aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-assets>
        <video id="video" src="test.mp4" loop webkit-playsinline></video>
      </a-assets>
      <a-videosphere src="#video" rotation="0 180 0"></a-videosphere>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```
 Since I am on IOS, I pin it to the home screen and it works!!! (although I have no sound, I can display the image in double for the Google cardboard and the video plays by itself) Thank you! 
  Same on my Nexus 5 (Android 4.4.4., Chrome 47.0.2526.83). In the Chrome console, I get the messages : 

> THREE.WebGLRenderer 74dev
> THREE.WebGLRenderer: OES_texture_float_linear extension not supported.
 @ngokevin Any update? :)
This is probably related: #307 

If there is anyway I can manually test it, I'd be happy to help! (clone from master and `npm build`? or is the new three.js version not in there? If not, where would I need to look for?)
 @ngokevin I checked out the `dev` branch from github. It's definetely not fixed there. ;)
Anyways, looking forward to the new release.
 @ngokevin ah, thanks for the hint! Totally oversaw to checkout aframe-core. Just read through the instructions with `npm link` etc. ~~Will try it out tommorow.~~
Just tried it, and it works indeed!

Just wondering: How would I manually build a `dist` of aframe after testing with `npm link`? Would the updated _aframe-core_ have to be published to the npm repo before building the dist of _aframe_? I tried running `npm run dist` in aframe, which resultet in errors (supposedly uglifyjs after running the steps manually).

The structure of the project and the build process are new to me, please excuse me, if I am asking overly obvious things :)
 I just runned `npm dist` on the dev branch. The `aframe.js` file produced allows me to use `<a-sky>` now. I do not have a black screen anymore on my Nexus 5 (Android 4.4.4, Chrome 47.0.2526.83) but Firefox 43.0 crashes.
  Whenever you click in any of the examples and drag around, if you leave the frame at all, it stops the rotation of the canvas and you have to click and hold again in the canvas to start panning again. This leads to a pretty annoying experience. 
 Yep it is.
  Resized texture images to powers of ten.
 This is my first pull request for a public project. Hope I have done everything right. 
 I tried to fix the positioning and aspect ratios of all materials in the examples according to the changed dimensions. It is not possible to convert the textures to POT and not add a padding in some cases because some of the examples contain textures with dimensions that are not integer divisible (as in: 1/2 ,1/4 as opposed to 1/1.35). If the image is scaled so that one dimension is a power of two, the other dimension is not so some padding has to be added.
  I may be in a bit over my head, but are there any straightforward means of rendering text (a la [three.js and TextGeometry](http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Extras.Geometries/TextGeometry)) as part of a scene rather then relying on images? It would be pretty cool to provide dynamic labels on mouse/pointer events.
 Woohoo! Thank you. Apologies for duplicating an existing topic.
  Its not possible to have multiple different videos, because the ID of the Video being played is hard coded in the `a-video` template.

```
id="video"
```

Maybe this should be replaced by an attribute.

```
id="${videoId}"
```
 Just ran into this bug as well
  I just tried aframe.io on my Motorola X (2nd generation) and the examples don't appear correctly (black screen as you can see in the printscreen, even after a while so not a loading problem). Maybe a lighting problem (as we can see first printscreen a little).

Using:
- Motorola X 2nd generation
- Android 6.0
- Mozilla beta 43.0b10 and Chrome 47.0.2526.83 

![screenshot_20151217-103920](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5400381/11866372/fecc919e-a4aa-11e5-8176-d0f16b5b2983.png)
![screenshot_20151217-103937](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5400381/11866373/fed07138-a4aa-11e5-9843-c1f543d54db7.png)
 Same issue here.  Several examples just show a black screen as depicted in the screenshots above.
- Moto X 2nd Gen
- Android 6.0
- Chrome for Android 47.0.2526.83
 Same for Alcatel Idol3, (Android 5.0.x) in Chrome and Firefox.
The helloWorld example works fine, but composite etc. (all with textures?) show a black screen only.
 Same here with:
- HTC Sense 6
- Android 5.0.2
- Chrome 47.0.2526.83

Seems to be an issue with textures, although the Shopping example is partially working. I can see the person, but not the other textures.
  When entering the VR mode on mobile, putting it back in portrait doesn't change anything, and there are no "exit VR" button, which makes it a bit difficult to exit VR on phones with no physical back button (in my case Motorola X 2nd gen)
 Yes, indeed that's the case for the motoX, you have to swipe to get the phone UI back. It wasn't very intuitive for me at first (when I started VR on this phone and being fullscreen all the time), so I figure it might be complicated for some users too, that's why I was suggesting adding a bit of UI, like in the webVR boilerplate, to simplify user experience.
 Two questions:
- Is the important label still appropriate as there actually is a way to exit VR mode?
- Should we move this issue to aframevr/aframe-core?
  Is there any way os using 3D models generated with other software for using in more complex scenes?
  My single page site, running on Vue.js, has a template with aframe components. The scene doesn't seem to build properly after the Vue component is initialized. Is there a way to trigger the aframe init at runtime, so the Vue component can control when the scene should load? 
 bump. Is this still the preferred method for initializing aframe later in the stack? And will this defer the loading of assets?
 i've been using `v-if` on the `a-scene` to render only when other data is ready This hack work-around does not work when using custom a-marker patterns using AR.js.  Is it still necessary today to convert images to power of two? @ngokevin   POT is only needed if repeat wrapping is enabled and/or your `minFilter` is using mipmapping (see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Using_textures_in_WebGL) and [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/317d6f66542ab63323c5dab6c7a4e9d08c07ca05/src/renderers/WebGLRenderer.js#L2895-L2902)). If you set the following parameters, the texture won't be resized, and it will perform comparably to a POT size.

``` js
tex.minFilter = THREE.LinearFilter
tex.wrapS = THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping
tex.wrapT = THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping
```

Though POT is always preferred since the GPU tends to handle it better, and could lead to (subtle) performance improvements in certain cases.
  For large and long term projects it might be worth investing in some commit/release/changelog automation at some point:
https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release
https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/master/conventions/angular.md
http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/

(budo changelog drags behind regularly)
 The nice thing about npm scripts is they are easy to automate. For budo/browserify I've been using this:
https://github.com/mattdesl/quick-stub/blob/master/README.md

Also see `standardize` (I'd accept a PR for semistanfard) and @yoshuawuyts `initialize-engine`:  
https://www.npmjs.com/package/initialize-engine
  Update to the last `dev` version of three.js. https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/7661
 Actually, may be unrelated.
  This PR introduces these changes:
- Removes the `host` field from budo options. This will make budo resolve to the internal IP, and log that instead of `0.0.0.0`. Now it looks like this:

- The above change will fix LiveReload when you hit the IP on mobile devices. This seems like a bug with budo, I opened an issue here: https://github.com/mattdesl/budo/issues/118
- I have un-commented the `live()` feature since it now works on mobile. I'm not sure whether you had this commented intentionally (some devs prefer not to use it; my scripts sometimes include a `--live` option to toggle this).

Some other small things that could change with the build script:
- `browserify-css` should now emit file events (https://github.com/cheton/browserify-css/issues/20), so it should be picked up by watchify and trigger a hard live-reload. However it seems like all the browserify-css stuff is legacy, I am not seeing much CSS in this repo.
- The HTML inside `examples/` are not live-reloading
- The `browserifyArgs` option can be replaced by a `browserify: { ... }` options object for code clarity
 The `examples/` HTML files get picked up by the watch task, but nothing is telling budo to `reload()` when they change. I'm not exactly sure how the templates are being handled here (haven't looked too closely) but it seems like getting rid of the `.live()`, `.watch()` and `.on('watch')` and just replacing it with `live: true` in options should mostly work (defaults to watching JS/CSS/HTML and triggering reloads).

Will test further...
  Mouse dragging in Chrome (OSX) stops when you move outside the bounds of the canvas. This occurs on the demos as well:
https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase-spheres-and-fog/

One solution is to add the mouse events to the window element, but then compute the x/y offset relative to the canvas. See [here](https://github.com/mattdesl/mouse-event-offset) for reference.
  Works in portrait, but flipping the device to landscape (as required obviously) makes the horizontal/vertical movement wrong (i.e. look up, the scene moves left).  Tried in dev edition; nightly wouldn't render at all so couldn't confirm.

  "this CodePen example scene!" points to http://codepen.io/team/aframevr/pen/6e013bf4b446e85d8f268e937ee09143?editors=100 which gives a 404.

is it suppose to point to http://codepen.io/team/mozvr/pen/BjygdO?editors=100  ?
 aframe-core also points to the wrong example.
 cvan published it so that I can take a look, he had published this though : 
https://aframevr.github.io/docs/guide/
which points to : 
 -> http://codepen.io/team/mozvr/pen/BjygdO?editors=100
  Fixed by: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/338
We can close this.
  Took a quick look at this a few days ago.
Seems that the fourth command:
`npm run browserify -s -- --debug | exorcist dist/aframe.js.map > dist/aframe.js`
won't run on Windows, it errors out, but works on Unix, so I couldn't progress at the time.

Will give this task another go on my Mac (where I don't have the same issue) tomorrow.

  It find it also confusing while playing with it. I expected to be able to reach the object itself by accessing the main template node, but I ended up going into two nodes deeper to access the actual object.
This was using markdown but I found the same problem when trying to use it with three.js directly as I got two empty object3d with each template. From the perfomance point of view I believe it will add *3 objects per "object" that even if they're empty objects they take space on memory and they all need to be traversed by the renderer. We already talked about this on slack with the lego pieces for example that each one is composed of 47 Object3d.
Is it a must to have all those intermediate nodes?

  Adding to this
If you set position like `camera.setAttribute('position', 'y: 1');` it'll result in `position="NaN 1 0"`
 @staus you could use `camera.setAttribute('position','y',1);` 
  I think that this is fixed:
`<a-entity geometry="primitive: torus" position="1.5 3 0"></a-entity>`
Result:

  Auto-detection would be great in the case of objects. A stop gap might also be to document the valid options. Currently https://aframe.io/docs/primitives/a-model.html tells us that the default is collada but without looking at [the code](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/pull/315/files#r42915419) we don't know that you need to specify `format="obj"`.

Possible duplicate? https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/issues/45
 Along with this, the mtl file is often separate from an object file and there is no component/attribute documented with the model entity/tag on how to specify the mtl.

 I've been looking into loading a `.obj` with a `.mtl`: threejs gives example loaders [OBJMTLLoader.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/loaders/OBJMTLLoader.js) and [MTLLoader.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/loaders/MTLLoader.js). Haven't got it working just yet but I don't think it should be too complicated to have the material component accept a `.mtl` file as its `src` attribute, if that seems like a good approach? Not sure how many formats you want the core library to support, though, or if this makes sense to include by default.
 So far I've tried 

``` html
material="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitgridio/models/gh-pages/lullabot/Body.mtl"
```

and 

``` html
material="src: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitgridio/models/gh-pages/lullabot/Body.mtl"
```

within a-model. Full example:

``` html
<a-model 
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitgridio/models/gh-pages/lullabot/Body.obj" 
  material="src: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitgridio/models/gh-pages/lullabot/Body.mtl" 
  position="0 0 -2" 
  format="obj">
</a-model>
```
 @sirkitree a-model only supports [a few attributes](https://aframe.io/docs/primitives/a-model.html). You may want to look into using a-entity directly (see [a-model implementation](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/elements/templates/a-model.html)). That's enough to specify a color for your `.obj`, for example.

I got a `.mtl` working, but it took changes to aframe-core. [Example here](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-core/commit/06ff9f7dda1e13d370e952cd0bbcbd93f1051236). Not sure if it makes sense to drop both MTLLoader and OBJMTLLoader into aframe-core, so this might need to be a separate primitive or component for `.mtl` support.

EDIT: With that change, you can use a `.mtl` file this way:

``` html
<a-entity position="0 0 -20"
          material="src: url(../../models/tree2.mtl); opacity: 1"
          loader="src: url(../../models/tree2.obj); format: obj">
</a-entity>
```
  For VR use it would be convinient to also support stereoscopic skies or to add a similar a-entity that supports this.
    Hmm any Windows pc or is it some specific combination of Windows/node/npm? I will try to reproduce.
 Hey @dmarcos, I just tested with latest budo (8.0.2) on Windows 10 Home with npm@3 and node@4.2.5. Testing on aframe `dev` branch with `npm run dev`.

The initial boot-up time for budo is ~7 seconds, but after that LiveReload feels pretty instant.

Getting a lot of 404s in the HTTP logs and some issue with `snazzy`, not sure if related.

If you can reproduce on a small test case can you please post an issue to `budo`. Thanks!
  WIP: https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/primitives/a-grid.js

A couple issues left:
1. If custom colors are important, maybe we can generate custom tile images using data URIs?
2. The `mappings` property for primitives sets up a 1:1 pairing of two properties, but here we need for width/depth to map to both actual width/depth and `repeat.x`/`repeat.y`. Maybe mappings accepts an array: `width: ['scale.x', 'material.repeat.x']`?
3. Density maybe isn't necessary for now, but if so we'd need `mappings` with custom functions or something, to get `width / density => repeat.x`.
  Hi @cvan , I tried to add the `controls` attribute to `video` element which is used as the texture for `a-videosphere`, but it seems the video controls are not displayed? my code is as below:

```
<html>
<head>
  <title>My A-Frame Scene</title>
  <script src="node_modules/aframe/dist/aframe.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<a-scene>
  <a-assets>
    <video id="antarctica" autoplay loop="true" controls src="video/MaryOculus.webm"/>
  </a-assets>

  <!-- Using the asset management system. -->
  <a-videosphere src="#antarctica"></a-videosphere>

</a-scene>

</body>
</html>
```

Can you please advice where was wrong?
  I am creating a `vr-light` component that will have `attributeChangedCallback`, and then we can remove `vr-hemispherelight`

``` js
<vr-light type="hemisphere">
```
  I was thinking about documenting this too, but I would have put it in `vr-markup`'s documentation. I run `npm link` because I want to hack on `vr-markup`, not because I want to hack on `vr-component`s.

Besides that, I would also document that the user should run both dev servers for ``vr-components` and `vr-markup`, and they should use the bundle served in memory at `http://localhost:9001/build/vr-components.js` rather than the one on the filesystem so they don't have to re-run build all the time.
 i guess so, I might've been running both just in case. Are you going to keep the link docs in this repo? I feel like it's focused on developing on markup rather than components. r+ otherwise since it's good to know how to link
