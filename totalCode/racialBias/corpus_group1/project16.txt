You should see the application bundle ID in STF's log output. IIRC, it should say something like "Unmapped browser ..."  All of them should work. I would suggest providing as many details as you
can about the devices (& carriers) that are not working.

  Please don’t remove the issue template, we need the details it asks you to provide.

Which device is this?  Great patch. Thanks @obrie! I have a spotty internet connection right now but will try to release a new version soon.  That shouldn't happen. You should be able to just plug in new devices without having to restart. What's the error you're seeing? Please provide as much context as possible.  Please see the answer in #909.  I would try a different adb version. Some Linux distros have broken and/or old adb package for armv7.

Also, sometimes on some phones you have to choose MTP mode for USB, and on some you need to choose Camera mode. Maybe try that too.

Also, RPi just isn't a very reliable platform. Maybe attach a powered USB hub to the pi and see if that makes any difference? Worth a try. Hmmmm but why does it show up in adb as a usb device then?

Anyway it looks like the device hasn’t compl ted the initial handshake because you can’t see the product, model and so on. Not sure what you’re doing though, maybe it’s ok Btw you might want to start adb with:

`ADB_TRACE=1 adb server nodaemon`

(Or perhaps it was `ADB_TRACE=all`)

Maybe you’ll see something there.  When you install STF, it builds a new resource cache. You have to clear the cache first if you change something. Run:

‘./node_modules/.bin/gulp clean’

Then try again.  Check out the [`--ldap-username-field`](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/b8388c75b31239a81834383564756df80a564cdb/lib/cli/auth-ldap/index.js) option. Maybe you need to change the value? Or, if it's just one user, perhaps the field has a weird value for just that user.  How does it change? Please provide the full output from STF. You can run `stf local 2>&1  | tee -a out.log` to capture the entire output.  Sounds good guys. Please update the issue if you find a way :)  I don't think that's a good idea. You can use the STF UI on a tablet, though, if that's what you want. Otherwise, if you want to run the whole STF, you can try but I don't think it'll be worth the effort.  Seems like it's an undocumented option: https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-oauth2/issues/28

The `state: true` value should be added to `option.oauth` which is used here: https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/auth/oauth2/index.js#L23

Easiest way would be to add a new boolean flag, defaulting to true, here: https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/cli/auth-oauth2/index.js

How about you create a patch and send us a PR? :) This should be fixed and enabled by default in master now. Give it a go and see whether it works for you.  You can access the STF UI via the browser on your phone. Other than that, no.  Hmm interesting... I think we should avoid GPL dependencies. Maybe we could drop hipchat support entirely, I’m not sure if anyone’s using it anymore. I think a larger issue may be dependencies of dependencies, I’m sure there’s something unwanted in there. Maybe you could help us by trying to assemble a complete list?

Not sure about your second question right now. Thank you @jonsmirl! We’ll attempt to remove packery ASAP - I’m not 100% up to date on the client side so hopefully it’s not too big of a task. @jonsmirl We wouldn’t ever add GPL based dependencies. 
The version we are using of Packery is the old version which is MIT licensed, they changed to GPLv3 in later versions. 
If you’re uneasy just check their README git history, it’s there.

Of course we welcome PRs that remove that dependency. Personally I may prefer a slightly alternate wording, such as “Contains code contributed by Acme Corp.” This way it doesn’t seem like everything was contributed by Acme Corp, which while originally true, is unlikely to remain so over a long period of time. It may be annoying to new contributors if all changes or even additions (seemingly) automatically get credited to Acme Corp.  See #770 we will merge it when we can  No, you'd have to use something like UIAutomator for that.  In general we don't help with network issues because you know more about your own network than we possibly could. You're having some kind of a connectivity issue. It could be caused by many things such as incorrect configuration (e.g. messing up the connect-push/sub/pull options), incorrect IP addresses or ports, or just firewall issues.  Unfortunately that's not possible right now, screenshots are not stored anywhere. I think there may be a pull request or an issue with a usable patch if you search past issues. Other than that you'd have to create the functionality yourself. Yeah I meant the state of the UI. The list of screenshots is not stored anywhere persistent.  It does not. Look at past issues for more information.  I would recommend using NVM to install node. You’ll avoid all those permission issues. Use NVM. You’ll avoid all that trouble.  You should see two WebSockets when the screen is active. One for the app itself, and one just for the screen data.  The log message is not very good. What it means is that the provider unit was unable to connect to the processor (via triproxy) and receive instructions back. The provider then ignores the devices because it doesn’t know what to do with them. 99% of the time it’s some kind of a connectivity issue.  Doesn’t seem like your connect-sub/push are correct. They should refer to the other server.  I'm not sure whate exactly you mean, does it work for a while and then log you out?

~If it doesn't work at all, then perhaps you're using the wrong `--public-ip` option. Even though the option is called `--public-ip`, you should use whatever ip or hostname you're using to access STF. Perhaps you should specify `--public-ip phone.tecent.com` instead of an IP address.~ see below Actually I think my comment is wrong. I meant you should make sure to use the correct `--app-url`. Use the proper hostname here. You won't be able to access from both the IP address and the hostname at the same time, though.  It won't work. If you run two instances of ADB, one of them will take ownership of all devices, leaving the other one empty.

I'm not convinced you actually need two separate ports, though. I don't see why you couldn't use 5037 for both. Regardless of whether you want to do that, it just won't work - only one of the instances will get access to the USB device. So if you launch two processes, it'll only be visible in one. If you still want to try you can try having these open at the same time:

```
adb server nodaemon -P 5037
adb server nodaemon -P 5038
```

Then e.g. `adb -P 5038 shell echo 1`.  Please provide details like yourNode.js version.  Please ask something more specific. Otherwise it’s difficult to answer within a reasonable amount of time.  It's a font issue. I'm not sure if we have a solution for it yet but check out #740 and #852.  I think in that case perhaps you want to set up some kind of an SSO service, and use OAuth2 instead. Otherwise I don't think there's anything we can do - LDAP itself doesn't provide a feature like that.  Either your installation is broken or you are using an old version.  How many devices do you have connected on that machine?  I don't think it'll work very well but you have the rough idea. You're missing touch down and touch up, though. They're required. You may also need to delay some of the events so that they're not sent all at once.  Well, that doesn't really have anything to do with OpenSTF.

Sometimes it's present in `adb shell getprop`, you can try looking for it in there. You can also try `adb shell ip` or `adb shell ifconfig`, though I'm not sure right now whether those will work.  
Seems you don't have ACL to access 172.17.8.101:2379 or you haven't started etcd service on the server. @ChandrakalaTekriwal You can find the tech details on the website of etcd and K8S.  It verifies the user’s adb key. If you have access to an adb key that has been added to the system, you can get in. Otherwise you cannot, though as always there may be bugs.  logcat works after refreshing your page in web browser? (it will force websocket connection recreated)
Also check how many logcat processed started on your device when you restart logcat on web UI.  Seems minitouch can't work on Orange Pi. Which version of Android ROM did you install on Orange PI? Is there any security option in setup panel of Android 7.0? If yes, you can attempt to enable it.
BTW, I've booked an Orange Pi One Plus online, will update this issue after trying out it:)  `--allow-remote` though it isn't ideal - search past issues for details. It might be very slow.  Yes and no, but in practice no. You can search for past issues to find our previous responses. Search past issues. But like I said don’t expect too much.  Show your code. Look at https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/device/index.js. You’re not supposed to be able to require and use it directly. You have to call .consume() which then actually runs the function and returns a promise that resolves with the result.  Check the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Maybe that Mi Mix 2 fix also fixes your device. Try building master.  See --no-cleanup.  Read the README and search for past issues. If you’re sure you have all the dependencies installed, nuke your node_modules folder once and install again.  Can't help you with that. It's an issue with your environment. Maybe you ran out of memory during the build.  Why are you running that command? Where did you find it? Curious about the reason why you choose Kali Linux? Do you want to do pentest with STF?  IIRC that’s an issue on some, but not all, Windows machines. There should be other issue reports too, try searching for the older ones.  While it's possible to use Apache, we don't support it. Please understand that it's a lot of work to support an open source project, so we have to limit the scope somehow. We recommend nginx. If you want to use something else you're on your own.  Our device database hasn’t been updated for a long time because it’s a lot of work. You can fork the project and create your own device database if needed. Check out stf-device-db. Yes but we might not want to do that. There are entire apps, both free and paid, dedicated to displaying this information (and others like RAM/ROM). I feel like it could be an entire open source project by itself :)

I have nothing against a PR though. But most likely the functionality would live in a separate repo anyway.  Hello GitHub community,

 @sorccu  No update on the issue.Can you please check the issue. You’re the only one with this issue. I would try running on a different machine. If your Docker host OS is Windows (could be, I don’t know) try using Mac or Linux instead.

You ahould also look at the network tab in your browser’s developer tools panel and see if you can find any clues there. There should be two WebSockets connections, check wgat’s going on with the screen websocket (usually last one). It could be timing out or the connection could be dropped by a firewall, for example (wouldn’t be the first time - especially on Windows). @sorccu both the linux boxes are linux machines,
I checked the developer console and i see this message:

``` my unit files are exactly the same as in the documentation with ipaddress changed.Only difference is I am using http and not https.Also thera there are tow providers.
machine A; all stf process,adb and provider1,rethinkdb
machine B; adb and provider2 Try running on a different port. Port 80 might get special handling from your firewall.

 @sorcuu ok will change port in nginx conf.Is there any other place where i need to make the port changes??

Still haven't made the changes as not sure which are the places that i need to update the listening port. @sorccu the docker logs of adb on provider 2 show

Is this a problem??

 @sorccu @thinkhy  changed listen port in nginx.conf 
Error
WebSocket connection to 'ws://masterip/socket.io/?uip=10.20.4.82&EIO=3&transport=websocket' failed: Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

Do i Need to make any other changes?? You have to update some of the units to match the changed port. Sounds like your `--ws-screen-url-pattern` is one of the options that's out of date.

In general, I don't have time to help with configuration issues. You know your network, I don't. @sorccu Thanks for your reply sorcuu.I checked with networking team and they say trafficis not blocked on port 80.But still i wanted to implement your suggestion and change the port.Can you please tell me which unit files need to be changed if the port is changed from 80.
Also would migrating from http to https solve the problem?
Please let me know.

 Switch to HTTPS. @sorccu after upgrading to https devices are filtered out.cannot see any devices.
stf service does not run on the device.

  Your OAuth provider must provide an email address. The user must opt in to share it as well. If they don't, they can't log in.  Maybe this is related to #806? Closed in favor of #806.  You can do it. It is not good from a security point of view but there are almost no checks whatsoever. Just connect and it should work.  Too expensive, I’m not going to buy it. Sounds like it’s a permission issue. Perhaps there’s an “allow auto launch” setting somewhere in there. @thinkhy do you have this device?  After version 3.0.0, we can set screen JPEG quality with the SCREEN_JPEG_QUALITY environment variable at launch time. But sometimes it's not enough for slow networks, even I set SCREEN_JPEG_QUALITY to 20%, the size of picture data can be just reduced to about 1/2 of origin size.

I did a simple experiment to limit rate of sending frame data in `lib/units/device/plugins/screen/stream.js`  as follows:

```js
          function wsFrameNotifier(frame) {
            var currentTime = new Date()
            if (currentTime - lastSentTime < MIN_SENT_INTERVAL) {
              return Promise.resolve()
            }
            else {
              lastSentTime = currentTime
              return send(frame, {
                binary: true
              })
            }
          }
```

The result shows that network bandwidth consumption is decreased remarkably, when I set the maximum frame rate to 10fps, the bandwidth consumption was reduced to 1/4~1/3 comparing with current code without any rate limitation, and the phone operated through web UI rapidly and surely, with smooth scrolling and swiping. Now working along both lines, I can set SCREEN_JPEG_QUALITY to 20% and set frame rate to 10fps, network bandwidth consumption can be improve to 1/3*1/2=1/6.

So, in order to improve transmission efficiency of STF especially for people use STF across remote sites,  I suggest to add a parameter in provider to limit rate of sending screenshot.
 I set 50ms for local network and 100ms for remote network across cities.  You have too many devices connected on one machine. Read the README.  You should use the IP your clients see for that option. Or, do a full deployment and replace the load balancer with whatever you please. We don’t help with network config issues because it takes ages and in the end it’s your network.  You want to make devices on the two servers be usable on STF web UI or use one provider to connect these devices ?  Is this related to STF? Please ask ZeroMQ people then.  Use the --group--timeout option. Default is 15 min.  Did you modify nginx config to update upstream server list? @David-gulu That's great. I've also attempted K8S recently.  The culprit is "apt-get uninstall unmet -y" ... That's not our Dockerfile. You should post the entire Dockerfile here, but in principle we don't support third party setups. No it isn't. You've changed the Node.js package URL and you've got that weird `unmet` in there. Post the exact Dockerfile you're using. You’ve modified it quite a bit, it’s not functional anymore. Take a fresh copy and do nothing except replace the download URL. Take the Dockerfile you claimed you were using. It’s that one. This time, don’t modify it until you have it working. @Fred0218 For the Dockerfile, you only have to replace npm register with a local mirror in China:
```
   RUN npm install -g cnpm --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org
```

Here I use npm register from taobao, it's workable for me.
  Most likely a config error. Sounds like the browser isn’t able to connect to the screen websocket. Open your developer tools console and look for errors. Or, in the developer tools, open the network panel and reload the page, and look for a failing request.  It seems that this is caused by https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable/commit/b81d1c71cd3774419571c360db4312c965a57a13. While the change was made over a year ago, it was only released 7 days ago. Since the new default maximum size is so low, most uploads are failing if you are using the latest version of the dependency. I've made a change that I believe fixes the issue, but I have no time to test it right now. Please checkout branch `issue-826` and report back whether it works for you.  If you're used the reference nginx config, could you try moving the following options directly under the `http` context, and take them out of the `location`?

```
client_max_body_size 1024m;
client_body_buffer_size 128k;
```

The socket disconnecting sounds like a separate issue, perhaps a timeout. Is your client a Windows machine? Is your STF running on port 80? Originally, a long long time ago, we noticed in our internal corporate network that something was causing Windows to drop persistent connections after a while if "default" ports like 80 or 8080 were used. We solved that by switching everything to HTTPS and 443. I was wondering if you may be experiencing a similar issue here.

Also, since you're running on port 7100, I assume you're using `stf local`? Unfortunately, the reverse proxy we use for development, `poorxy` (short for poor proxy), is known to have mysterious issues. Sometimes uploads may fail or other weird things can happen. For a serious production deployment, I would suggest following the deployment guide, or at least replacing poorxy with nginx, which usually fixes all upload related issues. encountered such problem again... reopen and seek for help  It should be an useful feature for UI Automation. We can contribute a PR for this feature.  I have 2 linux boxes at 2 locations:
I have to setup stf in such a way that I should be able to access stf , attached devices from either of the locations.

I have a dockerized setup  using the script from
 https://github.com/thinkhy/deploy-stf-docker
on Server A currently.I am able to see devices in stf web UI conencted to Server A.
Also we may add more servers in future

The Setup plan is as follows:
server A : stf up and running  - docker process running - Location A
rethinkdb is installed on this machine

server  B : Yet to setup - Location B

I have the following questions:

a) On Machine B should I have all the docker processes running (similiar to Machine A)

b) Do i need to setup rethinkdb pn server B ?

c)do i need to setup nginx on server B too ?

d)What nginx configuration would i need to integrate both these setups so that my stf UI will display devices attached to Server A,Server B
Thanks. Thanks for using my script in my project deploy-stf-docker:)

Short answers for your questions:
a) No
b) No
c) Yes
d) You needn't modify nginx config file on slave server, just modify command arguments of stf-provider.

If you still haven't resolve the problem, I can enhance my script to automator deployment across multiple servers.
  Thanks thinkhy,such a useful script.
I dont understand why i would need to deploy another nginx server on Server B.For my current setup I am using the nginx on Server A and have udpated entry for provider2 in nginx config?


I managed to the run the deployment script on 
Server A : location A
Next i created a .sh file from your original file which deploys only adbd and provider

Started provider 2 on Server 2 ,remote location B with 
```
# provider
echo "start docker container: provider-${HOSTNAME}"
docker rm -f provider2
docker run -d --name provider2 --net host openstf/stf stf provider --name "provider-${HOSTNAME}" --connect-sub tcp://${IP_ADDRESS}:7250 --connect-push tcp://${IP_ADDRESS}:7270 --storage-url http://${IP_ADDRESS} --public-ip ${IP_ADDRESS} --min-port=15000 --max-port=25000 --heartbeat-interval 20000 --screen-ws-url-pattern "ws://${IP_ADDRESS}/d/LASVegas/<%= serial %>/<%= publicPort %>/"
check_return_code
```
also configured nginx server on Server A,Location A:

    location ~ "^/d/LosAngeles/([^/]+)/(?<port>[0-9]{5})/$" {
      proxy_pass http://__IP_ADDRESS1__:$port/;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }

    location ~ "^/d/LASVegas/([^/]+)/(?<port>[0-9]{5})/$" {
      proxy_pass http://__IP_ADDRESS2__:$port/;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }

Now I am able to see devices from both location in the stf console.
The problem is that when i access the remote location device,I am able to see device screen in stf console.But When I click on the mobile device apps with the mouse on the screen the actions are done on the actual device in remote location,but the actions  are not seen on the stf console device screen.

Note that when i refresh the page the device screen displays the next page 
What can i do to check the issue.

Is my configuration correct?

``` One more issue:
When I try to access stfconsole from a different machine in the same neworkI am not able to access stf console,I was able to access the console earlier,I dont know what happened.I turned the firewall off on the stf server.
But still cannot access:

Developer console showed:

Update : This seems to be happenning only from my machine.
tried from different machine and works perfectly @thinkhy Can you please help with the issue.trying t solve it from days!!!Out of ideas now!!! @thinkhy Any Update on the Script? @terminalone  These days I have been travelling frequently, haven't gotten around to working on this. I think I will work on the script on June.  
 @thinkhy Please help with the script.
I have a provider and adbd running on slave ,no other stf processes.
master has all other process and adbd,provider 2 too.
Do I need anything ekle on the slave machine????


  # Android P

This is a tracking issue for Android P support.

## Android P Developer Preview 1

### Current status

Not working. Requires:

- [x] openstf/minicap#118
- [x] openstf/STFService.apk#25  Read the linked issues. Update this issue with openstf/STFService.apk#25   Can you install docker on Raspberry Pi?  Short answer is docker can offer much easier deployment and you needn't care about details of OS env. I would recommend the docker image which you can find on our docker hub page. STF and its dependencies have many native dependencies which can be a pain to get working. At the very least take a look at the Dockerfile in this repo’s docker folder for tips. I personally cannot help more than that so if you decide to go the local installation route it’ll be up to you to get it running. Feel free to post instructions for others here if you end up doing it, though. Or you can use the command of "nohup rethinkdb &"  That’s a known issue. It wasn’t really a big deal for us so we never did anything about it. If someome submits a PR perhaps we can take a look at it. Good report by the way. @sorccu @zhouzxiang I think this would be a security vulnerability if we open services of STF to the public. So I will try to fix it. Yeah, but that’s not what we built the system for. Obviously I have nothing against a fix, though.  Sounds like you’re hitting #100.  Hmmm no not really. You’d have to look at the devices list and see that all devices from a provider are offline. Give each provider a unique easy to remember name.

Or you can query rethinkdb but I don’t have time to help with that. You’d query all devices that have present: false. @sorccu I've implemented a page to show all the provider info in a tab view of settings page. I can submit a PR if this is a common requirement. Nice but I’ve had very little time to review recently, and I don’t have a multi provider setup available to me right now. Please submit it but also include screenshots if possible (censor private information with black boxes or whatever). Maybe @vbanthia can then also comment on it.  Seems your nginx config is incorrect so that you got 404(page not found)  It’s what we wanted to use at the time and Rust didn’t exist yet. Simple as that. Now I would use Rust :)  Seems your dev colleagues didn't register their Android public key on your STF. When they connect with your device via "adb connect ip:port", you could find a pop-up permit dialog on your STF web UI and click yes to permit it. Make sure developers don't share ADB keys. Each account should have a unique ADB key.  There's a hidden option called [`forceTouchOrigin`](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/461ec81c9ed3a149bd31906b1fc4546e95fee592/lib/units/device/plugins/touch/index.js#L506) that can be used to select a different origin. You can only set it in [`stf-device-db`](https://github.com/openstf/stf-device-db/blob/6dfcfd24245f3a05549b71a3383a5a7a37ef6c8a/static/devices-static.json#L94) so it's kind of inconvenient. Also, you might need to add another origin as currently only `top left` and `bottom left` are supported, but that should be fairly straightforward.  It says it right below the image... you can even control an Android phone from an iPhone if you like. In that picture STF is being used from an iPhone. That's all.  It does not ask for a password. It asks for your name and email address. You can enter anything you want.  How do you have access to Android P? I don't so I can't do anything about it. @hzy729 Curious about how you get android P's code base on ASOP? I just looked at the project, didn't find any tag or branch related to P. Closing in favor of #822.  It's difficult because unlike, say, HTTP, adb doesn't let the server know which hostname it tried to connect to. To uniquely identify the device, the IP:PORT pair needs to be unique. It also doesn't support IPv6. If you want to use the default port, you'll have to have a unique IPv4 address per device.  There’s a public API since Android 5.0.  Since Android 8.0 official version, 'ps' command is not workable to list process list. We should use 'ps -lef' instead on Android 8.0 and Android 8.1, so I attempt to fix the problem in lib/util/devutil.js. 
 Can you describe how you found out about this issue? Did it break something? Also, possible to see output of the old & new command on those android versions? I first found this issue in my scaffolding code for test automation, I intended to kill the process of uiautomator with the commands ps and kill, but it didn't work on Android 8.x, then I found the same issue on STF.

Next day I will paste the output of the old&new command on devices of Pixel2(Android 8.0), Huawei Mate 10(Android 8.0), XiaoMi Mix2(Android 8.0) and OPPO R11plus(Android 8.1). @sorccu I've tried out both the commands  "ps" and "ps -lef" on 7 devices from Android 7.0 to 8.1, covering 6 leading mobile brands:

According to above data, I think we should adjust the command of 'ps' for Android 8.x.


 Rather than checking the version, I think we should run with -lef first, then if it errors out try ps. Although maybe that could just be a single shell command  w/ some extra handling. @sorccu Thanks for your suggestion. One liner command "ps -lef||ps" can handle the problem. I will push the improved solution to the patch.  I attempted this command on Android 8.0 and 7.0 which both work. After testing the commands "ps" and "ps -lef" on 100+ devices covering 30+ brands, from 4.0 ~ 8.1, I found the output depends on ROM and Android version. I collected some cases below.

So I changed the code to run 'ps' first(for most of devices it will work), then if it doesn't find the target process try 'ps -elf'.

@sorccu please review my code. Thanks.
 I think this patch will function, but I see one potential issue. In (probably) most cases, it's not going to find a process even if `ps` alone works, simply because the process isn't running. Then it unnecessarily runs `ps -lef` which of course fails. Therefore I think the current fallback logic is a bit flawed, since it runs that extra command. It should be able to tell that it saw correct output, but there were no matches, and only run the fallback if there was no output whatsoever.

Also, I think maybe `ps -lef` should be changed to `ps -lef 2>/dev/null`. Maybe `ps` too since some devices like to output weird errors everywhere, and it could mess up things. Yes, but I meant that it should try to detect whether the command ran successfully. I'm ok with running both on Android 8.0, but they both run on older versions as well if there's no match.

So for example, let's say the output is:

```
OnePlus3T:/ $ ps
USER           PID  PPID     VSZ    RSS WCHAN            ADDR S NAME

root             6     2       0      0 diag_sock+          0 S [kworker/u8:0]
root             7     2       0      0 rcu_gp_kt+          0 S [rcu_preempt]
root             8     2       0      0 rcu_gp_kt+          0 S [rcu_sched]
root             9     2       0      0 rcu_gp_kt+          0 S [rcu_bh]
```

And we were looking for `minicap`. Obviously, the output is correct, and the `ps` command has worked. However, we don't find `minicap` because it's not running. With the current logic, it will attempt to run `ps -lef` even though `ps` worked fine, it just didn't find anything. Basically, it should be able to detect three different scenarios:

1. Found matching process(es) → End here
2. Got an empty list, found no processes of any kind whatsoever → Try again with `ps -lef`
3. Got a non-empty list, but did not find any matching process → End here  Please do not use our software.  Run `adb shell getprop` and paste the full output here. I guess it’s because there’s no SIM card support. Nah we can fix that. But not sure when. Maybe try changing the code yourself? Seems the field 'ro.product.brand' is missing  in the output of "adb shell getprop", so the line 113 of devutil.js failed:

```
 if (model.substr(0, brand.length) === brand) {
```

@sorccu For this case, can we add a default brand name 'unkown' as below?

```
 var brand = properties['ro.product.brand']||'unknown'
``` @thinkhy I think `'unknown'` should be at the presentation layer, not in the actual data that we collect. Anyway since we're not actually storing the brand, I don't think it needs to have a fallback value - perhaps just change:

https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/2dac3d1bbd1ef1974a1c22a10941c5739711928e/lib/util/devutil.js#L113

Into:

```
if (brand && model.substr(0, brand.length) === brand) {
```

That should work. Though this particular device might have other issues as well. @vagabond1-1983 maybe now? Try latest master. @sorccu your fix would be better, we don't need to assign a fallback value to brand which will not be presented on web UI. I think this was fixed already. Nevermind, sorry for the spam. Wrong search term.  It has already been updated a long time ago.  Thanks!  That’s normal on older devices. You should keep the developer tools closed or it can leak memory, because it has to store the images for debugging purposes.  Please provide more info about your test code and test environment.   No unless we can come up with a business model. We definitely would not be able to handle the increased number of support requests otherwise.  Doesn’t seem like this adds anything? I’ll close this one but feel free to send functional pull requests later.  If you are using `stf local` default secret key is `kute kittykat`

reliability.

  @zhn3431223  It should be due to incorrect options. Please update the issue if you have resolved the problem. Thanks. Thanks for your sharing.  Close out.  Just wondering if you have connected 300 devices and have them online on STF? Seems you connected too much devices on single machine. I have connected 300+ devices on 6 machines(about 50 devices per machine), it works very well.

Seems the instances of websocket component consume most your system resource. Did you attempt to deploy websockets instances on different machines?  I tested this on a Huawei Mate 10 just now. It does work, however there's a bug. When bluetooth is disabled, and you use the STF UI to enable it, bluetooth gets enabled just fine. However, after a few seconds the STF UI shows that bluetooth is disabled. So, in other words, when you click on the "enable" button, it works and looks fine for a brief moment ("enable" button is blue). But then the "enable" button deactivates and the "disable" button becomes blue. If I go to another tab in STF and then back to the "Automation" tab, it shows correctly again ("enable" is blue). Maybe some sort of a timing issue?

By the way on the Mate 10 there's a dialog that pops up on the device every time you enable Bluetooth. It says "STFService is trying to turn on Bluetooth. Allow?" Might be related and/or causing the timing issue I have merged openstf/STFService.apk#20 now. I believe that the bug I mentioned is related to the changes here. Note that you'll also have to bump the STFService version as follows:

```  Thanks for the detailed description, but I’m going to have to ask you to look at old issues. In general, emulators are not supported, but some people have managed to get them to work. Please see past issues for their reports.  Sorry we can’t provide generic guidance, it’s too time consuming. What I would recommend is that you just read the source code a bit and have a go at implementing it yourself. If you run into a more specific issue, then ask again about that issue.  Thanks. Let’s keep this issue open, perhaps someone will figure it out. Personally I don’t have that device so I’m not able to look into it. If someone wants to donate one perhaps we can move a bit faster. I have Vivo X9 and Vivo X9 plus on my STF cluster, which both work very well.  You may need to enable "click simulation" (模拟点击) on your developer options. You're welcome.  We’ve been thinking of perhaps providing a paid API with full STF integration for automatically retrieving the device name, image and possibly some other details. This way companies would have a way of supporting the project while getting something back. They’d also get a normal invoice which is handy for tax purposes. At the same time, the service would only be of cosmetic value, so no one would be forced to use the service.

Would something like that be of interest to you?  It's not possible for the remote server to interact with your local ADB. Note that `stf local` is for development only, normally you'd have the server running on another computer.

The reason why DELETE is able to kill the connection is that it simply closes the remote TCP connection on the server side, and adb then notices that and removes the connection from the list. It's only able to affect what you see in your local adb because adb has already formed a connection to it earlier, so they're able to communicate (or in this case just end the socket which is a form of communication). If they're not able to communicate then there's no way anything can happen. `adb connect` establishes that communication channel. So, essentially, it's not possible to communicate before the communication channel itself exists.  The screen of mobile on the STF web page is actually image rendered by the Browser,  you can't inspect the element as DOM tree.
I am comfortable with UiAutomator and Appium to do test automation on Android mobile phone. Yes, you can use appium to connect with devices on STF.  Please search the older issues for a solution. This has been posted a lot.  The only configuration we support is in the [deployment guide](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md). You can do something similar with `stf local` on one machine and `stf provider` on other machines, but we won't help with that.  Yeah, I should review more but it's been difficult to find time for that for a long time now.

So, since you've contributed several times in the past, I've just invited you to join the org. You now have push access and can review others as well :)  I'm not sure if this works since I'm not using it, but since you made it and are using it I trust that it does work.  You need to clean this up. No way it’s getting merged like this. Do not submit pull requests that include merge commits from master. You should rebase your branch.

Also, it’s not clear what the PR does.  I bet you didn't install `yasm`. See https://github.com/openstf/stf#requirements. Install yasm, then reinstall STF. One of the native modules failed to build. If there's any error or warning during the build, you should post it here. No, I meant the ‘npm install’ output. No no... the output of the `npm install` command you used to install STF. So perhaps `npm install -g stf`. Include sudo if you used it. There's not enough output. There should be way more. Did you already have STF installed when you ran that?  What version of Firefox do you use?  I use Firefox 57.0 on Mac Pro, the problem can't recreated.  My Firefox is Quantum 57.0(64 bit) 2016.3. Til now I can't recreate your problem. Did you install any third-party plugin in your Firefox? My Firefox is Quantum 57.0(64 bit) 2016.3. Til now I can't recreate your problem. Did you install any third-party plugin in your Firefox? Try accessing the UI with “localhost”, not “127.0.0.1”.

  Run your STF with `DEBUG=adb* stf local` (or whatever command you're using). Then try again and provide the full log output. No, no. Run `DEBUG=adb* stf local --public-ip 10.41.17.66`. That DEBUG part is important. Something's wrong with your set up. Try again on a new machine or a virtual machine and see if anything changes. If it works, you know it's a problem with your original machine. Just any other machine. You just want to know if it works or not.

I'm super busy right now, don't have time to help you with this. While trying another machine may be annoying, it's the easiest way to "reset" your entire software configuration, and therefore the easiest way to know whether your original setup is broken.  Only if someone contributes that feature, or provides very generous funding. Otherwise we have no time to work on that.

Duplicate of #22.  Use the --allow--remote option. Note that ADB over WIFI is much, much slower than a regular USB connection, so don’t be surprised if the performance is poor. Start STF with that option, then run adb connect to add the device to your local adb. STF will then see it.  Looks good but please put the commas in line with the existing ones. Some are a bit too intended right now. Some editors try to mess them up by default. Merged, sorry it took so long. Been very busy lately.  Try running on Linux instead. On Mac various things suck. It's okay for development but we don't support Mac based deployments due to bad experiences in the past. I would still recommend at least attempting to run on Linux. Since the issue takes a very long time to appear, I don't think we're going to have enough resources & time to look into it unless we're 100% sure it's there.

I can say however that this is the first time I've heard of this issue, though there have been cases where devices disappear on Mac if a process dies. It's either a Mac USB stack issue or more likely a bug in adb. Thus my recommendation to avoid Mac.

I've had Linux machines running for months and years and never experienced this issue. All devices, including Samsung devices, have been fine.

How many devices do you have connected to the machine though? On one machine? Try to decrease the number to 8 and see if anything changes.  Probably it doesn't render at full resolution by default. Perhaps it upscales a lower resolution image? Check your settings and change the resolution to see if that makes a difference.

Also, run 'adb shell dumpsys window' and 'adb shell wm size' before changing anything and paste the output here.

To fully resolve this issue I'd need to have one of those devices, but I don't. Feel free to donate one if possible. I don't think I asked you to grep by anything? Anyway wm size confirms that it's running at a lower resolution by default. You can make it work in STF by changing the resolution in settings. Other than that, I can take a look if someone sends me that device.  Your log is too short. I need to see at least 10, preferably 100 lines BEFORE the error. If you install stf from npm, you don't need webpack. It ships with prebuilt assets. Please guys, stop using sudo. I know it's convenient to install Node from your package manager, but it truly sucks and can make so many things not work. Set up [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and try again with that. If at any point you use sudo, you're doing something wrong.

When everything goes as expected, you should see the following line in the STF output:

```
INF/app 13302 [*] Using pre-built resources
```

Just to make sure that things are not broken, I ran `npm install -g stf` followed by `stf local` and everything went well. Great! I would still recommend using nvm though. Please search past issues, this happens quite a lot. Basically you either didn’t install all dependencies and/or you need to nuke node_modules and reinstall.  Your `--connect-sub` and `--connect-push` are completely wrong. Unless you've changed the ports, which isn't visible in your commands, they should be `--connect-sub tcp://IP_OF_MASTER_HERE:7114 --connect-push tcp://IP_OF_MASTER_HERE:7116`.  They are only stored for 10 minutes. Don’t expect to find them later. If you want to save one, right click the image and save.  1. stf local is for development only, so it doesn’t need to expose all options
2. you can still use an environment variable to set it if you need to.  > Request URL:wss://stf.example.com/socket.io/?uip=10.1.90.25&EIO=3&transport=websocket

Two things:
- Instead of using `stf.example.com`, you need to write your own domain.
- Also, if you are not using SSL, you need to use `ws://YOUR_DOMAIN` instead of `wss` Make sure that the address you’re using to access STF matches the websocket
URL. For example, if the ws url is wss://10.1.2.3, you should use
https://10.1.2.3 to access the app. Otherwise cookies don’t get passed and
things don’t work.

  You are misunderstanding between Bearer Token authentication & oauth authentication here.

Bearer Token authentication is only for accessing REST API. And you can only create these token from STF UI. For browser authentication you will have to use one of the auth which STF provide such as `oauth`, `ldap`, `saml2` etc.

If you think setting up oauth is too much work and you want some minimal security, you can use `basic-auth` instead.  Refer this: https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/254  Perhaps there were errors when you ran `npm install`? If `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` doesn't work, usually you're either missing a dependency (read the README) or you're missing a complete build environment (like perhaps python 2.7 or a c++ compiler). Ah... actually, it's more likely because you're using `sudo`. Sometimes, some modules refuse to build if you're root.

I would recommend installing and setting up node via `NVM`, which avoids the usual permission issues. You should **never** have to use `sudo` when running `node` or `npm`. Installing node from a package manager is the worst thing you can do, pretty much. If you're sure you want to do that anyway, you're on your own. However, perhaps https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions might help.  It’s not a magician. Your installation is broken. Do what I said.  You probably don’t have rethinkdb running. Read the README. Sounds like you’re doing something wrong. Try rebooting if you can’t figure out what’s causing that.  I'm too busy right now but ping me again in a few days. Ok I've now had time to briefly look at the PR. I think there are some issues that need to be resolved.

* minor: The code you've added doesn't respect our ESLint rules. For example, we don't use semicolons.
* minor: The `ldapGroupMembership` option has been added under the `options.ldap.bind`, but it isn't used for binding. It's only used for searching which is under a different section. I think the option should be renamed to `--ldap-search-group-membership` or `--ldap-search-allowed-groups` and in the JS object it should just be `groupMembership` or `allowedGroups`.
* major: I feel that the group check is done in the wrong spot. It should be part of ldaputil's `login()` function. All the LDAP options get passed to it so it shouldn't be difficult.
* major: Overall I'm not sure if checking the group post-search is a good idea. I feel like it should be part of the `query` in `login()`'s `tryFind()`. Though at the same time, we already have the `search.filter` option added earlier. Perhaps the whole membership check could already be done with that without changing any code? If not, please let me know why it doesn't work.  Hardware issue, can’t do anything about it. Read the README for recommendations. Avoid very long cables. You should also describe your hardware. Preferably exact model numbers. Not all powered hubs are equal, in fact very few are any good. It's a waste of my time to speculate too much, however if you see a device toggle between "device" and "offline" state, it's 99% guaranteed to be a hardware issue. Can't help.

It might become more stable once it's charged, but it might not. Sounds like your hub is unable to provide enough power to it. Read the README.  There is no password by default. Carefully look at the UI. It only asks for your name and email address. Anyone can get in.  Fork STF and replace the stf-device-db module with your own. It's too much work for us to keep it up to date. Fork the module and change the version to a github url or publish under a different name.  Get a better wifi router, that shouldn’t be an issue at all. Make sure you don’t put the phones in a rack or some other metallic enclosure though, the signal gets pretty bad there. Choose a good channel manually, too.

Also, you can run STF on multiple machines and have them in separate locations if necessary. If your are thinking about that scale, this might help you. 

https://code.facebook.com/posts/300815046928882/the-mobile-device-lab-at-the-prineville-data-center/ I’m sure you already know but we can’t help you design that. You should hire an expert at that scale, certainly sounds like you could afford it at least :) Keep it mind that we are merely unpaid contributors to an open source project. We can therefore only afford to spend a very limited time per issue, which isn’t enough to research a massive task like this.

I can only say that STF itself should function fine at that scale, though obviously you’ll need to run it on quite a few machines, and hardware choices are critically important.

I would be interested in hearing on your progress, though. We had 99% of the phones on LTE, because that was important to us. I’m sure you can get it working with WIFI, but you’ll have to be very careful when positioning the routers and devices. If you have the space, try splitting the devices into multiple locations.  ‘docker logs’ or alternatively journalctl may be more useful if you’re on a systemd machine.  Hmmmm interesting. It would indeed be the 2nd version with the duplicate LDAP in it. I agree that it looks weird but I guess that’s just the way it’ll be for now.  It's in the README, minitouch. Then check out the minitouch README after that.  It never worked reliably, and it hasn't been updated for newer Android versions. Don't use it. It's because it's not possible to add accounts without system permissions, so we tried to do it by emulating UI actions. 

Removing accounts works though.  Looks like a web font issue. You have a font issue of some kind. `Provisional headers are shown` just means that its using cached content. Try to check the `Disable cache` checkbox.

@HeartIsBeat can you check with latest [Canary version of Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) and also [Firefox](http://firefox.com)?
It looks like it may be a Chrome bug (see [here](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=602968)).  Don't ping people unless you have something valuable to add.

Furthermore, I can see from the doctor output that their STF is old. The output is different now. Updating might fix it. Otherwise, I guarantee that this is a setup issue of some kind.  I don't want to depend on imagemagick. I'm not convinced that this is the real reason. It's more likely a timing issue (e.g. reading a stream too late), and using imagemagick just happens to change the timing.

Most likely not merging unless some kind of proof is provided. Perhaps your gm is missing jpeg support for some reason? Are you able to use ‘gm convert’ on the command line? Good to know for reference, but I think it may just be an issue on your computer. On my mac and in our Alpine Linux based docker images, gm from the package manager contains JPEG support by default.

How did you originally install gm? Yes but I meant how did you install GraphicsMagick? With `apt-get`? I see, that would probably be the cause then. Package managers include some basic functionality by default.

I'll close this issue now, doesn't seem like there's a need for this change.  That is exactly how STF was meant to run. Read the deployment docs. They may be a bit complex but that's all the help we provide right now. Actually not exactly. STF does not connect to multiple adb servers. You can run pieces (units) of STF on many machines, and bundle them together into a single UI, which is what the deployment docs are for.  I made a somewhat more generic fix for this in a1866b0409a9abef755b0c78e48a74f493374700. Thanks!  Interesting. I don’t think we want to hardcode column names but perhaps this should be fixed by maybe introducing a new column type. I’m just happy that someone is actually using the search function :)

May I ask you how many devices you have connected to the system? Sounds like you may have quite a few.  If you're using `stf local`, use the `--provider` option to set the name. It's supposed to be a descriptive value that tells you where the provider is located, but you can choose whatever. Start stf again with the option you want, then refresh your browser. I’m not 100% sure but it should show up.  This is a problem that I can't fix without having the device here with me. If possible, please consider asking your company to donate one of those devices (a used one is fine) or donate funds to purchase one. Somewhat ironically, I hate working on devices remotely while debugging STF. The point of STF is to allow interaction that's as real as possible. I can't really tell what "real" is if I've never even seen the device myself. That combined with painfully slow SSH is usually super annoying and easily takes 3x as long as just having the device on hand would.

Based on the screenshot though, I guess that the Android API STFService uses to retrieve the display size was modified by Xiaomi to not include the software buttons. This could be verified by trying to run minicap with manually modified parameters and seeing if the buttons are actually there. I'm thinking they probably are, but are just cropped out. Interesting but I would prefer not calling `wm size` if possible, because there's no guarantee that the output format will be the same on all devices (including ancient ones), and it would be a huge pain to collect enough data to verify whether that's the case or not. It's also not entirely clear whether the value is affected by rotation or not. I'm hoping that there might be another Java method that returns real values... Btw there's a small bug in the `getResolution` you posted, it uses both `Promise.defer()` and `new Promise()`. The cleanup is tied on the deferred promise but it never gets resolved. Alternatively, https://github.com/openstf/minicap/issues/93 might be one way. More crash prone in theory, though. Related to #464, the LG V10 has an issue with both `wm size` and `minicap -i`. They both return  1440x2720, which includes the "second screen" at the top of the main screen. Using the full size with minicap results in a black area at the bottom of the screen image and even worse touch coordinates. The public Java API returns 1440x2560, which displays the correct screen area (though the touch coordinate issue is obviously still there). Well I can’t try it out. @thinkhy? @sorccu Can you please merge the code change(AndroidManifest.xml) for full-screen devices into STFService.apk?   Thanks Sorry I can’t yet - it will be at least another week till I have free time again. Tough times. OK, take your time. Please ping me if we need to test the new feature on Chinese brands devices. I've made the change. Can you try master now? I've tried the master of STFService.apk, which works very well. Thanks.  If you're getting an error, you should post the error. Perhaps you're seeing the help output but it may also be showing errors or warnings somewhere in there.  Thanks, I would have merged this but rather than pulling in a new dependency, `Date`'s `.toJSON()` (or `.toISOString()`) should do fine. The only downside is that it's in UTC, but as someone who deals with machines all over the world, I think it's more of an upside.  Sigh, the builder has died again... I think it was just out of disk space. It's building now, let's see if it works. Should be working again. It might just take a super long time. RPi is not very powerful. The full build can take several hours. Yes that may work, docker makes it fairly easy nowadays. We use a Scaleway C1 which is only 2.99EUR per month. Build still takes an hour or more but it does at least finish. An ODROID XU4 is also able to finish the build, and relatively quickly too. Check out https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/docker/armv7l/stf-armv7l-baseimage%40.service. As you can see it sets an environment variable and also passes some options to the script. Well if it works for you I'm not going to complain :) File size is an issue but could perhaps be solved by flattening the image.

Mind sharing your Dockerfile and the steps you took? Might be useful for other people as well. I think the easiest way right now would be to just copypaste it here. Put it between three backticks and it should get syntax highlighting, too.

    ```Dockerfile
    FROM alpine
    ```

Results in:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine
``` Thanks!  Based on the log output there’s a decent chance it could be a hardware issue (e.g. unsuitable hub that’s unable to provide enough power to all the devices), since adb reports that the device goes offline. You could also try capturing logcat output and see if there are any hints there. They work fine because the device only goes offline for a brief moment. It does kill all existing connections and shows up in the adb tracker as well. The “offline” state is reported directly by adb.

The thing about power issues is that things can sometimes work fine, but then something weird happens and you can’t explain it. It would be helpful to know what hardware you’re using. Unfortunately there are no timestamps in the log output so perhaps we’re talking about separate issues. Which part is the one that it shows when the issue happens? I see that one device goes offline, but then it comes back up and STF sets it up again. But I guess you didn’t mean that?

My best guess right now is that this could perhaps be related to zmq tcp timeout. Search past issues for details, there are a few environment variables you might want to try out. Does #100 look similar? Great! Closing the issue for now, then.  Did you perhaps start rethinkdb in a different folder than originally? Closing as there's no feedback. I will say however that this should not happen, but if it does, it's probably something RethinkDB-related. For example, it's possible for the database to get corrupt, though in that case RethinkDB would usually refuse to start at all.  What if you drag slower? I'm thinking this is probably caused by the touch coordinates jumping around too much. The issue is that on the browser side, it's not possible to retrieve mouse coordinates with subpixel accuracy. Since the tablet is much larger than the screen view in STF, it's possible that a single pixel on the browser side corresponds to 5-10 pixels on the device side. Then when you consider that mouse events aren't always perfectly continuous (e.g. for a 100 pixel movement you may only receive, say, 10 events instead of 100 events), it's quite possible that the resulting gesture simply isn't smooth enough. The system may then choose to ignore it as an accidental or incomplete gesture.

This could potentially be solved by interpolating fake touch events between each mouse coordinate pair, though it may also be necessary to introduce some input lag to smooth out the path of movement.

It's too much work for me to dig into right now, but it would be great if someone could give it a go.  It works fine. You’re supposed to do HTTPS via nginx. STF itself doesn’t and should not know anything about that. The deployment guide gives you some pointers.  See the other issues about this.  This is because the user could have left something unwanted open that doesn’t let the screen sleep, which is extremely bad for long term battery life. It's currently being done [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/445cfcf0bc025346bcfefae663fcd987285ade85/lib/units/device/plugins/group.js#L106) if that helps. Sure, please submit the PR! Note that we may or may not need changes but please go ahead. I would like to have automation testcase running on device connected with API, so the device is in "automation" status and would not be timedout.  You’re using an old version of STF. I guarantee you're either using an old version or a modified version. The paths in your log screenshot show `stf/vendor/minicap`. That path has not existed for 11 months. You should be seeing `stf/node_modules/minicap-prebuilt` instead.  Thank you! I changed the date to September as I'm not lucky enough to live in the future yet :)  I’ve made something like that in the past but I can’t publish it. It’s not too difficult though, try implementing it yourself. Thanks for the update. I think the lag you’re talking about is caused by network buffers. STF pushes frames as quickly as it can, which works well in local network conditions. When the client is far away, we push too much, and it results in delayed response to interaction. While not impossible to improve, it would take quite a bit of work andit’s not really the scenario STF was created for. Patches are welcome, though.  Impossible to say, depends on your hardware. Read the README. Read the README...  Could you explain your Use Case in more detail. May be there are better solutions.  Currently no, stf-provider would not work well with that. It is possible
but the configuration is annoying and I have no time to help with that.

If you must have the 2 interfaces on that machine, I would actually
recommend a 3 machine setup. One machine should be a load balancer, with a
setup that forwards each interface to the other machines, which would both
have a separate STF setup.

Unless you meant that you simply want the same STF to be accessible from 2
IPs. Then it's easy (with nginx config), though you can only show 1 IP in
the STF UI.

  No idea. There are so many LDAP servers that if you're the only one having
a problem, it's pretty much your problem. Try to figure out what the error
means, and if it turns out we need to change something, update this issue
again with the details you've found.

 See https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/3b632b4314ccc28739a06a2a5de451e75fef63ca/lib/util/ldaputil.js and http://ldapjs.org/. `STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_SEARCH_FIELD` is the field name to search against for the given username. If a match is found, it will return an object with multiple properties. `STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_USERNAME_FIELD` is used to select one of those properties to display in the STF UI, and to use as a unique identifier for the user. Have you tried running the search queries manually with a command line tool to see if they’re working?  This has been asked in the past, search for past answers.

  Thanks for the good report. I'm not sure when I'll have time to look into
this, could be a really long time. It would be nice if you could try to

 Good work! By coincidence, I happened to think about this issue this morning and figured that might indeed be the reason. I think it uses degrees because there were originally 4 selections available, and it was an easy way to map the icons. Should be a fairly easy fix.

Would you like to contribute the patch as well? :)  Don't compile it by hand, try to figure out why the require is not working
instead.

 Good!  It means that the worker process crashed, or the device was disconnected (which also causes the worker process to die). When the worker process comes back, it gets a new set of ports. Currently you can't really change that. You should try to figure out why your device is disconnecting. Yeah that doesn't sound good.  1. Not really, there kind of is but it doesn't work like that, the user
must be logged in already.
2. Yes if you are willing to write your own rendering code. You can look at
the STF source as an example. We will not help with that, however.
3. Yes and no, it's functional but the client side is unfinished. The steps
you must take to make it work are fairly advanced, I'd rather you didn't
try unless you're very confident in your skills.

  Sounds like your Node.js may be too old. You should have ran `stf doctor` and posted the results here. Uninstall STF and reinstall. Some of the native modules are stuck at the older version you were using before. Just follow the README. You're missing dependencies again. Please stop wasting my time.  Nothing in your logs points to this being an STF issue.  Not sure. I don't think that's a very interesting feature honestly. What's
your use case?

 @hram
One better workaround which I can think about for your use case is to run `input keyevent 82` in the shell present in the right side of device Dashboard view. This should work on most of the device but can't guarantee as different maker might make some change in their device.
 
@thinkhy  
> I resolved the problem by writing a Java program using UIAutomator to swipe the screen from bottom to top and from left to right

Instead of going through UIAutomator way, simply pressing `menu` button using `adb shell input keyevent 82` should unlock the screen if it is not password locked.  Actually it should be `input keyevent 26` to lock the device. https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html#KEYCODE_POWER

`input keyevent 82` will unlock the device.
 I guess we could add a new CLI option to make automatic unlocking optional but enabled by default. Should be fairly easy to do, though I don't have time for that right now.  It does. Please check Linux again, perhaps it'll work there. Alternatively, perhaps you are running into https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/603 or similar? Look for a similar setting and report back with your findings.

Also, you need to stop removing the issue template. We need those details. For example, you should've told us which device you're using.  I don't think that works. From what I know only Latin languages and some languages with a Latin-based IME (e.g. Japanese) work quite well.

It's not ideal, but you can tap on the software keys on the device itself.  As mentioned in the [README](https://github.com/openstf/stf#running)
> If you want to access STF from other machines, you can add the --public-ip option for quick testing.

set it up correctly you can access the system from a public address.

Guess we'll just hardcode the number then. Can you try the latest master and see if it works now? Ok. I think master should work for you, then. Thanks for figuring it out!  I don't know what you guys are doing with your Galaxies. My S8 (not S8+) is completely fine and has none of the issues you mention. It's a $1000 phone. There's no way I'll buy one just to test it out. All I
can say is that A) it should work, and B) it works for me.

If you're willing to donate your phone I can of course look into it.

 So, the stf repository is still supposed to use v2 (v3 won't work), and adbkit-apkreader should be using v3. I'm not sure why but it sounds like you only have one version installed. What does your `node_modules/adbkit-apkreader/node_modules/bluebird/package.json` look like? It would be great if we could upgrade, however we rely too much on cancellation and progression which are both deprecated. So I'm not sure what exactly happened here but I've just done a full reinstall of my modules and can confirm that `node_modules/adbkit-apkreader/node_modules/bluebird/package.json` was there, and the version was 3.5.0. `node_modules/bluebird/package.json` was 2.11.0. Everything should be fine.  STF grts that information from ADB. So ADB thinks that you have an emulator there - perhaps you really do? Can't really do anything about that right now, though there's a pull request that allows you to exclude devices.  I think there have been several issues like this in the past, you might want to take a look at open and closed issues. I'm not sure but it may have had something to do with Firefox. Might wanna try in Chrome.  Sounds like a misconfiguration issue. You should post the command you run
stf with.

 That command works fine for me.  You could attempt to analyze the logs I guess. You could use a third party
log collector service and run your queries there. Other than that, nope not
really, and it's unlikely to happen in the future, too.

 For now, this behavior won't change, though we may accept a PR.  I would recommend using an USB cable instead as you may get horrible performance otherwise, but you can do that by starting STF with the `--allow-remote` option and then issuing a standard `adb connect` command after that. STF will then pick up the device.

Please close the ticket if this resolves your issue.  Seems that you have the GNU `libtool` installed on OS X. You should probably use the `libtool` that comes with Xcode instead. It should be located in `/usr/bin/libtool` which should forward it to `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/libtool` or similar.  Please do not mention me directly. Someone rlse might answer.

The limit depends entirely on your hardware. It can be as low as 8 unless
you get the PCIE card.

  Delete `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies with `npm install`  That hub you posted is useless, since it only supports BC 1.2 on the
flip-up ports. Note that there is a USB 3 version of our recommended hub if
you really want that, but in the past I've found the USB 2 version to be
more stable. It's less complex, more mature, and 95% of devices don't do
USB 3 anyway, so there's no point in getting the more expensive USB 3 hub.

  Not supported yet. There is already an issue about Android O. Do not make duplicates.  Your question is too broad. You need to ask something more specific.

There is no single source. Some are provided by the APK whereas some just
taken off of 'adb shell getprop'.

 I can't help you with that. If you can't figure out how to retrieve that
property, you'll probably also need help in figuring out how to store it in
the database and how to display it in the UI, which would be way too time
consuming.

I would recommend trying to change existing version field first. Just
replace it with that property. Once you gain some confidence with that,
perhaps you'll be able to find a way to add the rest of the properties, too.

  They might not have the same domain. Additionally, there may be cases where
you do not have an HTTP request to take the values from.

Either way this is very unlikely to change unless someone provides a pull

 That hub is no good. It comes with a power adapter that's able to provide
12V*2A=24W. Even if the hub supported battery charging spec 1.1 or 1.2, a
device may use up to 5V*1.5A=7.5W, though usually 1A would be closer. As
you can see it's impossible for the hub to provide enough power. In the
manual, it even says: For best performance, the connected devices should
not exceed a combined current of 8A for UH720 (5A for UH700).


It's also highly unlikely that the hub actually supports BC, so even in
that sense it's just no good. Even ignoring the total output issue, it may
be unable to provide enough power for even a single power hungry device.


It's not about the price... it's about specs. You should return the hub or
throw it away.

 That's the thing with USB hardware issues - sometimes things work for a while but aren't stable long term. I'm not sure where you're located but you should have other options than buying from the US, see http://plugable.com/products/usb2-hub7bc/. Also, it doesn't have to be that exact hub, but it needs to have similar specs.

Do note that you could also have issues with your other components. Right now the hub is the only component that's obviously bad but who knows? Having the latest and greatest isn't necessarily a guarantee of anything either - older Intel processors used to have enough resources to support 50+ phones connected simultaneously, but now you're limited to 8-12 without a PCIE card. It's a huge pain honestly as soon as you try to connect more devices than an average consumer would.

Your motherboard could also have a USB chipset that has quirks in Linux. That's why it would be best to get the PCIE card to minimize the variables. And again, note that there are differences between PCIE cards, you have to choose one with the right specs. Yes, BIOS settings can help sometimes. However, the settings themselves
depend heavily on the motherboard and they can be labelled in various ways,
or more commonly not be present at all. We will therefore under no
circumstance provide BIOS advice as that would be a complete nightmare.

However, if you have the skills to look into the settings by yourself, then
it can sometimes work out. Glad you found a way.

Do keep in mind that the stability could only be temporary, though.

 Yes, thank you :)  Try using the `--lock-rotation` option. Otherwise some devices rely on sensor data and either don't rotate or revert back quickly.

Please close the issue if this solves your problem. What is the exact command you use to start stf

 It should work. It has always worked on samsung devices, too.

Start from the assumption that it works. Then, try changing your
environment in various ways (e.g. use a different browser) and see if
anything changes.

  You really need to provide the full output STF shows you. Otherwise there's nothing we can do. Use three backticks to format a block of code.

That looks like a relatively obvious error - is the disk full? Ok, run STF with `DEBUG=adb* stf local` and you should see the `pm install` command it runs. Copy that command and try running it manually. Paste the full output here. Also, run `adb shell ls -l /data/local/tmp/` and paste the full output here. You should look for a setting on the phone to allow the service to auto
start.

 Are you really really sure there's no auto start setting somewhere?  Great detective work! I've personally never used nodeenv, and have never had issues with nvm, so an easier alternative may be to use nvm instead.

It could also be related to how you launch STF, for example `./node_modules/stf/bin/stf` may not work, whereas `bin/stf` in the STF module folder may work. That's a complete guess, though. I guess it breaks [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/461ec81c9ed3a149bd31906b1fc4546e95fee592/lib/units/app/index.js#L30). Does `/usr/local/share/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/stf/node_modules/stf-wiki` exist? If not, how about `/usr/local/share/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/stf-wiki`? Specifically the error is thrown [here](https://github.com/lyphtec/markdown-serve/blob/v0.3.2/lib/server.js#L241). Perhaps someone on an affected system can modify that file and do a `console.log('rootDirectory is: ', rootDirectory)` before the check?  Looks like dockerhub build trigger is not working. Will trigger manually for now.  You can find both `latest` & `v3.0.0` image on docker hub.
https://hub.docker.com/r/openstf/stf/builds/

Somehow, automatic build trigger was off and because of that images were not building. It should be fine now. 

Thanks for reporting.  Difficult to say. However, we don't recommend installing node via homebrew
or the official installer due to permission issues with global modules. Use
nvm instead.

 Sounds like you have the same issue as some other devices. It's a setting.
Look for the issue about adding Xiaomi devices to STF. Use that and the
linked issues as a guide for finding the auto-start setting. Then update us
when you know.

  Can't really help you with this because it's an installation issue. However, I've just released v3.0.0 on NPM, so perhaps installing that would work better.  Your STF is too old. The latest version hasn't been published to NPM yet, so you should build from master for now.  Seems OK I guess. Firewall blocking local connections maybe? Anyway we
don't really provide support at this level, as it's unlikely to be an issue
with STF itself. Hopefully you can figure out what's wrong.

 That's weird, but good to hear you were able to solve the issue.  Sounds like you've misconfigured it, you should have used the `--public-ip` option to let STF know which IP you'd like to use. Good!  99% chance you already have another copy of STF running.

 Hmm, interesting that they use the same port. That's not possible, I have no time to give detailed guidance to anyone. I

 Either set up and use your own domain name or use an IP address.  I'm not 100% sure what you're asking but I think you believe that you're
supposed to replace those values. It's a pattern (or template), you're
supposed to leave it like that. The values are variables that are passed to
the template.

You could try posting the exact config and units you're using here. Perhaps

 As mentioned earlier this is a common issue on Macs when you have a large (usually 8+) number of devices connected. Either get more Macs or switch to Linux and the PCIe card we recommend. Closing.  I would recommend building from master instead of using the NPM version. Perhaps v3.0.0 that was just published to NPM will clear this issue.  Fixed in https://github.com/openstf/stf/commit/707482fa3b17a966b6727dba7ea5de9fba1ac40c  Do you mean that applications you installed get deleted?

 Use the --no-cleanup option if you don't want that.

  Ok as a disclaimer I don't think that's a very good idea, and we definitely provide support that, but it is possible with some effort.

If you run `stf provider --help`, you should be able to see that if you give it a list of serial numbers, it'll ignore all other devices. So, in theory, you could have both `stf provider 0123456` and `stf provider 7890123` running at the same time. Make sure to give them non-conflicting port ranges, though.

Note that I've never actually tried that myself, but in theory it should work. Yes you would need to know the serials and then spawn a provider for each (or however you want to split them).  No, please never use sudo. Instead, use `nvm` to install node so that you never have to bother with that again.  Your node is incredibly ancient. We haven't supported that version for years. Glad you were able to get it working, though I'd advice against using `sudo` anyway.  Read frames slower from the socket. That's the only way right now. Other
than that, you have to modify the code.

 While this feature may or may not be implemented at some point, the question presented in this issue has been answered. Closing.  While I agree that "your configuration is wrong" is vague, we simply don't have time to help with general configuration issues unless you provide all the necessary details by yourself. It takes a lot of time if we have to ask for those one by one.

For example, when you created this issue, you decided to remove the issue template. So now I would have to spend a few minutes asking you to provide those details instead of being able to help you directly. In this case, it would have been particularly useful if you had provided the exact commands you used, and the full output of those commands. Otherwise you're sort of expecting me or someone else to simply keep trying various random combinations, which is a huge waste of time.

Please try to proactively provide as much detail as possible. It increases the chances of someone willing to look into your issue.  Merged. Good improvements. Thanks!  Btw would you like to join our Slack at https://openstf.slack.com? We could certainly use some help if you'd be interested in joining the team as a contributor. Great! Can you email me at simo @ the name of this github org .io?  The stf image does not include adb. There's a separate docker image for
that. Check out the deployment guide.

  Use swagger-client v2.x.x

https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/601#issuecomment-305354613 Also, if you want to try v3.x.x then you will have to implement script by yourself with new syntax (API). Script provided in STF API doc is written using old syntax.  So does the unit output anything? Check `journalctl -u stf-log-rethinkdb`.

Note that I would recommend a third party logging service that watches journal logs instead. The rethinkdb logger can miss messages if it dies briefly, or obviously if the socket dies. That looks like a bug (it says undefined). I'll check it a bit later.

Seems to work fine with latest master, at least.  Hi,
Can we connect virtual devices created in virtualbox,vmware with openstf? Some have managed to do it, but I've never done it. Either way it's not a supported use case. Try searching for older issues about this same thing. Hi,
Here i am sharing the details to connect AVD(Android virtual devices) with openStf. I will just tell what i did because i have no idea what is the cause of that black screen issue or any other problem.

**Hardware details of the pc:**
Processor: Intel® Core™ i3-4130 CPU @ 3.40GHz × 4 
Graphics: Intel® Haswell 
 OS type: 64 bit

**Operating System:**
 OS: Ubuntu  16.04LTS

**Android Studio AVD details:**

Just make any AVD  x86(kitkat 4.4,marshmallow 6.0) works fine  but not of ABI "armeabi-v7a" and  let the settings be as by default.
Please don't change anything especially in the OpenGl or any hardware settings. But you can give the RAM and storage size as much as you need.

Note:  If you already a STF user then you don't need to read further.

**Source for installation of STF :** 

https://miteshshah.github.io/sysadmin/how-to-setup-smartphone-test-farm-stf/

or you can directly run this command from terminal(Press ctrl+alt+T to open terminal on ubuntu): 

**$ curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/MiteshShah/62cd0923b9068a927dae/raw/STF | sudo bash**

But i will recommend you to visit the link first.

**Starting stf on localhost:**

1. Open terminal and run the following command:
                                   $ sudo rethinkdb

2. Open another terminal and the run this command:
                                 $ sudo stf local
    but if you want to access stf on another computers connecting on same network then you can just run this command:
                              $ sudo stf local --public-ip 192.168.x.x

Here 192.168.x.x is the ip address of your computer connecting on that network, its different for every computer, you can get this ip address from:
            System settings> Network>Wireless or wired(see in left side) > name_of_network>then click on arrow on right side if the name> there in details you will see IPv4 address>Just copy/paste it next to --public-ip .
There are other ways too of getting this IPv4 address.
Now just run the above command as per your need.

**Using STF:**
Open any browser and type : 127.0.0.1:7100 for sudo stf local
                                                192.168.x.x:7100 for sudo stf local --public-ip 192.168.x.x

**Starting AVD:**

 Open Android studio>Click on AVD manager icon(Just below Window)>Start the AVD from Actions(that green play button).

**Back to browser**
Now open the browser and see in the **Devices** , there you must see something like "x86 .... " device, now open the device and its done.


Note:
If by any means your installation gets failed and during re-installation you get some "**protobuf**" error then you have to manually delete the protobuf folder and the location of protobuf in my case was: 
             computer>opt>protobuf
and then begin the installation again.  That doesn't look right. Perhaps it's your modifications that are causing the issue, as the `node-buc` package doesn't exist (or at least it isn't public).  No idea what you're asking. Ok. For Android 7.0, don't install STF from npm. Build latest master. It works fine. Did you use the :latest tag?

 It sounds like perhaps your issue is not with Android 7.0, but rather you
don't know how to connect a device.

Perhaps you're running STF in a virtual machine and need to add the device
there? Not enough details. What you should do is tell us what exactly you
did. You have to tell what your setup is like. You have to tell which
commands you used.

 Perhaps some day, but we're super busy with other things now.  It works fine. Use the master branch, though.

 They're now in separate packages, minicap-prebuilt and minitouch-prebuilt,
which are dependencies in package.json.

 Yes, that works sometimes but occasionally it doesn't (we've seen some packages fail to build in the past). Either way I would recommend `nvm`.  Duplicate of  #49 and #602.  Right now you cannot. No. You would have to figure it out yourself.  https://github.com/openstf/stf/commit/cc5d7580c23dce1fd4526974370fc3a5c76c866d should fix this issue. 

Thanks  Duplicate of #508.  Does anything else work? Like `adb shell` for example?

Usually that problem occurs when you are connecting from an older or newer ADB client to an ADB server that's a different version. However, if your ADB server is running locally, that shouldn't really happen.

I think you'll need to give more details. For example:

* Where is the adb server running?
* Does the adb server run inside a docker container?
* Where is `adb install -r` running?
* How did you install ADB?
* How did you connect the device to your ADB? Closing since no new information has been presented, and this doesn't seem to be an issue with STF anyway.  Use the master branch.

  At the very least, you should have posted the exact error from the error log, or preferably the full log. You have also removed the issue template where we ask you to provide these details so that we don't have to ask you every time, which wastes our time.

In general, we don't support `stf local` deployments, it takes too much time. It's a development version. Please consider doing a [full deployment](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md) instead. This is the ONLY deployment we support, and ONLY if you've followed it 100%.

Note that `stf local` can work with the correct options (assuming the other containers have correct options too), however we won't help you with that.

Also, you're using boot2docker which is 100% more trouble. Not recommended.  Pretty sure it's unable to connect to your other server. After devices are found, a request is made to the other server which then needs to reply. If there's no response, it might look like that. It can be that the address is wrong, or that there's a firewall on the other machine. Unfortunately I have no time to help you with that, so please try to figure it out and post your solution once you find it.  That depends entirely on how you installed it. Therefore it's your
responsibility to know how to remove it.

 You can read the script and do the opposite of what it does. You can also
ask the person who provided that script, however they'll likely say the
same thing.

I would recommend using docker containers for an easily removable, isolated
installation.

 If you need more infomation, tell me .Thanks very much Some older devices are like that. It happens when minicap asks the system
to scale down the image.

You can try modifying the source code to always force full size. That might
help.

Other than that I can't do anything, unless someone wants to donate that
device to me.

 Ok, I will try to modifying the source code. Hi,I try to modifying the source code. However, I falied. Here is where I changed. The device is 480*854.

Anthing I missed? Thanks

 I think what's happening is that the lock screen (with time visible) is
rendered with smaller resolution than usual, perhaps to reduce resource
usage and battery drain. When you start using the device, it switches back
to the real resolution and displays properly. Not sure, though. I don't
think there's anything we can do about it, though perhaps you could try
something crappy like disabling the lock screen entirely?

 OK.Thanks, I give up the device. Our team use STF to manage android devices.We also found minicap installed in other HUAWEI device sometimes result in restart of device. Just tell you the HUAWEI device is special.
Thanks very much. Let's keep the issue open, maybe someone will have an idea one day. But for now it's not possible. Regarding the other Huawei devices; I only have a Mate S and it works fine. Huawei's Honor brand should also work fine. I don't know about others. Consider donating some of the devices to us if you can. Sorry to see your final replay now, @sorccu. The HUAWEI G616 is owned by the company where I worked. I can't donate it . However , I will find the G616 in  some website which sell old devices. If  I find it , I  will donate it to you.  It's the output of the pwd command.

 @thinkhy Thanks a lot! @thinkhy Need help with deploying stf on two servers?can you add the functionality to deploy to multiple machines @thinkhy Any Update on the script for deploying on 2 servers.Thanks in advance.  STF works fine in airplane mode. Are you perhaps using `adb tcpip`? Closing this as no evidence or examples have been provided.  No not right now. Plus even if you could, users could still access the
device list by changing the URL?

  Oops, looks like I forgot again. Will merge later tonight.  Good answer by @mirceanis! Closing.  I would have to review it but don’t have much time. Consider merging it to your own fork and seeing if it works. Then report back. It's shown at the top of the pull request. Then it might not be finished yet.  I think the reason why I initially added the comm option was that I assumed it would be faster, since there was (presumably) less work to do. Any chance you could run a few benchmarks to verify that? Just run `time adb shell 'ps >/dev/null'` and `time adb shell 'ps SOME_COMM_HERE >/dev/null'` a few times and let me know if there's any difference. Obviously you'll need to run it on a device that supports the comm option. If there's no difference at all then we can merge this immediately. We probably have to merge either way, but it would be good to know if there's any difference. Thanks, that's very extensive. Merged. May I ask what you're working on if you have so many devices?  You're right. How did you find this though? Even though it's obviously a
bug, I don't think it should have caused any issues.

 Hmm... that's unfortunate. Unfortunately Google doesn't sell the Pixel here so I've never been able to try one myself. I do know that Pixel devices are working in STF, though.

As can be seen in minicap logs, minicap is not receiving requests. It may be a firewall issue created by the carrier in order to control Tethering. Could not verify this since `iptables` access is not given to `shell` user.  

I also tried `adb reverse` and this is working fine. I can access web app running on Mac OS from android browser using adb reverse port forwarding.

 So it's a MetroPCS phone. I strongly believe that this has the same issue as Alcatel Onetouch Pixi Glitz from Tracfone. The symptoms were the same. I managed to root the device and pull the adb binary from it at the time, and confirmed that it had been modified to not accept any socket connections using `localabstract`, `tcp`, `jdwp` or `track-jdwp`. Notably `localfilesystem` was not present, although mount permissions may have prevented those from working anyway - I did not check. MetroPCS phones are heavily customized. I’m not sure if it’s worth the effort. You could help us out, though, either by donating a device or investigating the issue and reporting your findings here.  It's because you have multiple providers trying to set up the same device like I told you earlier.  Latest release or github master?

 Ok. So when you create issues, there's an issue template that contains the
information we want. For example, it could be an issue with your device. Or
you could have an error in the log output. The template covers those
issues. Please fill in the whole template if you need assistance.

 This is an old issue and there is a PR for this https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/186

@gunta 
I think, we should just merge the above PR. Fixed in https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/186  Not right now.

 It's a completely different thing. Not related.

  If the connection goes through, you should see that in the logs. It's not
there, so either you should post a longer log, or you're connecting
somewhere else.

The error doesn't have anything to do with remote debugging. Maybe you just
have a device that doesn't work in STF right now. Try a different device.
Make sure that you're able to both see and control the device.

 I just read your original description again, and you have two `stf provider` providers running. `stf local` includes `stf provider`. You can not have the same device in two providers or this happens. One provider is trying to set up a device that's already being controlled by another provider, causing the first provider to fail. Then the other provider tries again, and the second provider fails. This continues in a loop until you hit the failure limit.

Basically you're doing it wrong. Maybe you wanted to use `adb tcpip`?

Can't help you with this any more, it's a usage issue.  It does, like the README says. Now please close this issue.

  Impossible to tell, you've given almost no details. It could be a timeout, though. Try setting a longer `--group-timeout`. Oh. The web UI isn't really meant to be used for several hours, I don't think that works well. No idea though, I've never tried doing that. I would use the `adb connect` command instead, and then run monkey over that. You should also increase `--group-timeout` to be longer than 10 hours. Thanks for following up with a solution! I'm not sure if it would have helped, but there's also `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE` and `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE` that you could have tried. See https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/461ec81c9ed3a149bd31906b1fc4546e95fee592/lib/util/zmqutil.js  Please ask the plugin author. I would try using UTF-8 as your character set, though.  Thanks!  I suppose that could be done.

  To add Xiaomi devices to STF, there are extra steps that must be taken.

1. To enable __Developer options__, to go __Settings__ → __About phone__ and tap on __MIUI version__ until it says developer mode has been turned on.
2. Go to __Settings__ → __Mi Account__ and create or log in to a Mi account. This is __required__ for the next step.
3. Go to __Settings__ → __Additional settings__ → __Developer options__. Turn __USB debugging__ (for ADB access), __Install via USB__ (needed for installing STFService.apk) and __USB debugging (Security settings)__ (needed for running minitouch) on. You __must__ have a MI account set up to enable  _USB debugging (Security settings)_, otherwise it won't let you.
    - Note: there are reports that some versions of MIUI **may require a SIM card** or these settings can't be turned on.
4. Connect the device to your computer. Allow the ADB key and select "Always allow."
5. Run STF. A dialog will pop up on the device confirming installation of `STFService`. You must allow the installation to go through. _Note that you may need to do this again in the future if the service is updated._
6. If STF fails to start after installing `STFService.apk`, go to __Settings__ → __Permissions__  → __Autostart__ and enable `STFService`.
7. The device should now work in STF.

__Common errors:__

If you see an error that says:

```
Setup had an error Error: /data/local/tmp/STFService.apk could not be installed [INSTALL_CANCELED_BY_USER]
```

It means that you haven't enabled the __Install via USB__ option.

**Steps tested on:**

_Redmi 4A_
- MIUI 8.2.6.0
- MIUI 8.5.1.0 Hmmmm that's weird, I don't have a SIM card in mine. Which device and MIUI version is it? Strange... does it actually tell you that you need a SIM card? Possible. I've added your findings to the guide. What kind of an update are you looking for? If the manufacturer forces you to set up a SIM card there’s nothing we can do about that.  It does that because it spawns multiple child processes. At the moment there is no easy way to do what you want.  @kwv 

Thanks for the PR. Made some comments, please have a look.

I will still suggest to use swagger-client@2.x.x instead of 3.xx since they are making lots of breaking changes in their own implementation not just because of OpenAPI specs. Also, I do not think we will be supporting OpenAPI v3 anytime soon since v2 is working totally fine as for now and we don't have any plan to extend OpenSTF API anytime soon. 
 LGTM, thanks!  Publishers and subscribers only push/sub to certain channels. There's a unique channel for each device, each group (set of devices controlled by a user at once) and all devices. When you tap, the message is sent to a specific device's channel. Other device workers never see the message. Device subscribes to its own channel here, https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/device/plugins/solo.js#L28

Just look for `sub.subscribe` under device directory, you will know all the channels which device is subscribing.  Ok, I know. Thanks One more question.You start two 'triproxys' through the command

```
INF/util:procutil 40934 [*] Forking "/Users/sheranjun/Code/stf/lib/cli.js triproxy app001 --bind-pub tcp://127.0.0.1:7111 --bind-dealer tcp://127.0.0.1:7112 --bind-pull tcp://127.0.0.1:7113"
INF/util:procutil 40934 [*] Forking "/Users/sheranjun/Code/stf/lib/cli.js triproxy dev001 --bind-pub tcp://127.0.0.1:7114 --bind-dealer tcp://127.0.0.1:7115 --bind-pull tcp://127.0.0.1:7116"
```

When I tap device A on the STF website, the flow is as follow:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5986074/26661140/8774d1f4-46ae-11e7-8c0c-9ac38829a338.png)

Here is my question. Why STF start 'app001' and 'dev 001' two 'triproxys' ? . If just start one 'triproxy', what's wrong with it? 


 App side triproxy takes messages from the web UI and passes them to the devices (through processors and the device side triproxy). The device side triproxy takes messages from the devices and passes them to the app side (via processors and app side triproxy). Ok.Thanks very much.  Well I'd say that's beyond our use case. We can't support everything. However, https://github.com/openstf/minitouch/pull/15 might work once merged. I don't think there's anything I can do about that right now, too busy. However, please post your feedback on that minicap issue where it is more appropriate.  Well, since there's this: `minitouch says: "binding socket: Address already in use"`, I'd say you may have more than one copy of STF running at the same time.

Also, please don't remove the issue template. You should have said which device you're having this issue with, but didn't because you removed the template. We need that information or we can't/won't do anything. Logs look OK to me. Closing since this issue is fairly old.  That's not an error, it's there purely for information purposes. I've now removed the message because everyone thinks it's an error for some reason.

Unfortunately that stack trace is not very useful. Please describe what exactly you are doing when that error happens. Nice. Have you tried upgrading the package in your own installation yet?

 I meant that the deployment is explicitly designed so that you can even
have 1 device per machine if you like.

The deployment guide tells you what you need and where.

  Choose a different channel. The default channel is for the current device only. I don't remember where exactly it is, but you should send the command to the user's group channel if you want it to go to all devices you're currently using.  Thank you, that is an extremely good bug report. I think @vbanthia would be best equipped to handle this if he has time. *Copying comment from [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/601#issuecomment-305354613), so that other users don't get confused.*

If you are not comfortable with NodeJS, you can also try shell script example, https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/API.md#using-shell  Looks good, thanks!  Thanks! Note that instead of saying you updated something, it's usually better to say why you updated it. For example, you could have written that `.demand()` is deprecated in the newest version.  Sorry about that, forgot to merge. It's done now.  Maybe you already have STF running.  Are you perhaps using the --allow-remote option and then adding a device to
STF with `adb connect`?

 Sounds like you have the same device twice in the system. Once over USB and
once over WIFI.

  You're using sudo. That tells me that you used sudo to install STF. Do not
do that. Use NVM or similar to install node do that you can run everything
as your own (or other) user. Otherwise modules will fail to build. There's
also an --allow-root flag (or sometjing like that, check help output) in
npm, but it doesn't always work 100%.

  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

**What is the issue or idea you have?**

When connected to STF, Alcatel GO FLIP is in a permanent prepare loop. This seems to be caused by a modified ROM disabling app_process and therefore most internal commands not working.

It's unclear whether there's anything we can do about this issue, possibly not.

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**

> product:gflip2 model:Alcatel_GO_FLIP device:gflip2

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**

Connect an Alcatel GO FLIP to STF.

**What is the expected behavior?**

Device shows up normally in STF.

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

The cause is:

```
adb shell pm list packages
/system/bin/pm[6]: app_process: not found
```

Obviously the ROM has been modified, probably heavily stripped down for the low-spec device. Therefore you can't even launch most executables on that device.

**Please run `stf doctor` and paste the output here.**

Not relevant. Thanks, that's good info. Looks like you're right, the props do mention KaiOS.

  Would need to see your code but perhaps the listener isn't started or set
up properly?

  What you're asking is exactly how STF was meant to work. See our [deployment guide](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md).

Your second question is more complex and several people have asked about it already. You can search past issues if you want to read why it's unlikely to happen for now.  Could be either a stream error in the poor proxy causing lost data (has happened before), or you have an exotic APK. If possible, mail the .apk to me (simo @ name of this github org .io) and I'll take a look when I have time. Or if you can post it here publicly, perhaps others can take a look as well. Closing since there's no feedback.  There are multiple issues about this topic already. Use the --allow-remote option. However, ADB over WIFI is extremely, extremely slow. You'll get really bad performance out of it and there's nothing we can do about it.  No I'm sorry that would be too much work for me to explain everything, the
question is too broad. Please read the ZeroMQ documentation. Other than
that, we may be able to provide paid training if necessary. Or, if you have
a very specific question then it might be possible to answer that.

  Did you install ZeroMQ? Ok run `npm install zmq` in a random folder (like `/tmp`) and paste the output here. I told you. Do not use root.

 Do not use sudo, do not use root. Do not use anything that makes you uid 0.

 It looks ok I guess, as long as that folder has permissions set up properly
(you're still in /root so that is suspicious but it could be alright). I
would recommend deleting your whole node installation and starting from
zero now that you actually have the dependency you needed. It's not worth
the time to attempt to fix a broken install. If you're having trouble with
dependencies, use the docker image instead.

This is caused by the [ASUS Auto-start Manager](https://www.asus.com/support/faq/1011266). Follow the instructions in that link to enable STFService. Everything should then work OK.

  The installation process uses prebuilds resources. You need to clean first.
Run 'gulp clean' or './node_modules/.bin/gulp clean' if you don't have it
installed.

Also there's no auto reload, only auto build. You meed to refresh manually
after changing things.

  You need the git repository if you're changing things. Could be that you're modifying an installation you installed from NPM, which would not work as it doesn't include all resources.  Perhaps some day. None of us develops on Windows so it has the lowest
possible priority.

  Seems like you did not do `npm install` after pulling the latest changes. Well, that's not STF. Can't help you with that. No I don't think so, I'd rather fix actual issues or build new features. If you're having trouble with dependencies, consider using Linux and the docker image we provide. Other than that you have to have your environment in proper working condition, honestly it's not our responsibility to help you with that.

As a last tip I would recommend doing `rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules/stf` and reinstalling. That doesn't look right at all.  Not really, although you could connect to the app websocket that the ui
uses for everything else. You'd have to mimic the ui though. If you want to
try that, check chrome's network inspector, select the websocket, and check
the messages that are sent.

I feel like it's probably too mich hassle. Using minitouch directly would
be easier I think.

  It says you don't have the zeromq libs installed. Read the README, you need the required dependencies before installing. Sure. You can start by giving all the details about your system. Please do not remove the issue template like you've done in this case, you need to fill in the details. Try using your package manager to install it instead. Installing from source usually integrates poorly with the rest of the system. Once it's installed, reinstall stf from scratch and see if that works. If it does, you can try going back to the source install method if you like (but we won't help with that).  Sounds like a configuration issue. I'm guessing the HTTP 301 is for redirecting to HTTPS. This is pretty old so I'm closing this as it's probably no longer relevant. However, I'll just mention once more for anyone who may find this issue on Google that in 99% of all cases of screenshots not working, it has been caused either by a missing dependency, misconfigured environment (e.g. wrong `PATH`) or incorrectly configured STF.  Yes, this issue has been happening lately. I believe there may be a bug in the current version of ADB. Sometimes it adds a null byte in there, but it can also be something else like 0x03. Unfortunately, right now it means that you have to remove the invalid characters from your public key. Also, it can be more than one byte. I've seen two in one case. Possible buffer length issue in ADB's base64 encoding I suppose. However, it can also be after the space. Looking at the [code](https://github.com/android/platform_system_core/blob/9ef4417c8ea24cfe561103902a8eb9fa455d1677/adb/adb_auth_host.cpp#L93), it seems like [EVP_EncodedLength](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-boringssl-docs/base64.h.html#EVP_EncodedLength) and [EVP_EncodeBlock](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-boringssl-docs/base64.h.html#EVP_EncodeBlock) include a final null byte in the output, which was not the case before (or it was accounted for). This change seems to have been caused by the switch to BoringSSL (compared to mincrypt earlier). I don't think it's working as intended, but it's the way it is right now. Will have to adjust the validation to account for it. Does not explain the issue with multiple unexpected bytes, though. I'm thinking that EVP_EncodedLength may actually not be returning an exact number, but rather a safe upper bound. That would explain the remaining issues. For now, this specific issue has been solved by https://github.com/openstf/adbkit/commit/715ec81639b000655635b8c5fbd92baa237ca929. STF's adbkit has been updated.

However, there may be even more malformed keys out there, with multiple unexpected values. Let me know if there are any real keys that don't go through. Are you 100% sure your adbkit is really up to date? Yep. With the latest STF we now ignore the null byte.

 Make your own stf-device-db and replace the built-in one :) Might have to
fork stf to change package.json though.

For models that are in the "database", it does show the name. Unfortunately
it has not been updated for quite a while and never contained all possible
devices anyway.

 If you don't have any devices with a known model, you can try running 'stf
generate-fake-device' to load some random data into the device list to see
how it looks.

  I don't get it. The error you're seeing simply means that there's something already listening on a port, meaning that you either have two stf instances running or some other program is running there. What exactly is the issue if not that?  No. Read https://github.com/openstf/STFService.apk/issues/12.  This is a tracking issue for Android O and will be kept open until the final version is released.

## Android O Developer Preview 3:

Not working. Same status as Developer Preview 2.

## Android O Developer Preview 2:

Not working. This is more trouble than usual, [STFService.apk](https://github.com/openstf/STFService.apk) may need a somewhat large refactor. There are also symbol issues with [minicap](https://github.com/openstf/minicap), the code running on Nexus 5X doesn't match the released android-o-preview-2 AOSP branch.

## Android O Developer Preview 1:

The master branch works as of 43f0341297fea60de8f4dc30e922d9c343b359a1. Either use the openstf/stf:latest docker image or install from source. Thanks, I'll try to check during the weekend!

 Well, I was able to compile it with some minor changes. However, the error remains the same:

> CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE "/data/local/tmp/minicap-devel/minicap": cannot locate symbol "_ZN7android11BufferQueue17createBufferQueueEPNS_2spINS_22IGraphicBufferProducerEEEPNS1_INS_22IGraphicBufferConsumerEEERKNS1_INS_19IGraphicBufferAllocEEE" referenced by "/data/local/tmp/minicap-devel/minicap.so"...
Aborted

Unfortunately this means that the device does not run the exact `android-o-preview-1` branch that was published. I'm using the bullhead-opp1.170223.012-factory-338a95b1 build for my Nexus 5X. It seems like the symbol on the device is:

> `_ZN7android11BufferQueue17createBufferQueueEPNS_2spINS_22IGraphicBufferProducerEEEPNS1_INS_22IGraphicBufferConsumerEEERKNS1_INS_19IGraphicBufferAllocEEEb`

Which translates to:

> `android::BufferQueue::createBufferQueue(android::sp<android::IGraphicBufferProducer>*, android::sp<android::IGraphicBufferConsumer>*, android::sp<android::IGraphicBufferAlloc> const&, bool)`

Whereas in android-o-preview-1, it's:

> `_ZN7android11BufferQueue17createBufferQueueEPNS_2spINS_22IGraphicBufferProducerEEEPNS1_INS_22IGraphicBufferConsumerEEERKNS1_INS_19IGraphicBufferAllocEEE`

> `android::BufferQueue::createBufferQueue(android::sp<android::IGraphicBufferProducer>*, android::sp<android::IGraphicBufferConsumer>*, android::sp<android::IGraphicBufferAlloc> const&)`

So there's a new boolean flag. Wonder what it is. It's definitely not there in the AOSP source. Not in master branch either. I was able to get use an ugly trick to access the symbol. However, it seems that SurfaceComposerClient's memory layout is different from AOSP and that's causing a segfault. I have it working now :) The master branch now supports Android O. As of Developer Preview 2 everything's broken. Minicap needs a recompile but they haven't released the actual source code they use, the symbols are incorrect. STFService is having weird issues where connections and listeners keep dying. Thanks, I'll clone it and see how things go. Hmm, nope. Their released source code doesn't match what's actually on the devices (Nexus 5X in my case). Seems like a class may have changed and the vtable is different. Specifically, one of these causes a segfault:

```
mBufferConsumer->setDefaultBufferSize(targetWidth, targetHeight);
mBufferConsumer->setDefaultBufferFormat(android::PIXEL_FORMAT_RGBA_8888);
```

``` It seems that `IWindowManager.watchRotation()` (which STFService uses) no longer works, the watcher never gets called. I'm a bit husy now but I'll check when I can.

 No changes since Preview 2, Preview 3 is still broken. Guess we have to start looking into adding workarounds. It will be at least several days before I can look into this, but @thinkhy your findings are correct. In the past I did manage to update minicap for newer developer previews, however that required removing a few lines that are relatively important, so I stopped. Minicap now works as of the latest release, but STFService is still an issue. Figured out a way to hack STFService a bit to make it happy. Latest master and 3.1.0 now support Android 8.0.  Maybe there's a setting like in https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/407#issuecomment-247852532? Interesting. Thanks for the detailed information! Also, note that since the maker has been extremely lazy and hasn't even set the USB serial number (as is evident from the value `0123456789ABCDEF`), you can only have one of these devices connected in STF since it's used as a unique key. Yeah you can't really change the serial number. If you have the skills, you could try writing a proxy that sits between stf and adb. That proxy would pretend to be adb and somehow map each device to a unique ID, possibly by making queries on the side and using the IMEI number, WIFI mac address, or just a persistent text file for the ID. That's the only way to do it right now without modifying STF.

Modifying STF is tricky since none of that information is known at the time the device is plugged in. Initially only the USB serial number is known. STF provides information in real time so it has to deal with the information it's able to access.  If there's a bug you've found please submit a PR. All I can say is that it
has (nearly) always worked for me.

  They are in STFService.apk, but depending on what you want to do you can just use the built-in `input` command. Well our version doesn't really support unicode either. I think Appium has something you can use. I can't help you with this any further but please update the issue with your solution if you find one.  There's an option to decrease the JPG quality in master. Other than that I personally will definitely not spend time on playing with color depths and whatever. I would perhaps accept a PR that does that, though.

STF was made for local networks where there's plenty of bandwidth available. Check --help.  You're right, the files are backwards. However, since they have the right content, everything still works as long as the units are launched via the main `bin/stf` executable.  Please send the .apk to me. My address is simo at openstf dot io. Ok, fixed. For some reason the manifest was slightly malformed. A field that was supposed to contain a size and is usually `8` was `0` even though the content was still there. Weird. The parser now uses a hardcoded size if that happens.  I can't find any of them for sale on Aliexpress or Ebay. Therefore it is unlikely that we'll ever be able to do anything about them. Physical access is needed. Thank you for your kind words. I would be happy to accept the devices if you'd like to send them. I cannot guarantee that I'll be able to make them work, but I will at least try. Please send me an email to simo at openstf dot io and we'll discuss details.  It can't connect because the container's network is isolated from everything else by default. There are many many ways to link things together, but if you have no idea, try following https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md to have an idea of what flags you might need. An easy way to try it out is to add `--net host` an an option to `docker run`.

Note that we do not support running `stf local` w/ docker. It's for development use only and may or may not work, we never deploy with it.  Remove the prebuilt resources and your changes will take effect. If you
have gulp installed, run `gulp clean`. If not, you can run
`./node_modules/.bin/gulp clean` to do the same with the bundled gulp.

 I'm closing this as a duplicate of #22.  Closing as this is pretty old. @Hao8816 's answer is good, or alternatively you may want to `rm -rf node_modules` once.  This issue is related to this [PR](https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/474). Previously, `--save-dir` option for storage service was not working. This PR allows to use `--save-dir` options to store all screenshot in persistent storage. 

You must be using [this](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md#stf-storage-tempservice) stf-storage unit file. This is using `--save-dir` as `/data` directory. `stf` user in docker container does not have root access so I am guessing that writing on `/data` directory is forbidden. One simple workaround is to delete `--save-dir /data` from your `stf-storage` unit file. or better solution will be to use a directory where `stf` user has write access. Great, please close issues when solved :)  We don't speak Chinese. I'm not sure what your issue is even after trying to use Google Translate. Please offer more details in English. I think this has been fixed for quite a while now.  If your developers are willing to do an ssh port forward before running adb
connect, that may also be an option. Or, you can set up a TCP reverse proxy
somewhere that maps connections to the right device port, and then modify
the connect url pattern. If you map the ports 1:1, modifying the pattern
may be all you need. Otherwise you may need to write some code to look up
the right device.

The issue with adb connect is that it doesn't tell the server which device
it wanted to connect to. Therefore you can only differentiate devices by
the destination port/IP. That's why everything but adb connect goes through
nginx, and that's also why it requires you to open more ports. But by using
one of tge two methods above, and perhaps writing some code of your own to
do the ip/port mapping, it's possible to have every client connect to a
single machine.

In general we do not provide detailed help with network configuration and
connectivity, it's too time consuming and really annoying to do without
understanding the way your network is set up. So, in principle, that part
is left to you.

 I'm not sure why you've decided to include the ip address in the URL at
all. Our docs definitely don't say anything about needing to do that. I'd
just give it some sort of a name (e.g. buildingname-5f-001). The only
reason why you'd include the ip is if you wanted to capture it and use in
in proxy_pass... but that would allow anyone to specify any ip and expose
your network. That's a bit of an issue with the dynamic port range as well,
but you can change the regex if needed, at least.

  You have provided no details. There is no way to help you.  Those ports will require root permission. Use `sudo` while running `stf local`×command.  The docker image does not run as root for security reasons. Only root can
bind on low ports. You can use docker's port mapping if you want.

Note that you're running stf local inside the docker image. While it may
work, it is not a supported deployment method. By doing the full deployment
(linked in README) you also set up nginx instead of poorxy (poor proxy).
You can bind nginx to any port you want.

 Well you can override the user it runs as I guess... at your own risk though. Try adding `--user root` or `--user 0` to your docker command.  We don't do anything like that. However, to accept input from the device, there's a hidden password field that gets focused when you click on the screen. It's a password field because that had the least cross-browser and non-Latin issues. What I think is happening is that your browser is simply autofilling the password field. This then is translated to key events. (the password field is only for accepting key events, and isn't actually a password) Guys, there's a reason why we originally chose a password field. It was and perhaps still is one of the only ways to get latin characters when someone is using an IME, e.g. with Japanese. Furthermore, at the time autocomplete off actually did what it's supposed to do.

Now, does anyone have an alternate, tested, complete solution that works in all reasonably recent browsers right now? It sounds to me like `new-password` isn't well supported yet. A PR would be greatly appreciated.  Your node is too old. Only 6.9 or newer is supported now. This makes our
life easier.

  This has been moved to openstf/adbkit#62.  This drops compatibility with node 4.x due to using .endsWith(), but we're
going to do that anyway soon.

 Screw it, I'll just merge it like this but please feel free to submit improvements later.  Currently no, but if you need to access the device (perhaps to get
something out of it), you can use an OTG adapter and an actual mouse. Or
perhaps the 'input' command from adb.

 FWIW I think it's unusual that Linux can't see the device. Thinking a
cable/ribbon might have become loose. Worth thinking about if you can take
it apart.

 This doesn't seem to be relevant anymore, so I'm closing the issue.  Two things,
1. Either rethinkdb is not running or your machine is not able to connect with rethinkdb. Check it first.
2. You are using wrong command.  Instead of `stf local 10.1.X.X 10.1.X.X` you need to run `stf local --public-ip <IP_ADDRESS_OF_CURRENT_MACHINE>`. After this, from another machine(should be in same network) access `http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_MACHINE_WHERE_STF_IS_RUNNING:7100` Yes. Check [this](https://github.com/openstf/stf-appium-example)  Duplicate of #509 but that's a good call let me take a look. Let's continue in #509.  Hmm... you're using a public domain name in the provider zmq sockets. Are
you positive that they're actually accessible on the IP it maps to? Please
also try disabling the firewall (e.g. iptables) temporarily on that machine.

The output is weird, it shouldn't show the same serial multiple times.

 The domain doesn't return any results on `dig` or `nslookup`. The situation could certainly be different from your network but I suspect that it's simply not able to connect to that address. ZeroMQ does not by default tell you if that's the case, it just keeps waiting for something to appear from somewhere.  I know this issue is fairly old, but we can look into this if someone sends us the device. Otherwise we  can probably never confirm or fix the issue.  Could be a firewall issue. Could be a misconfiguration. Could be anything. Open developer tools and see what the WebSocket request is returning. If it shows that it's unable to connect, then I'd suggest temporarily disabling your firewall to see if that helps. Just check your browser's developer tools. It should tell you why it's
unable to connect.

 Closing as this is very old. 99% chance that the issue was caused by a misconfiguration.  That's weird, possibly a bug in node. More likely though your node
installation is broken. Either way I would suggest using latest 6.x for now.

 Your installation is still screwed up. Fully remove stf and install it
again. If there are any errors during installation, fix those.

  No, emulators overall are not supported right now (you'll most likely see
just a black screen).

  Have you tried a different device? Could be a simple case of incompatibility. Keepalive time is in second not in millisecond. You can check this issue to know which services will require zmqtcpkeepalive setting. 

https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/342 I updated those old comments that had the weird value of 30000. You had to read the issue all the way till the end to see that the values were actually supposed to be in seconds. Also, not sure if 300 seconds is even a good value or not. I just told you, I have no idea. Depends on your network.

I think timeout unit depends on host OS. For MacOS it is ms & for linux it is seconds. I tested it with MacOS first that is why it was in ms before but later all the issues were on linux system that is why in seconds later.

Also, 300 seconds is working fine with all the past issues, so I think it is okay.  It's not necessarily a leak. Could just be that whatever you're doing is causing too many events listeners to be added. You get that warning if you have more than 10 listeners added.  @gunta do you have time to update?  The documents could be out of date, they were originally made for pre-2.0 and were perhaps last checked in the early 2.x days. Please check the RethinkDB documentation and post your solution here if you find one. Or make a pull request to update the information.  Seems that OP solved this issue :) Good work!  It says what the error is. Do not use root or sudo with npm.

 Sorry but you're opening too many basic issues like this. We provide the
software and it works. It's your responsibility to have your environment
set up properly. I don't think we can provide any more advice to you, it's
starting to take way too much time.

  This is a super comon issue. Basically your hardware sucks and you can do
nothing about it without getting better hardware. Read the README, our
advice in there is not a joke.

 While that can also be an issue, this one sounds like the Intel problem
listed in the README.

 No, it says the device is offline. It's your responsibility to make adb
work first before adding anything to stf.

 See the deployment guide. But if your device is offline, it's not stf's
problem. Make sure things like 'adb shell' work before doing anything.

 Yes, that works on some machines.  Most likely you did something wrong and now you have a strange installation. The newest master no longer uses commander (which might explain why it's missing) but you're using old code. Can't help with that, it's your mess.

I would simply reinstall and try again.  Unfortunately even though we originally used LDAP we haven't used it for
years now. If you need that feature please consider implementing it
yourself and making a pull request, as we are otherwise unlikely to do
anything about it.

  It means that something is already running on that port. Probably you
already started rethinkdb and forgot about it.

We don't provide rethinkdb support, if you have an issue starting rethinkdb
ask the rethinkdb people (although this particular request is so basic you
shouldn't need to ask anyone at all).

  Closing as this issue is very old. You can add `adb tcpip` devices with the `--allow-remote` option, but they perform very poorly. Not recommended.  Run `stf migrate` once before `stf local`. This may solve your problem. I had this error recently as well. My rethinkdb was starting extremely slowly since upgrading to Sierra, and that may have been the reason why the migration somehow didn't run. It may be related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/6047. I found a way to fix the slowness in there which also fixed the migration issue (although it could've been a coincidence).  Cause found by @perfectspr in #509. Now fixed in master.  We will need to look into this but I'm not sure when we'll have time.

Usually, given the distortion shown in the first comment, it means that the device is unable to scale the virtual display we create. Forcing 100% size fixes this, and explains why screenshots still work (they work because screenshots are taken at 100% size). Unfortunately, it is not easy to force only certain devices to 100% right now, and it would waste bandwidth and resources anyway.

Another type of distortion is when the screen has numerous visible artifacts, but is otherwise fine. That sometimes happens on other devices as well, but the cause is not known. My thinking is that we may not be consuming the frames from the virtual display quickly enough, but it's uncertain whether that's the case.

If anyone has any ideas or time to look into this, that would be much appreciated. I have an Amazon Fire  device, will look into this problem next day. Btw it used to work okay. I think the issue is probably that frames are not consumed quickly enough. Even though we lock the frame parts of the memory get reused. Unconfirmed though. The problem can't be reproduced on my Amazon Fire phone(Android 4.4.4). Can you paste your output of Display info in log? I think you need a newer version. Anyway the issue mostly occurs when the screen is moving. Like when you’re swiping left or right (iirc).  We don't know Chinese, please update the translations at Transifex if you
feel they need improvement. Then let us know in this ticket and we'll pull
the new translations.

  Are you using STF 2.1.0 or newer? Ok can you do a logcat dump and attach it to this issue? I think the options are `adb logcat -B -d >out.log`. Yeah just dump the raw output with that command and attach the file to this issue. Or send it to simo @ {name of this github org} .io if you don't want to post it here. That file parses fine with [adbkit-logcat](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit-logcat). If you're using the latest STF, is it possible you may have forgot to run `npm install` to update the dependencies?  I'm really sorry but aside from the existing documentation you can find in the repo, there's no additional documentation. There's some additional information spread around in various issues here on GitHub. New contributors are very welcome but I'm not sure if any of us has time to provide guidance. I would recommend trying to get started by yourself and then creating new issues for more specific things you are having trouble with.  They're the cheapest cables that work reliably. Anker and Aukey cables work
fine too but they're quite a bit mire expensive.

  This is an issue with the current architecture, some things are sent to all active browser sessions of a user. I'm not sure if we'll get to fixing it before a larger rewrite. Could it be fixed in some other way? Sure, but it's not very interesting, so don't count on it. PRs are welcome, of course.  Not really, it's a configuration issue for sure. Open the Chrome developer console on your friend's browser and there will probably be some kind of an error in there that should give you ideas about what's wrong.  Based on [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28631635/cannot-access-openid-userinfo-endpoint-on-azure-aadsts90010-jwt-tokens-cannot) and [this](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Login_with_Azure_AD), it should probably be:

https://login.windows.net/common/openid/userinfo  Please report back with whether it worked for you and close the ticket.  It would be helpful if you could list which virtual keys are present on the device.  Sometimes it means that the activity wasn't exported in `AndroidManifest.xml`. Does it work on other devices? Could be that a security setting is enabled that prevents the app from
starting via cli. Did you have to do anything special when you plugged in
the phone to get STFService working?

  That's very interesting to see. Unfortunately I don't think you can make it
100% smooth easily. Have you tried making the screen capture size as small
as possible?

I have some improvements coming that will reduce memory usage a bit but I
don't think it would solve your issues.

 Yeah, unfortunately I think limiting the FPS and jpeg quality would be the best option. The current code makes it a bit difficult to do, however. That should improve soonish, though.

You could also build a separate app around minicap. That 1s lag is because of another reason. My changes will fix that but I can't promise when I'll have time to merge my changes. It'll also remove unnecessary drawImage calls.  Maybe you have cookies disabled or something.

  Sure. The minicap readme describes the format, just conect to the socket
and read the data in your app. You don't need to run stf, minicap itself is
enough.

It is possible and we used to have a feature like that. However, it's more complex than you might think. If the devices are different in size or layout, what you touch on one device might end up touching something entirely else on another device. That's why the feature is not available anymore.  It's a limitation in recent Intel chipsets. You can't fix it, just believe us and get better hardware. AMD is a lot better but it has been unreliable in other ways, not recommended.  Maybe it's timing out? If the adb socket doesn't see traffic going into the device for a while, it'll disconnect. The timeout can't be disabled completely, but you can use a ridiculously large value for the same effect. Try `stf local -t 86400` for a 24h timeout. By default device will disconnect in 15 mins if kept idle (No UI activity). You will have to set timeout more than 15 mins while asking for device i.e calling reserve device endpoint.

```
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"serial":"xxx", "timeout": 900000}' -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN-HERE" https://stf.example.org/api/v1/user/devices
``` This is not web session or user session timeout. It is device timeout, meaning user will not be able to use that device if kept idle for timeout period.

If disconnections are sporadic then it may be because of network issue or something else. Logs can help in diagnosis. Also, will not suggest to run long test suites in one go. Better to divide into smaller one.

Regarding error, can you write what request you used to reserve device? yes, you can override timeout while requesting for a device. timeout is in msec, so take care about that. You need to replace MY_TOKEN with your stf api access token.
 CLI is in seconds, @vbanthia said that the API is in ms. Seems like this was solved.  I don't think there have been any changes related to that, and you're the
only person to report this issue. I'm thinking it's probably a
configuration issue.

Things to try:

- try logging in with an incognito window, perhaps there's something wrong
with your cache
- before trying to log in, open chrome developer tools and its network tab.
Make sure "preserve log" or whatever it's currently called is checked. Then
attempt to log in. Paste the relevant requests and responses here.

 Oh... maybe this is related to openstf/stf#482. @gunta any chance you could take a look at the webpack config? Looks like maybe it needs some special handling. Pushed a fix. Could you check if this issue is resolved with latest docker image? There will be a new docker image with fix, can you pull latest image and test it again. I pushed changes 15 mins ago.  Good reporting. Thanks to all that information I can immediately say that your secrets are different. One is "Kute KittyKat" and one is "Kute Kittykat". They are case sensitive. Make them match and things should work fine. @denis99999 Nice reporting.

> In addition, where is the place to ask for new openstf features ? For instance, the main feature I would like to have is a reservation system enabling users to reserve smartphones for a time slot, is it planned in the roadmap ?

There is an [open PR for that](https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/101), you might want to discuss it over there. 
Also for other features just search / open a new issue. PRs are of course welcome.  Check https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/170 & https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/428 This is basically a limitation of STF. Two users cannot add same adbkey because STF uses adbkey to identify the user. But it should show some error dialogue in case someone try to add duplicate key.  > Basically, if we're not actually trying to use the same keys on multiple PCs, do you see why this problem could arise? And how we can avoid it?

In most of the cases each PC has its own unique adbkey which you can find in `~/.android` directory. Most probably some body else logged in with that account and has added adbkey into his account that is why other users are not able to use that adbkey.

In case you meet this problem again, you can search for the user who is using that PC adbkey from rethinkdb. Follow these steps.
1. Install adbkit globally
```
npm install -g adbkit
```
2. Get fingerprint of current machine adbkey.pub
```
adbkit pubkey-fingerprint ~/.android/adbkey.pub 
```
3. Go to rethinkdb data explored and fire following query
```
r.db('stf').table('users').getAll($FINERPRINT_STRING, {index: 'adbKeys'});
```

This will give you user who have add adbkey. STF identify user by its email, so if email is changed then it will be a different user.  I have one and it works fine. Run `adb shell getevent -ilp` and post the
output. Also, run `adb devices -l` and post the line for your device.

 8.0 works fine. Not sure about 8.1, would be unfortunate if they've locked it down. Looks like in MIUI 8.1 there's a new setting in Developer options called "USB debugging (Security settings)" that is disabled by default. To enable the setting you have to add your Mi account, but I believe it should work after that.

Let me know how it goes. You probably have to update your phone, then.

 Btw did you happen to have a MI account on that device when you checked? In later versions the option is there and says you have to add a MI account first. I'm thinking that *perhaps* in the initial versions where they did that, they didn't even show the option unless you had an account. It's possible that if you add an account, the option would magically just appear. I have no device to test the theory with, though. :( Did you read everything in this issue? Did you change the setting that you must change? But did you change the setting shown in https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/477#issuecomment-262163984? Ok good. node-jpeg-turbo is actually already compatible with Windows thanks to a contributor, but that version has not been released yet. #603 now has a better guide for adding Xiaomi devices to STF.  It's written in the README. It's a problem with the cpu/chipset and nothing
but a hardware change can solve it.

 It's all in the README. It's not about powerful hardware, it's about Intel
only supporting a limited number of USB endpoints in their recent hardware.

Please read the README and close this issue. Everything you've asked is
there.

  And you're sure you're using the latest stf?

Can you check what the version field in `node_modules/minicap-prebuilt/package.json` says?  @lhplj Did you find a solution to this problem???I am facing a similar issue  Open developer tools in chrome and check what the error is. Try an
incognito tab to see if any of your installed extensions are causing
problems.

  Sounds like an issue with the `--public-ip` option. Try opening the developer console in Chrome, it'll probably have an error about a websocket. See which URL it's trying to connect to, it'll probably be incorrect.
 Your config is wrong. If you're running stf on port 7100, the websocket
should connect to port 7100 too. Please read the deployment guide for a
working example.

 Sorry but stf local is for development purposes only, it probably won't
work as it might not expose all the necessary configuration options.

 It is not advised to use Virtual Machine for STF for production use because unreliable USB connection. 

Anyways, if you are using VirtualBox for VM then you will have to register connected Android devices in Virtual Machine. 

Check this to know how to do register devices. https://github.com/openstf/setup-examples/blob/master/docs/coreos_fleet.md#configuration  What's the exact command you run stf with?
 Closing as the request information has not been provided.  Please check #407 and see if you have a similar setting. Don't forget to post your solution here if you find one!
 Our S6 was working fine though, so it may just be that particular model, or perhaps a software update.
  Interesting. It's normal for the touch resolution to be different than screen resolution, that shouldn't cause any issues. However, looking at pictures of the V10, it seems that there's an area above the usual menu bar that's part of the touch screen, yet operates as a separate tiny display for icons. It seems like the coordinates are off by just about the height of the icon area.
 I think for this particular issue I would have to have one of those devices... I'll think about it but they're fairly expensive.
 Yeah. Unfortunately these are too expensive for me to buy right now. If someone wants to donate a new or used V10 or V20, or money to purchase one, that would be great. Model from any region is fine. I've ordered a refurbished V10 from Aliexpress for $149.99 and free shipping. It'll take quite a while to arrive, but I might look into this once it does. It would be great if you guys could ask your respective companies to donate to the project to cover the costs. They are not always equal - at least on minitouch level. On many devices (e.g. Samsung) the touch resolution is much higher than the display resolution. I've received the refurbished V10, however it seems that the ROM has been modified. It seems to have been rooted and various things in the shell don't work right. Can't use it with STF. I don’t want to have hardcoded device specific workarounds if at all possible. That being said, the stf-device-db module contains a few special cases for problematic devices. You could add it there I suppose. First, though, we should try to solve this in an automated way. Yes that would be great :) Unfortunately it seems that I can't help until I figure out how to find and flash a stock ROM on my v10, which seems to be a huge pain. I was able to reflash the V10 with the help of a Windows virtual machine, the LG Phone From app (which I downloaded on a safe phone, then pulled the .apk and pushed it to the compromised one) to get a stock firmware link, and various shady software (namely LGUP that finally worked) from the XDA developers forum. I guess it'll be usable after all. Here's the `adb shell dumpsys window` output from the V10 (on Android 6.0):

Not sure if it can be done yet, but I'm thinking we might be able to show the 2nd screen too, which would then fix the touch coordinates as well.  Please read all of https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/407 and see if you have a similar setting. Don't forget to post your solution here if you find one!
 Did you go through all the settings on your device to try to find something similar to #407?  No it's not related. It's fine It turns out that at least the latest issue was caused by a self-compiled GraphicsMagick, which did not include JPEG support by default. Others having this issue, please run `gm convert -list format` and check if JPEG is there. Or try actually converting an image with `gm convert`.  Do a real deployment instead of using 'stf local' and you can set those in
the nginx config. stf local is for development only.

 Why did you use the port offset flag? Now everything's running on the wrong
port. You can see from the log messages that the ports are different.

  No, it's supposed to be like that. Sounds like your setup is missing something.
  Try switching the phone between MTP/PTP mode and see if that changes anything. On Linux sometimes only 1 of them works.

By the way your Ubuntu is so old it's practically useless. Please upgrade, we won't help with ancient software.
 Alternatively, try running adb as root and see if that changes anything. Note that it is NOT enough to run `sudo adb devices` as it simply connects to the existing adb daemon which may or may not be running as root. Run `adb kill-server` first, followed by `sudo adb start-server`. You can call adb without `sudo` after that.
  You're not using it correctly. It's meant to be combined with other images. See the deployment docs, there are links in the README.
  Thanks for the detailed report. Unfortunately STF does not support virtual devices right now. The `PrematureEOFError` means that it was looking for something in the output of a command or stream, and couldn't find it. If you run stf with `DEBUG=adb:* stf local`, you should be able to see the command it attempts to run before that happens. It would be helpful if you could post the context including that debug log, but again, VDs are not really supported right now.
 Wow that's great! Also, super awesome when people are able to figure things out by themselves and even share their solution :)

I wonder if the screen is visible in STF though?
 @strong-code have you tried with connecting virtual devices created in vmware or vbox? Hi again,
I am trying to connect avd with stf but stf is not displaying my emulator  in the devices list, but i have checked in terminal by running command "adb devices" and its showing device there. So what i should to connect stf with avd? I'm sorry but we have so few contributors that we have to limit the scope of STF somehow - currently that includes not supporting emulators since that would take too much time. I do know that some have managed to find a magic combination of settings that makes certain emulators work, but I'm not aware of the details. Note that it may even depend on your hardware and operating system. Perhaps someone else can share their secrets. @strong-code @sorccu No black screen issue for me, everything is working fine now :) That's awesome. If you don't mind, could you share how you set it up? People are always asking so it would be useful. Ok will share the details soon :) Hi,
For a detailed installation guide I need to know which ABI openstf support as when I tried with connecting an emulator having armeabi-7a ABI then it remains in preparing mode but with those ROM having x86 ABI get easily connected. #641 (comment) You can find the installation guide to connect the AVD with STF without any black screen issue here: #641   Because you are doing it wrong. You are not supposed to run `stf local` from `openstf/stf` docker image. Read [DEPLOYMENT doc](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md) to understand its proper usage. 
  You updated node and now the native modules are out of date. It would be best if you did `rm -rf node_modules` and then ran `npm install` again.
 It says what the error is. You probably used an older node before. Now
you've upgraded node and the native dependencies were built against the old
version and don't work with the new version without rebuilding. Rm -rf
node_modules and npm install again.

  I think the reason for that behavior is that if the user left something active that keeps the screen on (like a heavy 3D game), the device would never sleep, destroying the battery and display over time. Therefore the home key is pressed once to avoid that situation.

Maybe we could make it optional, though.
 You will also have to use `--no-cleanup` option otherwise STF will uninstall all new apps installed in user session.
  We are aware of this. The problem is that most devices provide their own UI for the back/home button, and only some of the devices don't.

Because the UI space in the mobile version is premium, we cannot afford to have two home/back buttons (also it looks very ugly).

To fix this we need to detect if the device provides its own home/back buttons on the screen and show/hide our UI buttons accordingly.
  Seems like a problem with brew and/or your shell is broken. It gives you suggestions what to do in that error message, you should do those.

I will close this as off topic, since it happens before anything STF related runs.
  Usually a hardware issue. Hardware is no joke, once you have more than a
few devices connected, you can run into all kinds of issues. Please read
the README and take it seriously.

  I'm pretty sure the Java method only works the app that code is included in.
 Btw what device is it?

  It's stable enough as it is right now, let's wait if someone picks it up and it becomes a community project.
 If no one does, then we might reconsider at some point in the future.
 RethinkDB has now been purchased, relicensed to Apache 2.0, and donated to the community. This 99% ensures that someone will pick it up again.

https://www.joyent.com/blog/the-liberation-of-rethinkdb  Now that the [Pixel phone](https://madeby.google.com/phone/) has been released, we should verify that it works with STF.

Unfortunately, it's unclear when orders will open in Japan where we're located, in the past it has taken quite a while, even months. Even if you try to purchase using VPN from the US store, it won't let you select a non-US payment method. Although likely possible with enough time and effort, it's not worth it to attempt to work around all the restrictions.

In short, it's unclear if we'll actually have a device before real users do.

On the off chance that someone wants to donate one of these devices (w/ any specs), please feel free to offer.
 I think you're using an old version. Be sure to use STF 2.1.0 or newer. Would be great to hear if it works!
 Great! One more thing, do you see the following message in the log output?

> Found 7.1 Developer Preview SurfaceComposerClient::setDisplaySurface

Should be grouped under screen or minicap.
 Thanks, awesome info! Means that unlike the 7.1 Developer Preview build, they're actually using the AOSP source they published.
  Interesting question. I think at around $50-60 there may be quite a few models, but $30 seems a bit low. Perhaps a used device in fairly poor condition?
 Since the question was interesting and obviously low cost to try, I found an [iPro Wave 3.5](http://www.ipromobile.hk/index.php?ac=article&at=read&did=904) that sold for $32.39 when I bought it on [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Hot-Sale-Original-Ipro-Phones-i9355-MTK6571-Smartphone-Dual-Core-3-5-Inch-Dual-Cameras/32651879143.html). Shipping is free but can take a random amount of time, mine was quite fast, a week or so. That exact listing seems to be a few dollars more expensive now, but if you look at the store's other items, you can find it for a few dollars less too (they have multiple listings for the same phone).

I can confirm that the Wave is actually fairly good. It runs what looks like an unmodified Android 4.4.2, and is honestly surprisingly smooth even in the STF UI. Comes with the Play Store, too. The box and everything is in English, doesn't seem to be aimed at the Chinese market. Now obviously it does look somewhat cheap, but perhaps $50 cheap, not $32. So higher than expected value there as well.

The only downside is that the USB serial number is uninitialized (it's `0123456789ABCDEF`). Therefore you'd currently only be able to connect one of them to STF.

And Android 4.4 is getting pretty old, so there's that too. It's super unlikely that there will ever be any updates for this model.

Overall, very good value for $32. Seems like iPro makes decent, cheap devices if you want to try another model (just keep the serial number issue in mind).
 It runs a MediaTek processor, and there seem to be some programs like SN Write Tool that _may_ allow you to do that. It's Windows only so I haven't tested it. Alternatively if you can manage to root the phone, it's possible.
  I don't think you understand how the API works... you login once and create
an API token in the UI. You can then use the API methods with that token
(i.e. as that user). You definitely do NOT send anything to the login
endpoint.

  Hi Sorccu,

Please open a new branch and add logout button, i cannot develop it because of websocket or you can write code piece for logout function and i can add my project ?
 That's not how open source works... I don't work for you. You can make a feature request and **maybe** someone will look into it at some point _if and when they want_.
 Yes, you are right Sorccu but i said **please**. 
 @cemakkok You should feel free to open issues, but you shouldn't ask someone in particular since that is just asking to work for free. Someone else might want to implement it also.

Since this is open source, everyone works on their spare free time and the issues they care most first. 

If you really need it ASAP you can try posting a bounty [here](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/38007749-logout-branch) and someone might give it a chance.

```
 I actually happen to have a ZUK Z1 and can confirm that this issue happens. It seems like the system does not allow files in `/data/local/tmp` to be executable, making it potentially impossible to place binaries there.

```
shell@k9:/data/local/tmp $ touch a
shell@k9:/data/local/tmp $ ls -Z a
-rw-rw-rw- shell    shell             u:object_r:shell_data_file:s0 a
shell@k9:/data/local/tmp $ chmod 0777 a
shell@k9:/data/local/tmp $ ls -Z a
-rw-rw-rw- shell    shell             u:object_r:shell_data_file:s0 a
```

If so, not sure if there's an easy fix.
 Yeah that's one option. So do you have a rooted device or did you use the `app_process` trick?
 Yeah, that's the one.
 I'm working on a workaround for this but no promises on when it'll be ready. Hmm that's a good idea, I had been thinking about installing a separate app for that (or possibly reusing STFService but it may possibly not have worked due to dependency ordering, not 100% sure). I can verify that the change does work on my Z1. This is now fixed in master. It tries to install to `/data/local/tmp` first, but if the installed file doesn't have the executable bits after installation, it uses `/data/data/com.android.shell` instead. Works on my Z1.  PRs are accepted.

Otherwise, probably never since it would mean a completely rewrite, and if we get time to make a full rewrite we might choose a different library.
  You're using an old version of STF. You MUST have v2.0.1 or higher.

 I believe this issue was fixed by updating your STF :)
  <!---

IF YOU REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE WE WILL CLOSE YOUR ISSUE WITHOUT RESPONSE.
Just read it. See the commonly asked questions and fill in the details we're asking, it saves so much of our time.

Hi there!

Please be sure to run `stf doctor` before submitting an issue. Please include screenshots, command output and log files if any.

=== SUPER COMMON QUESTIONS ===

Q. I'm having issues when multiple devices are connected.
A. Usually caused by insufficient USB power supply or other hardware issue we can't do anything about.

Q. Can I connect a device to STF over WIFI?
A. Yes, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, ADB over WIFI can easily be 10x slower than USB, so don't expect too much.

Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?
A. Try the `--public-ip` option or do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Q. Can I run STF on multiple machines?
A. Yes, if you do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

- If there was a problem with a specific device, run `adb devices -l` and paste the relevant row here: 
 When you install STF from git for the first time, `npm install` runs a script that builds a static copy of the resources. You can run `gulp clean` to get rid of them (or `./node_modules/.bin/gulp clean` if you don't feel like installing gulp for that).
 It will work unless you need a new native dependency.

 This should be fixed in the latest versions (I think 2.1.0). Please open a new ticket if not.
  Yeah, I've been wanting to rewrite the provider for quite some time now. Thanks for the PR!
  Not sure about 1 and 2, my guess would be no/difficult due to restrictive android permissions. As for 3, see https://github.com/openstf/STFService.apk. 
  Thanks for the report and log output.

I can't find a place to buy a G730-U00, so I'd say the chances of this issue getting looked into are very slim. However, perhaps fixing some other Huawei device that's easier to buy would fix this one as well.
 Let's keep this issue open so that it's easier to find if someone else searches for it.
 I have an idea that will probably make most devices work. But no time to do it right now.
 I'm not 100% decided if I would want to open source that method or not yet.

Perhaps you could try `screenrecord -o raw-frames`.
 Perhaps it is similar, I have not looked at Vysor's source code. But we are aware of Vysor, yes.
 @jonqchk I can see from your log that your device was running Android 4.2. We've just pushed a fix for many 4.2 devices in STF 2.3.0. Please try it and report back if it works.
  It has been discussed here. https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/170
 Reason why STF does not allow 2 users to have same adb keys is because STF uses adb keys to identify user in remote connect. So, one adb key can only belong to one unique user.

Is there any specific reason for using two different tokens for automated tests on same machine? Can't this be done with same user token?
 This is the way it works. The key must be unique for each user, since `adb connect` doesn't send any other identifying information. If two users had the same key, we would not be able to figure out which one is trying to connect.
 One possible work around is to store adbkeys of various teams on docker-machine and use data volume option (`-v`) while `docker run`. By this you will not have to create different docker images for different team just because of adbkey.
  It is working fine on my system. Could you provide your provider's systemd unit file and logs when device get disconnected due to timeout.
 ```
nohup stf provider --name --connect-sub tcp://:7250 --connect-push tcp://:7270 --storage-url http://cloud.qaprosoft.com --public-ip --group-timeout 3600 --no-cleanup &
```

Is this exactly the same command which you ran? Because you missed some options such as `--name` & `--public-ip`

Try something like below:

```
stf provider --name SOME_PROVIDER_NAME --connect-sub tcp://:7250 --connect-push tcp://:7270 --storage-url http://cloud.qaprosoft.com --public-ip CURRENT_MACHINE_IP --group-timeout 3600 --no-cleanup &
```
 that is because `<>` is syntax for comments in markdown.

Anyways, this is really weird why this is happening in your setup. I just checked again and wrote logs as you mentioned. It is working just fine.
  USB hubs without power are useless since the devices will get discharged fast. You'll not be able to use the devices more than what the charge lasts, which is usually less than 1 day.

If you care about batteries dying after 2 years, the only real solution is to not use batteries at all.

Instead you can use electrical power from an external source to the internal battery connection pads with wires. That's going to be a DIY job and you need care to ensure correct voltages and polarity.

Also, some devices work without having a removable battery connected, just the USB power, so you might try this first.
 I think that's the downside of device labs and you can't really do much
about it, short of bypassing the battery at least. I'd say 2 years is a
fairly good run, though. I've heard of cases where they have to change
batteries every few months, but that wasn't with STF - they were using
something else. Our devices lasted for about two years too, now after 2.5-3
years I hear that about half are experiencing similar issues (haven't seen
the situation by myself, though).

If you go with regular hubs you're going to have huge stability issues.
That's the tradeoff. Some devices may be so unstable that you wouldn't even
be able to use them for a few minutes, let alone two years.

 Yes, removing the battery and replacing it with a static power supply is a good method, but labor intensive and quite a bit of knowledge is required to make sure you don't fry your device. Plus some devices are difficult to open, as they don't have replaceable batteries. In any case I've seen a working example of that.
 Personally I'm thinking an occasional "battery conditioning" might help. For example, you could cut off the device for a day or two once a month or so, until it has <20% or <10% battery left, and then reconnect. It may prevent the issue from happening, but obviously testing would be required.
 There is no solution, however you can significantly reduce future issues by introducing airflow. Buy a few fans (USB powered are fine) and make sure they're blasting directly at the back side of the devices. It’s a small investment. Why not try it out? I don’t have any “proof,” however I can say from personal experience that after applying constant airflow to a set of devices (a few of which had already started to expand), not a single new device went bad and the ones that had swollen already did not get any worse. It’s been running pretty much unchanged for over a year since airflow was added.  You can try with the [STF API](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/API.md).
We also have a sample using appium here: https://github.com/openstf/stf-appium-example
  Some of our dependencies use it and we have no choice but to wait for them to catch up.
 We've changed to pug as far as STF is concerned. Some child dependencies may still use jade, but we don't.

If you want to know what are the breaking changes look here: https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/2305
  Use the `--group-timeout` parameter to choose a longer timeout. STF extends the timeout every time there's a user action (e.g. when the user touches the screen, or in this case, whenever something is written to the device you're `adb connect`ing to). You haven't told us anything about what, and how, you're  testing, but if you simply launch something and wait for it to finish, it's likely that STF doesn't see any "user activity" on the socket and considers the usage session ended. Either increase the timeout or make sure you're doing something every now and then.
 you can also set `--group-timeout` per device while reserving a device. Some thing like below:

``` js
var device = {serial: 'yyyy', timeout: 900000 }

clientWithPromise.then(function(api) {
  return api.user.addUserDevice({device: device})
    .then(function(res) {
      console.log(res.obj)
      // { success: true, description: 'Device successfully added' }
    })
})
.catch(function(err) {
  console.log(err)
})
```
  It would help if you pasted the error (or a screenshot of it) here, and let
us know exactly what changes you made.

 Ok, maybe it's easier if you do `npm uninstall -g stf` followed by `npm install -g stf`if you've installed it globally.
 Not sure, your installation is fucked up. I would really recommend using
NVM to install node instead of using your distro's package manager.

  Hi,

Can i add new users with basic authorization groups in OpenSTF console ? 
For example someone can test on some devices, another group can test on all devices. 
 No, not right now, but perhaps in the future.

  You can use the --group-timeout parameter or perhaps the --no-cleanup
parameter.

  ADB on OS X is very unreliable. I would recommend deploying STF on Linux if
possible.

  It means that something was already listening on that port. Perhaps you ran `adb devices` on that machine at some point? Run `adb kill-server` and try again.

Pulling the image before running it ensures that you're always running the latest code with the latest improvements. It's just how our sample images currently are, you can modify them if you don't like that.
 All I can say is that the deployment docs work, I've used them several times. Check what rethinkdb complains about by running `systemctl status rethinkdb`.

The adb docker image is configured to use host networking, so other programs would still be able to use it just like before. If you don't need it, if you have to modify the provider unit to not require the adbd service.
 And how did you start the adbd container?

 Also, if you are using boot2docker, you will have to mount your host OS's USB devices to boot2docker VM otherwise you will not see anything.
  It says what the error is, you already have something running on port 7100.
  Guys, can you share your experience under my post, i need help.

https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/493  Just stop wasting your time and go with the docker deployment. It's definitely possible to run the commands by yourself without docker, but it would be extremely time consuming to help you with that, so we will not. You can try to take a look at the deployment guide and steal/modify the commands from there.  Basically we did hard work, using private APIs.

So nothing in STF requires root permissions.

If you want to know more details about the implementation, please check our following presentation: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FBvRiCdRgs

If you want custom consultation services, you can contact us at contact@openstf.io
  You can run test with any Appium client library using STF API. Check this [sample example](https://github.com/openstf/stf-appium-example) which uses Ruby Client library. You do not need to add any extra STF specific capability. Just assume that you are running test on device connected to your local machine.
  Which model is it? Can you just run `adb devices -l` and paste the model, product and name here?

Also, I've seen this once before. Turns out that there was some sort of an antivirus app running on the device, and for some reason it didn't like STFService, so it prevented the service from being started. Uninstalling the antivirus apps made it work again. It was one of `CMSecurity.apk` or `DrBooster.apk`.
 Here's how you can check. Do not have STF running while you do this.

In one shell, run:

``` sh
adb logcat -s 'ActivityManager:*'
```

Now, in another shell, attempt to start the service manually:

``` sh
adb shell am startservice --user 0 -a jp.co.cyberagent.stf.ACTION_START -n jp.co.cyberagent.stf/.Service
```

Watch the log and perhaps you'll see something like this:

```
W/ActivityManager(  854):  App Op not allow to start app jp.co.cyberagent.stf/10123
```

If you see that or something like that, it's one of the antivirus programs getting in the way.

And this is how the offending applications were removed:

``` sh
adb uninstall com.trendmicro.dr.booster
adb uninstall com.cleanmaster.security
```

For good measure, perhaps uninstall STFService once too:

``` sh
adb uninstall jp.co.cyberagent.stf
```

Now if you unplug the device once and plug it back in, STF should be able to reinstall the service and launch it.
 Not sure, possibly because the app doesn't have a launcher activity it looks suspicious. Or perhaps because of the private APIs.
 Thanks for the useful log. Based on the somewhat poor english in the log output it seems like there's still some kind of an antivirus or blocker running. Would be very interesting to know which app it ends up being. You can try something like `adb shell pm list packages -3` to show all 3rd party packages in the system.
 I want to see it myself and hopefully fix it. I've ordered that phone from Aliexpress. Will probably arrive by the end of the month.
 Well it's possible it's a system package as well. Perhaps try to take out
the -3 flag and see if there's anything there?

It'll be at least a month before I can do anything about this myself.

 I've just updated STFService.apk for an unrelated reason - I'm curious if you're seeing any change with this issue? Can you update your STF and try again? Use master or the :latest docker tag.
 I have now received the Le_X620 and I can confirm that it has that issue. However I seem to have found the cause.

At least for Le_X620, it does NOT have anything to do with an antivirus. It seems that trying to launch a service while the app is not running already counts as an "Auto Launch" and the system prevents that by default. I tried with a brand new application with an empty service and got the same result.

What you have to do is:
1. Add the device to STF and let it install the service application. It's OK if it starts failing.
2. Go to `Settings` on the device.
3. Look for `Permissions` under `Personal`.
4. Choose "You have allowed X apps to auto launch".
5. Toggle STFService ON.
6. You're done, the device now works with STF.

Here's a gif of how to do it:

![le_x620](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/32509/18616701/72d94094-7dfb-11e6-875c-f4ebdf0e61da.gif)
 One issue per device please. Closing this one, created a new one for ZUK Z1.
  Use the `--no-cleanup` option when starting STF.
 Your STF is too old, then.
  I think that device probably doesn't work.
 Probably the same issue as #366.
 Like I said, that device doesn't work. Same issue happens on some other low-end Samsung devices as well.
 No need to close the issue, it's useful as a reminder. But for now I'm not sure if we can do anything about it.
 Both should be fixed in STF 2.2.0 :)
  Duplicate of  https://github.com/openstf/minitouch/issues/5
  There's a link in the README. The minicap repo has full instructions.
  There is no such feature right now.
  gulp v4 is not released yet. Any specific reason to use unreleased version? Also, what are the errors?
 Run `./node_modules/.bin/gulp` instead of your global gulp. So, e.g. `./node_modules/.bin/gulp clean` would be equivalent to `gulp clean`.
  > I triggered an execution using appium and opened the STF dashboard which shown a Devices page. I clicked on the device where the execution is happening, because I was expecting it will show me the execution. But the moment I clicked on it, it released the device from me causing the automation failure.

I don't think it is releasing device until you are clicking "Stop Using" button. 

To view the execution,
-> Go to device list
-> Click device control url from "Product" column as shown in this demo video, https://github.com/openstf/stf-appium-example/blob/master/doc/demo.gif
 Also you must be logged in from same user whose access token you are using.
 @email2vimalraj are you looking to even prevent touches to the screen?

By the way if you press `SHIFT + CLICK` when using a device you can see only the view, is this something similar to what you want?
  If you're on Linux, it would be very easy to just use the docker image
which has all the necessary deps.

  Why does everyone want to do that now? This has been asked at least 5 times in the past week.

It's possible to do it and in fact it's quite easily exposed in one of our dependencies. A little bit of grepping will easily find it.

I can give advice if you're looking to improve STF or fix a bug, however since it sounds like you just want to rip one feature off, I'd prefer if you at least did the grepping yourself since we've done all the work for you already. Correct me if I'm wrong, though.
  It's our own custom made design, designed by yours truly + @gunta. The rails (shelves) are not actually powered, there are USB hubs velcroed to the back side. The front side is velcro as well, although we've heard that 3M DualLock would be better. Works well either way.

I'm not sure when we'll have the time to clean up the drawings... this is actually a duplicate of the legendary issue #1.

Maybe we could arrange something if you're super interested. Let me know if so.
 The design allows the shelves to be rotated to any angle (within reason), and it can even be taken off entirely just by picking it up. The weight of the shelf is enough to keep the angle once set.
  Not really, Nexus 7 should work fine.

  Basically your requirement is to release all user devices once he leaves STF.

I don't think your current idea of logout will serve your requirements as deleting session from browser will not change device owner in STF's database. So, if you want to release all devices from a user you will have to implement a new websocket message something like [this](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/websocket/index.js#L188-L199) which will tell backend to update devices ownership.

Once you are done with this implementation, you can add a new button something like "Stop Using All" in device list which will call above implemented message.

Anyways, currently STF releases all the device which are not being used for `--group-timeout` time which is `15 mins` by default. So, even if a user forget to release device before leaving STF, that device will be released after 15 mins.
  It’s not functional. Don’t use it.  Hi, yes we want to provide deeper integration like you describe.
Since most of the work can be done by using STF (instead of inside STF), a new repository would be expected for this integration. 
We are having time constraints right now, so any contribution would be very appreciated.
 Since the current API exposes an ADB device, you can use or build any other
tool that requires an ADB connection. That new tool doesn't necessarily
have to be directly in the STF repository, STF just provides access to the
device. Depends on the use case, though.

 Mostly yes, but this will depend on how much changes need to be made in the current STF code.

Since we currently don't know, but we want to make this work in an easy and straightforward way, I've created a new repository [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf-appium). 

Let's keep the discussion [there](https://github.com/openstf/stf-appium/issues/1) 
and any possible prototype for making this automation possible.
 As a reference, in the past before developing STF we tried to use Selenium Grid as a backend but we had to drop it out because we found it to be unreliable. So we are not fans of Selenium Grid.

You might want also to try the [Jenkins plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Open+STF+Plugin). 

Other than that, if you're able to make it work, we would love to check it.
  No you cannot right now. There are several issues about the same thing already, closing this one as duplicate.
  Thanks!
  Perhaps you could use the notes column in the detailed view. Double click the value (empty by default) and you should be able to enter a note for each device.
 Also, if the devices go offline often, but you only have 20 devices, then it's probably a hardware issue.
 What do you mean by device name? What is the value you want to see?
 Interesting problem, but it looks like it isn't a standard Android feature, and therefore there's no API to access the user-specified device name. Some have had success accessing the bluetooth adapter's device name.
 I think one way you could do it would be to use Contacts, and look up the device owner's profile or a specific contact. You could then use the contact fields to store information.

Alternatively if you're OK with building your own app, you could just store it in a local file, database or wherever.
  No, You cannot do this right now.
  It's in adbkit, one of our dependencies.

 Look, we went through all the trouble to research everything, spending days
if not weeks looking at packet captures, then we actually built it by
ourselves, and finally gave it away for free. Surely you can do a little
grepping to find out where it is?

Alternatively we can provide detailed advice at a hourly rate.

 If you find a bug or want to expand the features, then feel free to ask for help. But we don't provide help if it's something you can look up relatively easily by yourself, because that takes time and doesn't improve the project.
  It should already set a cookie. Currently it isn't possible to disable the login entirely.

Probably duplicate of #37.
 Basically you just need to sign a JWT using the STF session secret that includes the name and email address (=id) of the user, and then pass it to STF using a query parameter, like [this](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/d104e940838a77b02d088795f59691d5a0381b2c/lib/units/auth/mock.js#L98) and [this](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/d104e940838a77b02d088795f59691d5a0381b2c/lib/units/auth/mock.js#L111). That user will then be logged into STF.
 There is no registration. You are assumed to have your own
authorizationsystem set up already, or use mock login.

  I'm not going to get into a religious debate about databases. We felt like learning something new, and the fact that they provide official Node.js drivers was also a huge plus. It's written in modern C++ with SSD optimizations in mind from the start, and it boots up with just one command without any configuration whatsoever. And it comes with a built-in admin panel that's very usable and looks great.

The new real time functionality is also very interesting but it did not exist at the time.

If you'd like to use another database, you pretty much just need to rewrite one file, `lib/db/api.js`, so that's an option if you want to go through all the trouble.
  Yeah, STF hasn't been optimized for that scenario. It was originally made for internal networks only.
 This problem can also occur in internal networks if your wifi is too weak or it is being shared by many people. STF client side is not optimised for weak network connection.
  Just sometimes or always?
 You could try https://github.com/mattinsler/longjohn to get a more usable stack trace. Might be a bit annoying to do with the docker deployment, though. Unfortunately the current units pull the image before running it (which is a bit of a mistake, I'm using a different method now), so even a `docker commit` wouldn't apply your changes reliably. Might have to either modify the units or run from the cloned repo.
 Could possibly be a TCP timeout, and therefore perhaps related to #100.
 That's super useful. Perhaps we should include longjohn by default... might have a bit of a performance penalty, though, so would need to study the code.
 Nice. Perhaps using it only when DEBUG is true (if there is a performance penalty) would be useful too.
  They're from http://fontawesome.io/. May be a bit out of date but you should be able to use most of the icons listed there.
  Thanks, that's useful. Just to be clear though, it only works on Linux
right (and not with Docker for Mac)? Someone's bound to ask later.

  `stf local` is for development only, it isn't meant to be used for a 24/7 deployment. It MIGHT work, but it might not. For stability, you'd want a full deployment (see the deployment guide).

Anyway make sure that all output gets fully consumed. I remember one case from a really long time ago (should not happen anymore) where we were using another tool (perhaps nodemon, can't be sure anymore) to keep the program up and running. However, that program had some kind of a bug or misconfiguration, and it would run out of buffer space entirely. The program would then get blocked permanently and nothing would work. Make sure you're not doing something similar. 
  Sure, please see #123.
  You can see the issue right there in the log. Also, next time please format the log output by wrapping it within ```.
  ADB (which is provided by the Android SDK and is used by STF) is not stable on OS X. It is very common for devices to disappear randomly, needing to be unplugged and plugged in again. If you need to run STF on OS X, you're on your own pretty much. We only support Linux since it's much, much more stable.
  The README includes all the hardware information we give away. We can't give you advice about your custom hardware because it's incredibly expensive and/or time consuming to do that. If you decide to use something else than what we have in the README, you are on your own (although you could perhaps use our consultation services for that if you wanted to). 

Anyway, a Mac Pro would be an incredibly bad idea. You would most likely be unable to handle anything more than 10-12 devices. You need to use PCIe USB cards or you're most likely screwed.
  <!---

IF YOU REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE WE WILL CLOSE YOUR ISSUE WITHOUT RESPONSE.
Just read it. See the commonly asked questions and fill in the details we're asking, it saves so much of our time.

Hi there!

Please be sure to run `stf doctor` before submitting an issue. Please include screenshots, command output and log files if any.

=== SUPER COMMON QUESTIONS ===

Q. I'm having issues when multiple devices are connected.
A. Usually caused by insufficient USB power supply or other hardware issue we can't do anything about.

Q. Can I connect a device to STF over WIFI?
A. Yes, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, ADB over WIFI can easily be 10x slower than USB, so don't expect too much.

Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?
A. Try the `--public-ip` option or do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Q. Can I run STF on multiple machines?
A. Yes, if you do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

 After OS update to 6.0, Samsung Galaxy A7 2016 is working fine.
 Hmm, that's very interesting...
 These should all work in STF 2.2.0 :)
  So far, 19/20 times, this error has been caused by the gm binary either not
being installed or not being in PATH.

 There have been at least 20 issues about this thing. So far, in 99% of the
cases, it has been an issue with the the gm binary not being found.

I would highly recommend pasting the stf log output from when you take the
screenshot, all the way till you see the broken image. Otherwise there's
nothing more I can say.

  Don't remove the issue template, now I have to waste time asking you the same questions again.

That particular issue can happen on some devices if frames are not being read from it quickly enough. Which device is it? Please post the output of `adb devices -l`, it contains the necessary details.
 I don't have that one, but I know that Redmi Note 2 works fine at least.
 That sounds weird, but I've now made the timeout configurable in https://github.com/openstf/stf/commit/72a16ed2ff559d1ea895c0213fa805c140b5948a. Could be the same as #100. For usage of `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE` and `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE` see https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/104#issuecomment-149859430.

Note that the message can also imply that you have too many devices connected on that machine, or that the device isn't receiving enough power. It can be caused by many things. Do you have USB tethering or personal hotspot enabled on that device? Note that the current codebase does not have `waitForPort` anywhere anymore. Try using the latest version of STF and let us know if anything changes. Seems that this issue was resolved. Closing. Thanks!  You updated your Node.js and now the native extensions that were built for an older version no longer work.

Remove the `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` again.
  Your processor sucks. Get a PCIe USB card or you're just wasting your own time. Additionally, #354 may be related.
 Or more precisely, the chipset sucks. Recent consumer Intel chipsets are not good with a large number of USB devices.
  There is no information whatsoever in this issue, so I'm closing it.
  App switch key is already there in the master branch (see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)), which you can use either by building from source or by using the docker images. You'll then have 4 buttons in the blue bottom bar.  See stf <command> -h and/or the deployment guide

  ADB access gives you permissions that normal apps cannot have. Otherwise you'd have to root your device. STF doesn't support that scenario right now.
 As you can see, they only provide remote control for a limited set of devices (although their collection is already large and keeps increasing). It means that there is no single method to make all devices magically work. I am not sure how exactly their app works, but in the past some vendors like RealVNC have made contracts with manufacturers to include libraries for their use. It could be the case here, but who knows. Traditionally injecting touch events is only possible in your own app. Could be that they are using some sort of an overlay on the whole screen, although I haven't tried it. Displaying the screen without rooting is possible from Android 5.0, with some limitations (secure views like YouTube can't be viewed).
  Operating system IS relevant.
 Your old ubuntu probably has libmtp installed, which changes device permissions and makes ADB unable to see them. Try running adb as root and see if anything changes.

ALL devices should be able to connect. Sometimes you have to choose between MTP and PTP mode, but one will work.
 Sure, however it's easier to check if it's the cause or not by temporarily switching to root.
  That scenario is well supported. Your own separate authentication app and STF only need to know the secret key which is used to sign the JWT token. Essentially your app checks whether the login details are valid, and if they are, it generates a JWT token containing basic user information. It then signs the token using the secret key. Then it redirects to STF with the token as a URL parameter. STF checks that the JWT signature matches and if so, accepts the login using the provided information.

I can't give you step by step instructions. Honestly that would be a waste of time. Please look at one of the existing plugins, like the [LDAP plugin](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/auth/ldap.js) for example, and just do the same thing. There's so little code that it should be fairly obvious what it does.

Perhaps try to get the built-in LDAP plugin working first, and then try to replace it with your own?
 tadesushilgithub, 
1 - You have to pull STF project from github and run from file.
2 - Run "gulp build" command  in stf folder, this process do all jade extension files convert pug file.
3 - Now you can add button in menu.pug file not menu.jade.
4 - Run "gulp clean" command for every file changes, you can "gulp clean" when STF is running
  Based on the bug reports over time, we probably do have a known problem with streaming somewhere, but it's unclear where it is. Could be adbkit. We have not been able to reproduce the issue or make a test case for it.
  Try using the `--lock-rotation` flag to make it more reliable. Otherwise the device may realize it's not actually rotated, and turn back immediately.
 I believe this was resolved with the comment above. Feel free to open a new issue if not.
  It is a feature.
 We should add a flag to disable it though.

 Ok I finally added it. You can now use `stf local -C` or `stf local --no-cleanup`. Same for the provider unit if you run it separately. Thanks!
  LGTM
  When you create an issue, there's a template that you seem to have removed. It includes commonly asked questions, like "Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?" which applies in this case as well.
  Looks like you've changed the STF logo (visible before you edited), meaning that you've modified the source code. Could be an issue you've created yourself.

I would suspect incorrect configuration.
 Most probably its related to TCP Connection timeout. It depends on how your local network is configured. 

One solution to solve this is by setting `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE` & `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE` environment variable to your providers.
 If you are running all other stf micro services such as (stf-app, stf-auth ...) in same machine then you only need to add these variable in provider. If you are using CoreOS + Fleet then they might be running on different machines then you will have to add these variables in other services(which are using zmq socket) too.

Basically you will have to make sure that all the TCP connections between your servers do not die.

Unit file looks okay to me.
 looks like you have added some extra spaces in `-e "ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE =1"`. It might not work because of that space. Change it to `-e "ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE =1"` -> `-e "ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE=1"`

Also, always write source code in markdown code block for better visibility.
 By definition TCP_KEEPIDLE is

> The time (in seconds) the connection needs to remain idle before TCP starts sending keepalive probes, if the socket option SO_KEEPALIVE has been set on this socket.

Can you guys try again with `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=300`
  It says you don't have zeromq libraries installed.
  can you post `stf doctor` output and also stf logs
 Those warnings have no effect on functionality. It only means that we don't have an image or a name for those devices.
 Could be due to many reasons. Perhaps you're using the `--public-ip` option and setting it incorrectly. Or perhaps you have a firewall blocking something. The information you've posted so far is not very useful to be honest. It's borderline impossible to say anything about the situation.
 When you create an issue there's a template that shows you the basic things we need. Why did you remove it?

We would need, at the very least, the full command you use to launch stf, the `adb connect` command you run, and the logs from when you run it. Or the entire log preferably.

Start by disabling the firewall entirely and see if that helps, though.
  Hey thanks! Don't mind about the Travis failure, it's a bit screwed up right now. I'll merge this if you can fix the small thing I commented on separately.

Also thanks for keeping to the existing coding style!
 Thanks!
  You upgraded node without doing 'npm rebuild' to recompile native
extensions.

  Our example deployment setup does not provide a solution for automatic service discovery, as there are simply too many solutions out there. A lazy method would be to use a MachineID condition in your fleet unit files to ensure they stay on the same machine.

As for the reboot, perhaps your cloud-config doesn't start with `#cloud-config`? It MUST start with that line or it will be ignored. Make the contents are properly indented too. Otherwise I'm not sure, other than that perhaps it's not reading the cloud config from the location you think it is. But that's a CoreOS question, not an STF question. 
 Wow I haven't seen that validator tool before. Thanks for the link. Sorry for not being very useful, but right now spending time even responding to our own issues is essentially lost time, and therefore lost money to us. Hopefully it's understandable why we're not very interested in answering questions about unrelated projects.
  Please search closed issues, this has been asked many many times.
 No, that would be a huge waste of time. Just search.
  Maybe your STF version is too old.
  The issue is not related to STF. Something is wrong with your hardware. Usually it's caused by insufficient power supply. You'll see the same by running `adb devices -l`.
  Check [DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md) and [setup-exmaples](https://github.com/openstf/setup-examples)
  It's super easy to build the docker image... you literally just clone the repository and run `docker build .`. I am not sure how you've managed to even make that error happen, but it looks like you may have compiled the native modules on Linux and are now trying to run them on OS X.
  Duplicate with https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/118
  Currently there is no such feature in STF.
  You probably didn't install graphicsmagick.

 So far every single time the screen has looked like that, graphicsmagick
hasn't been installed. Could you check that the gm command works?

  Have you run `gulp clean` and after that `npm install` ?
  Do you mean that even if you change it to zh_CN from the UI it gets back to EN ?
 Supposedly STF should auto-detect the browser language, however there might be a bug.

Can you paste the output you get from here: http://jsbin.com/qirazahuyi/edit?console ?
 @0x88l so can you paste the output from here:  http://jsbin.com/qirazahuyi/edit?console ? I think there may be a bug related to the language matching.
 @0x88l So I found the bug, thank you!
  I don't think the size of the package is related. The automatic launcher activity detection seems to be failing for some reason. Is there any chance you could send the `.apk` file to me?
 Could you also send me the TVGames apk?
 And which operating system and which version of Node.js are you using? You seem to have removed all the details from the template again so I'm forced to ask them one by one, which is super slow.
 `stf local` or full docker deployment? 
  When you create an issue on GitHub, there's a template that you must fill in. Without the information in the template, you're not giving us enough information to do anything about the problem without wasting hours of our own time. For example, you're saying that the website crashes. That doesn't really say anything to us. Please create a new issue and fill in the issue template, and include the log messages that show the crash.
  You probably have the resources built already, meaning that it won't rebuild them. Run `gulp clean` once and you should be able to modify everything after that.
  If you want to test you need to run `gulp translate`.

Note that we are managing all the translations at Transifex since its better than just plain Github for contributing.

I've created the Thai language over it, so can you upload the translated file to [https://www.transifex.com/openstf/stf/]() ? You will need to register and apply for the Thai language only once, then you and other contributors will be able to do all the translations online.

After that you'll be able to send a pull request following the steps [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf#translating).
 No, you need to run `gulp translate` after that if you want to check.

But you can skip this, just upload the `po` to Transifex and we can do the rest.
  This is very basic stuff so you might be better having someone close to help you, or asking over [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).

Having said that,

First uninstall the globally installed stf (if you have it installed)
`npm uninstall -g stf`

Then do a fresh checkout
`git clone https://github.com/openstf/stf.git`

Fetch all NPM and Bower modules
`npm install`

Make stf directly accessible from command line
`npm link`
  Build and run our master branch and use the [SIGUSR1 signal](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html#debugger_advanced_usage) to enable the debugger for the process you want to debug. Or launch one of the processes separately and do the same thing.
  It looks more or less correct to me. What exactly is not working?
 I don't think you can use localhost for google oauth2. Google server will make a request on your callback url, so it should be a public domain.
 It [says that you can](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer#creatingcred), at least for testing purposes:

> You can also create and edit redirect URIs from this page, by clicking a client ID. Redirect URIs are the URIs to your application's auth endpoints, which handle responses from the OAuth 2.0 server. You must change this value from the default example to the URI of your application's auth endpoint before you can use OAuth 2.0. For testing, you can specify URIs that refer to the local machine, such as http://localhost:8080. You should design your app's auth endpoints in a way that doesn't expose authorization codes to other resources on the page.

Technically it is possible since the callback URL gets returned to the browser. Google doesn't have to be able to access the URL.
 yeah, you are right. I tried it long ago that time google did not used to accept localhost as domain while app registration. But yeah, in oauth2.0 protocol, all the redirections are through browser so localhost should be fine.
 Looks like your user info endpoint is incorrect. According to https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#discovery it should be `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo` (or you can remove the /v3/ for latest version).

I've just tried this myself and was able to get it working with the following configuration:

``` bash
export OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_URL="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth"
export OAUTH_TOKEN_URL="https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token"
export OAUTH_USERINFO_URL="https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo"
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.apps.googleusercontent.com"
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
export OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL="http://localhost:7100/auth/oauth/callback"
export OAUTH_SCOPE="openid email"

# Now you can just run stf local without the annoying auth options.
stf local --auth-type oauth
```
 Looks like [Google doesn't allow private IPs in the callback URL](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24736168/error-invalid-request-device-id-and-device-name-are-required-for-private-ip). There are some workarounds in the Stack Overflow post.

What you can do is to buy a domain or set up a subdomain for an existing domain, and point it to a private IP. You might as well do the [full deployment](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md) then, though.
 I've added some documentation for the Google provider in b61df410f72505367728c4d05ef53449eadd4d69. I'll close this ticket now since the issue is solved, the private IP thing is beyond our control.
 Doesn't sound like that has anything to do with STF?  It does, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, there are several problems with that. The ADB wifi protocol is very, very slow. It can easily be 10x slower than USB. If you search the issues you can find more detailed information.
 No, just connect to it normally with `adb connect`. Just keep in mind that there's nothing we can do about the slowness.
 No... that's not how it works. You need to read http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html#wireless. Please try to figure it out on your own, this isn't a bug and walking you through it is a huge waste of our time.
  Depends on what kind of information you want. Internally STF uses [STFService.apk](https://github.com/openstf/STFService.apk) which provides all the device information through TCP connection.
  No, please use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install node.
  You're right, it was a bug in one of our own dependencies. I've pushed a fix with tests to prevent future breakage. Should be fixed in master now, but remember to run `npm install` to update your dependencies.
  Sounds like your RethinkDB is too old, or possibly too new. Please post the exact version.
 When you submit a new issue, there's a template with required information. It seems like you've removed the whole template. We can't help you because you're not giving us enough information.
 @0x88l Can you at least paste the output of `stf doctor`?
 Can you post the output of `stf doctor`?
Also can you post what error you get when "npm download"?

If you don't post any of the required information no one will be able to help you.
 Can you post what you get after doing `npm install` ?
 Yes
 First, never run npm as root, it causes all kinds of things (mostly native
extension builds) not to work properly as some kind of a security measure.
Use your own user, create a separate user, or use something like the nobody
user.

Second, If you want to install from master, you have to clone the
repository first. Otherwise it might be missing some things that are
normally built before publishing. After running npm install in the repo,
run npm link and it will be accessible globally.

  Thank you for your contribution!
Merged in master.
  You're right, I just updated and it doesn't work.
 Looks like the screen has been abusing display: table-row. It doesn't actually contain any table-cells.
 This should be fixed now. Could you build from master and try again?
 You're probably using prebuilt assets. Run `gulp clean` to always rebuilt assets on run, or `gulp build` to rebuild assets once. You can also use `./node_modules/.bin/gulp <command>` if you don't have gulp installed yet.
  None of the core developers uses Windows. It might be possible to make it work but we don't really care, to be honest. Our only officially supported deployment platform is Linux for now. 

Since you're asking for a very detailed guide, you could perhaps try posting a bounty on this issue, and maybe someone who knows how to do it will respond.

[![Bountysource](https://api.bountysource.com/badge/issue?issue_id=32851453)](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/32851453-is-there-a-doc-about-deploy-stf-on-win7)
  This is already implemented in 2.0.0 branch and will be available in next major release. If you want to use it now, then use 2.0.0 branch. To know more about its usages refer this https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/200
  Read [this](https://github.com/openstf/minicap/blob/master/README.md) and [this](https://github.com/openstf/minicap/tree/master/jni/minicap-shared) for documentation. And there are also some instructions in this [issue](https://github.com/openstf/minicap/issues/8) which may be helpful
  You can have more than one stf-triproxy-dev running if you need extreme scalability, but your graph is a bit off. The stf-triproxy-dev is a contact point for ALL the services running on ALL the provider machines. Therefore if you put it directly on a provider machine, all other provider machines and stf-processors would have to connect to that one.

Like the deployment docs say, the provider machines are only supposed to have adbd and stf-provider running. You should put the stf-triproxy-dev unit wherever it's convenient, usually the application server. Keep in mind that the triproxies are bind points, i.e. they must have some kind of a static address e.g. a dns entry or a static IP. If you put the triproxy on the provider machine, all other machines will need to know its address, which is annoying and even impossible in some environments. I would recommend getting started with only one stf-triproxy-dev, and if you really, really insist, you can try adding more once you get that running.
  Yes, please translate from https://www.transifex.com/openstf/stf/dashboard/ if possible.
  Can you paste the output of `stf doctor` ?
 You updated node and didn't run 'nom rebuild' to rebuild native extensions.
This is like the 5th time this exact same question has been asked in the
last 1-2 weeks.

 Ok, so it looks like `npm rebuild` alone is not enough on Node 6.x. For future reference, if it still doesn't work, I would recommend simply doing `rm -rf node_modules` followed by `npm install`. It should then work as usual.
  Looks to me like you did not follow the instructions. You need to include `http://` or `https://` in `--storage-url` like the deployment guide shows.
  Sorry to take so long. I've applied this to master, and we're hoping to merge 2.0.0 soon into master as well.
  Looks like you are trying to run setup example which is in different repo. Please don't mix issues between different repository. 

Also, it's hard to identify problem with current information. Please post everything what you have done to run that sample with fleetctl logs.
  Difficult to say, as it would take lots of time to implement. Consider [donating to the project](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/openstf) to allow us to spend more developer time on it. For now let's keep this in #64.
  Yeah some Lenovo devices are known not to work with STF right now. Personally I don't have any so I can't really do anything. Please consider donating the problematic Lenovo device or a similar device to us.

Alternatively, you can click the badge below to start a bounty on this issue and maybe we or someone else will take a look at it if it reaches a reasonable value.

[![Bountysource](https://api.bountysource.com/badge/issue?issue_id=31981649)](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/31981649-a-set-of-lenovo-a850-devices-constantly-drop-connections)
 There's a good chance that your device might work now in STF 2.3.0. Please test and report back!
  You are getting this error because you are doing it wrong. You are not supposed to run `stf local` from Docker. `stf local` was made for development purpose not for deployment. If you want full deployment using docker then follow this [Deployment doc](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md). It has everything you need for full deployment.

Anyways, the reason you are getting that error is because [STF docker image](https://github.com/openstf/docker-openstf-base/blob/master/Dockerfile) does not have `adb` in it. For `adb` it uses different image [docker-adb](https://github.com/sorccu/docker-adb/blob/master/Dockerfile). `stf local` requires `adb` to be installed and should be in `$PATH`.

One more thing, if you want to deploy stf using docker, I will not recommend to use OS X as it does not support docker natively. Use docker supported OS such as CentOS, Ubuntu etc.
  Looks like you're trying to use STF from another phone. We have some known rendering performance issues in that area (mobile Safari and Chrome) that cause most of that lag. The frame producer on the origin device, with its current architecture, waits for the current frame to be fully read before sending the next frame. Since the rendering on the phone is very slow to begin with, this further compounds the effect, and can even lead to the image getting stuck like you saw (although it could have been caused by another issue as well) once the internal buffer queue runs out of space.

I agree that it is definitely a use case we want to support, but it isn't possible right now due to our limited resources. We're working on something that will hopefully allow us more time in the future.
 To be a bit clearer the problem is essentially our current "video" delivery method. There may be some low hanging fruits to improve the performance somewhat, but I think it'll require a larger architectural change to become fully responsive.

Find us funding and we can do it ;)
 Well that doesn't sound right. Any chance you're using ADB over wifi?
  We still recommend the plugable hub. Closing the issue as it's pretty old and the situation has likely been resolved in some way already.  It sounds like they've just renamed some symbols. Anyway the part of STF that needs the private APIs isn't actually an app, it's a simple binary. Some changes may be required but I don't think it'll be a problem.

If I uprade my Nexus 9 to N, I won't have any 6.0 devices left. If someone donates an N-compatible device we can take a look at it faster.
 I mean, STF won't work right now because we don't have a precompiled shared library for N yet. I'm just saying that it should be possible.
 Hopefully soon. I've added a [contribution link](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/openstf) to the README, please feel free to pledge your support if you'd like to get N support faster :)
 Thanks to a few generous donations from @juliusspencer and others, we should be able to purchase a Nexus 5X for Android N development with the donations we've received so far! I will keep you updated.
 I've scheduled a withdrawal from Bountysource and ordered a Nexus 5X from a reasonably priced seller. It should arrive this weekend (or perhaps a little later). I'll get working on N once it arrives. 
 Yes that would be a separate issue, but some devices indeed do not work. It's difficult to say if that's the case here, as there can be many different causes. Anyway please create an issue per device that doesn't work, and include as much information as possible. Unfortunately most of the time the issues are difficult or borderline impossible to solve without having physical access to the device, so what we can do is quite limited. We could perhaps try to buy second hand devices, but sadly even having access to a device doesn't guarantee success, and even if it works out it can take several days of developer time.
 Ok, I've received and flashed the 5X. It seems that the current N version works without any changes to STF. It still introduces itself as SDK 23, which is likely to change over time, but at the very least there seem to be no breaking API changes so far.

So, the status as of Android N Preview 1 is that **it works as-is**. I will keep monitoring the preview updates.
 It turns out that Developer Preview 2 was just released, and that's what I actually tested even though the site wasn't fully updated yet. Android N Preview 1 will therefore go untested.

So, to correct my previous statement, it's Android N Preview 2 that has been tested and works fine.
 Should work now if you build from master.
 Our "app" that requires private API access is not an app. It's a stand-alone binary run inside the device as the shell user. Therefore the same rules don't apply.
 And for what it's worth, it works fine on a Nexus 5X running Preview 4 (which runs SDK 24) without any notifications.
 I've now verified that current master still works great on Android N Developer Preview 5, which is near-final (even branding has been changed to Android 7.0 already).
 I just tried on NRD90S and it works fine. Haven't checked NRD90M but it should also work just fine.
 Not sure why this issue is still open. Android N has been supported for a long long time.  device-db hasn't been updated since 2 years. You can add device images here, https://github.com/openstf/stf-device-db by sending PR.  Looks like a WebSocket problem, check the developer tools on Chrome for ideas. 50% of the time it's a configuration issue, the other 50% a firewall that you may or may not know about.
  It's not supposed to happen and we could probably fix it, I have a rough idea of what's going on and some potential solutions planned (but it's not that simple). Problem is that even finding out the root cause (or a reasonably plausible cause) can take several days of work, let alone the time it takes to actually fix it. Also, I don't have any device that exhibits that behavior, so I couldn't even test it.

So far no one has been willing to donate even a single device, ever. I would be happy to own every single Android device in the world, but the sad reality is that we can't shell out hundreds or thousands of dollars per month on new devices. We are looking into offering some commercial services in the near future that would pay for both developer time and new hardware. Alternatively if we could get some kind of bug bounties going on with reasonable rewards, we could then probably look into these things faster. Let me know if you're interested.
  That's not recommended because adb over wifi is super super slow. You can search past issues for more details.

I suspect your issue may be caused by a firewall, but perhaps not. Open your browser's developer tools. There should be a failed WebSocket request. Take a screenshot of that request incl. headers if there are any, and post it here.
 How are you launching stf? If you use `stf local --public-ip 1.2.3.4`, then you should only access http://1.2.3.4:7100. If you don't give the `--public-ip` option, then you should only access http://localhost:7100. You can't mix them reliably.
 No, it doesn't have a launcher action so that it doesn't interfere with the
original UI. You can still access and uninstall it from settings, though.

  That's not a problem. It just means that we don't have a picture for that device. Also, stop spamming. Within just a few hours, you emailed us directly in Chinese, which we cannot read, then posted this issue, and are spamming other issues as well.

Furthermore, your device is broken. USB serial numbers are supposed to be unique, but yours is "0123456789ABCDEF". It means that the manufacturer has no idea what they're doing. STF does not work if you have multiple devices with the same serial number connected to the system. If you had multiple devices connected to the system, this is most likely the reason.

Anyway please post the full log output, all the way from `stf local`, otherwise it's impossible to say anything.
 A missing picture is not a problem. It just won't look pretty in the UI.

You need to show the full log or there's nothing I can do to help.
  Did you run adb connect ip:port? Also using adb over wifi is a bad idea
(even though it works), search the issues to find out why.

 STF over WIFI with USB devices is fine. ADB over WIFI is super slow, and if you connect those devices to STF they will also be very slow, because there's nothing we can do to fix the slowness of ADB itself.
  Currently you'd have to fork, since the built-in plugins are quite interconnected due to permission issues and device workarounds. It's an interesting topic, though. Perhaps we could make it simpler for at least some types of plugins.
  May I ask what kind of an application requires 2.5GB of disk space?
  Yeah, it would be great and it's definitely something we'd like to have at some point. However, nearly all our development time is unpaid right now, and I guesstimate it would take up to several weeks of full time work to get it done. So basically there's a financial barrier that's keeping this from being implemented for now.

This ticket will be kept open as the official emulator support ticket.
 @rseek Nice. That means that you might have to only change [minicap](https://github.com/openstf/minicap) to make the screen work also. Let us know if you make any progress ;)
 Can you explain a little more about what you want to do? What is minicap-niop? Where's the link to the changes? Currently your links go to our repository, which doesn't have any of those changes.

I can't include any binaries that I haven't built myself, but I would consider adding them to the package if I was able to build them myself. Again, more details needed, though. I am slightly confused, but if the emulator is x86, wouldn’t STF already attempt to load the x86 minicap and minicap.so? You mentioned earlier that the generated binaries didn’t work on a real device, so they needed to be in a separate folder. But Nexus 5 isn’t an x86 device. Did you perhaps attempt to run the x86 binaries on your Nexus?

If there are no changes to the binaries, I don’t really see how it would break real devices. Let me know if I’ve misunderstood, though. Don't worry you provided details and tested things out. Good work.  The shelves are our own design and they were custom made. If you really really want one, I guess we could have one made for you... but it would be very expensive.
 Duplicate to https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/1
  It's possible with `stf local --allow-remote`, but there's no point, and if you want to use it locally there are some drawbacks listed in the README. There are already many issues about this same thing but as a small recap:

The ADB wifi/TCP protocol is super inefficient and has huge overhead. If you try it yourself, without STF, you'll see a difference even with just regular `adb shell`. The latency and transfer speed can very easily drop to 1/10th (or less) of what you'd get with USB, which completely kills the STF screen performance.

Furthermore, many devices turn wifi off or at the very least disconnect from the network when they're idle, in order to conserve power. This means that your ADB connection will die all the time and someone will have to reconnect it.

Finally, you won't be able to test real 3G/4G or Airplane Mode if you connect your devices over wifi. You can't turn wifi off or choose another wifi network either.

So yeah. It's just not worth it in any sense.
  No, you cannot do this via `stf local`. `stf local` is made for development purpose not for production.

As said earlier, you will need to do a full deployment as described [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md) to use multiple providers.
 Yes it does, but you need to know what you're doing like you apparently do :) Anyway we only provide step-by-step instructions for a full deployment and `stf local` isn't super reliable, it might fail to restart processes that die and we know it has other bugs too.
  You can set optional `timeout` parameter while adding a new device, something like this

``` js
var device = {serial: 'yyyy', timeout: 900000 }

client.then(function(api) {
  return api.user.addUserDevice({device: device})
    .then(function(res) {
      console.log(res.obj)
      // { success: true, description: 'Device successfully added' }
    })
})
.catch(function(err) {
  console.log(err)
})
```

`timeout` is in ms
 Currently, you cannot reset the `timeout` for the devices being used. You can only set it while adding a new device. 
 @vbanthia how can i use your code sample, i cannot see any sample in the project like that api.user....., how can i get client object ?  for example i wanna add this code to work when client click a device. 

Which js class, must i edit ?

Thanks for your answer.
  You need to do a full deployment, as described in [DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md). This allows you to provide devices from multiple machines.
  Not all devices work. It's hard to say if this is one of those cases, it could be due to many other reasons as well, such as a bad USB connection.

Please update the ticket with the exact model number of your device. You can get the necessary details by running `adb devices -l`.

We most likely don't have the device so we can't test it. If you'd like us to look into it, considering becoming a [hardware sponsor](https://github.com/openstf/stf#sponsors-wanted). 
 I think we had one and it worked fine. Samsung makes many country-specific models and sells them under the same name. Sometimes the differences can be huge. Please give the exact model number as shown by `adb devices -l`.
 You mean the model number and not the device serial number, right? The model number is nothing more than a string in build.prop. Personally I've never seen it change, but it is possible for a software update to change it, or to even modify it freely on a rooted phone.

The device serial number, in theory, cannot change. However, sometimes weird things happen. We had this one Disney-branded device that would sometimes give `1234567890ADCDEF` as its serial number early in the boot process (but still connected to `adb`). After it got a bit further, it showed the actual serial number. This stopped happening after a while, though, so I think a software update may have resolved the issue.

We also had a dirty cheap $50 phone that had the serial number permanently set to `1234567890ADCDEF`. We never plugged it in to the system.
  Could be possible I suppose, but making it 100% foolproof is unlikely. Additionally, it would require root, which none of our other current functionality requires. So, it would only work on rootable ROMs. 

To be honest it's kind of a niche feature, and I don't think we'll implement it any time soon. Most device providers don't have a need to hide information, all they care about is resetting the device after use.

If you'd really like to have that feature anyway, we may be able to implement and support it commercially.
  1. Nope
2. Every broken device has a different cause & workaround. It's nearly impossible to tell you what you need to do, you have to figure it out yourself. And it's almost impossible to do it remotely. We'd have to spend several hours, perhaps even days with the device. You can become a [hardware sponsor](https://github.com/openstf/stf#sponsors-wanted) if you'd like us to look into it.

Personally I haven't seen that error before, so it would probably take several days to fix.
 No, if someone wants these devices supported, they have to send me one.

Otherwise all you can do is wait.
 But please create a new issue for that specific device. That way it's easier to see which devices are not working.
 It seems like the I9082 is upgradable to 4.2 (originally 4.1), and @chanchifan's I9152 is 4.2. We've just pushed a fix for many 4.2 devices in STF 2.3.0, could you try and see if those devices work now? And @prateekagarwal60 please let us know which Android version your device was running.
 Ah, I can see from the log that it was running on SDK 17, which is 4.2. I believe both of these devices have a very good chance of working now, but please report back with results.
  well if you are just looking for a work around then I can suggest one.

Generally `80` & `443` ports are open in most of the firewalls. You can use `--poorxy-port` option while running stf server and set port = 80. In order to use `80` port, you need to start stf as sudo. Run command will look something like this

``` bash
sudo stf local --public-ip x.x.x.x --poorxy-port 80 
```

There will still be a limitation, you won't be able to use stf's `remote-debug` feature as it needs more open ports `7400 ~ 7700` in case you are running stf as `stf local`.
 In that case you can't use `stf local` since it doesn't expose all the
options you need. You would need to do a full deployment as described in
https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md.

 Most likely a firewall issue. Unless you do a full deployment, as mentioned earlier, the device screen goes through a different port which you must also open. In fact you have to open a whole range of ports for the screen. Either do a full deployment or tweak your firewall.

Also, many Windows machines don't like it when you use WebSockets on port 80. The connection tends to cut off after 10 seconds or so. I would recommend using a different port (ideally with HTTPS).

Anyway can't really help with the firewall issue. It's entirely up to you. You can check your developer console in your browser to see where it's trying to connect to. You have to then make sure that the connection to that address and port isn't being blocked by anything on either side.

OR this is a device that doesn't work yet. If so, consider becoming a [hardware sponsor](https://github.com/openstf/stf#sponsors-wanted) so that we can fix it for you.
 You choose the range yourself or leave it as default, which is 15000-25000 (an overly large number but hey, at least it's large enough). See `stf local --help` or `stf provider --help` depending on your setup.
 Use the [deployment guide](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md). `stf local` is for local development only, though you may be able to use the `--public-ip` option to make it accessible from elsewhere. Can't help you with that, though.  How did you install stf?

 Super old issue but @dpn's answer is good. Closing.  If you're using an older version of Node with NPM 2, you're probably hitting npm/npm#5400. You can try running `npm rebuild zmq` if you don't want to upgrade, but I would strongly recommend using Node 5.x instead.

Please close the ticket if this solves your issue.
 rm -rf node_modules && npm install

  First of all, with this information no one can help you. Report detailed issue, this one is just wasting our time.

Looks like, you are trying to run setup example. Provide full detail about your environment, command you ran for setup and your problem.

Lastly, keep title short and write details in description block.
  LGTM
 :+1: 
 Thank you!
  You can check this PR as a reference for coding style

https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/223/files
 looks like there are many modules which are imported but never used. Please remove those.
 well, there is still one point you have not fixed yet. https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/247#discussion_r49556805

Personally, I do want to use passport-xxxx for all our auth unit for code consistency and maintenance point of view. If you really have any strong reason to not use passport, we would be okay. 

If you need more example for `passport-openid`, I think this can help you. https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-openid/blob/master/examples/signon/app.js

If you make these changes, then it will be `LGTM` from my side.
 Thanks for your research. I suggested `passport-openid` to keep consistency. I have made one more minute comment. If you fix that plus this one https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/247#discussion_r49556805, I will merge it.
 No, it is not related to passport. It is only a coding convention. Just to separate openid related options. You can check saml and oauth unit to see how protocol specific options are set.
 LGTM
 Merged in master!
  Could you provide more information about your setup?

Please also provide STF logs 
 If there's no screen but it otherwise works fine, you may have missed the `--public-ip` option. You need to set it to access STF from another computer.
  Well, as far as I know. This is an intentional feature not a problem. When you are sharing devices with others, you don't wanna keep development binaries inside device.

This is how this feature works,
1. `device unit` will store a list of pre-installed apps when device is connected to provider
2. on `group.leave` (Stop Using), it will again list packages and uninstall all the new apks installed by the user.

In case, XiaoMi, Huawei, Nexus is not uninstalling app after device session is over, then there is a problem. Can you recheck again on those devices? In case they don't uninstall apps, could you also post stf logs.
 Well logs in my case looks like this

```

INF/device:plugins:cleanup 5244 [EP7351U3WQ] Cleaning up package "com.vbanthia.androidsampleapp"
```

As you can see the last line, it is from `cleanup` plugin, which clean all the new added apps. In my case it was `com.vbanthia.androidsampleapp`. `cleanup` plugin uninstalled it.

I think, the reason why stf is not uninstalling apk in your case is because your apk was already present in the device when your first connected it to stf. So according to `cleanup` plugin, it is not a new entry. I know this is not very good design but we are working on making it better and probably release it in next big release.

So, I advice you to clean your device first i.e, uninstall all the unnecessary apk and then connect it to stf provider.

If the above solution does not works, then it may be problem with your device. I am not sure if we can provide any support remotely. In this case you can either debug your self by debugging [cleanup plugin](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/device/plugins/cleanup.js) or being a [Hardware Sponsor](https://github.com/openstf/stf#sponsors-wanted)
 Well currently it is not possible to hide this feature without changing the code itself.

In case you are okay with editing code and building stf yourself then just comment out the below line, stf will not uninstall any app later.

https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/device/index.js#L35
 It's now possible to disable the cleanup plugin by using `stf local -C` or `stf local --no-cleanup`. Same for the provider unit if you use it separately.
  I have used it once and did not find any problem with STF
  Looks to me like you already have one `stf local` running. Are you perhaps trying to run the command you posted in addition to `stf local`? Because that would be wrong, you only need to run the command you posted above. Alternatively, you may want to check if some node processes were accidentally left behind somehow from a previous run.
 Also, don't set the `--port` option. Your `--ldap-url` should be `ldap://10.11.200.201:3268`.
 Even if stf local says it's shutting down everything, there can be a bug.
Overall stf local is not meant to be very reliable since it's supposed to
be for development only. You need to check your running processes somehow
(with ps maybe) and kill any unexpected stf node processes. It doesn't
usually happen but seems to have happened anyway in this case.

 Looks like you should set `--ldap-search-field` to the LDAP field that contains the username, and you may also need to change `--ldap-search-scope` and `--ldap-search-class` if the [defaults](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/b9fd290da8e87679972dea4c430bb6f71bd82c84/lib/cli.js#L351) aren't good for you.
 No. It depends entirely on your LDAP server.
 In that case you are missing one of the required properties. Check `stf auth-ldap --help` for the available options.
 Looks like you're missing `--ldap-search-field`.
 The error message says exactly what's wrong. `Error: Hostname/IP doesn't match certificate's altnames: "IP: 172.17.17.2 is not in the cert's list: "` You connected using the IP address, but the certificate is for a hostname. Or perhaps has no value set at all since the value is empty? Either way, the certificate doesn't match and it can't connect. Figure out what the hostname is supposed to be and use that instead. Alternatively you can try using `export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` before running STF, although I'm not sure if it applies to this issue, and is of course a security risk.
 Yes, we have written the [deployment guide](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md) for that. `stf local` is for development use only. Unfortunately the `--websocket-url` option is not configurable for `stf local` right now at all.
 It's a required argument. It's a signing secret used to verify the authentication token. If someone knows your `--secret`, they can create a valid token and log in to your system. You must give the same `--secret` to your auth, app and websocket units or they won't be able to work together. For `stf local` it defaults to `'kute kittykat'`, which is why you don't need to set it.
 Sounds like it can't find the email field of your user. One of [these](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/48d621b1940058b5a4d979e35dc5eb2132c52946/lib/util/ldaputil.js#L120) is required.

Currently STF requires an email address to use as a primary key. If your LDAP doesn't have email addresses, you'll have to add them somehow.
 This issue is very old and has been resolved.  It's [this one](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/b9fd290da8e87679972dea4c430bb6f71bd82c84/lib/units/device/plugins/touch/index.js).
 That's the only one we have. But it's doing exactly what the [minitouch](https://github.com/openstf/minitouch) documentation shows.
  Not yet, but progress is being made in the 2.0.0 branch.
 It is not possible through STF UI but can be done through API. All you need to do is,
- Reserve all target devices where you want to install your apk using REST API
- Remote Connect to those devices
- Install apk using `adb -s SERIAL install /path/to/apk`

Here is the API documentation, https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/API.md
  It might or might not work, none of our collaborators use Windows and therefore we never test it. Please contribute instructions for Windows if you manage to get it to work, though.
  ~~minicap~~ minitouch doesn't provide a WebSocket server. It's a raw socket. Raw sockets are very different from WebSockets. You MIGHT be able to use something like http://websocketd.com/ if you really don't feel like playing with sockets yourself, but I've never tried using it.
 Why does your log still show a HTTP request?
  Not through the UI, but the functionality does exist in the backend and even in the client side JavaScript. It's not exposed since we don't have a multi-device UI yet. @vbanthia is doing great work with the API in the upcoming 2.0 release, so you may be able to do that programmatically in the future. The initial API endpoints will not expose all functionality, though.

If you really want to try the hidden functionality, there's a secret way. But it's not very useful for real work. Actually perhaps I shouldn't even mention it. But here goes. If you go to the device list and open your developer console, you'll find that there's an ugly global variable called `cc` (you can call it Control Center or whatever you like). It exposes the ControlService's methods (such as [`.openBrowser(url)`](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/b9fd290da8e87679972dea4c430bb6f71bd82c84/res/app/components/stf/control/control-service.js#L207)) on the whole device list, but there are caveats. First and foremost, it was and is for quick debugging, nothing more. Therefore it's quite stupid, and won't even ignore devices that are offline. It simply controls ALL devices in the list. You'll still get the desired end result but the promise won't return as cleanly as it should. There's also a separate control group for your "device group", or the set of devices you're currently using, but that one isn't exposed. Another thing is that even though the command will go to all devices, it won't actually wake them up unless someone is actively using them. Therefore to see the effect you'd have to first click "use" on all the devices in the list first to unlock them, and then run the command. IIRC you can shift or alt click on the use button to avoid going to the device page. 
 By the way if you'd be willing to contribute some of your time to assist and/or provide guidance with WebRTC, we could make the screen even faster ;)
 Currently we are not using it due to the large time investment required to learn everything required, and not having a sponsor to cover the development cost. But there is a huge incentive in doing it, for the following two reasons:

There's huge demand for WAN access due to people wanting to install STF on cloud providers, while running just the `stf provider` on physical machines. Currently it can be done, but latency and bandwidth can be an issue. Even when they are less of an issue (i.e. when the servers are not that far), it's still not an ideal situation. WebRTC would allow users on the same network to go through their internal network instead, improving latency.

Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, our screen capture method is not actually as fast as it could be. If we had WebRTC, we would be able to convert and send hardware accelerated raw x264 frames from the device and push these through the WebRTC connection. Not only would capturing be faster, but the smaller frames would transfer much faster through the bandwidth-limited ADB connection. We should then have an easy, efficient and low effort method to render these in the browser, since it would essentially be the same as a remote webcam from the browser's perspective.

I've been trying to read on how we could produce a WebRTC video stream from raw x264 frames, but so far haven't been successful in doing it. I'd guesstimate it would take 4 weeks or even more if I had to attempt to learn everything from scratch by myself, and currently it's just not possible.
  This PR implements RESTful APIs for STF which will make possible to use STF for test automation.
Detailed discussion can be seen [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/38)

In order to implement APIs, I did following things.
- Created a new api unit
- Used [swagger](http://swagger.io/) to define apis
- Moved all the current apis in app unit to new api unit
- Authorisation using accessToken which can be creating from STF UI. Refer (https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/190)

API Documentation can be found [here](http://vbanthia.github.io/angular-swagger-ui/)
### How to use these API's for test automation?

Basic idea behind test automation is by using STF's remote debugging feature. By this feature you can remotely connect STF device to you machine(client). [More about this feature](https://github.com/openstf/stf/wiki/%5Ben%5D-Remote-Debug)
### How to connect device
1. Get all the devices using `GET /devices/` endpoint. You can also use `fields` query parameter to get only useful information such as `GET /devices?fields=owner,ready`. You can filter the usable device by filtering devices whose `owner==null`
2. Next step will be to request a usable device from STF server. You can do this by sending a POST request to `/user/devices` endpoint with `serial` in request body. Since this request is going to be asynchronous, STF will return you a polling URL. You can use this polling url to check if device is added into your devices (group).
3. Once device is added into your devices(`/user/devices`). You can ask STF server to start remote debugging using `POST /user/devices/{serial}/remoteConnect` endpoint. This will again return a polling url like `/user/devices/{serial}`. You can check if remoteConnect is finished by `GET /user/devices/{serial}?fields=remoteConnect`. If it is true, you can get `remoteDebugUrl` from device information i.e `/user/devices/{serial}?fields=remoteDebugUrl`. After getting this url you can use this url for remote connection and then you can run most of the automated test such as appium, calabash etc.
4. Once test are over, don't forget to disconnect remote debug and release the device by `DELETE /user/devices/{serial}/remoteConnect` and `DELETE /user/devices/{serial}`
### NOTE

Those who wants to try this branch, they can use `npm install stf@2.0.0-beta` or docker image  `docker pull openstf/stf:v2.0.0-beta`
 @HelderVSousa 

I merged some recent UI fix from master to this branch. Check once again. In case if it is not working, please also provide errors detail with your environment info which you can get from `stf doctor`
 @dhartwich1991 

I tried reproducing this but could not. Most probably you are still using `master` branch. Can you confirm this?

In case problem is not resolved, please post stf logs too.
 Github is the right place for discussion.

Are you able to connect same device from STF UI? In case yes, how much time does it take to get device connected after pressing "Use" button.

This error is raised when `stf api` service is not getting JoinGroupMessage (or device connected) message from backend within 5 second. Code related to this error is [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/2.0.0/lib/units/api/controllers/user.js#L127-L134)
 @fbatogo 

One more thing, if you want STF Java Client for Jenkins plugin, you can generate one using [Swagger online codegen](http://editor.swagger.io/) and [STF swagger.yaml](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/2.0.0/lib/units/api/swagger/api_v1.yaml) 
 @fbatogo 
Sorry, I could not look into your issue, will try to check this sometime next week.
 @fbatogo 

Good to know that its working now.

The reason why it was running and not raising any error was because of ZeroMQ behaviour. As you can see API unit uses `7150` and `7170` port to connect with stf's app side sub and push sockets respectively. Unlike HTTP, zeromq's "client" socket does not raise any error if zeromq's "server" are not running. So, previously API unit was listening at `7250` and `7270` port but it was not getting any `device connected` response since those message were sent on `7150` and `7170` ports.

I will try to figure out much better way to log the proper error message in case client is using wrong port. Thanks for troubleshooting.
 Read this https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/2.0.0/doc/API.md and use 2.0.0 branch 
 Without STF logs, I cant interpret anything.
  To use ldap, you will need to start you stf-auth unit using ldap settings. You can find ldap related options using `stf auth-ldap --help` command. After reconfiguration restart you `stf-auth` unit.

In case you are using `stf local` then check ldap related options using `stf local --help`
 or check https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/47
 Duplicate of https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/47
  No, but then again I have not researched this topic very well.

 That is very interesting. I was under the impression that the images were all signed and could therefore not be modified. This would at the very least require an unlocked bootloader, right?

```  I don't think it's possible to root all or even most devices from STF. Many
devices require you to unlock the bootloader, and then install a custom
recovery. This requires physical interaction on the device. In some cases,
like HTC, you may even have to register on their website to get an unlock
code. I have an HTC One M8 and had to do that.

If we somehow managed to do that, we would still lose ADB access to the
device since the ADB keys reset, and USB debugging is off by default
anyway. And, by resetting the phone with rooted firmware, before you even
get to settings to turn USB debugging on, you'd have to deal with the
initial prompts about setting up wifi, your name, google account etc.

It might be possible for some devices, as long as you don't have to erase
the user partition, but I don't think it's really worth it. It would be a
HUGE maintenance cost and a never ending source of issues.

Feel free to try to implement it yourself, though :)

   :+1: 
  Like the README says, you have to build from master if you want Android 6.0 support. We're trying to release a new version as soon as we have time.
  I don't think those instructions are correct specially `installation` part.

If you are installation stf globally using `npm install -g stf`. You don't need to do `npm install` again.
Just skip the second step. You already install stf in `npm install -g stf` command.

Go to the step 3 and run stf app
 Also, if you are using Virtual box, you won't be able to see devices until and unless you use [usbfilters](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#idp46608643879360)

BTW, what host OS are you on? Windows? Mac? or something else?
 well, ideally it should work if you are using Virtual Box. Installation will go smooth. The only problem will be filtering usb devices in Virtual box every time you add new one.

Other way you can try is by installing some linux OS on bare metal by making hard disk partition. This will give you real Linux OS instead of VM.
 we cannot figure out the problem if you don't provide us error log or other important information regarding your setup.
 If the installation doesn't show any errors, it could be that you're
hitting a known bug in npm 2. Try running npm rebuild zmq OR upgrade to
latest node 5.x (that comes with npm 3).

  Which version of Android was the device running? If 5.1, there's a good chance that STF 2.2.0 fixed the issue.
  @drogjh 
Can you provide more info about your problem.
  You need to give more details or no one can help. Also, please don't mention me directly asking for help, maybe someone else will answer.
- Are you trying to add a device to STF via `adb connect`, or are you using the `adb connect` remote debugging functionality?
- If you're using remote debugging, are you running the `adb connect` command on the same machine where STF is running, or a different one?
- Where do you see the `offline` status? Perhaps by running `adb devices`?
  This PR implements RESTful APIs for STF which will make possible to use STF for test automation.
Detailed discussion can be seen [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/38)

In order to implement APIs, I did following things.
- Created a new api unit
- Used [swagger](http://swagger.io/) to define apis
- Moved all the current apis in app unit to new api unit
- Authorisation using accessToken which can be creating from STF UI. Refer (https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/190)

API Documentation can be found [here](http://vbanthia.github.io/angular-swagger-ui/)
### How to use these API's for test automation?

Basic idea behind test automation is by using STF's remote debugging feature. By this feature you can remotely connect STF device to you machine(client). [More about this feature](https://github.com/openstf/stf/wiki/%5Ben%5D-Remote-Debug)
### How to connect device
1. Get all the devices using `GET /devices/` endpoint. You can also use `fields` query parameter to get only useful information such as `GET /devices?fields=owner,ready`. You can filter the usable device by filtering devices whose `owner==null`
2. Next step will be to request a usable device from STF server. You can do this by sending a POST request to `/user/devices` endpoint with `serial` in request body. Since this request is going to be asynchronous, STF will return you a polling URL. You can use this polling url to check if device is added into your devices (group).
3. Once device is added into your devices(`/user/devices`). You can ask STF server to start remote debugging using `POST /user/devices/{serial}/remoteConnect` endpoint. This will again return a polling url like `/user/devices/{serial}`. You can check if remoteConnect is finished by `GET /user/devices/{serial}?fields=remoteConnect`. If it is true, you can get `remoteDebugUrl` from device information i.e `/user/devices/{serial}?fields=remoteDebugUrl`. After getting this url you can use this url for remote connection and then you can run most of the automated test such as appium, calabash etc.
4. Once test are over, don't forget to disconnect remote debug and release the device by `DELETE /user/devices/{serial}/remoteConnect` and `DELETE /user/devices/{serial}`
 I'm not really a fan of the pollingUrl thing. I understand the reason why it's there but it just feels clumsy. Also, although it kind of works in this case, we will eventually need other endpoints that need to receive replies in real time. For example we could have an endpoint to run a shell command, and return the output to the caller. So, I think it would be worth it to attempt to at least partially decide a method to deal with situations like that here and now.

In this case, since we're dealing with a non-transaction message, I would suggest at least trying something like this:
1. Start listening to GroupJoin messages on the global channel.
2. Send the message just like you're doing it now.
3. Set a timeout for a reasonable value. I think 5 seconds is perfectly fine if the system is healthy.
4. If we hit the timeout, return some HTTP failure code. I'm not sure which one right now. _Maybe_ 504 Gateway timeout.
5. Meanwhile, keep checking every GroupJoin message that comes in.
6. If a GroupJoin arrives with the correct serial number, compare the owner.
   - If the owner does not match the one the API request was made for, someone else took it and we should return an error code.
   - Otherwise, if the owner matches, that's a success. Then it's up for debate whether we should immediately return the device data, or require one more request to the device data endpoint.
   - In either case, clear the failure timeout.
7. Stop listening to GroupJoin messages.

If starting/stopping the listeners is difficult because of the router, I would perhaps suggest having the listener always on in the app scope (not per request). Create another EventEmitter that's accessible by both the router callback and the request handler. In the router callback, simply emit the received event in whatever format is convenient. You still need to make sure you do `.on()` and `.removeListener()` in the request handler, but you won't have to mess with the router which should make it easier.
 Update after Review
- Removed nested code
- Removed pollingUrl and made all the api synchronous using 5 second timer
- Typo fixes
 Finished writing documentation. Merging this into 2.0.0 since its getting too big.
 Some people are complaining, but I am still not able to reproduce this. Can you tell me how are you making requests? Through browser or through command line?

First try to make request through browser itself to check if you are using proper branch. After login open `http://localhost:7100/api/v1/swagger.json` url. In case if it is still redirecting, please post STF logs and chrome dev tool's network tab screenshot.

For command line usage, refer this doc - https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/2.0.0/doc/API.md
  Any chance you could provide a test `.apk` file that fails?

I've been suspecting for a while now that the installation may be losing an initial chunk of data, but I've never been able to reproduce it myself. I've seen it happen a few times in the error logs, and yours may or may not be one of those cases. I've checked the code quite a few times in the past, but I haven't seen any obvious spot where it could happen. If the same file works when someone else is trying to use it, possibly on a local STF installation, then that's most likely what's happening. If it doesn't work locally either, then it should be something fairly easy to fix.
  Are you running npm as root, or perhaps with sudo? Because NPM doesn't like
when you do that.

 It should work now, but you should run `npm update jpeg-turbo` in your stf repo first to make sure it gets v0.3.2 instead of v0.3.1.

By the way my XU4 is 100% silent now, and runs at 40-50° when idle, and between 60-75° when doing heavier things. If you max out all 8 cores with `stress --cpu 8` it does go above 95° after a minute or two, though. I'll keep trying different cooling options, but I think this one's already pretty good for our purposes.

Thanks for reporting the issue!
  This feature allow user to generate an access token. Using that token users will be able to access STF API.

UI looks like this.

 You cannot use it now. This PR is a subtask for implementing APIs. 
 Could you add an initial version of an express middleware to do the API auth? Currently it's LGTM if you address the expiry thing, but since the token is not actually being checked anywhere, I'm a little worried that we might be missing something that would otherwise be obvious if there was an implementation.
 You can check the API auth here in swagger branch.

adb -s DEVICE_SERIAL shell am start -a android.intent.action.MAIN -n com.android.settings/.Settings
```
 Did you run that command in the server machine(where device is connected and stf is running) or some where else?

Since, STF can access the devices `device not found` error is bit weird.

Please do following things
1. Post stf logs when you click setting button
2. Open settings app manually in the device and run following command and post outputs here.

```
adb -s DEVICE_SERIAL shell dumpsys window windows | grep -E 'mCurrentFocus|mFocusedApp'
```

Don't forget to run command in the machine where it is connected.
  Duplicate of #83.
 Could you give more details about your use case. With current information, we are not getting anything.
  Thanks for reporting the bug.

It will be fixed once this [PR](https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/186) is merged.
 Hi! 
Thanks for your feedback, definitely we welcome contributions.

About the Appium integration, there is some discussion about the test automation, check [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/38). This has chances of being implemented soon-ish.

As for iOS support, you can check [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/64). This has less chances of happening anytime soon, however any contribution would be appreciated.

The "Save Screenshot" behaviour you mention is a known bug and we'll fix it asap (actually its the first time we hear of someone actually using this feature).

Honestly I don't remember of us talking to any Testobject employee, but it may be just bad memory ;)
  Theoretically it should work until and unless you are not adding a new OS level dependency and using latest kernels and docker.

You may get npm installation error sometime in that case just try rebuilding.

If you not able to build image by your own then you can also use cloud services to build docker image such as docker hub.
  No, STF isn't designed to work with emulators. It's because they don't use
SurfaceFlinger for rendering like real devices. It might be possible to
make some emulators work, but I don't think it's worth the time and effort.

If you have a compelling use case, feel free to let us know.

  Merging to openstf/adbkit#41.
  Once we add minify support, minifying should do it.

However we had problems with UglifyJS and annotations in the past, so we disabled it for the moment.

The way to do it is to use [ng-anotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate) + UglifyJS.
It should be done only on `gulp build`
 The file includes source maps and other debugging information. For us it
wasn't really a problem since everything was in the local network anyway.
You should be able to get it to around 500KB by tweaking webpack options
(and doing the stupid angular thing).

 Have you produced any solution about this issue?  Aren't sensor API's Read Only or listeners. What I mean is you can detect a shake in your device using these sensors. You cannot create them. You cannot make device tilt left. 

Do you know any way to create these motions using adb or some hidden apis?

One way will be to design the device rack which can shake and tilt devices.
 It is possible, for example there's [SensorSimulator](https://code.google.com/p/openintents/wiki/SensorSimulator) even though it's very old now. I'm pretty sure there was something a bit newer too, but I can't find it right now. Personally I haven't spent much time looking into what it does, but I suspect it just uses DDMS. I've often thought about having a 3d model of the device (or more likely just an extruded rectangle) in the UI which you could then drag to change sensor values. Seems like a lot of work, though.
  Well, I don't think the problem is with rethinkdb. Because client never access database directly.

Regarding 

> "Device database does not have a match for device xxx"

This error means that the device which are using is not present in [STF Database](https://github.com/openstf/stf-device-db)

The grey screen problem is because client is not able to make websocket connection. `stf local` uses port range between 7400 ~ 7700 for these connections. Can you check if these ports are open? 

Better way to debug this problem is by using chrome developer tool and check what kind of error are you getting in WebSocket connections.
 > Do you mean the ports on PC which running the stf local?

Yeah I meant that.

Btw, What kind of proxy are you using? Can you give me more details.

In general, client will make two connection with server. One at 7100 port which is okay in your case since you can see web app. The other connection is for screen. STF will choose a port between 7400 ~ 7700 and then your client will establish a websocket connection to see device screen. Make sure that you can access these port while using proxy from your client.
 You can also change port range by providing `--provider-min-port` & `--provider-max-port` options while running `stf local`
 Closing this issue assuming problem is fixed, since the reporter has not reported any progress.

Feel free to reopen this issue if you face similar problem.
  Is `stf local` running on the same machine as Android Studio?

Have you confirmed your ADB key in the STF UI?
 Do both users have unique ADB keys? Are both of them verified?
 Does his computer work with normal remote adb ('adb tcpip 5555' & adb
connect ip-of-device)?

 @sorccu 
Currently, two users cannot have same ADB keys. But I think we should allow users to share keys.

A valid use case is when you will use STF APIs for test automation. For example, if you are running test from Jenkins slave using access token that Jenkins slave machine can be shared by many users.
 Allow how? How would we know who's trying to use it then?
 yeah, that we will need to figure it out. But I just realised that there will be use cases where user will be sharing adb-keys. I cannot think any good solution for now, but will keep this in mind.
 I think GitHub deploy keys behave in a very similar way. Each deploy key for every repository must be unique, since that's the only way they can know which repository it's for. And yes, it is super, super annoying with CI, but since even GitHub hasn't been able to solve that issue, it could be that it simply cannot be solved without modifying ADB's authentication mechanism, which would require modifying the adb binaries themselves, or tunneling the whole connection somehow (which wouldn't actually be bad for security with something like openssh, but would complicate usage).
 GitHub can and does partially solve the issue by providing alternate ways to authenticate (like personal access tokens), but since we're stuck with what the adb binary gives us right now, we can't do the same.
 yeah, this will be difficult.

And for problem with shared machine(Jenkins Slave) we can advise user to use access token of "bot" user instead of their own. And use same bot user for tests targeting on that machine.
  Well, this is a known bug which is already fixed in master branch. Looks like you have installed stf using npm and npm latest version is pretty old compare to master branch. Refer: https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/117

You have two choices.
1 Add 'present' index manually in devices table
- Go to rethinkdb administrative UI (http://localhost:8080)
- Open Data Explorer
- Add index using query 

``` js
 r.db("stf").table("devices").indexCreate('present');
```
- Make sure your device table should look like below, check using this query.

```
r.db("stf").table("devices").info();
```

Output

``` json
{  
   "db":{  
      "id":"7195ff75-7ddf-49b5-99e9-64cebbd75da8",
      "name":"stf",
      "type":"DB"
   },
   "doc_count_estimates":[  
      0
   ],
   "id":"e4363c74-eaa3-42b6-b4d7-f019caed0bf6",
   "indexes":[  
      "owner",
      "present",
      "providerChannel"
   ],
   "name":"devices",
   "primary_key":"serial",
   "type":"TABLE"
}
```

2 Use master branch

You can find instruction [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/149#issuecomment-150489725)
 Most probably the problem is related to [this rethinkdb bug](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4694). I am now able to reproduce this with rethinkdb < 2.1.3

These are my findings with different rethinkdb versions.

2.1.1 - X
2.1.3 - O
2.1.4 - O
2.1.5 - O

The problem is because indexes in devices tables are being created parallel and only the last one is actually being created.
 Problem occurs only with older `rethinkdb`.

Now, you can run stf doctor command in order to confirm all the stf dependencies.
  > which makes me confused to understand difference between stf local and actual deployment.

STF is a distributed application which means it is supposed to be run on a cluster of computers in production environment instead of a single machine. stf local feature is developed just for development purpose. You are not supposed to use it in production environment.

In order to deploy STF app in production, you will need
1. A cluster of computers where you can connect your devices
2. A tool which can deploy, stf docker container in the cluster

There are many ways to do this but [STF's Deployment doc](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md) suggests, [CoreOS + Fleet combination](https://coreos.com/). CoreOS is to make cluster and Fleet is run STF services inside cluster.

I highly recommend you to go through all the [CoreOS documentation](https://coreos.com/docs/) even if you don't plan to use CoreOS because that will give you an idea about computer cluster. After you finish reading these docs and if you reread the deployment doc, you will automatically understand everything.

> Do i need to install all the requirements explicitly on my ubuntu machine including rethinkdb ?

No, you do not need to install any thing on your ubuntu machine. All the required dependencies are already installed in docker image. You should consider reading [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) regarding how docker works.

>  including rethinkdb ?

There are many ways you can create database (rethinkdb) cluster. You can use or not use docker, its totally your choice. https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/163 might helps.
 Well, this is a known bug which is already fixed in master branch. Looks like you have installed stf using npm and npm latest version is pretty old compare to master branch.

}
```

2 Use master branch

You can find instruction [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/149#issuecomment-150489725)
 nice!
 @romitincedoinc 

Can you tell, which rethinkdb version you were using?
  This should be fixed in the master branch. See #138 for details.
  Because that's not how containers are supposed to work (although I'll admit that it is an almost religious issue). There should be only one process (+ possible worker processes) per container. You could argue that we should just put both of them inside the same container and use supervisor or something else to manage them, but I would just reply that you're doing it wrong, i.e. the _Virtual Machine_ way, not the _container_ way, so don't waste your time.

Also, having the DB and the app on the same server is not a proper, scalable deployment.

The [deployment guide](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md) provides some examples. It's a bit heavy, yes, but it's meant to be that way.
 #122 might also help if you're not using docker for RethinkDB.
  Merging to openstf/adbkit#41.
  People always ask this, it's because you don't have GraphicsMagick
installed, or it's not in your PATH.

 Yeah, but if you get the `Error: spawn gm ENOENT` error it means GraphicsMagick is not installed. Otherwise it works fine, there has never been any other reason for broken images yet.
 Closing this issue as this is not the problem of this project. If you follow the README and install all the dependencies as per instructions, screenshot feature should be working properly.
  @vbanthia is correct.

Alternatively you can use an SSH tunnel, `socat` or some other way to make the port accessible.

For example you could run this command on the app server where `stf local` is running:

``` bash
ssh user@server -L 5037:127.0.0.1:5037
```

.. which makes the remote ADB server available on the same port on the app server. You wouldn't even need to use `--adb-host`. `adb forward` still wouldn't work globally, though. For that, the modified adb command is the simplest solution.
  We're using webpack and gulp for building.

First run `gulp clean` to get rid of the `build` directory.

After that, just running `stf local` will take care of rebuilding on the fly any front-end asset with webpack.
 @LiufxLucky365 if you want to develop you're supposed to use code from github, not from npm.
Grab your stf from https://github.com/openstf/stf.git
  Thanks!
  That's because the URL is http://localhost:7100 just like the README says.
 Are you following the README exactly? If not, you need to post every single command you ran, starting from `git clone`, or we can't help.
 Great!
  Look, just do it EXACTLY like the README tells you to do. Your setup looks like you did something way, way different. For OS X there's even a oneliner that installs all the dependencies (as long as you've got homebrew installed).
 Can you post at least the version of your software and also how you installed `node/npm`?

```
node -v 
npm -v 
brew -v
sw_vers
```
 Seriously, if you need to install from source, this is all you need to do:

``` bash
brew install rethinkdb graphicsmagick zeromq protobuf yasm pkg-config
git clone https://github.com/openstf/stf.git
cd stf
npm install
```

Now open a new shell and start rethinkdb with:

``` bash
# run in the "stf" folder
rethinkdb
```

If it complains that port 8080 is already being used, try:

``` bash
# run in the "stf" folder
rethinkdb --http-port 8090
```

And then simply:

``` bash
# run in the "stf" folder
bin/stf local
```

Or if you don't want to type `bin/stf` all the time:

``` bash
# run in the "stf" folder
npm link
```

And now you can run this from anywhere:

``` bash
stf local
```
 Sounds like your installation failed. Please follow the instructions in the README exactly. Alternatively, network errors during installation can break the it.
  @vbanthia researched this a bit in #166. Any chance you could attempt to verify his findings?
 @neofreko any update on the above?
 Closing this PR as problem was in `rethinkdb`. Above problem will occur if you are using rethinkdb < 2.13

Now, you can run `stf doctor` command in order to confirm all the stf dependencies. 
  I just tried this and it's 100% awesome. One thing though, the input seems to have slight transparency to it - depending on the columns you have active the positioning kind of makes it look like the column on the left on the previous row is the input placeholder value. It's a bit confusing. I would suggest dropping the transparency.

<img width="445" alt="screen shot 2015-11-14 at 4 08 09 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/32509/11162549/ff7463ae-8ae9-11e5-8bc3-8e03e42b7f67.png">
 LGTM for merging if you fix the transparency thing.
 @sorccu 

The transparency problem is only with "device-not-usable" class. Since you are using fake-devices thats why you are having this problem. As you can see [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/res/app/device-list/device-list.css#L12) opacity for this class is being set as 0.8. And in css when you change opacity, it also changes maximum opacity for all the child elements. So even I set opacity for device note form, it will be only 0.8

Possible solutions:
1. Don't make it as child of table row (which will be too messy)
2. Instead of changing opacity, use something else to show device is not usable for "device-not-usable" class

Do you know any better solution?
 Could not come up with a great solution. Added a work around in commit https://github.com/vbanthia/stf/commit/d3c8d3d0f6e0890dd0bd863c68e772de0bee62f2. Using light gray font color in case of "device-not-available" class instead of opacity. This will solve the transparency problem.

![screen shot 2015-11-14 at 20 14 12](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7875161/11163297/b3ccbbcc-8b0c-11e5-891b-ffb59f9fc21b.png)
 IMO that's a good solution, in fact per row opacity might potentially have been slowing down the rendering of the list a little. And I'm not actually using fake devices, I have a whole bunch of them but I mostly keep only one or two connected since I don't have a proper shelf at home (yet!).
 Looks good to me, feel free to merge with or without fixing that last nitpick of mine.
 Thanks, merging it.
  If you follow the README it will work just fine.
 Yeeeeah nope. It's all in the README. Good luck though.
  It's in the README. Just clone the repo and start from https://github.com/openstf/stf#building.
  Cannot reproduce.

Tried with:
- Windows 7 (Version 6.1.7601)
- Chrome 46.0.2490.80 m (Latest)
- IE 10.0.9200

On Chrome I was able to see English or any language without problems. 
IE also worked (at least the device list works fine; controlling the device has a bug so it doesn't).

Can you post a screenshot? Is your Windows edition special or somehow have some different font settings? Do you have an `adblocker`?
Try with disabling all the extensions in Chrome.
 One of my colleague also had the same problem in his windows machine, I don't know his environment details. But he fixed this problem by enabling DirectWrite flag for chrome.

These are the instructions to enable DirectWrite flag. http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/chrome-font-rendering-windows/
 Couldn't reproduce with neither toggling DirectWrite nor ClearType on Windows 7.
It could be the GPU, GPU drivers or ad-blocking.

@Tierney0115 can you try disabling all Chrome extensions?
 @Tierney0115 did you deleted Lato from the CSS or from your system fonts?
 @Tierney0115 which one? CSS or system fonts?
  The problem with remote debugging and proxying/load balancing is that the
only thing that uniquely identifies a device is the ip:port pair. "adb
connect" doesn't even send the hostname it's trying to connect to to the
server (i.e. there's nothing like the "Host" HTTP header). Therefore your
load balancer either needs to have as many ip addresses assigned to it as
you have devices, or you have to open a separate port for each device.
Also, ADB doesn't support IPv6. So while it's possible, it would be very
complex.

 I think he wants to expose all devices via a single address, so that he
only needs to make the load balancer accessible.

  You're right. This was caused by #104, although only on some platforms (by mac and boot2docker were both perfectly fine). I've pushed a fix and the latest docker image should solve the issue. You can check #104 for more details.
 By the way, if you use docker, your host system doesn't need to have zeromq installed. It's included in the docker image.
  You're right, this is caused by a relatively recent change (well, ~2-3 months) to the way ports are passed to the workers.
 This should now be fixed.
 Yes I know. I believe it's a bug in our code. Overall I'm not very happy with the provider unit right now, it needs a rewrite.
 I would look into why the workers are restarting so much in the first place. It's possible that there's still a bug in our code, but if you encounter the bug after only 1 day, then the workers must be dying practically all the time. I'm pretty sure you said you were using an ODROID-XU4, but it's difficult to say anything without precise details about your system. You should tell us everything about your power adapter, the development board, the OS it's running, the output from `uname -a`, whether you're using a USB hub (and if so, which hub and which power adapter), and the USB cables you're using.
 I'm not at home right now but I'm on Arch Linux and I'm pretty sure the kernel version is 3.10.92 or something. You might want to look into updating the kernel, there are USB-related fixes in basically every release. I'm also running Linux [4.2](http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:xu4_building_kernel) on one of my other XU4s. It took about 10 minutes to crosscompile on a quad core i7 from 2014 or so. So far I have not done extensive testing with the newer kernel, but I would definitely give it a try given the amount of problems you have. Hardkernel will also attempt to provide Linux 4.4 once it becomes stable.
 I only have a single Android 6.0 device, a Nexus 9. It's running perfectly on my Arch Linux XU4, and it's connected directly to one of the USB 3 ports.

While we should certainly make sure that the `--screen-port` problem doesn't occur at all, getting the error means that the worker is dying practically all the time. Even if the error was fixed, the device would be practically unusable, since it would just die in the middle of a user session. Usually it indicates a weak USB connection, or that one of the services the worker requires isn't working properly. Even if you see the devices with `adb devices`, they could be losing connectivity momentarily.

I would suggest doing the following on the problematic provider:
1. Run `nc localhost 5037`
2. Write `0012host:track-devices`, hit enter and keep watching
3. Start the STF provider on that machine, and save the log output somewhere
4. If you start getting output from track-devices often, it means that some devices are getting dropped on ADB level. This could also be caused by bad socket handling on our side, causing ADB to reset the connection, though.

If it doesn't seem to work, I would need to see the whole log from the start, all the way from `stf provider ...` to until you start getting the `--screen-port` error. For an even more informative log, you can try setting the DEBUG environment variable to `*`, like this: `DEBUG=* stf provider ...`. You can find my email address in my profile if you'd rather send it privately.

You can also try running ADB with `ADB_TRACE=all adb start-server` to get more output from ADB side. You'll get a huge amount of information, though.

Anyway without proper logs I can only take random guesses, since it's working fine for me.

I would definitely try updating the kernel too. It's a relatively low effort thing to do, and might actually end up fixing the issue.
 Note that I don't necessarily mean that there's a bug in the Linux kernel. However, many USB devices/chips have vendor or even device specific workarounds hardcoded in the kernel. Since Linux 3.10 is originally from 2013, it could be that it simply doesn't have the necessary workarounds for your hardware. And then your Android 6.0 devices are somehow causing the issues to appear, that may otherwise have been fixed in newer kernels.
 It's usually caused by manufacturer modifications of the private Android APIs minicap uses. I'm not sure if that's what happening in this case, I would have to see the logs. Anyway, it seems to mostly happen on Chinese devices, for some reason. Perhaps they like to customize their ROMs more. For other devices, I would say that overall less than 1% have this problem. Usually, fixing a problem on one device from the same manufacturer makes all other devices from that manufacturer work too, but there have been some exceptions.

Fortunately, though, it's usually possible to find some kind of a workaround for almost any device. However, it's almost impossible to do it without having access to the device. Furthermore, temporary access is not usually enough. If we lose access to a device, then it might stop working again at some point since we can't test it anymore.

Since the project is open source, we don't have the money to buy every device in the world. If you'd really like to get these devices working, consider becoming a [hardware sponsor](https://github.com/openstf/stf#sponsors-wanted).
  Check `stf local --help` and `stf auth-mock --help`.
  Added some comments, can you take a look? Might have more comments later
 No need for a new PR, just update your branch and the changes will show up here.
 I made some changes in https://github.com/openstf/stf/tree/hogehoge-banana-s3insteadoftmp. I don't have S3 set up, can you check that it still works?
  Authentication is provided by small, separate web apps. Use one of the units in https://github.com/openstf/stf/tree/master/lib/units/auth as an example and make your own. And since they're separate apps, as long as yours does the same thing (forwards to STF with a signed JWT token in query parameters), it doesn't even need to be written in JS. Use the source code as your guide.
  I'm not completely sure what you mean, but if you're using a remote device, the remote address _is_ the serial as far as ADB/STF are concerned. So, in your case it would be `"172.18.176.103:5555"`.

By the way using remote devices with STF is not recommended. The ADB remote protocol is very slow, it will be many times slower than just using USB directly.
 Ok, well, knowing that is actually kind of tricky... it's because there are several independent components that update the device information, and whether a device is usable or not depends on several different pieces of information. The only parts in the system that know the full state of a device are a) the client browser, and b) the device worker itself. So, you have to implement the same logic in your system.

The logic is here: https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/res/app/components/stf/device/device-service.js#L56
 No. Everything inside the `res` folder runs on the client side only.
 Why can you not just use the code I linked? All the parameters (except
"using") are available in the database...

 The JSON you posted contains the `present`, `status`, `ready` and `owner` fields. You can therefore do the equivalent of  `data.usable = data.present && data.status === 3 && data.ready && (!data.owner || data.using)` in your own code, in any language (although you'll have to remove the "using" condition since there's no property for it).
 Just read the data from the database like you did earlier. You can use
RethinkDB changefeeds (https://rethinkdb.com/docs/changefeeds/javascript/)
to watch for updates in realtime.

 - `owner` is null when no one is using a device, otherwise an object describing the owner
- `ready` is true if STF has finished initializing the device (i.e. when you see the "Fully operational" message in the logs)
- `present` is supposed to be true if the device is physically connected to the system. HOWEVER, it can also be false if a device stops sending a heartbeat message to the system for some reason (like process death) even if the device is still physically connected. For example, if a device shuts down, it will still be physically connected but the system won't know about it, so it'll have `present: false`. If the system starts receiving heartbeat messages from that device again, then it's set to `present: true` again.
- `status` is one of https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/wire/wire.proto#L159. `OFFLINE` is different from `present`, if a device is `OFFLINE` it usually means that the ADB connection is either still being initialized or could not be established. If a device stays `OFFLINE` for a long time, it usually means that the system doesn't have enough resources to handle that many USB devices, or that there is not enough power available.
  We recommend systemd for that.
  We just modify the DB directly since RethinkDB is pretty easy to use and
the notes almost never change. It will become editable if someone
implements it, personally I don't have time for it right now.

The original intention was to show which ones of our devices had
carrier billing accounts available.

  Dear all,

I've been exploring and wondering how to remove those devices that we know we'll no longer be using for testing in our STF interfaces. How could we remove their log from the app in order to clear and update the interface with the used and existing devices?

Many thanks,

Marco
 Hi,

You have to open the RethinkDB admin UI, usually localhost:8080. Go to the
data explorer and run:

``` js
r.db('stf').table('devices').get('SERIAL').delete()
```

Where SERIAL is the device serial (you can toggle it on in the detailed
device list).

 Thank you very much, @sorccu ! It worked perfectly. It's amazing to continue learning and developing with this beautiful tool STF is.
  With environment variables: https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/db/index.js#L16
 If it's server-side code, then yes.

 Yes, it's being used all the time because that's what the official deployment guide uses (although docker sets the environment variable). My best guess is that your firewall is blocking that port. Might want to check your iptables, ipfw or similar.
  In general all Android-based systems like MIUI, Amazon's Fire OS, CyanogenMod etc. are fully supported (with the exception of Firefox OS). However, because we use private APIs behind the scenes, some individual models don't work. I don't have an EMUI device to test with right now so I can't say anything about that, but I know that all versions of MIUI work fine. For example, I have a Redmi Note 2, Meizu M2 Note, and a ZTE V5 PRO right here, and they all work just fine.

However, I believe Redmi Hongmi is one of the phones that does not work right now, so if that's the one you tried, perhaps try something else instead.

Also, by "failing to connect" I assume you are getting some kind of errors in the logs. Could you perhaps post the logs here? Feel free to remove any identifying information first, though.
  Thank you!
  The UI is not functional yet, we're working on it.
  I am aware of this bug, but have never been able to reproduce it myself. Anyway it should be easily solvable for doing an `indexWait()` in `migrate`. Are you using an HDD or an SSD on that machine?
 This should be fixed now, in 66fbadbd5d3ba39d4ae38d73cc8159ec521ddc9b. Commit message was cut short because the ticket number accidentally went on a new line, and because it began with a #, it became a comment.
  It's our own design, but we had it made at a company that specializes in making office furniture/design. We're planning on open sourcing the design as well, but I haven't had time to clean up the plans yet. The original ticket is #1, so I'm closing this one as a duplicate for now.
 If you _really_ need to buy one directly, I could probably have one made for you, but it would be very expensive. I'd have to think about it a bit more, but we're talking somewhere around $2000-3000 for a single shelf that houses 50-56 devices. Shipping would be very expensive as well. And that's without PCs, hubs, switches and cables.
  Yeah, that's the way to do it right now. As a side note, we need to work on the `--help` output, many of the descriptions are not actually very helpful to beginners right now.
  Is it possible that your zeromq library might be super old? 3.x or 4.x should work fine.
 If you're on Ubuntu 12.04, they only seem to have an old version available. On newer versions you should be using libzmq3-dev (or similar on different distributions). While we could catch and ignore the exception thrown by the old version, I'm not sure if we care enough about supporting ancient software.
 The keepalive options have now been made optional, so this should be "fixed" as well. However, what I said earlier still stands. Ubuntu 12.04 is simply too old, we're not going to spend much time fixing it.
  Build from master, 1.0.10 isn't compatible yet.

 Duplicate of #105.
  The protobufjs update breaks something when a decide is connected. Will look into it later.
 Old, blocking change is in #120
  It already works, but you have to build from master or use the :latest tag
if you're using docker.

  Nice, but it seems kind of annoying to have to call a separate method every time you want to create a socket. I would perhaps prefer something like this:

``` js
var push = zmqutil.socket('push')
```

instead of

``` js
var push = zmq.socket('push')
zmqutil.setTCPSocketOpts(push)
```

and then zmqutil would be:

``` js
module.exports.socket = function() {
  var sock = zmq.socket.apply(zmq, arguments)
  sock.setsockopt(zmq.ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE, 1)
  sock.setsockopt(zmq.ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE, 300)
  return sock
}
```
 Looks good to me, but I'll have to run it first to make sure things still work. Will merge tonight.
 One thing: there may be some unused `require('zmq')` calls left behind now since almost everything uses zmqutil.
 Thanks!
 Turns out this breaks at least on latest stable CoreOS when using `--net host` with docker. We also have a separate report of the same thing in #139. It looks like the value for ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE doesn't make sense, but pending further investigation I have simply made the keepalive options optional in 8e8f2d17b7.

Now you have to export or set environment variables to get the functionality:

```
ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE=1 ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=300 stf local
```

or

```
docker run \
  -e ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=1 \
  -e ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=300 \
  openstf/stf:latest stf triproxy ...
```

**EDIT: Timeouts are in seconds. Reduced value form 30000 to 300. The value is just an example, try a lower value if needed.**
 Yeah, but it looks like ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE actually does this:

> ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE: Override TCP_KEEPCNT (or TCP_KEEPALIVE on some OS)

and then

> TCP_KEEPCNT (since Linux 2.4) The maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the connection. This option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

That seems kind of different than we want. Looks like these seems more appropriate:

>        The time (in seconds) the connection needs to remain idle
>        before TCP starts sending keepalive probes, if the socket

 Yeah, seems to be that way: https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/commit/d9f32611adcb2a3c2c46748b16056def10391192

Either way, it looks the the values for `setsockopt()` are supposed to be seconds, not milliseconds.
  It's because you didn't install GraphicsMagick. You need to have all the requirements installed or it's not going to work.
 Well, technically you can use method you want, as long as the `gm` binary can be found in your `$PATH`.
  Yes, see [doc/DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md).
  It will take time to review this PR because it is so big.
 Getting a `WARNING: Tried to load angular more than once.`
Be sure to not include angular again since its already in the global namespace.
 I think I would do something like this instead of polling every minute. It's not necessarily the best way though. Also, make sure to read all the way to the end.
1. Add `lib/units/device/plugins/reserve.js`
2. In there, start listening for a `ReserveUpdateMessage`, and send a `ReserveUpdateRequestMessage` when the device worker loads (just a sample name)
3. `processor` receives it, loads the full schedule for that device from the database, and a `ReserveUpdateMessage` back to the device with the details
4. The device worker wait for the nearest reservation, if any.
   - By either setting a timeout for the nearest job - 10s, and then kicking out whoever is using the device (if anyone) and make the scheduled user the owner, `setTimeout()` isn't super accurate so it should trigger a bit earlier (and it won't do much harm)
   - OR perhaps instead of `setTimeout`, always have a `setInterval` running in the background in the device process (perhaps checked once per minute). When the callback triggers, check the internal state if the next reservation is closer than the next internal. If so, kick out current user and make the scheduled user the owner.
5. If a new reservation is made, send a new `ReserveUpdateMessage` with the full schedule to the device channel
   - Update internal in-memory state
   - Clear `setTimeout` or `setInterval`, run a check immediately, and set up new timers

Step 5 could be made easier if we handled messages from the application side in the processor. That way you could just send a tiny message to the processor and it would load and send a full `ReserveUpdateMessage` to the device channel. However since it's not possible right now, what you'd probably have to do is to create the full `ReserveUpdateMessage` in the `websocket` or `app` unit, and then send it as-is to the processor.

HOWEVER, I like having the reservation functionality completely separate from the device process like it is in your patch (reaper style). It makes it easier to manage. It would be best if you could adapt the steps in your `scheduler` unit instead. You could then even use RethinkDB's `.watch()` in the `scheduler` unit to load schedule changes in real time, and send `ReserveUpdateMessage` to appropriate devices when necessary. That you you wouldn't necessarily have to send a separate message from the `websocket` or `app` unit to the `scheduler` unit, it would automatically see all changes.
  Haven't seen this problem before, but like you said we only use OS X for development. Please keep us updated if you find a solution.
 Great, thanks for doing the research! I can say that we have never had this exact same problem, but then again we've only used CoreOS so far, which I suppose may have different defaults. It would be great if others could verify that your solution works for them.

Furthermore, it sounds like it would be good to add the options to all ZMQ sockets, not just the subscriptions. I will look into adding your suggested patches into the application code, but it may take a while since I am somewhat busy right now. I would be happy to accept a pull request, though.
  You'd have to take the auth-mock service unit and modify it with LDAP options. You can check `stf auth-ldap --help` or #47 for guidance. I'm closing this one as a duplicate of #47 for now.
  Yes, but due to ADB USB protocol overhead, it's super slow and unreliable. It's because the protocol sucks and not something we can really fix. When running locally, you can use `stf local --allow-remote`, but then you will not be able to use the demote debugging functionality, as STF would confuse the fake device with a real one and try to set it up, but get confused because the same device is connected twice.
  Because you're getting a HTTP 502 error, it means that your request arrived to nginx, but it was unable to connect to the backend server. The backend server in this case being `stf-storage-plugin-apk`. Either your nginx.conf is wrong, or you don't don't have `stf-storage-plugin-apk@.service` running.
 Looks like you forgot to replace the storage URL somewhere. It's trying to connect to `stf.example.org`.

All command line options are in `lib/cli.js`. The `--save-dir` command line argument translates to the saveDir option in JS code. But it doesn't look like you are having problems with the upload. It seems to me it's uploading just fine, but then when it tries to access the manifest via the apk plugin you hit that error.
  You have to build and install the latest master. NPM has not been updated yet.
 I know that at least emulators don't work, since they don't expose any linux touch devices. It should be doable but we haven't really focused on that. Not planned currently unless someone convinces us.
  Good catch. Unfortunately it looks like pull-left might break the layout of the dropdown:

<img width="146" alt="screen shot 2015-09-28 at 10 49 33 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/32509/10137184/40fffa26-6633-11e5-953f-ddf053e2f484.png">
 I'm not sure if I get it, why are you running npm link every time? To compile the client-side JS?
 It uses the built resources if they exist, otherwise they're compiled on-demand and recompiled automatically as you change files. Just run `gulp clean` first to get rid of the generated artifacts.
  There was a bug. If you build from master now, it should work with `stf local serial1 serial2`.
  Nice, I will merge this if you address my comments. Most of them are simple text changes.
 Sorry I'm a little busy right now but I'll check this over the weekend :(
 Thanks! I will ask @gunta if he might be interested in styling it a bit more.
  Thank you, this is very interesting. Have you tried this on an older device yet (2.3)?

Also could you remove the `console.log()`s?
 @codeskyblue we don't have "Refresh" in any part of stf because everything is realtime.

Could you implement it as a realtime monitoring feature (this will need implementation on the device side, just like the rotation watcher).
  Yes, by using `stf local SERIAL_OF_YOUR_DEVICE_HERE`. You can get the serial from STF's device list,  running `adb devices` or just from going through STF's output.
  There can be many reasons. It's possible that you didn't enable USB debugging yet. It's also possible that the USB connection is too weak for some reason, try a different port or cable.
 Does it make any difference if you upgrade to latest Node 4.x?
  Thank you!
  Your assumptions are correct, and `--storage-url` goes to storage-temp. One thing though is that your route is called "newprovider" but in your browser it's "remotehost". However, since you're getting a gateway timeout, I think you actually have them correct in your real configuration. When you get a gateway timeout, it means that nginx was unable to connect to the backend server. So basically if you have `proxy_pass http://PUBLIC_IP_OF_PROVIDER:$port/;`, then your nginx server isn't able to connect to the PUBLIC_IP_OF_PROVIDER. It means that either nothing is running on that port, the port is blocked/firewalled or that your webserver can't access that IP at all.

Two things:
1. Make sure `iptables` on the new provider isn't very restrictive, it needs to have a whole bunch of ports open. Might be worth disabling iptables just to see if that's the issue.
2. I don't think you did this, but just in case: even though the option is called `--public-ip`, it actually means "public within your network" (i.e. an internal IP all of your users are able to access). While a real public IP might also work, you'd have to do a lot of extra work setting it up and latency would suffer.
 Great! Note that you can set up a firewall if you want, but you'll need to make sure the range between `--min-port=15000` and `--max-port=25000` is open. You can use a smaller range if you wish.
  The request goes through WebSockets. If you look at the picture [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md), the message flows as follows:
1. Browser sends a WebSocket message
2. One of the `websocket` units receives the message and translates it to Protocol Buffers
3. The `websocket` unit sends the message via PUSH to the app side `triproxy`'s PULL
4. The app side `triproxy` takes the message as-is and randomly forwards it via DEALER to one of the `processor` DEALERs
5. The `processor` doesn't do anything yet (although it could if necessary), it simply forwards the message via DEALER to the device side `triproxy`'s DEALER
6. The `triproxy` takes the message as-is and uses PUB to publish the message the the device's channel (which is included in the message)
7. The `dev` unit that is listening on that channel receives the message via its SUB.
8. If the device is in a group, it leaves that group (and clears its in-memory state)
9. The `dev` sends a GroupLeave message and sends it via PUSH to the device side `triproxy`
10. The `triproxy` takes the message as-is and randomly forwards it to one of the `processor`'s DEALEREs
11. The `processor` receives the message, reads it, and modifies the database to remove the owner from that device
12. The `processor` forwards the message via DEALER to the app side `triproxy`'s DEALER
13. The `triproxy` receives the message and PUBs it to all the `websocket` units
14. All the `websocket` units receive information that the device no longer has an owner
15. The `websocket` units emit a WebSocket message to all the connected browsers
16. The browsers receive the message, update their internal state in JavaScript and re-render the UI if necessary

I'll admit that's a bit complicated, but it makes the system more scalable since you can easily increase the number of `processors`, `websockets`, and if necessary, `triproxies` as well. Nearly all internal communication in STF works this way.

If you remove the owner directly from the database, you skip step 8, and the device doesn't know it's no longer supposed to be in a group, since that information is also stored locally in memory. It will time out (i.e. automatically leave the group) after 15 minutes of inactivity, though, so it should eventually become usable.
 Also we don't actually use `RotationWatcher.apk` in STF. It's a companion program for `minicap` in case you want to use it by itself :) Otherwise it's very nice.
 Nice graph, perhaps we could add it to `README` or `DEPLOYMENT`.
 @LiufxLucky365 having to wait for timeout is a different issue, open a new ticket for it.
 @LiufxLucky365 actually its a different problem.
A) luisxiaomai wants a way to stop all the devices on user logout (we don't have a sign-out UI yet).

B) You want to stop the devices being used by your users because they close the browser directly. 

Adding logout support will not fix your issue because your users will still be closing the browser directly, thus not logout. 
What could fix the issue for your users could be: 1) lower the timeout to something like 30 seconds, or 2) add an option to release the devices on `window.close`.
  The hardware guide exists for a reason. Once you scale past just a few devices, you WILL run into problems unless you know what you're doing. At the very least, get a powered USB hub (with enough power! Most powered USB hubs are actually only able to support 3-4 devices simultaneously). If you are in China, I would recommend the ORICO brand. Our recommended hub is essential a rebrand of an ORICO USB 2.0 hub with BC 1.2 support. For example, [this hub](http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/2014-New-Design-ORICO-BH7-U3-BK-ABS-7-Ports-USB3-0-BC1-2-Charging-HUB/105327_2026659970.html) should be OK. You should have more options on Chinese sites, though.
  I think it's good, I added some feedback. Overall, though, our whole screenshot section needs way more love than it's receiving right now.
 @codeskyblue Thank you. Before merging this, I have some UX-related questions.

There are more than one way to do this, so want to make sure we choose the best way.

A) Take `X` shots every `1` second, fixed, default `50` shots (your PR)
B) Take shots every `1` second, for `X` seconds long, default `50` seconds long (same, just different wording)
C) Take shots every `X` milliseconds, for `Y` seconds long, default `1000ms` for `50` seconds long

If we later add `screenrecord` (movie) capabilities, it would be in seconds, so `C` is more consistent with this.

We don't want to overcrowd the UI with buttons for features not used as often. 
In this case a [dropdown](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/dropdown) button fits well with this.

```
[Take Screenshot Continuously][v]
|
> Every [1000] ms
> For [50] seconds long
```

It also would be nice to save these values with the `SettingsService` so the user doesn't have to enter the values every time.
 This branch is outdated, if you want to use it, rebase it with master branch.
  Not yet.

  I'm not sure if that's a bug - you're just using ImageMagick instead of GraphicsMagick. I'm worried that this patch would break the app for GraphicsMagick users.
 I will close this pull request for now since it would break `gm`, but in the future we might add a command line option for choosing gm/imagemagick manually.
  You have a crappy USB host controller and/or USB hub if you're using one. It's disconnecting so much that STF runs out of ports and fails to even put them back into the pool. That's a bug, but even if we fixed it your system wouldn't be usable. If you're using a hub you're most likely just going to have to throw it away, it's worthless. I recommend reading the troubleshooting section in our README and possibly our hardware recommendations, too.

We've seen the problem before when some guys scavenged random parts from their dead PCs and tried to put a provider there. USB is NOT easy once you have more than a few devices connected.
 And it could also be caused by crappy USB cables. Just go through the troubleshooting section, we have encountered every single issue listed there.
  Node 4.0.0 was released two days ago, we still don't support it.
Try to use the previous node 0.12 version until we add support for the new node.js.
 Actually Node 4 is supported since a few weeks ago, you don't have to modify package.json. We're currently developing with 4.1.2. And please don't update random modules, there's a reason why some of them are not using their latest versions. The error you're seeing is #106.
  Hi,

You seem to be using my old rethinkdb image. I made it when there was no official rethinkdb image available yet, and we are not using it anymore. It's not supposed to be in our docs, how did you find it? I won't remove it in case someone's still using it, but I just added deprecation notice to the repo to prevent this from happening again.

It's possible that your connection problems are caused by the driver being too new for the old image, but more likely it's a problem with the `--canonical-address` flag.

Additionally, with your current config you'll lose your data when the container shuts down.

Here's our unit (but you may want to at least update the rethinkdb version):

``` systemd
[Unit]
Description=RethinkDB
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/etc/environment
TimeoutStartSec=0
Restart=always
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/docker pull rethinkdb:2.0.4
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill %p
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm %p
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/mkdir -p /srv/rethinkdb
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/chattr -R +C /srv/rethinkdb
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm \
  --name %p \
  -v /srv/rethinkdb:/data \
  -e "AUTHKEY=YOUR_AUTHKEY_HERE" \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 28015:28015 \
  -p 29015:29015 \
  rethinkdb:2.0.4 \
  rethinkdb --bind all --canonical-address ${COREOS_PRIVATE_IPV4} \
    --cache-size 8192
ExecStop=-/usr/bin/docker stop -t 10 %p
```

Note that we are NOT running the ambassador on the database host itself, although you can certainly do it that way if you like.

Alternatively if you find specifying the `--canonical-address` annoying, you could just use host networking and it should bind to the right address.

``` systemd
[Unit]
Description=RethinkDB
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/etc/environment
TimeoutStartSec=0
Restart=always
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/docker pull rethinkdb:2.0.4
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill %p
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm %p
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/mkdir -p /srv/rethinkdb
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/chattr -R +C /srv/rethinkdb
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm \
  --name %p \
  -v /srv/rethinkdb:/data \
  -e "AUTHKEY=YOUR_AUTHKEY_HERE" \
  --net host \
  rethinkdb:2.0.4 \
  rethinkdb --bind all \
    --cache-size 8192
ExecStop=-/usr/bin/docker stop -t 10 %p
```
 Also... if you do set an auth key, you'll have to open the web UI the first time and run

``` javascript
r.db('rethinkdb').table('cluster_config').get('auth').update({auth_key: 'newkey'})
```

As per https://rethinkdb.com/docs/security/. It used to be possible to do it from the command line more easily.
 Our units have the `127.0.0.1` you removed and they work fine. Nginx runs in a docker container on a separate host, but that shouldn't matter.
 Ok I went through our units and it looks like I have made a mistake with the example nginx configuration. We are actually using two nginx instances. One of them is on a separate server, and the other is on the same server as the app units with `--net host` enabled, and it's referencing `127.0.0.1` in the config files. That's why it works for us. I'll fix up the documentation later. I think the best option is to remove the 127.0.0.1 for now as you've done.
 I have updated the documentation to remove 127.0.0.1 and added an example rethinkdb.service.

As for the screen not showing up, I think looking at your Chrome developer tools should prove more useful. Go to the network tab, filter by WebSockets and see if something happened with the screen WebSocket.

@MichaelMadsen You can also get rid of the https error by giving the appropriate units `-e NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`.
 Done.
 Could you show your nginx config?
 Nice catch! I didn't spot it either...

Btw I added `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` to the docs as well. Let's try to make them as complete as possible now.
 Great!
 Not necessarily, it's certainly possible. However we provide no instructions for that.  Thanks!
  Maybe try accessing it with http://localhost:7100 instead of http://127.0.0.1:7100?
 Do you mean that you want to run both of them on the same port? Or that you can't use 127.0.0.1 in your proxy_pass? If the latter, you can either use `[::1]` or `localhost` instead, or tweak your system settings to somehow not discriminate against IPv4. I'm not sure how to do that so you'll have to do some googling.
 @kartx22 

Is `adb` properly installed in your system?

You have to install all the prerequisites before running `stf local`.
https://github.com/openstf/stf#requirements
  Looks like there was a commit last month and the ambassador image got rebuilt. Something probably changed and broke things.
- https://github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/ctlc-docker-ambassador
- https://hub.docker.com/r/ctlc/ambassador/
 I know that only one line changed, but it caused a full rebuild of the docker image. Something must have changed during that rebuild.
 I'm trying it at home and it's not working. But I know for certain that we've been using the same unit (with automatic docker pull) for probably around 2 years and it has always worked, even on new machines. But it looks like we'll have to find an alternative now.
 Oh... you know guys, it actually works. The image is buggy and you do get the errors every time. However, it still manages to open the link behind the scenes. Anyway that's bad, so I'll try think of something.
 Please try to change your unit configurations to use `openstf/ambassador`. Other than that the usage stays the same.
  Have you seen https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md?
  Thanks!
  Thank you for your contribution!

Your PR has two unrelated commits ("add install doc" and "fix script") so I've cherry picked just the "add zh translation" commit and pushed to `master` already.

However, the translations are not supposed to be translated directly from the `JSON file` (everything is automated), but from the **Gettext .po file**. 
So could you submit a PR again against a new `stf.zh.po` file? 

You don't need to use Transifex, you can ask your colleague to just use a free GUI tool like [PoEdit](http://poedit.net) for doing the translations.
 @codeskyblue 
First pull the latest stf from master, install all external dependencies, and do a `npm install`.
After that for compiling you'll only need to run `gulp translate:compile`.
  Thanks, it's a bug that went unnoticed for a really long time. In fact I'm not even sure how on earth we didn't encounter it before... We use the exact same unit template and it pulls the latest image, which had this same problem for a long long time even before yesterday's update. Complete mystery.

Please pull the latest image to fix the issue.
  Sorry for the late response. The deployment docs unfortunately had many mistakes (see #76 if interested) and were updated a while ago to be more complete. Closing this ticket for now.
  Hi,

The devices use a configurable port range, 15000-25000 by default. You can
decrease the range if you like (it's very generous - one device shouldn't
need more than 2 ports), but you'll have to make sure that range is open.
Try the help output to see the options.

The other necessary ports are configurable and can also be seen in the help
output (or the deployment guide if you're doing that).

 Well, all network services are bound to run a little slower once you're no longer running things locally. It shouldn't be terribly slow, though. Are you accessing it via a public network or from an internal network? We've only ever used internal networks. 
 Can't help with that, sorry. It was not meant for public use and has never
been tested with one.

  Can you clarify what kind of guidance you're looking for?
  Hi,

You forgot the `--link` option. See https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md.
 Hi,

Sorry but that's beyond the scope of STF and the resources we have right
now. The deployment guide is meant for those who are already familiar with
the software we use, or otherwise able to adapt the instructions to their
system.

Note though that you don't have to set up https if creating the certs is
too much trouble.

 I can guarantee that the instructions work as long as you know how you're
supposed to use them, since the system we use is identical except for a few
configuration options. So I know that it works, but I can't really help if
you or someone else can't get it running, because that would take way more
time than I can afford :)

  Hi,

Thanks for the awesome work. We would like to have iOS support, yes. However we currently do not have the resources to develop it by ourselves, but if someone provides a reasonably functional version I may be able to port the rest of the functionality. I would be very interested in seeing what you've got so far.

Btw you mentioned you were hoping to perhaps compress TIFF frames into PNG. I think PNG is a lost cause for screen capture purposes as the compression is very very slow compared to JPG. JPG (w/ libjpeg-turbo) is the fastest method we've found so far, but over time we're planning on moving away from JPG frames to transferring raw x264 frames instead. As long as the device supports hardware encoding, this method should yield the highest FPS.
 Great, really looking forward to this :)
 Amazing. 

For capturing images, I get that you are using `com.apple.mobile.screenshotr` which firsts captures a `TIFF` frame and then you have to convert it to `JPEG`; which will not get you the max frame-rate.

Since iOS 8 there is [`com.apple.cmio.iOSScreenCaptureAssistant`](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice/issues/122) which gives you an encoded video stream. If you are able to get the stream (you _may_ have to do some [reverse-engineering](https://www.aorensoftware.com/blog/2011/08/20/exploring-airplay-mirroring-internals/)) and then somehow forward that to the browser, you'll probably get the highest FPS. 

On the Browser side then you could try to do any necessary processing and show it by using `Media Source Extensions` or `WebRTC`.

If you need any help in getting the approval of stakeholders, just let them know that we can add the name of your company in the credits as a big contributor on [http://openstf.io](http://openstf.io), if that is the case just let us know ;)
 @kwv any update on this? :)
 If you feel like you need an iOS implementation faster, consider posting a bounty on this issue (see badge below). If the bounty gets large enough, perhaps we or someone else will take a look at it.

XCode supports testing multiple real devices using UIAutomator since v6.3.2

https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/273#issuecomment-110145744
 @codeskyblue it works also on Android, should be able to be used without problems
 Well its for different use cases afaik, at least currently.
 I think that's probably the reason why no one has contributed a solution
yet. It takes a huge amount of developer time and there are clearly
financial benefits for end users. In other words it would be a viable
product. Not many are willing to give that away for free.

 They probably meant that Apple wouldn't allow you to publish an app that does that. However, you should be able to use private APIs to your heart's content if you never publish your app in the App Store.
 Note that on iOS the home screen is quite slow for some reason. You can capture screenshots faster in some other views (e.g. Safari). I can confirm that around 4-5 FPS is possible with this very basic method.
 WDA screenshots suck, don't bother. It stops capturing during any animation or significant activity.
 Above repo has been transferred to the OpenSTF org. here: 
https://github.com/openstf/ios-minicap
 I believe so, but it's untested as we're improving things. Anyway it's still very much a prototype with bugs and all. It will take time to polish it. Let's not start asking too much. You can help by testing it yourself and reporting the results.
 My understanding is that for touch events, Remote simply adds code to the app you build. I'm not sure if it can send events to any app / system.
 No, it's super, super slow. And unreliable. Can take 5-15s for an event to
register.

 Facebook isn't omnipotent. We've been using WDA for touch events internally
and it's the worst. Latency of touch and key events is easily several
seconds, sometimes even tens of seconds. To be fair, I believe most of the
issues are due to XCUITest rather WDA itself.

It's also extremely unreliable and can often go into a weird state that you
can only recover from by rebooting the device.

In short: it works, but is a nightmare to work with. We will never
integrate it with STF in its current state. If the situation improves we'll
think again.

 USB. If you'd like to help, feel free to make a sample app to demonstrate
the responsiveness. Based on my personal experience with WDA I really don't
think it's possible to make it work well with real time control, but would
be happy to be proven wrong.

 That's great! Do you think you'd be able to share your example's source code? I've also been looking into reading data from the USB endpoint iOSScreenCapture opens. I've been able to capture some raw data from it, but haven't had time to figure out the format yet. I suspect it's deceptively simple, though. Do you know what the output format is?

The only downside of doing the capture that way is that the device menu bar switches to a static view when the endpoint is open. For example, time is always "9:41" and other icons are hidden. No. This isn't a paid product, please try to learn to respect people's free
time.

 I don’t think anyone is actively working on it right now. Comtributions are welcome :) People tend to think that relatively popular open source projects have some magic behind them that somehow produces funding to the team, but that’s rarely the case. As we have no business model, “the team” quite literally makes nothing from it, aside from the occasional donation. All the time we spend on the project is free, unpaid labor, that is directly out of our own leisure time. We even buy our own devices with our own money. Considering that, don’t you think you’re being a bit unfair? Guys thanks for your hard work but can you please take this discussion to your repo :)  I think your device is too old. We only support armeabi-v7a (with neon) and newer. In fact yours is the first armeabi-only device ever reported to us. Just to be sure, can you post the output of:

``` bash
adb shell getprop | grep '^ro\.'
```
 Then use adb's -s option with the right serial number (you can see it in
the logs).

 Currently you can't exclude just one device, you'd have to actually unplug it.
 By the way could you let me know what device this is? I'd want to know the model number at least. Either `adb shell getprop | grep -E '^ro\.'` or `adb devices -l` should give enough information about the device, including the model number.
 Thanks! I can take a look if someone is willing to donate one of these super old devices. I might eventually buy one myself but funds are limited right now. I've posted a small update in the README.
 I got a used Wildfire S off of Ebay for ~$30. Might look into it some day but no promises of any kind.  Sorry for the late response. The deployment docs unfortunately had many mistakes (see #76 if interested) and were updated a while ago to be more complete. Closing this ticket for now.
 Here is the error logs

Either your db is not running or your unit files are not configured properly. `RETHINKDB_PORT_28015_TCP=tcp://rethinkdb.stf.example.org:28015` is this the exact line you have in there?  Have you thought about replacing it with the real address of the rethinkdb
server?

 Please use ``` to format your code. If you don't do that, it looks bad and some characters may not be shown at all, like `\`. 

I don't see anything relevant in that log. Perhaps you cut it a bit short.  Maybe your sudo is configured to ignore your PATH. Try running `sudo node -v` and see if it works or not. If not, you need to find a way to fix it.
 It's a bit late, but you can get around that problem by using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). Although I'm pretty sure you shouldn't need sudo with homebrew's node either... anyway it's an old issue now, but if it happens again, try running brew doctor to see if it can find something wrong with your installation. Note that you're practically NEVER supposed to use sudo with homebrew.
  Do you mean the log function in the STF UI, or just `adb logcat`?
  There is considerable overhead in the ADB TCP protocol (used in `adb connect`) that we can do nothing about, but I've never felt it was _that_ slow.

I just tried it on my localhost (so it's a little bit different than yours, but still) and got the following results:

``` bash
Simos-MBP~ % time ~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb -s localhost:7401 install -r HelloApp.apk
7034 KB/s (693077 bytes in 0.096s)
    pkg: /data/local/tmp/HelloApp.apk
Success
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb -s localhost:7401 install -r   0.02s user 0.01s system 0% cpu 3.546 total
Simos-MBP~ % time ~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb -s SERIAL install -r HelloApp.apk
7403 KB/s (693077 bytes in 0.091s)
    pkg: /data/local/tmp/HelloApp.apk
Success
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb -s SERIAL install -r   0.02s user 0.01s system 0% cpu 3.470 total
```

So yeah, we do have a little bit of overhead but it's way under 10%.

Is it possible that you actually switched your device to TCP mode, and tried to connect to that? Because that's always super super slow, every time.
 This may be caused by openstf/adbkit#41.
 Can you update your adbkit to 2.4.0 and try the same thing you did before, and report your results to openstf/adbkit#41?
 or update stf to latest one i.e `v1.1.1`
 It would be really interesting to know what in your network causes this :(
Unfortunately we can't reproduce the issue.

Is it possible you may have torgotten to run npm install after updating you
repo?

 If you feel confident enough about letting me ssh to a machine in your
network from which the behavior is observable, I could try to look into it
this weekend. Alternatively remote desktop but it might take a long time.

  Nope, it's a very very low priority for us.
  If you don't have an auth key for rethinkdb, just don't set the environment variable.

Disabling auth is not possible right now, see #37. Use the mock auth if you don't have anything else.

I would suggest using the docker images because they include all the dependencies (although you'll have to set up rethinkdb separately) and you won't have to install anything separately (except RethinkDB). See [doc/DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md) for details.

I would also strongly recommend running RethinkDB on another host. ADB is only required on nodes where you have devices connected. The rest of the dependencies would be good to have everywhere.
 I think you're having some kind of network issues. Maybe something's blocking the connection?

Worst-case scenario, if you're unable to solve the connectivity issues, you can [build the base image](https://github.com/openstf/docker-openstf-base) too, with `docker build -t openstf/base:v1.0.1 .`. You should then be able to build the image in this repository.
 You have to run the docker build command from the folder where you cloned
the stf repo.

 The openstf/base image does NOT include STF. It only exists so that the main build in this repo doesn't take too long. You need to pull or build openstf/stf, although the units will attempt to do it for you.

The example URL does not work because it's an example URL. You need your own domain (or you can just use your IP) and then you'll have to modify the unit configs with the new URL.

You should create a separate unit for RethinkDB (preferably on another server) and expose its ports. Then you need to then modify `rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service` so that it's able to connect, and start it. Then you start the migrate unit and let it finish. Then you start the rest of the units, order is not that important but you should launch the provider last.

Sorry but I don't think I can provide anymore support with this issue, it's taking way too much time. The deployment docs are meant for advanced users who have prior experience with docker and systemd.
 It says failure, but because the command is prefixed with -, the failure is only mentioned in the logs but doesn't prevent the unit from starting. It's normal to see it in the logs.

We just improved the deployment docs to include a sample rethinkdb.service, that might help.
  They're used for routing ZeroMQ PUB/SUB messages.
  Hmm, perhaps you're somehow running 32-bit node with 64-bit libs? Try with 64-bit node instead.
  Well, it looks like whatever the thin client is, it doesn't expose any touch devices. Can you run `adb shell getevent -ilp` and paste the output here? I have a feeling there's probably nothing we can do, though.
 Yeah, because it uses a different API that didn't support multi-touch until recently.

Unfortunately I'd have to say that we are not very interested in this issue right now, since our resources are very limited and we have so far only dealt with touch devices.

I may consider working on this at some point, but don't expect too much.
 Well, you have a touch device, but it's not a multitouch device. Currently we only support multitouch devices in [minitouch](https://github.com/openstf/minitouch), since that's all we've ever had. Can you run `adb shell getprop | grep -E '^ro\.'` and paste the output so that I can see which device it is?
 Ummm so it's something like this? http://en.senter.com.cn/products_detail/&productId=128.html
 That's a different issue. See #477.  Check https://github.com/openstf/minicap. All the source code is available there.
  It works for me on OS X. Is it possible that your firewall might be blocking something?
 I just tried again and it does work for me. I haven't done anything special, the command alone should be enough. One thing to watch out for, though, is that even though it's called `--public-ip`, it actually means "accessible from your internal network". So, I'm pretty sure you didn't do this, but I'll just say it as one possibility: if you got the IP from, say, https://www.whatismyip.com/, it most likely won't work. 

This could be somehow related to #31 though. We're still not sure what the cause for that one is.
  You can check [doc/DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md) for a setup similar to ours, although you'll have to be able to figure out how to distribute the units yourself.
  Send the process you want to debug a signal to trigger the debugger. See https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html#debugger_advanced_usage.

I'm closing this ticket as the signal works fine, even though it is a little bit more annoying to use. I'm not sure if we can make it any easier right now, but feedback and patches are definitely welcome.

  Hi,

There's a relevant reply in #46, but it's kind of unrelated otherwise so I'll just paste my reply here once more for search purposes:

---

You can use OAuth 2.0 or LDAP. Some information is available in [doc/DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md). Note that you're not supposed to run STF with `stf local` in production, although it can be done. Here's my reply to someone else who asked privately:

---

As for authentication, what do you currently use? If you trust your developers enough that they're not going to claim to be someone else, you could just use the mock login while you're testing the system. Alternatively, we provide an implementation for LDAP and OAuth 2.0.

Although the processes are meant to be started separately, you COULD use either with of those with `stf local` like this:

```
stf local --auth-type oauth2 \
  --auth-options '[ 
    "--oauth-authorization-url", "https://sso.company.example.org/as/authorization.oauth2",
    "--oauth-token-url", "https://sso.company.example.org/as/token.oauth2",
    "--oauth-userinfo-url", "https://sso.company.example.org/idp/userinfo.openid",
    "--oauth-client-id", "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "--oauth-client-secret", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "--oauth-callback-url", "https://stf.example.org/auth/oauth/callback",
    "--oauth-scope", "openid email"
  ]'
```

If that looks a bit weird, it's because it's not really meant to be super convenient - just possible.

You may also need to export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 in case you're using a self-signed cert. 

Similarly, you could support LDAP (or possibly ActiveDirectory) with the auth-ldap provider (or `--auth-type ldap` with `stf local`). Check `stf auth-ldap --help` for the available options.

We are planning on improving the documentation over time, however there are still a few bugs we want to fix first.

Also, be sure to read the Troubleshooting section of the README, especially if you're planning on using Intel processors, as you might find out you're only able to support 8-12 devices per machine otherwise!

Hope this gets you going for now.
 See `stf auth-ldap --help` for the available options. You yourself have to know which options you have to set and to which values.
 The syntax is correct, but you don't have enough options. You should add at least `--ldap-search-dn` and `--ldap-search-field`, and possibly `--ldap-search-scope` and/or `--ldap-search-class` if your company is using different values.
 As you can see in the logs, it says `INF/db 2204 [] Unable to connect to 127.0.0.1:28015`. It means stf is not able to connect to db. Did you start `rethinkdb` before running stf?
  You most likely don't have GraphicsMagick installed (the `gm` command). It's listed in the requirements.
 You can use OAuth 2.0 or LDAP. Some information is available in [doc/DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md). Note that you're not supposed to run STF with `stf local` in production, although it can be done. Here's my reply to someone else who asked privately:

Hope this gets you going for now.
 Read the README for installation instructions. I can't help you with this. It's your responsibility to make your development environment work. The instructions provided in the README work. Nothing in the README says to run `sudo npm install graphicsmagick` so clearly you have not read it. You can't install it via npm. If you can't get it installed, consider using the docker image instead which includes (almost) everything.  You need to have a rethinkdb container running as well, and then link to it. There's a bit more complicated example over at https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md, but you could skip the proxy container and just link against the rethinkdb container if you like.
 Depends on how much you've used Docker before (especially with linked containers), and what OS you're running on. It won't work on OS X with boot2docker because it won't be able to see your USB devices.
 Yes it would be possible to configure the USB ports, however it's annoying and reliability is questionable. In fact https://github.com/openstf/setup-examples does that but some people are having issues.

The adb port forward thing may or may not work, but you could do pretty much the same thing with `socat` or similar common tools. Or try setting the ADB_HOST and ADB_PORT environment variables and STF will try to use those. Functionality is untested, though.
  Actually we haven't tested with any Android TV versions yet. Can you post the
output from 'adb shell getprop | grep ro.product' and 'adb shell getprop |

  The same error i am getting with one of the avd, well if you remember then please tell me how did you solved this error? That doesn't have anything to do with this issue. The error can occur if the worker process dies, which based on your other posts is indeed happening.  Hi, `-o` is for a different thing, you want to use `rethinkdb --http-port 8081` instead.
  Can you run `adb shell getprop | grep ro.product`  and paste the output? There shouldn't be any private information there.
 Unfortunately we don't have any Neken devices to test with (I actually learned that the maker exists from your post :bowtie:), so I might not be able to help right now.
 We have a Lenovo Yoga Tablet 8 that exhibits the same behavior, it's our only device that does that. I'll try to look at it at some point.
 There's a good chance that this was fixed by STF 2.3.0. Please try and report back with your findings. @rseek I am not sure about HUAWEI U8825-1, please create a new issue for it if the problem still exists, and remember to post the log output there. Thanks!
  Hi,

What does `stf -V` output?
 Did you install from NPM with `npm install -g stf`? I just tried it and it works on my computer.
 Glad you got it working. Can I ask how you built it? From the logs it looks like you managed to install it globally after building, could you post the commands you used so that we can anticipate this in the future?
  We support pushing files (currently only APK files), so might as well support pulling a file from a path.
 Yes, in the end a **File Explorer** is in the roadmap. Something like [this](http://zendelsolutions.com/zendel/projects/angular-filemanager/).
 @vrunoa Right now we have few resources, so the answer is no. 
Contributions are welcome! 
If you need any help implementing or have any questions don't hesitate to ask here.
 We appreciate any contribution. Thank you for your work and looking forward to it.
 True, I'll close it. However it seems that it doesn't quite work an all recent Android versions, I've had trouble getting it to work on Nexus 5X running Android 7. The list is always empty. But I think that should be a separate issue. Thanks!
  Hi,

We are of course planning to offer automation, but currently we're pretty much fully booked with other bugs & requests.

We're hoping to have something available (perhaps limited to just 1 testing framework like Espresso) in a few months, but we can't make any promises. At first we're just planning on just creating a fairly simple API to reserve devices with the desired features, with the possibility to enumerate the devices in the response and `adb connect` to them yourself. We'd then build the real automation on top of this API.

Help would indeed be much appreciated, but our vision regarding this is not clear yet. Right now what would be very useful (aside from a complete implementation) would be a detailed description of how you would like the system to work, including any testing frameworks you need. 
 That's more or less what we were planning to do at some point, so it would be very helpful indeed if you could have a go at it.

I prefer reserve/release as they are easier to understand (for me, anyway).
 `Lock/Unlock` can be confused with the screen rotation indeed. 
`Reserve/Release` sounds good.

The next step would be to reserve based on device `capabilities`, not only `serial`.
 @vbanthia you can use the preliminary UI for the access tokens in `res/app/settings/keys/access-tokens` (you'll need to uncomment it on `settings/keys/keys.jade`).
 @jlhonora yes, we want to integrate any of the great tools available.
However we need first an API that its platform/tool agnostic first.
 About the `connect.start` thing, I'm actually not very happy about having to retrieve the URL this way even in the current UI. Ideally I'd like to store it in the database, but the reason why it's not there right now is due to a complex dependency graph for the device `identity` module, which would otherwise be the prime candidate for storing the URL (since it currently also stores the screen WebSocket URL). Currently it has to be accessible before most of the services start. Although I guess we could create a new message for it so that it doesn't have to rely on `identity`.
 Feature will be available in next major release.

 I haven't tried these tools yet but theoretically they should also work. All you need to do is,
1. Reserve the device
2. Remote connect 
3. Start your test assuming device is connected to your own machine. 
  No, it is not possible to disable authentication right now.
 The current app doesn't support this, but we may offer a more lightweight version of STF at some point without auth or any advanced features. Closing as wontfix for now.
  Weird, we have the same device and it works. Can you open the developer tools in Chrome and see if you might have some sort of errors in the console?
 Could you try in incognito mode (and make sure no extensions are enabled) just to see if it makes a difference? We had something similar happen a long long time ago and that was the reason.
 Can one of you guys (or both) provide the full output from `stf local`, up to where you attempt to use the device and only see gray? There shouldn't be any private information there except perhaps usernames in paths, although more importantly your phone's IMEI and phone number may be visible if the device wasn't found in our database.
 Did you attempt to use the device when that log was being captured? I'm not seeing any evidence of the screen WebSocket being used (or actually the device being used at all).
 I need the log to be able to say anything, but could you pull the latest master from Git and try `stf local --provider-min-port 15000 --provider-max-port 25000`? Perhaps a firewall/iptables/something is blocking one of the default ports (7400-7700). I wouldn't say it's very likely but worth a try anyway.
 FWIW here's the same Nexus 7 with the same Android version running in our system.

 I'm closing this ticket in favor of the earlier #31. Let's continue there.
  You can with the new **stf 1.0.8** version.
Control a device and then try clicking `Dashboard -> Apps -> Manage Apps`.
It should open a list of running process (unfortunately this doesn't work for old Android devices yet).
  I don't think there's anything we can do about the camera. I think they're bypassing the Android rendering layer somehow to combat the lag. Considering our limited resources I don't think we can spend any time on this. Sorry :(
  Hi,

Unfortunately we have very limited resources and are therefore only able to
document a very narrow range of possible deployments. What you can do,
though, is to take the `docker run` commands from the example unit files
and write corresponding service configs for whatever init system you're
using, or if you don't even have access to docker, just take note of the
environment variables and the stf commands. It will be a lot more tricky
without docker, though. Also, remember to replace %p and %i where
necessary, %i means the unit filename after @ (if you were using systemd)
without extension, and %p means the part before @ (or the whole name
without extension if none).

However, if you only have a single computer, you might as well use `stf
local --public-ip <your ip here>` the make things easier for yourself.
Making sure that it restarts if it dies is left to you. If you need it to
run on port 80 you could set up a simple nginx reverse proxy, or for a
super lazy solution add a `--port 80` option and run STF as root, but
that's not secure at all.

Simo

 Closing this ticket because we don't have the resources to test and keep up another set of deployment instructions.
  What kind of a feature are you looking for?
 According to [this](http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-CN/about/dashboards/index.html), Android devices over 4.4 are just about 50%. 
In order to support this in older versions we will have to look for another way.

Currently you can use `screenrecord` from the Shell command, however you will not be able to download the file, for that follow this other issue #39.
 @codeskyblue Sure, make a PR and we can evaluate it. 
It would be good if it's also implemented server-side and not only client side.
 It does make sense, but unfortunately we have no time to implement it.
  Hi, please let us know the following:
- Which browser (and version) are you using?
- Which version of Android is your Galaxy Nexus running?
- The exact command you use to run STF (e.g. just `stf local`)
- The exact URL you use do access STF (e.g. just `http://localhost:7100`)

It would also help if you could provide the full output of `stf local`, although you might want to redact the IMEI and phone number that may be visible if we don't have the device in our device database. The log message should begin with a yellow `WRN`.
 Also, if you have any other device, it would be helpful if you can check if that one works.
 Turns out we do have the Japanese version of Galaxy Nexus somewhere (with 4.2.2), I'll try it ASAP. I'm pretty sure it will work on my computer, though.
 From the logs you sent it looks like it does manage to open up the WebSocket just fine since minicap gets started and stopped as it should. So I don't think it's a network issue, unless something blocks the WebSocket binary frames.

Can I ask what specs you have on your computer (both the STF app server and your local client if different)?

Additionally, I would be interested in knowing at least the following:
- Does the network panel show anything when the screen is grey?
- The full network log from before you control the device to you seeing the grey screen for the first time. You can copy all the logged information by right clicking in the network tab and selecting Copy All as HAR (on Chrome at least). Alternatively the "Save as HAR with content" may be more informative.

If there's nothing in there either, we may have to resort to screen sharing if somebody's willing to let me do that.
 I'll be away until next Tuesday, but I'll take a look when I return.

 @swarawan Do you happen to have more than one device connected with the same serial number?
 Works for me.

Can you tell me how you installed STF? The exact commands you used? I would also like to see the exact command you use to launch STF.
 So you installed stf with `npm install -g stf`? If you run `stf -V` what does it show?
 Well, I just tried it with the NPM version and it just works. The IP gets replaced like it's supposed to. Starting to get out of ideas, but what's your node version (`node -v`)?
 Mine's the same version. No, there really is nothing you have to edit. It should just work. If you can post the full output of `stf local --public-ip 172.17.2.130` that might help, but other than that I'm not sure if there's anything I can do since I can't reproduce the issue. 
 Yeah I think we'll have to do that. I'll PM you with details.
 Looks like the AT&T Galaxy Nexus (Android 4.3) is not sending any frames for some reason. Since our Galaxy Nexus works, I will try to update it to 4.3 to see if there's a difference there.

The other failing device, GT-P7510, is the first device I've ever seen that doesn't support NEON. This was confirmed with https://github.com/sorccu/smallfeat. Minicap uses libjpeg with NEON optimizations to improve encoding speed. We could potentially detect neon support at runtime, but I'm not sure if it's worth it - since the CPU is super old to start with, the capture rate would presumably be super slow.
 That particular Chrome issue has been fixed, see #303. You'll have to build from master or use the latest docker images, though.
  Running a provider on a Pi (v2) is definitely something we want to support, but as we currently depend on Node.js I assume it would be a bit of a hurdle. I currently don't have a Pi to test with, so there's not much I can say right now. Definitely interested in hearing if you or someone else manages to get it to work.
 I ordered a Pi 2, will update the ticket once there's progress. No promises
though.

 Actually I'm not planning on running RethinkDB on the RPI, it needs more RAM for smooth operation. The rest of STF _may_ run OK, but I'm mostly interested in running the device provider there and nothing else. It would connect to another server running the app itself.
 That's awesome! I guess you didn't bother with docker and just did the whole installation yourself?
 Progress so far with my RPi2 running Arch Linux & Docker:
- Built and pushed the [base image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/openstf/armv7hf-base/) to Docker Hub
- Ran into problems with the stf Dockerfile where in `ENV /path:$PATH` the `$PATH` gets replaced with an empty string. Not sure why this is happening.
 Figured out the cause, will wait till resin-io-library/resin-rpi-raspbian#3 gets fixed.
 I added a temporary workaround, the STF image is now available as [openstf/arm7hf-stf](https://hub.docker.com/r/openstf/armv7hf-stf/).

Still need to create an image for ADB.
 Make sure that your RPi is using a 2A power adapter. I find that providing any less power to the PI makes USB connections highly unstable. Also, power hungry devices tend to not work so well anyway. You could try [increasing the USB current](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/27708/is-setting-max-usb-current-1-to-give-more-power-to-usb-devices-a-bad-idea).

ODROID-XU4 is more expensive, but a much, much better fit with its Battery Charging 1.2 support, dedicated USB 3.0 bus, 1GB ethernet, eMMC 5.0 boot disk support, and 4A power adapter. The only downside is the somewhat noisy fan but I've replaced mine. All future ARM development will be done on ODROID-XU4.
 Should be fine, but personally I'm not going to use a hub anymore, which should greatly increase reliability and concurrency. You should be able to buy 10 or more XU4s for the price of our recommended components and hubs. Depending on whether you decide to utilize the USB 2 port as well (I won't), 10 XU4s can support either 20 or 30 devices. An additional benefit is that since there are fewer devices per machine, it becomes much less annoying to update & reboot the machines since you'll only lose 1-2 devices per machine. You could even set up automatic updates and reboots without having to worry too much about anything. Also, since you can give each provider a unique name, it should become way easier to physically find a missing or misbehaving device.

I'm not done with my own setup yet, though.
 Could you try [this](http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=95&t=15302) to see if it helps at all? Apparently there were some problems with their manufacturing process that left the USB 3 ports a bit dirty on some boards. Try cleaning them and report back.
 That's weird. My XU4 is very stable, although I only have one Nexus 9
connected to one of the USB 3 ports. In the past 10 days the device worker
has only died once, however it seems to have been due to Android stopping
the STFService rather than the USB connection actually dying.

 We now have an automated nightly build for armv7l available at https://hub.docker.com/r/openstf/stf-armv7l, and as a bonus it's a lot smaller than before.

The one thing that's missing is a good, up to date adb container for arm. It isn't easy to compile adb separately, unfortunately.
 You can take a look at https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md for guidance. It's not really meant for beginners but maybe it'll help.

Even though there's only a single docker image, you can launch any of the internal processes with it like the guide explains. It contains (almost) everything STF needs, with the exceptions being adb and rethinkdb.

Among other reasons, the benefit of supporting only a docker-based installation is that we mostly don't have to deal with people asking how to install dependencies, installing them incorrectly, using wrong versions, botching permissions, and we don't have to provide separate instructions for the various Linux distributions out there or deal with their outdated packages.  Reasons:
- Old devices CPU are too slow (Slow JPEG encoding)
- STF->Client Network speed may be too slow (Poor Wifi)
- Client browser may be too slow (Mobile browser / Old PC)

Ways to do it: 
- Manual quality control: Low/Med/High
- Auto quality control: Measure each blob loading time
  Have 3 L/M/H breakpoints for when the value goes below 

What to adjust:
- Image size
- JPEG image quality
 I think it would be easier to understand if it was a slider between speed and quality, rather than having 3 levels to choose from. Then it would also be clearer why the option exists.
  - Resize when rotating
- Resize when loading

Already doing it for the Standalone mode.
But in normal mode it might be annoying so test it first.
  In that case you want to use `stf local --public-ip <your computer's private ip here>`. You can then connect to STF by using the ip:port combo.

Note that we currently have a severe performance regression on iOS, it won't be very usable at all. Working on it!
  We have a prototype for that but it requires an extra cable in the
headphone jack (or root), since it's not possible without system
permissions. (Although I'd certainly like to be proven wrong)

 It would take so much time that I doubt we'll be able to offer the feature for free.
 I don't think it's a good idea anymore. Many new devices come without a headphone jack.

I have no time to explain it in detail but just get an analog audio -> usb converter. Then you'll get USB audio that you can read with standard utilities. You can get started with a cheap one, but they don't usually have the most suitable specs.  Looks like you're missing pkg-config. It's included in the README in the
master branch, make sure you installed all the requirements.

 Hmm, could be a `$PATH` problem then. If you run `which -a pkg-config`, what output does give you?
 Well, it's kind of unrelated to STF so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to help, but what does `echo $PATH` say?
 Seems ok to me... difficult to say really. You might want to run `brew doctor` to check if you have any problems with homebrew.
 Hi, this ticket isn't really related to STF so I'm closing it to make the list of open issues more manageable. Hope you get your environment sorted out.
  Hmm, I think you're probably missing GraphicsMagick (the `gm`) command. Perhaps [this](https://github.com/openstf/docker-openstf-base/blob/master/Dockerfile) will help you find the right packages?

Let me know how it turns out.
  The screenshot page hasn't received a lot of love so far, although similar persistence issues can be found on all tabs. This is one of the many areas we're planning to improve at some point :(
 The screenshot page has a separate Angular Controller that keeps track of its own state. When you move to a different tab the controller gets destroyed and the state is lost. This is a design issue on our side, all state should persist. The current code is [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/res/app/control-panes/screenshots/screenshots-controller.js), but there's not much to improve there without solving the state issue.
 Yes, that's one of the many things we're working on, but we're heavily
backlogged. If you feel like helping that would be great too :)

  Hi!

STF is supposed to run in a server (Linux or Mac).

We don't support installation in Windows, sorry. I have just updated `package.json` to reflect that.

Once you get STF installed in a server, you will be able to access that server from your Windows machines without any problem (even from Internet Explorer).
 I don't think blacklisting w32 is fair. Although we never tried it, it might work via cygwin as long as you're determined enough to get everything necessary installed. I reverted the commit and put a small reminder about Windows to the installation docs.
 @Azusanya We don't provide Windows support, but the error looks like you don't have Git installed (or it's unable to find it for some reason).
  @nasahapps Can I ask how you installed node? Looks to me like you probably used the official installer, but I'm asking just to be sure.
 @nasahapps It does work for me on latest Yosemite, although brew installed the latest Node.js (0.12.7) instead of 0.12.0. Perhaps try upgrading?

I've seen the same error before due to having my repo inside Dropbox and/or BitTorrent Sync (they presumably "recovered" some of the files NPM wanted to delete before it got to delete the folder), but I don't think that's the case here. 

I've also seen similar errors occur due to permission problems, although the logs usually tell you if that's the case (it's usually a small message before the other errors). Might be worth running `brew doctor` and Disk Utility's Repair Disk Permissions just to be sure, though.
  Remote hosts are disabled by default because you can easily get into a situation where ADB is seeing the device twice (once as a USB device and once as a remote device). STF would then try to set up both and fail.

To enable remote devices, you can run `stf local --allow-remote`.

HOWEVER, you must keep a few things in mind.
1. After running `adb tcpip 5555` you must **unplug the device** first, and only after that run `adb connect ip:port`.
   - **If you don't do it in this order STF won't work because it tries to set up the same device twice.**
2. You CANNOT use the remote debugging feature (STF's `adb connect`) on the same computer where STF runs.
   - **STF will see the same device twice and fail, because it's already connected locally.** 
   - You can use remote debugging from other computers freely (with the `--public-ip` option)
3. `adb tcpip` is super slow. It's much, much slower than USB.

To make things a bit easier, you can give `stf local` a device id and it will ignore other devices. For example, `stf local --allow-remote phone-ip:5555` would prevent STF from trying to set up any other device than `phone-ip:5555`.
 The issue includes a solution. Furthermore, there are at least 5 more
issues about this. It's not enabled by default because it's a very bad
idea. Read some of the earlier issues to find out why.

  @tonatiuhromero 
We are planning to add a "view only mode" feature in the future
It will not be only a single device though, 
it will be a screen showing multiple devices at the same time in realtime.

@paulirish 
About the shift-click feature I've just opened another ticket #13 so we can keep the discussion there.
 @tonatiuhromero Actually in an old version of STF we had the ability to see multiple device logs at the same time in a single window. So we have to reimplement this, thanks for the reminder.
  Thank you!
We'll have a look.
 Truth to be told we have spent relatively little time perfecting the client-side implementation (which is actually quite hacky), because we initially were not able to produce frames quickly enough to start with. And even though we now are able to do that, we still had our old assumptions and didn't even bother checking if there might be some additional gains to be made there. Thanks for the reminder and detailed information!
  I submitted a [ticket here](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=388206) 1 year ago, but current status is WontFix because "We are experimenting with alternative ways of implementing wireless debugging".

As long as there is any update on this, we need to update this ticket.
 @paulirish 
That sounds good.

> For the attached device, you have a listing of the open tabs under the input field to launch a new one.

I'm a bit unsure about this one, listing all the tabs open in a device might make it browser-dependent (unless we can make tab listing work even on default browsers).

> You have an inspect button for them, clicking them opens devtools, probably embedded into STF instead of a separate window. So I still get the minicap + interaction of stf but with the full devtools over debugger protocol

Does this kind of interaction would be possible without requiring the security permissions of a Chrome extension? 
  Thanks, I'll add it in a few hours. If you can provide an icon for `com.chrome.canary`, I can add it too even though the app itself is not public.
  Hi!

Be sure to use 1.0.3 or later (and do `npm install` for updated deps) if you want to try `adb connect`. We had a bug in our implementation that newer versions of ADB brought up.

The error you're seeing is actually a bit different. You see, STF also supports `adb connect`ed devices. So what happens is that STF sets up your local USB device first. Then do you `adb connect` and it sees a second device, and tries to set it up too. However because you already had STF running on that device it fails because of the "double-setup". I'm currently thinking about perhaps disabling `localhost` sources from being set up automatically without some command line option, but what you can do right now is to give `stf local` the serial numbers you want to use, and it will ignore the rest (incl. the `adb connect`ed device), like this: `stf local T076001226`.

You should be able to see both your USB device and the remote device in your chrome developer tools. However, Android Studio is somewhat buggy and will not let you have the same device connected twice, causing random freezes and/or broken functionality in the UI. This happens with the non-STF `adb connect` too if you leave your USB device connected after `adb tcpip 5555`.

Also, since you're testing things out I'll just quickly mention that there's a bug in our reverse port forwarding implementation (Node.js side), causing occasional process deaths if you use that feature. I'm rewriting that part right now. 
 By the way it would be super awesome if we could get built-in support for `adb connect` in Chrome. There's an open ticket for it but it's being ignored because of the low performance of the native implementation. But it's not the only implementation ;)
 Hi! 

>   built-in support for adb connect in Chrome. 
> can you point me to the ticket?  

I've opened a [Chromium ticket here](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=388206) 1 year ago, but current status is WontFix because "We are experimenting with alternative ways of implementing wireless debugging." Do you have any update on this? 
If there is any work we can do to add support for Chrome directly (without needing to install ADB) we would gladly do it, and it would be awesome.
I've opened the #10 STF ticket to keep track of this.

> (speaking of performance, the perf of minicap is amazing.)

We are planning to make it even faster, the goal is 60fps on any decent device.
 Hi, I may be mistaken here but I believe what you're doing right now is:
1. Running `stf local` without any extra args
2. Then on the same machine, running `adb connect localhost:7401`

Doing this causes STF to see the same device twice (because ADB is seeing it twice). Then it tries to set up the same device using both the USB serial and the IP/port pair (which is used as the remote serial). Then it fails since they try to set up the same resources.

With 1.0.3, you can prevent this by running `stf local <your_device_serial_here>` instead of just `stf local`. This will cause STF to ignore the "new" device that `adb connect` adds.

Anyway, I just pushed a change to `master` to require an `--allow-remote` option if you really, really want STF to try and set up remote devices too. This should solve the problem, can you check and confirm? You'll of course still be able to see the device in your chrome developer tools.
  Merged, thanks! I think I'll do as you say and change the default version to 'latest'. The auth problem sounds like it may be a bug, would you be willing to create a separate issue for it?
  Hi,

Could you show me the command you used to launch STF (e.g. `stf local`)? Looks like the log cuts off a bit. I would also like to know which OS and browser you're using.

  Hi,

Thank you!

You can change the IP address STF uses by launching STF with `stf local
--public-ip 192.168.1.100`. You should then be able to access it from other
machines via http://192.168.1.100:7100.

Note that for a real deployment you would not use `stf local` at all, but
instead start all the processes separately. Currently we lack documentation
for doing that, but `lib/cli.js` might give you a few hints. Later on we'll
publish systemd unit configurations to make it easier.

You can change the RethinkDB address by setting the RETHINKDB_PORT_28015_TCP
environment variable (it's link docker --link format). By default it's
`tcp://127.0.0.1:28015`. Users will not connect to the database directly,
though, so you usually don't have to change the address if you run STF
locally.

So, if you wanted to change both the public IP and the RethinkDB address,
you'd launch STF with something like this:

```
RETHINKDB_PORT_28015_TCP=tcp://192.168.1.100:28015 stf local
--public-ip 192.168.1.100
```

And you should be OK.
  Hi,

Thanks for the feedback. We're going to open source our shelf design
shortly!

 Sorry, we have no time to clean up the design for release. Furthermore, we
are targeting different hardware now, requiring a different design.

**My issue:**
I have 7 devices attached to my local server, somehow some of the phones are detected with phone numbers and others not.

It is helpful to see the numbers for each attached device and would be good if all of them displays the number. Is this issue device related?

Many thanks! Thank you for your response.

Here are the 7 devices: _(**NND** - number not detected)_

- Wiko Lenny 2 - **_NND_** (Vodafone, Android 5.1)
- Samsung S5 Mini - **_NND_** (Orange, Android 6.0.1)
- Samsung S8 - **_NND_** (Vodafone, Android 8.0)
- Samsung S6 Edge - OK, Android 6.0.1
- Samsung A5 (2017) - OK, Android 7.0
- Sony Z3 - OK, Android 6.0.1
- Sony Z5 - OK , Android 7.0

 @newbie-qa do that devices marked NND have the same SIM card as one of the OK?
On some SIM cards number is not stored. the 7 devices have their own different SIMs.  Sometimes when i change SIM for OK devices, it does not reflect the correct number but after restart of ADB, it works and displays the correct number. For NND devices, ADB restart does not fix the problem :(

I was able to verify after making this change that my phones would get properly registered and no errors were shown when unplugging / plugging back in.

This fixes #907.  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

I have STF up and running just fine without any issues. It is very stable and works great. My only question is if there is a way to refresh STF without having to restart it to pick up new phones. Whenever I plug in a new phone, STF attempts to read it and then throws some error. To get it to register, I have to close the CLI and re-run STF to get the server back up which then reads the phone just fine. 

Note: I am running stf local - public IP (which I know is not recommended) for testing reasons. 

Outside of having to restart STF to pick up newly plugged in devices, the system works great. Thanks for all the hard work put into this. 
 I've had these exact symptoms but had assumed it was my wonky docker deployment. Ill get it all hooked up again and get dumps of all the logs when I can. My issue had todo with how I was passing the USB devices in docker and not a problem with STF itself.  I downloaded the stf files from the github and made a few UI changes and I want to deploy STF locally with the UI changes I have made. How do I do this?  I am using docker-compose with a Raspberry Pi. One device is not shown within openSTF, I see no logs about it.

**What is the issue or idea you have?**

 When I do a lsusb, I can only see IDs, not the device.
```Bus 001 Device 004: ID 274c:0101```
dmesg gives me some information:
```[    2.152638] usb 1-1.3: New USB device found, idVendor=274c, idProduct=0101```
For another issue, I saw that you advised to use
```DEBUG=adb* stf local```
to get more information.
I tried that, but it did not change anything:
```services:
    stf:
        image: openstf/stf-armv7l
        privileged: true
        container_name: openstf
        depends_on:
            - db
            - adb
        network_mode: host
        environment:
          - DEBUG=adb*
        command: "stf local --public-ip 192.168.0.12"
```

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**
Yes, it does happen only on one specific device.
I added
```# MyDeviceName
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="274c", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0101", MODE="0666" GROUP="plugdev", SYMLINK+="android%n"
```
in /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules but that didn't change anything (yes, I rebooted).

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
After modifying my install with what I found [there](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9210152/set-up-device-for-development-no-permissions), I managed to get the device available under my Linux machine:
```$ adb devices -l
List of devices attached

A0F6FD7290AA           device usb:1-1.3 product:myproduct model:myModel device:myDevice
```
Unfortunately, it still can't be seen under Docker. If someone knows what I should modify in the Docker image, please let me know.

I have modified the ADB image, replicating the changes I had made on my machine hosting Docker:
```
ADD files/51-android.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
RUN chmod 644 /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules && chown root. /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
```
but that did not make a single change in the device detection.

**What is the expected behavior?**

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

**Please run `stf doctor` and paste the output here.**

 Thanks @sorccu . The device is not a phone (my specialty, plugging in Android devices which are not phones), and is not powered by USB.
So there is nothing to change in the STF image, nor ARM image (except the ADB version maybe). If this works on the Raspberry machine directly, it should work within Docker, am I right? Thanks a lot @sorccu , will do.  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

Here are the results when I run `stf doctor` on websocket container.  I have Rethink Cluster running. I am wondering if this is happening because of ProtoBuf is not installed inside of the websocket container. But the error messages point to the ProtoBuf.js path. I don't know what is causing this disconnection error.

Thanks.
 I've just started setting up openSTF and more as tech demo then a "prod" ready service for QA but the issues I've run into with docker swarm is privileged containers aren't support on docker swarm, the way around this is to make a docker image that loads the privileged images. This is all doable what I'm trying to get going is two distributed system one for the reThinkDB so thats distributed throughout the stack and then also have the stf cluster distribute throughout so the load balanced, My theory is hopefully everything should be pretty smooth if the services can use the resources of every device. I'm doing all this testing on a raspberry pi 3 B with raspberry pi 2s as the worker nodes. Hi @mr-sour,

I was subscribing to this issue since I also want to implement openSTF on Docker Swarm. I just started to learn Docker and Docker Swarm and some sort of guide would be super helpfull. Could you please share how you implemented STF with Docker Swarm?  @sonamoo I have only been able to implement each device as a standalone instance of openSTF but though swarmmode with services (I guess if your using standalone swarm thats a whole different can of worms) I can get a gist of what I've done so far it not that bad when you break it down. Like I mentioned the only thing that throws a wrench in things is the lack of privileged containers in swarm mode I talked with them about this and I'm not sure they're gonna get that implemented anytime soon. I've got a workaround from the docker team that I'm sure if you dug around enough you would find on their github but Ill get that in there to. Like I said this is more of a tech demo and I dont even have all the parts yet (just ordered a pico cluster) So development might be a little slow for a couple of days here. @mr-sour, @sorccu,  Thanks! I will also be learning docker swarm and trying to implement this. I will probably do this on the weekends. I will update here when I find solutions.    can stf run on android? if not ,why?has anyone done this? 
I want use tablet （Android） control several devices . i still have no idea.  I could be wrong, but I think porting stf to Android could prove as difficult as porting Linux to your tablet.
A Raspberry Pi 3B+ is not the recommended platform, but it works for me. At $35, you can't go wrong...  **What is the issue or idea you have?**

You know, once I learn a thing or two about NodeJS  Is there any way for me for Remote control  device from the phone devices not browser?  The license file says that STF is under Apache license 2.0, but some packages (i.e packery, hipchatter) used by STF are under GPLv2 and GPLv3 licenses, is it means that STF should be under the more restrictive license, that is GPL ?

What is the impact for external contributors ?

On behalf of my company, I would like to contribute to OpenSTF to add some rich features, but I saw in the code that no contributor has added their author copyright, is it the rule in the OpenSTF project or is it possible to add our copyright ?

Thanks. What about also my third question relating to copyright ?

Regarding licenses, I found a tool named 'npm-consider' (cf. https://github.com/delfrrr/npm-consider) which analyses dependencies of dependencies from package.json:
```
$ npm-consider install
stf@3.3.0
Packages  1373

          Protective         2      
          Uncategorized      49     
          Weakly Protective  2      
          Public Domain      3      
? What is next? Details
```
Here is an extract of the console output:
```
hipchatter@0.3.2, Protective, GPL-2.0, dependencies: async@~0.2.9, needle@^1.0.0
xmldom@0.1.27, Weakly Protective, LGPL
xmldom@0.1.19, Weakly Protective, LGPL
stf-device-db@1.2.0, Protective, CC-BY-SA-4.0
```
But it exists a general tool named 'scancode' (cf. https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit) which can be used to analyse deeper the code both for npm and bower packages. For instance, I found some npm packages as 'adm-zip' or 'aws-sdk' which are published under permissive licenses but including 'js' files under protective licenses...

At bower side, I just find 'packery' under GPLv3 license but sure a deeper inspection has to be made.


 The GPLv2 does not infect other projects unless you actually link them into your program (ie shared object).  So for a shared object the library needs to be licensed LGPL -- that is the specific exception included in the LGPL, that the GPL will not infect programs linked to the library. Virtually zero shared objects are licensed GPL since that prevents them from being used in anything other than a GPL program.

The accepted wisdom is that the GPLv2 does not infect over a Javascript module boundary.  This is due to Javascript being a dynamic language.  The GPL only applies to a derived work, a dynamic linkage is not considered a derived work.  Of course none of this is truly settled by going to court, so if you are paranoid you should avoid GPL licensed Javascript modules. You migiht also simply ask the project owner to switch to the LGPL since the LGPL is always safe.

Also note that dev tools have no impact on the license of the output they produce unless they are inserting code. gcc contains a specific exception allowing free use of the run-time it inserts. 

The GPLv3 license of Packery is probably a significant licensing problem (which is why most people avoid GPLv3). I would recommend removing it from the project. Looking at the website, this is likely someone who is going to show up demanding that a commercial license be bought. 

 I am concerned about the Packery module because they have commercial licensing terms in big bold letters right on their home page. They have also picked a very unfriendly open source license as a means of forcing almost everyone to buy a license.  These guys have paid $$$ to lawyer to write all of this....
https://packery.metafizzy.co/license.html Everything else seemed reasonable. Given that Packery is an old MIT version, there shouldn't be any obvious problems.

As for the initial poster's concern with copyright assignment, I'd suggest assigning copyright to the STF team. The only reason for doing this is to make it possible to change the license later without locating all of the copyright holders (which can be a real problem 20 years later). Of course you don't have to do this, it just makes things easier. And for sure the contributor can take credit for their contributions in the files.

An example of this causing a problem is the Linux kernel. The GPL used by the kernel is silent on patent licenses. It would be very beneficial to the kernel to add a patent license clause, but it is impossible to locate all 3,000 of the contributors to get permission to do that change. 

IANAL but I have been dealing with various open source license issues for decades (I'm one of those 3,000 kernel contributors).  I do wish that open source licensing was easier for people to work with. Thanks for these precious answers !
@jonsmirl, what do you mean about "take credit for their contributions (of contributors) in the files" and in the same time "assigning copyright to the STF team" ? In practice, may you give an example of what form should take such a contribution in a file ? You can always write a note into the file saying something like "This code contributed by Acme Corp, www.acme.com". There is no problem with letting contributors let people reading the code know where they are if they are looking for consulting business. There is no legal meaning to the acknowledgement comment, it can be anything you feel is appropriate.  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **What is the issue or idea you have?**
First of all, this piece of software is amazing and the support the devs provide is top notch.  The issue my team and I are experiencing is our devices are recognized by STF but all of them are disconnected.  Our deployment is in google cloud using kubernetes, all 3 devices are on connected to my desktop which is running on MacOS high sierra, and we followed the deployment instructions as best we could for our situation.  We can see the dashboard when we enter our url and the service will often 'disconnect: socket connection lost' and the we have to reconnect.  Also, I entered the adb key in the settings.  Can we get a hint at where to be looking to fix out issue?  Do we need to run adb connect so each device connects to the outside server? Please let me know if you need any more information and I'll be happy to provide it.  Our deployment is based on this [script.](https://github.com/dimasaryo/stf-k8s)

**What is the expected behavior?**
All of our devices are connected and behave gracefully.

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**
stf local works fine on my local machine.  that's why we decided to deploy.

thank you for your help. Hey did you fix your issue, i have pretty much the same deployment as well, and i am trying it hard to connect.
 yes, just fixed it today.  so what we found out is deployment cannot be run on macOS by itself since it has connection issues with android just like sorccu said in many of his posts.  our solution was to follow these instructions from [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29776333/mobile-devices-under-mac-os-x-to-connect-to-docker).  Then deploy with docker using this [project](https://github.com/nikosch86/stf-poc/blob/master/.env).  Worked like a charm. hi thanks, but i am good with the setup but when i try to connect using the provider command my devices are getting ignored, regardless of using docker. I have disabled all the firewalls but still they dont work.
can you suggest something.  For example:
**Server 1:** 
[Docker] 3 container
1. docker run -d --name rethinkdb -v /srv/rethinkdb:/data --net host rethinkdb rethinkdb --bind all --cache-size 8192 --http-port 8090
2. docker run -d --name adbd --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb --net host sorccu/adb:latest
3. docker run -d --name stf --net host openstf/stf stf local --public-ip 192.168.1.100

1. docker run -d --name adbd --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb --net host sorccu/adb:latest

anyone can help on this?
 fixed the issue.
  I use follow common start stf, it is ok while accessing with ip(eg.http://192.168.1.16:7100), I login once，then I no need to login. But while accessing with domain name(eg.http://phone.tecent.com), I need to login while using http://phone.tecent.com. Please help me!!!
stf local --public-ip='本机IP' --auth-type ldap --auth-options '["--ldap-url","$LDAP SERVER URI", "--ldap-bind-dn","$LDAP BIND DN","--ldap-search-dn","$LDAP BASE DN", "--ldap-bind-credentials","$LDAP BIND DN PWD", "--ldap-search-class","user", "--ldap-search-field", "mail"]'  Hi,
is it possible to run adb on two different ports ex port 5037 and 5038
If yes, how do I configure stf to listen on port 5038.
I require this because I have another console based application that uses minicap and runs on port 5037 Thank for your response, the reason I want to run two instances on separate ports is because the other application also use minicap and this is causing the device to hang some time  I can't get `stf` installed on my mac os:
```

```
It seems bufferutil version should be bumped... `$ npm -v`
`6.1.0` I believe it's related to:
https://github.com/websockets/bufferutil/issues/96 I faced the same issue and managed to find a workaround. Still have to remember though. :-(
I am now using Docker because it's easier to set up. @gounthar what's your workaround? I should have written it. I only found a few hints in my shell history.
```
npm install npm@latest -g
sudo ln -s ../../lib/libSystem.B.dylib libgcc_s.10.5.dylib
sudo ln -s ../../lib/libSystem.B.dylib libgcc_s.10.4.dylib
npm install -g bufferutil@1.3.0
xcode-select -p @gounthar didn't work for me. It's not a blocker to me though, I can use docker stf.
Last version of `bufferutil` is 3.0.5 btw Sorry for that. I know I had a look at https://github.com/websockets/bufferutil/issues/17 for some commands I tried and that I had to go back to Node 8.  I have installed stf ,it runs very well. But I need to modify some source, could you tell me how to debug the code? When I debug stf local with webstorm as follow,
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26616673/40582599-98bcb42a-61ad-11e8-8471-773befc5ab25.png)

 hello, what the debug  software call? I find somewhere to debug but I can't .  hi
After I deploy the stf code on the server, some computers can access the server pages correctly,but some computers displays blank when access device control page,like the picture below; Do you know the reason?

ISSUE : I am deploying open STF using https://github.com/openstf/setup-examples and then using https://github.com/openstf/setup-examples/blob/master/docs/coreos_fleet.md

All installation is fine but when i start configuring FleetCTL, i export FLEETCTL_ENDPOINT=http://172.17.8.101:2379
and then run fleetctl list-machines command, to see list of VMs, i am getting following error

Can u please help me on how to start etc service or how to get ACL to access 172.17.8.101:2379 Hi @thinkhy So, I tried running etcd and then checked etcd cluster health and I got "member 8e9e05c52164694d is healthy: got healthy result from http://localhost:2379
cluster is healthy"

but still getting some issue "Error retrieving list of active machines from fleet API (Get http://domain-sock/fleet/v1/machines?alt=json: dial unix /var/run/fleet.sock: connect: no such file or directory)
Possible issues:
  etcd is unhealthy and/or lost quorum
  connection cannot be established to any etcd server" on fleetctl list-machines

I also tried to ssh into cores -01 and found that etcd.service is not present

So how should I go about it now? Kindly help  hi, there

we are now deploying STF and it worked out fine. 
<img width="609" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37066792/39609325-bb84af70-4f7a-11e8-870f-b05821fb3609.png">

As the above figure shows,  we want to figure it out that whether remote debugging support user authentication or not ? If not, does it mean that after copying the public key, by just typing "**adb connect IP:port**" provided by the figure, a user can connect the smartphone remotely without any authentication even if they are not logging in STF and are not occupying any device?

yours, 
David   <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

**What is the issue or idea you have?**

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**
No it happens on most of the devices I have.

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**

- When pressing the get button on the UI it fires the command : wire.LogcatStartMessage
- I added a log on  **function entryListener(entry) ** and it is logging for the first time the logcat is pressed.
- After stopping the wire.LogcatStopMessage is fired.
- Next time onwards the start message is fired and then the entry log is never fired.
- Works again after plugging out and plugging the device back again (or group.kick() and join() again may be.!, I din't try this though) 
**EDIT:Also, the device.kick and device.join doesn't solve that problem as well.**

**What is the expected behavior?**
The log should be retrieved when pressing the get logs button in the UI and the stf backend should return the logs from the entryListener().

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

 Thanks @thinkhy. I used the OrangePi_OnePlus_Android_7.0_en_gapps_v1.3.img ROM.
I'm trying to compile a version myself (but not with much luck for the time being).
I don't know how to start, but I will see if I can make anything to get it to work for this board/ROM. Wow, thanks a lot! I will have a look at the security option if it ever exists. This issue seems to be similar to: https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/599 
This part of the log:

```
suggests that there is no touchscreen.
At the time of writing multitouch capability is required for minitouch to work. Yes, it looks like the source of the error is the same. I was thinking of buying an Odroid C2 to get rid of this issue as this card is way more supported than Orange Pi, but thanks to #599, I know it won't solve this issue.
I'll clone the minitouch repo, and see what I can do.
Thanks @koral-- . @gounthar please provide the steps you made to install it on pi @nateby : sorry for not understanding. What do you want to know? How I installed Android on the OrangePi One Plus, or how I installed openSTF?
Thanks. @gounthar I noticed that you made it with docker and docker-compose on a Raspberry 3B,and it works flawlessly,I try hard and useless,I can't find docker images for 32bits and ARM,please provide some steps
I highly appreciate your help, thanks.  There's not much effort put into this: just a few images modified and built on the pi. I'll try to set it up in a repo and give you the link. Thanks for your interest @nateby. @nateby : I wrote a quick documentation about my use of hypriotOS and openSTF local there: https://github.com/gounthar/openstf-armv7-behind-proxy-with-hypriot.
I haven't done much, just gathered some information.
I will someday write another one regarding hypriotOS and openSTF provider (with some images of my own). @gounthar thanks for your help^o^ ^o^ ^o^  hello,guys!!!
It's my first time to use STF to manager mobile phone, STF show devices normality when I connect devices by usb, but STF can not show the devices when I connect devices by ip:port.
I connect devices with this command:
```
adb connect <host>[:<port>]
```
Is there a way to show the devices connected by ip:port ?
  I have some question do this openstf can control 1 process in all mobile?

For example:
If i have 50 phone number with the some model and the position of apps placement are the same position on display.. But I want to control only 1 phone and others will follow the same flow... can it do that?  Can you give me some clue..  Hello,

I am attempting to make some modifications to OpenSTF and am encountering some issues when trying to interact between classes. This appears to be due to STF-Syrup's dependency injection blocking functions from an external scope. 

In short, I would like to be able to reference functions in _bar.js_ (Uses Syrup) FROM _foo.js_ (Does not use Syrup). I can successfully require and assign _bar.js_, but instead of a typical class object, I receive a SerialSyrup object that util.inspect shows is constructed like this:

```
SerialSyrup {
  options: {},
  body: [Function],
  dependencies:
   [ SerialSyrup {
       options: {},
       body: [Function],
       dependencies: [],
       resolved: null } ],
  resolved: null }
```
  
Every attempt to reference functions that exist within the "module.exports" block of _bar.js_ fails with "...is not a function" when called from _foo.js_ . Is there a way I can reach inside this block, other than totally refactoring _foo.js_ to be a Syrup module and importing _bar.js_ as a dependency?

PS: Reposting from [/openstf/stf-syrup](https://github.com/openstf/stf-syrup/issues/3), as that issue page appears dead.
 Same issue here. Attempting to modify the packages auto-cleanup to be scheduled every few days. For that I've written a simple cron that injects cleanup.js. 

```
module.exports = syrup.serial()
  .dependency(require('./cleanup'))
  .define(function(options, cleanup) {
    var log = logger.createLogger('device:plugins:cleanupCron')
    return {
      uninstallPackagesCron: function() {
        nodeSchedule.scheduleJob(CLEANUP_EVERY_SUNDAY, function() {
          log.info('Cleanup job launched')
          // *logic here*
        })
      }
    }
  })
```
Cron is then required in app/index.js with the server startup
```
var cleanupCron = require('./../device/plugins/cleanupCron')
```
And what I get from logging the cleanupCron is the whole SerialSyrup object with no way to reach the uninstallPackagesCron function
```
 SerialSyrup {
  options: {},
  body: [Function],
  dependencies: 
   [ SerialSyrup {
       options: {},
       body: [Function],
       dependencies: [Array],
       resolved: null } ],
  resolved: null }
```  Touch point doesn't match between the touch on STF Control and the touch on Real Device.
Please see the bellow picture, mobile is OPPO R15.

Any solution? @sorccu

 @sorccu thank you S.K. for the reply, I'll try if it was fixed. Once I've done, will update result here. @sorccu thanks sk，looks working fine.  I installed app and run stf, after sometime it removes this app. If not using stf, app still there forever. This happen on all my devices (7 devices).

 @sorccu some CPU and Memory info can be retrieved from filesystem /proc, we may need a PR for this feature ...  Ok, after many tries I found a way to solve this by reinstalling npm packages  We tried switching to Https but we don't see any change in behavior.
Observation :- stf screen gets immediately refreshed when we refresh the browser.

Now we need to refresh stf screen on browser every time after performing action on device so that both should remain in sync.

Please let us know if there is any parameter we need to update for auto refreshing browser screen. hey guys, i am trying to set this up as well. but i am having trouble setting up the provider client in my remote laptop, i tried everything but in the end it shows that the devices are ignored. can you guy help me on this.
 @habeebshk Can you post your provider file.  In this way #47 , the system prompts "Missing or rejected email address Retry". Must OAuth support openid? For now, our OAuth doesn't support it.

  Hi!
I've set up stf locally on PC (Ubuntu 16.04) with connected Android device and it works well. `stf doctor` answers all is OK.
Now I'm trying to re-run stf with remote access from another PC (Windows 10)

Ubuntu network is

Windows network is

I'm starting `stf local --public-ip 10.62.24.90` on Ubuntu PC and going to `http://10.62.10.16:7100` on Windows. But this link redirects me onto `http://10.62.24.90:7100/auth/mock/` with message "This site can’t be reached"

Tell me please, is there ability to use stf from another local subnetwork? Or maybe did I some errors during its set up? Clients can see each other.

do you mean this [DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md)? where is `--allow-remote true`? Thanks, I've forgot about it.  As the title say, now I have two STF Server on two machines,Also they connect to the RethinDB Cluster(share data),but some trouble with me ,how I can  let two STF Server share the devices?once I have one stf server, I use stf provider xxxx to connect devices, but now two server how to share the devices?
Thx a lots. @thinkhy  thanks for your reply。I want to make devices on one server，and usable on two STF web UI。Can it Work？Such STF1 and STF2 can show all devices(devices from one server)，users also can use devices from STF1 or STF2. STF1 and STF2 share the devices Pool. apology for my poor English why two stf servers but extend triproxys? you are trying to solve the performance issue, right? @BenZii yes, it's workable for STF to make devices be used across servers. For example, you can deploy your devices on server A, then connect with these devices thru IP and port on server B.  I have an application that uses ZMQ Pub-Sub Model. I have an algorithm in my sub side that if the socket remains idle for 40 seconds it should disconnect and reconnect again. Now, I want to remove this algorithm. Instead i want to use TCP KeepAlive Packets so that my socket does not remain idle  and thus my sub does not disconnect and connect frequently. 
Please find my code below:

zmq_socket_t socket;
socket = zmq_socket(_zmq_context, ZMQ_PUB);

int tcp_keepalive = 1, tcp_keepalive_idle = 25;

 if(zmq_setsockopt(socket, ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE, &tcp_keepalive, sizeof(tcp_keepalive))) {

Please help me on this ??  I am not able to achieve my target. Am i missing anything? No its not related to STF.  after the device is running, about 15 minutes, it will automatically turn off the control, there is no log  Hi, there

We are now deploying STF in production mode(App role and provider role separately). Taking disaster recovery into consideration, we want to double stf services for the APP role. We tried to configure that by ourself by doubling triproxy app (each with two processors connected), triproxy dev(each with  2 processors connected), and modifying the configuration of the reaper, websocket, api and the  provider. Then we found we can not control the smartphone remotely on the webpage. 

I want to know Is it possible to run  same stf services on a single server ? Looking forward for your advices! 

In addition, also provide the statements for starting the above mentioned STF services using docker:

yours David
 not change anything about nginx. Should I change the configuration of nginx under such condition? yes, you can add more instances in nginx config. I am trying to do the same configuration as this one, which has more than one tri-proxy-dev. I encounter the same problem which cannot control the device remotely. It seems like only half of event messages can go through zmq channel to the device side.  theoretically this configuration should work, couldn't figure out what is the issue.  nginx configuration does't seem to affect anything with this configuration.  @David-gulu have you solved the issue? @zr0827  not yet. We are trying using k8s for redundancy.  I have read Dockerfile,only have two lines use -y option.
someone can tell me why occurs this error?

can you also post your Dockerfile here.  Hi! I am able to run stf locally but when I am trying to access from another machine, device screen is all greyed out. I'm using the mac's ip on which stf is set up locally. please suggest how to access STF from another machine. I read some other related issues and its mentioned to do proper deployment to access. Is there any other way or have to follow deployment guide only?
Thanks!

 Many thanks for your reply and quick fix.. I will test n let u know. Thanks it works for me now.. :) m closing this issue  Hi, there.

We deployed Openstf in production mode(APP role, database role, proxy role on one server and provider role on another server). When tried to install an app of small size(20MB), everything worked out fine. Yet when tried installing apks of relatively bigger sizes(100MB above), the progress bar was stuck there whereas the apk activity was launched successfully in the webpage (the following figure).

Worse still, sometimes the following situation came up as well(the following figure). After stucking for  a period of time, the apk activity was launched successfully in the webpage. In addition at the same time  a hint came up to inform the socket connection was lost.

I want to know under what situation will trigger the prompting of  "socket connection was lost" and are there any advices to help solve this problem?

 Thanks for your reply @sorccu. Our client is a Windows machine, and  the stf running on 7100. Through our research, the behavior of "socket connection was lost" seems to be clear. When it comes to separation mode, the performance of the client as well as the browser itself truly becomes the bottleneck. When pushing large apks, Firefox 55 and above will stuck for a while. When stuck happens, the browser itself will not response any operation. If the performance of the client is relatively poor, then the stuck period is longer than it should be, which may be regarded as connection lost at the STF server side. Testing shows that Chrome 34 is a good choice.

The progress bar still was  stuck there when using Chrome 34, yet socket connection lost never happened again,  and the  apk activity was launched successfully. We will try to figure out why progress bar was stuck and reply.
 Thanks for your reply @sorccu. We will try your advices. We  noticed poorxy when investigating stf local mode. Currently we are not using stf local. we are now using multiple docker containers  to run each stf service individually and using nginx for url mappings. We just use the same port 7100 with nothing more than that.  Team,

Is there any possibility to add object spy feature with STF, because it will be really useful for the team to launch the device and click on object spy to view the android elements for the automation purposes.

We can use Macaca's app inspector to do that, or we can also use Appium's UIautomator feature to do that.

Here is the link to Macaca's object spy.

  @terminalone I'll try my best. Recently I have been busy on other urgent project ... @thinkhy please also share the scripts with me, thanks  Expecting the great project to support Android P... 
When can support Android P?  Has anyone successfully installed OpenSTF on a Raspberry Pi? And more specifically on Cent OS 7? I am not very Linux savy, but have done a few minor installs in the past and am trying to put OpenSTF on a Pi. Does anyone have instructions for how to go about doing that?
Thanks! @thinkhy : Yep, you can https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/docker-comes-to-raspberry-pi/
However, the question is why not using the "local deployment" way only? Install node, "npm -g" install stf and run it? I managed to get OpenSTF running on the Pi. Utilizing Pacman to get the dependencies and then NPM to install stf. I had to make some changes to the npm default folder because I was getting a lot of permissions errors. Now I am having trouble getting the phones to actually connect. What is required to be on the phones besides USB debugging enabled? If I can get it working I'll rebuild it with instructions.
Do I need to so something with the keys to enable the phones to connect? Thanks,

 Also I am wondering how people are running the RethinkDB and STF on the same machine, everytime I run RethinkDB I am unable to then run the STF Local command. My current work (due to being in a minimal OS) is to run RethinkDB on the actual Raspberry Pi terminal, then I SSH into the Raspberry Pi from another computer and run stf local --public-ip 192.168.60.23 --allow-remote

To then run STF I had to run:

Then I SSH'd into the pi from a different machine and issued this:

stf local --public-ip 192.168.60.23 --allow-remote

Then I was able to access it remotely at:
http://x.x.x.x:7100/

This is more or less what I did. Also had to allow it through the firewall because it was being blocked. You mean by running rethinkdb and stf on the same machine that once you start rethinkdb it blocks your terminal and you cannot execute any more commands on that terminal unless you kill rethinkdb?
That would also imply that if you log out of the Pi or lose the network connection, STF gets terminated?
If so, have a look at "screen": https://www.howtoforge.com/linux_screen. It lets commands continue to run and be sent to the background so you can keep on working on the same terminal and/or log off Made it with docker and docker-compose on a Raspberry 3B with latest Raspbian.

**In the process of using STF, I found a Bug  which is necessary.**
**After it is finished using the device, minitouch and screenshots can still work, which is not common sense**

Reproduce the steps:
1. When the device is out of time or click to stop using on the list page, the operation page will pop up a box indicating that the device has finished using ,like this:
![capture_201836_103046](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23167666/37011229-2a5179c6-212a-11e8-9ee9-6f27f0f253cd.jpg)

2. Click on the external area of the box, the box will disappear immediately, the page still remain in the operation page.

3. Now operating the device display area (although there is no image display), the actual device is still responding to the minitouch operation, in addition, the screenshot button can still correctly capture screenshots.

  Hi, there

I have read through the deployment document and deployed OpenSTF in production mode, with (app & database role) and the provider role deployed on two separated servers. One server ran the app.service, app-auth.service and other necessary services according to the deployment document  ,
and the other server only ran the provider service and adbd service. The deployment was base on docker.

At  the beginning, the overall system worked properly, yet , if we just left the connected phones there with no one using them after a specific period of time (seems to be 40 mins) , then a problem occured.  When we clicked the "use" button,  the screen monitoring part on the webpage turned out to be gray and we were not able to do anything to such phones, including checking status infos of them.  We tried to replug these devices, and found that they were offline on the webpage whereas connected when checking using "adb devices" (status device). 

To best of our knowledge, we have tried everything we can  and find out that the problem will not disappear unless we restart the provider container.  

This problem is not happen on a specific device. We've also checked the logs of the provider container and found no difference between  the problem occured and not.

 Thanks for your advice. We will check and feedback. We checked #100, #104, #342, and #528 and finally solved the problem according to #342， by adding

-e "ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=300" 
to the below unit-files

stf-triproxy-dev

stf-processor@

the smartphones were kept idle for about 2 hours and still connectable.   A little advice here is to update the DEPLOYMENT.md and thus can help more people to avoid encountering such problem. Thank you very much. closing.  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

Hi, 

How can i know how many providers running through any tools? And is there any administrator pages that we can see some system information?

Thanks very much. thanks thanks @thinkhy

I will look into it. Please send PR.  I have two PC use the same codes, one is OK, but another when I use the Screen Capture feature it show this log.

Does anybody know the reason? i am also facing same error  hello, I'm working on a project that based on the github project,so l'm learning the stf code recently.Thank you for sharing.It’s amazing that it displays the phone screen fluently .  I haven‘t used nodejs before that，so  I have a question that why you choose nodejs to implement it? What’s the nodejs‘s advantage？
 thanks for answer.  Hi stf devs!

I'm trying to use the STF in a manner where I control the device and the dev I'm working with is connecting with the device via adb connect to see the logs locally.

Is that possible scenario? When we try that, dev is able to connect, but doesn't see the device in the list. WE can do that via myself going physically to the device but that takes a while each time a change is pushed.

Unfortunately remote control by the dev is not possible because of huge delays (USA -> Europe). In our env sometimes that dialog does not appear on the web UI. But navigating to settings and adding the key manually helps. It also happens that users mistype their email-address and as such do not have the ADB keys in the same account  Hi!
**in stf the touch point not match the real device screen.  Please look at the picture，however there is a law**

**no errors or warnings in the `stf local` output**

**`stf doctor` no problem **

what should be modified?

 @sorccu Thank you very much!  Hi there, 
Actually this is not a issue for the project, it's about the webpage of openstf.
I noticed in https://openstf.io/, 'feature' section, you guys used a phone picture.
But why the picture looks so much like a IPhone ?
Could you please replace it with a real android device picture?

 Cool, thanks!  I try to run stf on localhost and it worked till now, for some reason when I hit stf local and go to the localhost:7100 it redirect me to the http://localhost:7100/auth/mock/ which require some username/pwd.

It would be nice if we can add a reverse proxy so that we can connect to devices using {serial}.something.tld e.g adb connect deviceserial93.stf.farm.com this way adb connect will be on the default port

  Did you try the teamview remote control, how it can share screen view without shell? Could you show me the API detail information?  @sorccu on Android 8.0  it's not going to find a process with 'ps' when  the process isn't running OR the process is not attached to current terminal's PTY. So we can't give up running the extra command 'ps -lef' just because ps works and there were no matches in the output. Consider the following case(Android version >= 8.0, Manufactor: Google, Huawei, XiaoMi, Oppo).:

```shell
ps
USER           PID  PPID     VSZ    RSS WCHAN            ADDR S NAME                       
shell        15491  1137   10204   2056 0          7f8007a898 R ps
ps -elf
UID            PID  PPID C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root             1     0 0 03:08:24 ?     00:00:21 init
root             2     0 0 03:08:24 ?     00:00:00 [kthreadd]

root             7     2 0 03:08:24 ?     00:00:26 [rcu_preempt]
root             8     2 0 03:08:24 ?     00:00:00 [rcu_sched]
root             9     2 0 03:08:24 ?     00:00:00 [rcu_bh]
root            10     2 0 03:08:24 ?     00:00:38 [rcuop/0]
root            11     2 0 03:08:24 ?     00:00:00 [rcuos/0]
root            12     2 0 03:08:24 ?     00:00:00 [rcuob/0]
... ...
```

In above case, both 'ps' and 'ps -lef' can run well, but we cant only find STF related processes thru 'ps -lef'.

I will add '2>/dev/null' in next commit. Thanks for your reviewing.
 OK, gotcha. Current code has already support scenario 1 and scenario 2:
    
   1. Found matching process(es) → End here
   2. Got an empty list, found no processes of any kind whatsoever → Try again with ps -lef

For scenario 3, suggest to divide it into two cases:    

   * 3. Got a non-empty list, but did not find any matching process 
       * 3.1 list contains any process launched by root user which suggests 'ps' can output the whole process list  → End here 
       * 3.2 list just contains processes launched by non-root user which suggests 'ps' might only output processes in current terminal  → Try again with ps -lef

 Ok, I see. Thanks for the info. Thanks @thinkhy  @sorccu 
I will try for your suggestion. Please let me know if you have new patch for the issue. That would be great @sorccu . Would you update openstf/stf docker image too? I build stf environment in that way.      Hi, can you help me with problem, when i connect to device and nothing do with it, i see a lot of generated screenshots. And it will be stop, when i'll disconnect.

 Thank you very much~  It is useful :)  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->
I use the STF version 3.2.0
**What is the issue or idea you have?**
Over time of the using the stf local I noticed that the `adb devices` returns `error: protocol fault (couldn't read status): Undefined error: 0`, but if to stop the stf - `adb devices` works correctly. After rebooting the machine I can use the STF and adb again without problems.
**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
The stf was started by the command `/usr/local/bin/stf local --allow-remote --public-ip 192.168.0.214 --provider 192.168.0.214 --bind-dev-pub tcp://192.168.0.214:7114 --bind-dev-pull tcp://192.168.0.214:7116`

 @thinkhy I deployed stf depending on https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md.

I have 50 provider role machine (10 devices per provider), the devices are not connected to single machine directly. 
But I only have one app role machine, is that the problem? What is the maximum devices can connect to one stf app role? 500? 1000? Is there any practical experience with that scale?
  This contributes to the server side, see this ticket:
https://github.com/openstf/STFService.apk/issues/18
and the corresponding pull request:
https://github.com/openstf/STFService.apk/pull/20

The STFService.apk was updated to the changes in the pull request in order to be able to set and get the Bluetooth status. The .proto files have been adjusted. The functionality was very similiar implemented to the WiFi functionality. Like for WiFi, similiar buttons have been added to the Device->Automation view.

Be aware, that setting and getting the Bluetooth status is only possible with the new updated .apk, otherwise a timeout occurs. Rebased and fixed that issue  Hi,
I am using STF 3.2.0 version. and There's issues during attaching emulators to STF.
I wanted to attach android emulators on server version of centos. 
So when I ran the emulator, I used  -no-skin -no-audio -no-window options. 

I have the 2 questions for this errors. and details are described on below.
- When I clicked the device from STF main screen, Error was occurred. 
- Attaching arm based emulator was failed.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26616673/34550125-446a0a5a-f149-11e7-8751-9cab4979435d.png)

could you tell me which code can response after " scope.control.keyUp(key)"?
 @thinkhy ,thanks. I have solve the problem  Currently our device list displayed by STF looks like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3340954/34461934-c3399cba-ee38-11e7-9263-7c7271e0e7b1.png)

Some devices have unfriendly names like XT1032 and C6603 however, their market names are Moto G and Xperia Z respectively. It will be nice feature to include those market names in STF UI.

There is an official list of Android devices maintained by Google: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1727131?hl=en and there are Android libraries which map model names to market names e.g.: https://github.com/jaredrummler/AndroidDeviceNames or https://github.com/tslamic/AndroidDeviceNames
 What is approx. price and what else will be included (if any)?  While below 'DELETE request' disconnects adb successfully.
> DELETE http://xx.xx.xx.xx:7100/api/v1/user/devices/xxxxxxxx/remoteConnect

Below 'POST request' doesn't do anything but shows "remoteConnectUrl" 
> POST http://xx.xx.xx.xx:7100/api/v1/user/devices/xxxxxxxx/remoteConnect
'{
    "success": true,
    "remoteConnectUrl": "xx.xx.xx.xx:7405"
}'

 I expected this request to do this:
>adb connect xx.xx.xx.xx:7405

Is it a bug or intended result?


Please run stf doctor and paste the output here.

Thank you very much.
  Hello!
STF is a great tool , thank you!

I have a question.

I want to get the device on the left screen as DOM.
Because I want to operate the screen of the smartphone with selenium.
Do you know how to do it?
Or if you know another method other than selenium please tell me... Thank you very match!

I want to controll the pre-installed application on andoroid-OS.
For example, to make a call from a phone-application which pre-installed, etc.

Can I use appium with STF?  Could not locate the bindings file. Tried:

 Thanks @sorccu   Sometimes apps requires a device having some minimal OpenGL ES version. This PR adds corresponding column in device list and field in API.

Version is always in format: `<major>.<minor>`. If undefined it falls back to `0.0` to be consistent with [GL_ES_VERSION_UNDEFINED](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/FeatureInfo.html#GL_ES_VERSION_UNDEFINED) and to be always parsable as a float. @sorccu what about reviewing this PR?
PS
Sorry, if this comment is too offensive but I haven't found any info that reminders like this post are unwelcome.  Cool, thanks :)  Adds option to control SAML callback URL explicitly, similarly to oauth2 unit. Thanks!    INF/util:procutil 13197 [*] Forking "/usr/lib/node_modules/stf/lib/cli migrate"

Thanks for your patient and suggestion. @sorccu   ### I setup the STF follow the step in README.md, and my stf version is 3.2.0
### So, when I finished setup, I connect my Nexus6 use USB, and start stf with the command `stf  local`.
## Then I open my FireFox, and type in  http://127.0.0.1:7100, after I input the username and email. it came out this mistake:

### and when I close it and open the control tap, it like this:

### the stf log seems everything is OK!

## But, It is strange that when i use safari to open the url, it's OK, every thing goes well.

# do you have any idea about this ? @thinkhy FireFox Quantum 57.0.1 @thinkhy I tried remove all the plugin and restart the firefox, but stil cannot work  I have to get hold of UDID so that I can use it in my automation. However when I pick the UDID from adb devices output it does not seem to work.

 hi sorccu,
any clue about this issue Thanks buddy. which machine do you recommend.I have a Mac mini for now. Hi Sorccu,
it worked on other machine. Not sure what went wrong with this one. I will revisit it later.
Thanks for your help!!! 
Cheers,
Gaurav
  Is there any consideration for audio synchronization  on stf ?
  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

**What is the issue or idea you have?**

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**

**What is the expected behavior?**

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

**Please run `stf doctor` and paste the output here.**
 Thanks for your reply，but my STF service have no way  connect with the Android Machine ..  Where to use  "allow-remote"?  Adds option to control screen resetting when user releases device. Resolves #722. +1 for this feature please. I also have a use case where I need the device left in the same state after automation Yes, my editors and IDEs actively fight me with this formatting. Sorry for overlooking that.

PS. Could you, please, take a look at #778 as well? No problem and thank you for your work!  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->
Yes, Using STF v3.1.0 from npm

**What is the issue or idea you have?**
Samsung devices will be lost and offline after no one use for a long time(e.g. 24hours). Re-plug out and in, they work again.

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**
Occured on all Samsung devices(Galaxy A7, Note 2, G900F) I owned.

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
currently I used 2 Plugable USB 2.0  7 ports with 60W power adapter hubs(the recommended one) connecting ~10 devices. I installed STF to V3.1.0 several days ago. What I found now is all samsung devices will be lost and offline if it keeps available for a long time(e.g one day). Others devices(Sony, Nexus, HUAWEI) work well. 

**What is the expected behavior?**
should not be lost automatically.

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

 Thanks @sorccu . But it seems to be a minicap compatibility issue? because on my side only samsung devices have this problems. Currently the STF runs well on the macMini except this issue. Will consider if need to move it to another linux host machine. Actually quite enjoyed the STF v3.1. thanks for the great work! @sorccu Thanks for the suggestion. I will try to test on Linux if it resolves the problem. Currently I have 13 connected devices with two Plugable USB 2.0 7 ports with 60W power adapter hubs.   Yes, on one MacMini. ok, let me try it @sorccu I tried decreasing to 6(one hub connect to only SM-G900F, another connect to 5 other brand devices), the SM-G900 still go offline after one day, while other devices work well. Anyway, i will try to use a linux device  my new huawei mate10 device with  2160x1080 pixels, which  is  a zero bezel huawei product named ALP-AL00 , shows a Non -full screen display on our stf just as my screenshot bellow . and I cannot swipe or click on the screen button either.
BTW: No setting changed after i got my device,except openning USB  debug 
screenshot on stf:

 I wanna to konw why this issue happened ?  and how to get full-sceen display? thx ···
run 'adb shell dumpsys window',  I found nothing about mDisplayId
run 'adb shell wm size', it shows just like below:

this is all my log ,please help  look like you don't have `./../../../webpack.config`

so it could be related to #651 or #40. 
i'd suggest to check these two issues for solution and give more information it it doesn't help.
 My problem is similar to #651，If I install webpack by running "sudo npm install webpack", I get the following warnings and the problem of missing webpack.config is still unresolved.

I don't know what's wrong ，please help me ,thanks Yes,i install stf from npm , sudo npm install -g stf.   But,why the log  display " Cannot find module './../../../webpack.config'  " My problem was resolved. I ran **npm install -g stf**  and  sudo chown the directory
everything went well.

  Why the `screen-jpeg-quality` option is not available in stf local mode while it is available in stf provider mode ? Shame on me it was obvious :-)
Thanks !  I'm running STF using Docker. I have one VM in the app and db role and one physical machine in the provider role. I also have HTTPS reverse proxy on another machine. After setting up everything and connecting a device to provider, I'm getting this error when opening STF and logging in:
![STF screenshot with error message](https://i.imgur.com/CWBDmjP.png)
And in the Developer console I see an error in when trying to establish a websocket connection:
```
Request URL:wss://stf.example.com/socket.io/?uip=10.1.90.25&EIO=3&transport=websocket
Request Method:GET
Status Code:400 Bad Request
```
In all examples here I've replaced my actual domain with stf.example.com.
I checked Nginx access logs on the VM and the request is being forwarded to the websocket service.
Here is how I started stf-app service:
```
sudo docker run -d \
  --name stf-app.service \
  --link rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service:rethinkdb \
  -e "SECRET=XXX" \
  -p 3000 \
  openstf/stf:latest \
  stf app --port 3000 \
    --auth-url https://stf.example.com/auth/ldap/ \
    --websocket-url wss://stf.example.com/
```
and the stf-websocket service:
```
sudo docker run -d \
  --name stf-websocket.service-1 \
  --link rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service:rethinkdb \
  -e "SECRET=XXX" \
  -p 3000 \
  openstf/stf:latest \
  stf websocket --port 3000 \
    --storage-url https://stf.example.com/ \
    --connect-sub tcp://10.1.2.28:7150 \
    --connect-push tcp://10.1.2.28:7170
```
The IP address is of the VM itself.
In the logs of the websocket service I do not see anything.

I'm not sure where to look or what I should additionally check. Any help is appreciated. Hi,

I am using my domain but I changed it here as an example. Also, I'm using SSL but through additional reverse proxy. I'll try to see if bypassing SSL reverse proxy helps. This is actually not working. I cannot have reverse HTTPS proxy and open websocket connection to non HTTPS endpoint.
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://devicefarm.example.com/' was loaded over HTTPS, but attempted to connect to the insecure WebSocket endpoint 'ws://10.1.2.28/socket.io/?uip=10.1.90.25&EIO=3&transport=websocket'. This request has been blocked; this endpoint must be available over WSS.
``` Is there a way to get some debug logs on the websocket service? Thanks for the tip. I also found this issue: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues/1942 and I think it's the problem with Apache reverse proxy. I'll check that as well. have the same problem... but in my case i'm using HAproxy in front of stf. 
and it is so painful to set it up. 

but, ok. will set it only for IP's. and will put simple redirect from outside. 
 yea. i fixed it for me. 

now it works with HAproxy and on the coreos with oauth.

thanks @nemanjanedic @sorccu @vbanthia  This was the issue on the Apache HTTPS Proxy. Additional rewrite rule is needed for /socket.io/ and /d/ paths.  
Hi,
Has anyone tried to authenticate the STF app using the Bearer token key generated by Settings->Keys section? (https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/API.md)

I found the thread #311 helpful (https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/311) however it requires many settings:

```
export OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_URL="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth"
export OAUTH_TOKEN_URL="https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token"
export OAUTH_USERINFO_URL="https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo"
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.apps.googleusercontent.com"
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
export OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL="http://localhost:7100/auth/oauth/callback"
export OAUTH_SCOPE="openid email"

# Now you can just run stf local without the annoying auth options.
stf local --auth-type oauth
```

I am wondering whether I can simplify these settings to make my Bearer token work. My setup has only one user and I don't want to use the mock authentication.

Appreciate your help!
 Thank you vabanthia for your explanation. In fact, I did successfully use OAUTH using Google credentials. My issue is that I embed OpenSTF in another app which already has one layer of authentication so I want something simple that allows all users who can login my app successfully can use OpenSTF without the second layer of authentication -- only one account is needed for my app and I can pass the login information in command line, no second login screen. I will look into #254 to see whether it can help. I tried #254 but it seems that it not what I need. I would need to modify STF myself to disable the login screen (one default user only) or synchronize two authentication layers so that STF authentication layer can use user credentials from my app's login information.  #353 looks good.

Many thanks for your support!  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

Adds option "--ldap-group-membership" which can take name of the group as parameter "CN=STF Users" and filter users, depending on their group. Parameter can get one or more groups.
Example
`stf local  --public-ip somecompany.insider.net -p 80 --auth-type ldap --auth-options '["--ldap-bind-credentials","ldapstfpassword","--ldap-bind-dn","CN=ldapstfuser, CN=Users, DC=company, DC=loc","--ldap-search-dn","OU=COMPANY, DC=company, DC=loc","--ldap-url","ldap://company.loc","--ldap-search-field","sAMAccountName", "--ldap-group-membership", "CN=STF Users, CN=QATeam"]'`
Here we grant access to users who are in groups STF Users and QATeam

Since LDAP can response with string (user with one group) or array (user with multiple groups) - we implemented check that handles this. @sorccu Is there any problems with this pull request? Merge, merge ;) whew...weekend in rheelm Zero. Make it fun......Make it yours.......dw.xo_ ping @sorccu Looks like we need to remake everything. Our developer who worked on this feature is not available now and won't be accessible for several months. Is it available that you accept this Pull Request and refactor it to your liking? Feature works fine now.
If not - then we will fix it when dev'll be available.  I have been trying to use STF to connect to my Android. I am able to connect, sometimes for a few minutes and sometimes only a few seconds. Following are system specs and log output.

The application will keep looping from Registered/Lost/Found until the usb cable unplugged and plugged back in. Any help is greatly appreciated. I am fairly new to nodejs so if there is something I am missing, please let me know.

Thanks I will see what I can find on the hub. When you say it is a 'Hardware issue', can you be more specific? Do you suspect that it is USB/hub related or some other device issue? What is the longest recommended USB cord? I see the one mentioned in the README is only 1.5'.  Sorry, I forgot to mention the phone batt, is only at 33%. Might things work better if the phone has a full charge? Thank you for the follow up. I am not trying to achieve stellar performance from the remote device. I have my home office in the basement and do not get cell service in the dungeon. With the help of a BT head set and your UI (using --allow-remote and wifi), I am able to make/receive calls and text messages remotely. 

By trade, I am a certified Penetration Tester so there is a definite possibility of using this solution when performing mobile device testing.  

Thanks again for your help and all of your hard work providing this FOSS solution.

Regards The maximum length of a USB connection (better: link) is 5m (= ~ 16'5"): https://superuser.com/a/64747  As stated in the title, I am trying to deal with two issues. 

First I am running on ubuntu and starting sft with: 'sft local &' for force it to the background. This works fine except when I try to do an orderly shut down, I need to run ps and kill a bunch of different processes.

Second, I started playing with stf weeks ago and am just now getting back to using it. I have forgotten the user/password to access to web UI. Is there a way to recover or reset the credentials?

Thanks FYI, I have tried deleting the stf db in rethinkdb and restarting the stf service but still cannot log in. Don't use "&" to start a process in the background if you want to cleanly shut it down later. Better use "screen" (https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) or some process manager.
For the credentials: RethinkDB has its own web UI that you can use to have a look or modify data stored  Hi,
I am using STF for a while now, but i have observed that for most of the devices it shows the default image. Only in case of Nexus 6P i was able to get the proper device image.
Can any one help me with how to make the desired changes in order to get the specific device image properly. Thanks for the quick response Simo Kinnunen. I have already forked the STF but how can we make changes to the node modules directory stf-device-db module and rebuild it in order to get the updated images of the devices. I tried doing it but in vain. So can you please suggest some way to do it.  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

**What is the issue or idea you have?**

My phone use 2.4G route to connect router. And if there are more than 15 phones connect to the same Wi-Fi hot point at the same time, then none of the phone can connect to the internet. Because of the signal interference of Wi-Fi

So can you suggest me some method to solve the interference?

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**

No, It happen to all phone if there are more than 15 phones.

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**

Connect more 15 phones to the same Wi-Fi hot point.

**What is the expected behavior?**

All phone should have connected to the internet.

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

No Error, Because it is out of stf's business.

**Please run `stf doctor` and paste the output here.**

None Thanks for your reply. But in fact I have to setup a cluster in the size of 10000 android phones. So routers make no sense. I have to deal with the signal interference of electromagnetic wave. Thanks @sorccu I will do it myself. But can you tell me wether your scale of phone cluster can be handled only by a good router? Ok Got, LTE is a really excellent solution. But in my country, Phone number must be binded with everyone's ID Card, and every person could have at most 5 Phone number. Nobody or company could have anonymous phone number.  that is b\*\*\*s\*\*t. Sure. Thanks again.  Hello!

thanks, i'll use it.   Hi all,
I can control the flow of the code to handle touch events from its device control pane to the touch plugin (stf/lib/units/device/plugins/touch/index.js). Basically, the frontend calls functions in control-service.js and control-service.js subsequently sends Websocket requests to websocket service. After that, the websocket service creates TouchXYZMessages and passes them to touch service for handling.  However, I don't know how the touch plugin interacts with the real device -- I suspect that eventually, STF needs to send some ADB commands to the device to simulate the events however I cannot find that code.
Could someone please help me on that?
Many thanks  When I click the "Automation" tab, it asks for my "Store" login (I'm assuming this means my Google Play Store login?). But when I click sign in nothing happens. What is this supposed to do?

 @dsuryadi1 @sorccu Hello guys, I had the same issue, does it have any solution? I tried to up STF with docker-compose from https://github.com/nikosch86/stf-poc/blob/master/docker-compose.yml, as I see it is latest images for STF Can you guys try to run adb from a different machine? Have you configured multiple stf servers and switched among them? 
It appears that if your local machine is registered to one stf-server(via adb-key) it doesn't register to the other server. As a consequence , adb devices does not list anything even after connection success.  One thing you can check , if your adb-keys show as registered on the stf settings page.  Basing on commented functionality and mostly the problem with issues mentioned in https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/460 and https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/349 I noticed that mostly my problem was connected with not using imagemagick. Mostly I had problem with proper converting bitmap which was collected from blob.
After changing:
var gm = require('gm')
to:
var gm = require('gm').subClass({imageMagick: true})
Screenshots bitmaps are properly displayed on stf screenshot div. There is one dependency which will need to be added, need of installation of imagemagick. Hi Simo, 

I made small investigation. Without using : 
var gm = require('gm').subClass({imageMagick: true})

http://aheckmann.github.io/gm/docs.html

I receive

 Error: Command failed: gm convert: No decode delegate for this image format (/tmp/gmYAAOaw).

Mostly looks like gm nodejs module have problem with converting jpg images stored in s/blob.

To reproduce this error you can add in:
lib/units/storage/plugins/image/task/transform.js

var gm = require('gm')
var Promise = require('bluebird')
var logger = require('../../../../../util/logger')
var request = require('request').defaults({ encoding: null });;

module.exports = function(stream, options) {
 var log = logger.createLogger('storage:plugins:image:task:transform.js')
 log.info('debug log for me')
 log.info(stream)
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    log.info("imagemagick")
    var test = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(stream))
    log.info(JSON.stringify(test.uri))
    log.info("imagemagick will continue")

    var url = test.uri.href;
    gm(request(url)).write('/tmp/reformat.jpg', function (err) {
      if (!err) {log.info('done')}
      else {log.info(err)};
   })
   
   var transform = gm(stream)
   ....

The solution works on my machine. Hmm, thats true. gm convert ad hoc on my machine did not support jpg.

luze@luze-001:~/stf/stf$ gm convert -list format | grep JPG
luze@luze-001:~/stf/stf$ gm convert -size 120x120 ~/Desktop/0657049c0062100d.jpg  -resize 120x120 +profile "*" thumbail.jpg
gm convert: No decode delegate for this image format (/home/luze/Desktop/0657049c0062100d.jpg).
but imagemagick it is.

So mostly looks like add hoc-gm is not supporting jpg. There is a workaround for not using installed local imagemagick. I found this solution:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16094875/how-do-i-configure-a-jpeg-delegate-for-graphicsmagick
`$ cd ~/source
$ wget http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz

**Description:**
During filtering devices via Battery Level or Battery Temp filer, I noticed, that results for query like:
batteryLevel: > 20

Did not return Android devices passing this criteria. The same issue I observed when I tried to filter devices using this query:
 batteryTemp: >20

STF source code checkout with : d5ab5fd83d2e9a1dab2c61dc42b0ba999a6dbb1a

**Steps to reproduce**
A)
Insert in  input tag with name="deviceFilter" this query:
batteryLevel: >50

**What is the expected behavior?**
We should expect to see only devices which battery level is bigger then 50%. But we see only devices, which body contains 50%.

B)
Insert in  input tag with name="deviceFilter" this query:
batteryTemp: <40

**What is the expected behavior?**
We should expect to see only devices which battery temp is lower then 40°C. But we see only devices, which body contains 40.

**Investigation**:
The problem is mostly connected with using text filtering for both of params: Battery Level and Battery Temp. 
stf/res/app/device-list/column/device-column-service.js: ln340

As we can see both of params are marked as TextCell. To parse them as values we might to add additional extra checking in :
stf/res/app/device-list/column/device-column-service.js: ln340

to parse those data properly by adding this part:
  , filter: function(item, filter) {
      if ( options.title == "Battery Level" || options.title == "Battery Temp" ) {
        //Exception in TextCell. We want to filter after integer values for two columns, Battery Level and Battery Temp
        var remove_unit_character = ''
        switch (options.title){
        case "Battery Level":
          remove_unit_character = "%"
          break
        case "Battery Temp":
          remove_unit_character = "°C"
          break
        }

        var parsed_value = parseInt((options.value(item)).replace(remove_unit_character,''))

        return filterOps[filter.op || '='](
            parsed_value
          , Number(filter.query)
        )
      }
      else{
        return filterIgnoreCase(options.value(item), filter.query)
      }
    }

 Hi @sorccu ,

Not to many, only 5, but I thinking about adding few more devices to my environment. I'm just playing around in different locations. I think about adding one more thing , which I'm missing in your framework. 

It will be cool to have possibilities to compute few filters queries for instance:
batteryLevel:>20 AND sdk:>20 AND name: Nexus 5

But I would like to do it everything by baby steps. The fix for filtering I added in PR:
https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/736  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->
3.1.0

**What is the issue or idea you have?**
I changed hostname of machine. 
I cleared rethinkdb data, but Location still shown old hostname.
I want to update 'Location'

 @sorccu thank you. So if hostname is changed - there is no way to "update" it, only to set manually? You could modify the data in the database directly? Thanks, issue is resolved.  Xiaomi mix 2 resolution is 2160x1080 pixels, the virtual status bar can not be displayed on stf. But Samsung S8 resolution is 2960x1440 pixels, the virtual status bar can be displayed properly.
This is Xiaomi mix2's screenshot on stf:

 XiaoMi Mix2 is a popular full-screen phone in China. I can get a new device this weekend, will try to debug this problem or provide a way for @sorccu to remote-debug this problem. The remote control tool STF can't used to remote debug itself, from this point of view, STF is not self-host :-)
I get used to using TeamView to do remote debugging, but it's indeed painful to connect across countries, network delays can't be tolerated.

Thanks for your hints, this weekend I will verify if XiaoMi Mix2 crops out the actual size of screen.
 @sorccu The culprit is the absolute height of the available display size retrieved by STFService, related code can be found in /android/view/DisplayInfo.java:

```java
    private void getMetricsWithSize(DisplayMetrics outMetrics, CompatibilityInfo compatInfo,
            Configuration configuration, int width, int height) {
        outMetrics.densityDpi = outMetrics.noncompatDensityDpi = logicalDensityDpi;
        outMetrics.density = outMetrics.noncompatDensity =
                logicalDensityDpi * DisplayMetrics.DENSITY_DEFAULT_SCALE;
        outMetrics.scaledDensity = outMetrics.noncompatScaledDensity = outMetrics.density;
        outMetrics.xdpi = outMetrics.noncompatXdpi = physicalXDpi;
        outMetrics.ydpi = outMetrics.noncompatYdpi = physicalYDpi;

        width = (configuration != null
                && configuration.screenWidthDp != Configuration.SCREEN_WIDTH_DP_UNDEFINED)
                ? (int)((configuration.screenWidthDp * outMetrics.density) + 0.5f) : width;
        height = (configuration != null
                && configuration.screenHeightDp != Configuration.SCREEN_HEIGHT_DP_UNDEFINED)
                ? (int)((configuration.screenHeightDp * outMetrics.density) + 0.5f) : height;

        outMetrics.noncompatWidthPixels  = outMetrics.widthPixels = width;
        outMetrics.noncompatHeightPixels = outMetrics.heightPixels = height;

        if (!compatInfo.equals(CompatibilityInfo.DEFAULT_COMPATIBILITY_INFO)) {
            compatInfo.applyToDisplayMetrics(outMetrics);
        }
    }
```
Width x height retrieved in above code is 1080x1980, but the actual resolution rate is 1080x2160. 

Fortunately the shell command "wm size" can output the correct value:

```
chiron:/data/local/tmp $ wm size
Physical size: 1080x2160
```

So I wrote some code to workaround this problem:

  * Add a new function getResolution in lib/util/devutil.js

```javascript

// get window size (resolution)
devutil.getResolution = function(adb, serial) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    client.shell(serial, "wm size").timeout(2 * 1000)
      .then(function processAdbOutput(output) {
        var content = ""
        var resolver = Promise.defer()

        function processData(data) {
          content += data
        }

        function errorListener(err) {
          resolver.reject(err)
        }

        function endListener() {
          var res = /(\d+)x(\d+)/.exec(content)
          if (res === null)
            reject("Can't find valid resolution rate")
          else {
            resolve({width: res[1], height: res[2]})  // get matched group
          }
        }

        output.on('data', processData)
        output.on('error', errorListener)
        output.on('end', endListener)

        return resolver.promise.finally(function () {
          output.removeListener('data', processData)
          output.removeListener('error', errorListener)
          output.removeListener('end', endListener)
        })
      })
  })
}

```
  * Invoke devutil.getResolution to get screen size in lib/units/device/plugins/service.js  
 
```javascript
    plugin.getDisplay = function(id) {
      return Promise.join(runServiceCommand(
          apk.wire.MessageType.GET_DISPLAY
        , new apk.wire.GetDisplayRequest(id)
        ), devutil.getResolution(
          adb

        )
        .timeout(10000)
        .then(function(data, resolution) {
          var response = apk.wire.GetDisplayResponse.decode(data)

          if (response.success) {

              )
            }
          }
          throw new Error('Unable to retrieve display information')
        })
    }

Til now STF can support XiaoMi Mix2 perfectly.

 @sorccu Thank you for reviewing my code! I will fix the bug soon. I've applied the code for almost 90 devices covering 20 brands(Android 4.2~8.0), it works well.

BTW, this week I will contact engineer in XiaoMi to discuss about the issue ...
 OK, I will look into openstf/minicap#93 after work. Seems to introduce more code changes.  Xiaomi has [a blog](https://dev.mi.com/console/doc/detail?pId=1160) about this issue, which is written in Chinese. 

It's fine if you don't know Chinese. The solution is to declare the maximum aspect ratio larger than 2.0. Here is the [documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#MaxAspectRatio) about how to declare the maximum aspect ratio written by Android team. 

Note that Mix 2 is running Android N.

I hope it helps. @sorccu  I will try it tonight. Thanks @linzhaoqin from XiaoMi. @sorccu The problem has been resolved perfectly after adding meta-data in AndroidManifest.xml as @linzhaoqin mentioned:

```
<application android:allowBackup="true"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_launcher"
        android:persistent="true">

      <meta-data android:name="android.max_aspect"
        android:value="3.0" />

```

Added two debug log in lib/units/device/plugins/service.js:

```
    plugin.getDisplay = function(id) {
      return runServiceCommand(
          apk.wire.MessageType.GET_DISPLAY
        , new apk.wire.GetDisplayRequest(id)
        )
        .timeout(10000)
        .then(function(data) {
          var response = apk.wire.GetDisplayResponse.decode(data)
          console.log("+++++++++++++ width:", response.width)
          console.log("+++++++++++++ height:", response.height)
```
Then run STF and connect with the Mix2 device, the output is as expected

```
INF/device:plugins:service 28623 [c4700512] Agent says: "InputClient started"
INF/device:plugins:display 28623 [c4700512] Reading display info
+++++++++++++ width: 1080
+++++++++++++ height: 2160
```

Thanks

 I met the same problem recently. I guess some manufacturers force return an error resolution because they want the virtual button to be shown forever and not covered by other apps, I think getting resolution from adb command is a good solution.  I have pulled the code from Git but i am unable to run the source code in order to make changes to its UI. Can anyone please help me with this.                                                                                                                                       I have tried with the below steps                                                                                                                                      1. Pulled the code from Git                                                                                                                                              2. Installed the dependencies mentioned as per the Requirements in STF notes.                                                   3. Also installed the dependencies using "npm install -g stf"                                                                                      4. Fetched all NPM and Bower modules using "npm install"                                                                                    5. linked the module using "npm link"

After doing "npm link" i get the same  thing which i get on "npm -h" . So exactly how should we run it, is there any other way to do so ? 
 Hi yogesh8384,
Please try the following steps. I used it for both Ubuntu 16.04 and 14.04 64-bit and it works properly. Now I can modify OpenSTF code, rebuild and run with no issue. Hope it helps

Thuan
 Thank you Thuan Pham,
Its working now, i am working on modifying the UI but i am unable to make changes to the default device image that comes when the devices are connected. Is there any way to do it, or we need to make the changes to the stf-device-db that is present in the node module as the images are present there only. Thanks @thuanpv - your instructions worked for me on Kubuntu 17.10 with a minor modification:

```
wget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/p/protobuf/libprotobuf9v5_2.6.1-1.3_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libprotobuf9v5_2.6.1-1.3_amd64.deb
```

Your instructions also worked without modification on KDE Neon (which is based on Ubuntu 16.04).

Is there any way of installing everything on Ubuntu from a repo? Hello, im using Kali Linux... but when i follow you step 2 i getting this problem

```  It is not an issue just a question:  is STF 3.1.0 available soon on ARM from docker hub in order to get the Android O compatibility ? Arrgh, do you have a trail about the error causing the build to fail ? My target is raspberry Pi3, may be I can try to build on it ? Thanks, I currently download the latest image !

 Hi,

Thanks for your answer, this morning I saw that the build failed:

I have no problem of disk space on my SD Card (64 Go), so do you have any idea about this fail ?
Sure the raspberry is not enough powerful, so what do you advise me to use as ARM hardware to build ? Do you think a cross compilation may be a good solution ?
Thanks.

It might just take a super long time. RPi is not very powerful. The full build can take several hours.

Yes that may work, docker makes it fairly easy nowadays. We use a Scaleway C1 which is only 2.99EUR per month. Build still takes an hour or more but it does at least finish. An ODROID XU4 is also able to finish the build, and relatively quickly too.

 Just a detail perhaps, but I changed the release tag in “Dockerfile” from “3.5” to “edge” because in “mkimage-alpine.sh” file the “edge” tag is configured, otherwise the build fails at starting, do you think this changing may fails the build ? If I set the “3.5” tag in “mkimage-alpine.sh” file then the image building fails also at starting..

Yes that may work, docker makes it fairly easy nowadays. We use a Scaleway C1 which is only 2.99EUR per month. Build still takes an hour or more but it does at least finish. An ODROID XU4 is also able to finish the build, and relatively quickly too.

Check out https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/docker/armv7l/stf-armv7l-baseimage%40.service. As you can see it sets an environment variable and also passes some options to the script.

 Finally, I took the Dockerfile for x86_64 architecture and adapted it for ARM, after what I successed to build the docker image for raspberry Pi3 in less than 40 mn, and it works well !

Obviously, the image size is about 714 MB while it is 311 MB for alpine, but it does not matter, do you see some potential drawbacks about this build ? Whatis the best way to share ? through a pull request ? you mean through docker hub ? ok, I took a debian source image but it should works well also with an ubuntu one:

```
FROM armv7/armhf-debian:latest

# Sneak the stf executable into $PATH.
ENV PATH /app/bin:$PATH

# Work in app dir by default.
WORKDIR /app

# Export default app port, not enough for all processes but it should do
# for now.
EXPOSE 3000

# Install app requirements. Trying to optimize push speed for dependant apps
# by reducing layers as much as possible. Note that one of the final steps
# installs development files for node-gyp so that npm install won't have to
# wait for them on the first native module installation.

 In synthesis, I just made the following modifications:
- replace `ubuntu:16.04` by `armv7/armhf-debian:latest`
- replace `node-v6.11.2-linux-x64.tar.xz` by `node-v6.11.2-linux-armv7l.tar.xz`
- add `sed -i'' -e '/phantomjs/d' package.json`  Good day!

I have STF deployed in Kubernetes. Now it has 4 real devices connected to real PC. Some time it works fine, but than it stops to work. I can not say how long it takes to get stuck, but after weekend it doesn't work as usually. 

Seems like something happens with the `device` component. I see the following:

1. This device exists in list of devices on web, but all detail fields of the device are ampty.

2. POST to API returns error:

```
# curl -X POST -H Content-Type: application/json -H Authorization: Bearer 44fc57bf30fc467d9381ba664c465285dbdf2b778a87488aa0482fe877269480 --data { "serial" : "3300a5cf2c4f233d" } http://api:3700/api/v1/user/devices
{"success":false,"description":"Device is not responding"}
```
3. Log contains messages from period when it worked find, now there is silence in it. I placed it at the bottom of the message.

4. Processes are alive, TCP ports for listening are open:

6. Restart of the 'device' component will solve the problem: I can kill it and start it again by the same command. Than it will work some time properly. 

Is there any ideas what to do? 

I can collect additional diagnostics if you advice how.

 Sorry, what do you mean? 'adb devices', 'adb shell', 'adb install' work fine. I can restart the 'devices' component without touching devices, and it solves the problem. We use that hardware for tests a long time, it works without issues.  Ohh, I'm not sure that I understand you correctly sorry. 'provider' will restart 'device' when lack of device detected, isn't it? So why in my case restart doesn't happen automatically? 

Another question. I can write liveness probe and restart the provider myself. Do you have ideas how can I detect this situation? About hardware, in this case we use four Samsung SM-T815Y tablets and "plugable" hub with 50W power for devices.  Yep, seems like we're talking about separate issues. Logs from original message look good. But that logs show only the correct period. 

After 'provider' switched to the "get stuck" mode, there is no messages from 'provider' or 'device' at all! I can restart the whole 'provider', or kill 'device' and start it again manually, it will solve the problem for some time. 

 @sorccu Thank you. I've set environment variables for changing TCP keep-alive flags. Seems like it works - after last weekend all devices are still connected.   Notes content was deleted after restart the STF host.
I used STF model local.

Did I miss something from configuration note?
 Thanks @sorccu for your quick response. Let me scan through the steps I did to see whether I did that.  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

**What is the issue or idea you have?**
Problems unlocking devices sometimes

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**
It happens in most new tablet devices that requires full swipe to the top to unlock (like Pixel C)

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
1. Open up a newer tablet device, like Pixel C
2. Try to unlock it

**What is the expected behavior?**
It should unlock with no issues

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**
No warnings.

**Please run `stf doctor` and paste the output here.**
All good here.

Even leaving the cursor inside the device provides identical results:

In case you'd like to debug on that device, I can give you a VPN/splashtop access to my device that hosts STF so you can see by yourself.

(i had to reupload second gif since it was the same)  I am trying to setup OpenSTF to make it work over HTTPS. However, once I type in the URL https://127.0.0.1:7100 I receive the error message "This site can't be reached". My OpenSTF setup works fine with HTTP.

Anyone has successfully setup OpenSTF with HTTPS? Is there any option to switch between HTTP and HTTPS support? If there is no such option and I need to modify OpenSTF to make it work, could you please give me some guidance -- which component(s) need to be changed and how?
Many thanks
  I'm trying STF locally with Android simulator, but seems it's not working properly.

Am I doing it wrong or it's just that STF doesn't  support simulator ?  Somehow connected to: #346 #242 
**What is the issue or idea you have?**

I've checked cli.js file and didn't found any flag that would be helpful.
When the session is closed ("stop using" option) for each device, the application which is on the top activity is closed (minimised).

Is there something that I've missed, flag or any other way to leave the application on the top after closing device session?

The case I'm thinking about:
Automated tests are running on the device (for example Espresso). While this is happening I would like to lookup on the device to check if everything is ok. But when I'm leaving the session ("stop using" option) the application is closed (minimised).

I would like that application to be still on top activity then I leave the device session to let the tests run without interruption. Sure. Understand. Any clue what can I do about it?
Any suggestion where I should lookup to make a PR with a new flag for example? Will you guys be ok with a new PR with a new flag to turn this off?
Will you accept it, will this be ok with your idea of this project.  **Not able to OnePlusOne 3T to STF in Ubuntu 16.04.1**

 @sorccu 
We are using the latest stf version "3.1.0"
Attached screen shot
<img width="533" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22715147/30795342-be70f736-a1ea-11e7-8a50-796ef3543d81.png">

Any help would be appreciated .  Its working fine on MAC with the same version of STF "3.1.0"
    Actually I have an STF server located in France and a user located in China which meets latency about ten seconds on screen display while the network rate seems to be good enough, so I would like to know if there is a way to reduce the quality of the screen streamed by minicap in order to reduce this latency ?

I know minicap takes a -P argument {RealWidth}x{RealHeight}@{VirtualWidth}x{VirtualHeight}/{Orientation} but in pratical how can I restart minicap in the mobile with the desired size ?

Thanks.
 Just a tip since I fiddled with it myself - it doesn't reduce latency really. I tried connecting to a PC connected to a 1ms ping PC with 50mb up 500 mb down speed with a PC with identical network settings, lowering the size of the screen by changing the code, and the screen have shown up in a new size... but it was still as laggy as it was.

I think some more work would have to be done to make it work as we'd like it to.  Will a server can connect up to a number of mobile phones? USB connected to more than one phone, the USB interface is not enough bandwidth how to solve? In the use of the process, often a mobile phone dropped, what is a good way?

Is there any recommended server model? How many phones can be connected to a server Is there a reference value? For example, you increase the use of what configuration, up to the number of mobile phones can support?
thank~  Hi,

Could I deploy two STF services on the same machine that has two different IPs?

Regards Hi again,

I have a machine with two network interfaces, some mobiles will be connected to one of the IP_A and the rest to the other IP_B, could I deploy two STF services, one for each IP on the same machine?

Thanks! @sorccu is it possible for stf-provider to support cesarca's requirement with "--exclude" and "--include" options which can filter different devices set for different providers on the same machine?  Hi all,

could you, please, give name of framework that you use for the ldap to get correct examples? 
because main confuse is about:
STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_SEARCH_CLASS
STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_SEARCH_FIELD
STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_SEARCH_SCOPE thanks.

still has this error :(

what the difference between STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_USERNAME_FIELD and STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_SEARCH_FIELD? thanks, so i understand why `STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_SEARCH_FIELD ` is required. 

but, now i totally lost in configuration... 

```
  -e "STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_BIND_CREDENTIALS=pass"\
  -e "STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_BIND_DN=CN=stf bind,OU=System Users,DC=domain,DC=local" \
  -e "STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_SEARCH_DN=DC=domain,DC=local" \
  -e "STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_TIMEOUT=360" \
  -e "STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_URL=ldap://192.168.2.100:389" \

  -e "STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_SEARCH_FIELD=sAMAccountName" \
  -e "STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_USERNAME_FIELD=displayName" \
```

this looks fully correct. 

and last one `STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_BIND_DN`. this is could be wrong, but... 
if binding works well (i checked it with wrong pass and it fails), so it should be correct too.

`STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_SEARCH_CLASS` as i understand, it now correct too. 
i tried `STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_SEARCH_CLASS=(objectClass=*)`, but it doesn't help. 

all other configs like:
`STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_SEARCH_CLASS=objectClass=person`
`STF_AUTH_LDAP_LDAP_SEARCH_CLASS=person`
are failing on start, and i think its because of syntax errors. 

where i should look deeper?  so... i tried several configs with several servers.... and now i can say - LDAP is not working (  yep, if you mean 'ldapsearch' command.

also i configured all other services (such as jenkins, nextcloud, gitlab, rednine, etc.)  in my office and they all work.   Can you add scrolling ability with mouse wheel how it is implemented in android emulator?  **What is the issue or idea you have?**
Portrait/Landscape indicator logic is reversed on large (10"+) tablets, which are landscape by default. This happens for example on Samsing SM-P900.
Here is a screenshot:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3340954/30395710-6411758a-98c7-11e7-8728-2e87cc00393d.png)

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**

```

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
Connect SM-P900 to STF.

**What is the expected behavior?**
Orientation indicator is consistent with actual orientation.

There are 2 10.1 Samsung tablets available in remote test lab: http://developer.samsung.com/remotetestlab/galaxy/rtlDeviceList.action they can be connected via adb. It looks like rotation comes from here: https://github.com/openstf/STFService.apk/blob/master/app/src/main/java/jp/co/cyberagent/stf/monitor/RotationMonitor.java#L69-L80
Current rotation in tooltip matches this value and is correct.

It seems that STF assumes that 0° rotation just means portrait however, it is not always true.
One of the way to determine if it is portrait or landscape is check the value of [orientation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#orientation).

Orientation can be passed along with rotation to STF UI and current portrait/landscape indicator state can be based on orientation. Rotation can be used for tooltip only. Will try to fix it in my spare time.  run ```npm link``` cause an exception in console, error log as follow:
```ERROR in ./res/web_modules/nine-bootstrap/index.js

At provider side, I also saw in log file that a VNC server is started, is it possible to interact with it using a VNC client ?

Thanks.
 Thanks for your answer  When i enter stf local after installation.
 I get the following error message. I have pasted full logs below this error message.

 Yes, this is an issue from npm. I got this fix by clearing npm's cache.  How can I open lock screen or lock device?
As workaround I can press power button and reconnect device.
In this case i will be on lock screen
But i want to open lock steen without recinnecting.
 I want to see notifications on lock screen
Or as an example media player controls This cace from my QA colleagues I resolved the problem by writing a Java program using UIAutomator to swipe the screen from bottom to top and from left to right. Or you can simulate the operation of unlocking device with any Android UI automation tool.  Sorry for my mistake. Today I checked "Advanced Input" -> "Special keys" -> "Power" button and this works for all devices. But need to press button 2 times. First click and devise screen is off after second click I can see lock screen.

@vbanthia 
input keyevent 82 dos not  work for me @vbanthia On some devices like HuaWei P10, "input keyevent 82" doesn't work when it's not password locked. Maybe some manufactures modified the default behavior of this keyevent.  On master branch, I found this problem on windows:

Hi!
Can you help me.
How can I type russian characters from PC keyboard?
English characters from PC keyboard and russian keyboard on device works fine.  Hi guys, any support would be appreciated as I am new. I have spent hours and hours searching but I couldn't find anything. Hopeless! I want to  make publicly access-able so they can use the Public IP address access the STF.

I have tried port forwarding on my router but it redirects top local ip (192.168.1.9:7100) but I want make publicly access able . When I type in the public IP with the port (x.x.x.x:7100) it directs me to (http://localhost:7100/auth/mock/). I have also tried to NGrok still the same. 


Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you all. 


 @vbanthia it only works internal network not outside, I have opened the ports from 7000-25000. <your_internal_network_ip_here>

Recently we have connected S8+ to the STF service. 
The problem is: despite screen's orientation is set to portrait view (within device's settings, on STF web page, and using adb command), cursor on the screen moves like orientation is set to landscape:
when (on vertically oriented device) I move mouse up, cursor goes left, when I move mouse left, cursor goes down.
Moreover, this is the only device that displayes cursor when being used via STF web page.

So, it'll be great if you help me with resolving this issue.

Thank you for your attention.

 Mmmmmm... very useful answer, thanks)  For the latest version of STF(3.1), the package.json shows bluebird is 2.10.1:

        **"bluebird": "^2.10.1",**
        "adbkit-apkreader": "^2.1.2"

In the modlue of "adbkit-apkreader 2.1.2", it shows bluebird has been upgraded to 3.4.7:

          "dependencies": {
              **"bluebird": "^3.4.7",**
              "debug": "~0.7.4",
              "yauzl": "^2.7.0"
          },

So after deploying the STF v3.1, the problem was encountered when trying to install APK package:
        
        ERR/storage:plugins:apk 13930 [*] Unable to read manifest of "4f92bf05-283e-40d9-850e-d80eca3deec2"

            at processImmediate [as _immediateCallback] (timers.js:617:5)
            ... ...

Seems the function of "fromCallback is introduced in 3.x version of bluebird, so STF modules which still depends on bluebird 2.x can not work.

Also I attempted to upgrad bluebird to 3.x for STF 3.1, but still hit the problem in lifecycle related function:

     resolver.promise.cancellable is not a function ...

It's because [Cancellation](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/cancellation.html) has been redesigned for bluebird 3.x. The symptom is that the program gets stuck with the message: "INF/util:lifecycle 15277 [*] Winding down for graceful exit"


 Yes, I tried to use 'npm install' and 'npm link' to install the dependencies, also tried to upgrade bluebird manually with the command "npm install bluebird@3.4.7" Initially the directory `node_modules/adbkit-apkreader/node_modules/bluebird/ was not existed.  I issued command `npm install bluebird@3.4.7` to install bluebird v3 manually. Now thing goes well and I can install apk through STF UI. 
Thanks!

BTW,  is there any plan to upgrade  bluebird or  use native Promise interface in STF itself? It might be a env problem. I did following steps in my dev env on Macbook:
   1. Merge the code of v3.1.0 with my customized code based on 2.1
   2. Issue the command "cnpm install" (cnpm is using private npm registry from taobao.com)
   3. Open web page of STF and encounter the problem caused by incompatible bluebird version
   4. try to issue the command "npm install" to update modules using official npm registry, the problem still occurs, the dir `node_modules/adbkit-apkreader/node_modules/bluebird/package.json` can't be located 
   5. issue the command "cd node_modules/adbkit-apkreader/&&cnpm install bluebird@3.4.7" to install bluebird v3 for apkreader manually.  Then the problem resolved.
  Hello,

First of all, thanks for your good work.

so this is my set I also meet same problem, this may be the reason: your configuration '--provider-min-port 57503 --provider-max-port 57550' can only support (57550-57503+1)/4 = 12 devices, because every device will use 4 ports, when you try connect 13th device, there is not enough port to use. so increase the

  Hi, 
I'm trying to customize the STF to our internal needs, and I need to fetch more details about device and show it in device detail.. But I can't figure out, wherefrom the STF is getting the informations like OS, SDK, Platform, HW details? Do I need to customize the mobile app STF, so it will send those informations, or can it be done from STF app without altering mobile app codes?  'adb shell getprop' is what I'm looking for, but I can't find it in STF codes anywhere to modify it to my needs Ok, thanks for you help.. Anyway I was not able to figure out, how to alter the adb shell command to return Knox SDK version.. 
This is the command I want to use `adb shell getprop net.knox.shareddevice.version` Yep, thats what I thought, just wanted to be sure, there is no easy way to do it 👍  Thanks a lot..  I I find that auth-url, websocket-url, and --app-url useless in STF, the browser knows which domain it visit STF from, if we give a fixed domain , accessing the **same** STF from **two** domains is very difficult, I think we can just give /auth/mock/ instead of https://stf.example.org/auth/mock/  **What is the issue or idea you have?**

 I bought hardware specifically following the README. G4560 (so newest gen CPU) and B250M motherboard, along with SSD and 8gb of rams. Also top-end usb hubs, active, powered from power outlet. http://www.tp-link.com.pl/products/details/cat-5688_UH700.html - UH700 TP Link, you can't even get a more expensive one in here. Also, I've been playing with STF a year or two ago, and it worked up to 10 devices on mac (!), so should work here too I guess?

One more thing - I'm still waiting for the StarTech usb controller, but I think 6 devices should not restart themselves @sorccu big thanks for this support that you didn't even had to provide - I have a few of those hubs already unfortunately (they did work with mac up to 12 devices), so for now I'll just plug less devices per hub and then import the pluggable from US.

Thanks! Sure, but who has the resources to test out all the USB Hubs and usb extension cards out there? ;) You guys (or just you?) did a great job handpicking two best options for both hubs and extension cards. 

My StarTech PCIe card should arrive next week, and I just ordered the pluggable usb 2.0 hub, so hopefully it'll sort out at least those problems I face now.

Thanks! Just in case someone has similiar issue - I was making a research what's wrong with UH700/720. Turns out, for some reason, in some cases, it tends to restart every 30 seconds (rough estimate of how often my devices were kicked off stf):

https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2201564

Removing extension cord should help. Also, it's basically 4 port device with... another hub plugged into one of its ports. Nice engineering TP-Link ;) 

One more thing: It fixed itself (disconnecting) when I connected the hub to 2.0 port in front of the PC panel rather than 3.0 port.  One (really) last tip, that could help someone - I wasn't able to fix the 3.0 ports, BUT, after turning off ALL USB options in bios and, using powertop, in tunables, selecting autosupsend as "bad" resolved the issue completely. Even with the mentioned hubs, I was able to connect 24 devices (3x7 + 3 ports) and everything is super stable.
I have no idea how I managed to get to this point, because no one mentioned fiddling with that option, but it helped me. 
![2017-08-21_00-49-53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10826482/29499140-b5606574-860a-11e7-9a57-a364c6f58eca.png)
 @sorccu sure, that's why I'm setting up the proper USB controller and using the pluggable hub, which is much more capable, for more power consuming devices (like tablets and bigger phones). I've left this info here also in case someone will have similiar problem - so you can always reroute him (or he can find this in google or STF issues listing)  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

I have set up stf and connect to devices successfully.  But on the device control page: the landscape icon is not working for me.

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
Select one device on the devices list, then on detail page click on landscape icon. Device is still portrait.

**What is the expected behavior?**

 It fixed today. I really don't know what's wrong. Yesterday I tried various browsers and update my node version, but didn't work.   Anyway, really appreciate your help, sorccu.  I think I know what could be the issue here - I had similiar situation, thinking what could be wron, in the end it turned out... S8 is not supporting landscape mode on home screen. I noticed that when I opened the browser and the rotation suddenly changed.

Hope that helps someone with similiar problem :)   Hello,
I am trying to automatically extract coordinates of all user actions (e.g., tap or swipe) on a OpenSTF device.

For actions which are manually triggered by a user on OpenSTF device, I can extract these coordinates by slightly modifying the code in stf/lib/units/device/plugins/touch/index.js. Specifically, I can extract the coordinates once the device screen is touched from TouchConsumer.prototype.touchDown = function(point) {...} function.

However, my approach does not work for actions which are automatically triggered by Appium test scripts (like the ones in STF appium example : https://github.com/openstf/stf-appium-example). I suspect that the reason is because after getting the remote ADB URL from OpenSTF, Appium calls "adb connect" to directly control the selected device so it doesn't use any component of OpenSTF, except the minicap for doing a kind of "streaming". Am I right?

If I am wrong, could you please let me know whether I can retrieve coordinates of actions triggered by Appium test scripts from somewhere else in OpenSTF code base or not? I have taken a look into the adbkit module (https://github.com/openstf/adbkit) but have not found any solution. Many thanks.  Hi guys, since I have upgraded to the latest version some devices are stuck in preparing mode and other two devices appear as "disconnected" even when I can list them in adb

 No, disk is not full. 13.31 GB free in fact :) In my case, some devices keep in preparation status are due to stf service can't be started directly, on some devices, we should start activity first then start the service by issuing:

      adb shell am start -n jp.co.cyberagent.stf/.IdentityActivity   
      adb shell am startservice  -n jp.co.cyberagent.stf/.Service
 On some devices of Meizu, we can't start a service before activating the activity ...  I'm sure they have the auto start setting but it 's actually not working for STF service. Now I hit the problem only on devices of Meizu. i got the same problem on a "Lava Iris 870"
Starting the service manually solved it for me as well  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

**What is the issue or idea you have?**
Unable to make an initial STF run

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**
I was able to run it on MacOSX previously.

 I've never resolved this issue myself, even after trying with:
Debian 7,8,9 and Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04.

But was able to set it up via docker. So I'll close the ticket - but in case someone runs into such a problem like I did, I recommend trying with Docker. It took me like 30 seconds instead of 1 full day of trying. i ran into this same issue on ubuntu 17.04 using the 'nodeenv' utility to download & setup the node/npm environment. this happened with both the latest stable (8.4.0) and latest lts (6.11.2) node.
to debug, i ran each command individually until i found the one that output the error that included at the bottom:
`Each option can be be overwritten with an environment variable by converting the option to uppercase, replacing dashes with underscores and prefixing it with STF_APP_ (e.g. STF_APP_AUTH_URL)." `
this turned out to be the 'stf app' command, e.g: 
`./node_modules/stf/bin/stf app --user-profile-url http://localhost --websocket-url websocket://localhost --auth-url http://localhost`
running that failed with the same error message about `"rootDirectory" not specified or is invalid` which actually comes from the markdownserver npm module.
anyhow, the ENOENT i noticed in the strace was this:
`[pid 22147] stat("/home/matt/devel/nexus/openstf_nodeenv/node_modules/stf/node_modules/stf-wiki", 0x3c8ea9931d0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)`
i guess the search path for the module wasn't right. i just worked around it by making a symlink like so:
`(openstf_nodeenv)matt@aquos:~/devel/nexus/openstf_nodeenv/node_modules/stf$ ls -l node_modules`
`lrwxrwxrwx 1 matt matt 2 Aug 30 00:46 node_modules -> ..`
everything started up fine after making the symlink. hope this saves somebody else an hour, lol.
 hmm, haven't tried nvm. i want to say i went with nodeenv because it's in the ubuntu repos and i prefer to use a repo/.deb if possible. i might check it out anyways, though.
i did just now test executing it from different paths, e.g. bin/stf and stf/bin/stf, but it still failed to start with the same error message.
btw, this thing is really pretty cool :) another quick note. that little recursive symlink breaks other stuff, like 'npm ls'. fails with `npm ERR! Maximum call stack size exceeded`. so, runtime of openstf isn't affected negatively, but doing other stuff with npm appears to be. hope this saves someone else another 10 minutes, lol. This error happens with `yarn`, installing the global module with yarn.

I have tried uninstalling the rethinkdb and stf; no luck. I have read this this issue as this parson having similar issue [#458](https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/458) but this person had it in different ports whereas mine is the same one `28015`. I am running one MAC OS X EL Capitan

Any help would be appreciated, let me know if like any information. Thanks. Just update : I have created another user on the same mac and  started all the services and it works. Can I know what is the issue or mistake I am doing?   ryOnImmediate (timers.js:645:5)

Thanks for the help (and the great app), you can close it now.  Hello,
I successfully setup OpenSTF on a machine following the installation guide at https://github.com/openstf/stf. I can use OpenSTF on this machine by accessing 127.0.0.1:7100 using mock authentication. However, when I try to access the device test farm from another machine on the same network (by typing IP_ADDRESS:7100 where IP_ADDRESS is the address of the machine on which OpenSTF has been installed), I get the error message "This site can't be reached" and on the URL bar of the web browser I see this URL "localhost:7100/auth/mock".
I would like to get some suggestion on configuring OpenSTF so it is accessible from other machines on the same network.
Thanks,
Thuan

 Oh, my bad. It works now. Thank you very much for your prompt reply.  Hi Team,

I have installed all the  pre requisites as mentioned the documents, however when i run the 'stf local' to start the stf server from terminal i am getting the below error

**NOTE :** When i type stf doctor , i see nothing in the terminal window.

Thanks
RajendraC Thanks for the quick reply Sorccu, actual problem was my airdrop server was running on the localhost 7100 port, I have forcefully closed Airserver from activity monitor, then my STF is running like a charm

Regards,
RajendraC Yes, sorccu, 
I would like to be in touch with you for the goal i am trying for using STF, I have my appium+Selenium(automation tools) automated scripts are developed and stored it my desktop, every time i am running those scripts on physical devices by connecting through USB cable. Now i would like to make a local cloud of  all my devices and would like to access those devices over the localhost to run my automated tests, 

Any help in this regard would highly help to achieve my goal

Thanks in Advance,
RajendraC Thats fine, I will post if any issues come across

Thanks,
Rajendra  First of all, thank you for your great software.
It has been a really great source of help, and I'm looking for an option to install the same APK and run the same test on a group of selected devices from the STF panel. Is there a way to do this?

Thanks in advance.
 Ok, Thank You.

Now I've been trying to use STF API to install an APK on several devices simultaneously,  but unsuccessfully. Is there any kind of tutorial for this? 

I've tried using the examples with curl:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN-HERE" https://stf.example.org/api/v1/user

but I get this:

curl: (6) Could not resolve host: stf.example.org

Thanks in advance  **What is the issue or idea you have?**
I know you don't support any question apart from the scope.
I want to understand how do you get the serial and port information after running the provider, are these a kind of environment variable, I am trying to make it as a pod in the k8s.
Since there is no direct way to provide `--screen-ws-url-pattern "wss://stf.example.org/d/%i/<%= serial %>/<%= publicPort %>/"` apart from environment variable, I don't see any environment variable exposed for `serial` and `publicPort`.

Also, Since I am using an ingress to bind all the services, I am still a bit confused with provider being being a part of ingress.

Any suggestion will be appreciated, Thanks! @sorccu @vbanthia Any suggestion here guys? @sorccu
I currently have 2 issues:
- If I hard code the serial number for provider, then only it gets registered and starts to provide, but fails at the websocket connection.`failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 400`, I still have an operable greyed out screen.
- If I give the provider any other name apart from serial number of device - it just gets filtered out. And this happens only in the case of creating it as a replication controller in k8s If I make provider  as a daemon service on the machine, it provides correctly - 'That's why I am trying to understand, how I can get this in k8s'  I hava cloned the stf.git and deployed the stf by command ```docker build -t stf:0.0.1 .```in th stf git directory.
When I deploy and build successfully , then I run it by the command ```docker run -it stf:0.0.1```.
However , it shows the error message:
> docker run -it stf:0.0.1
> /usr/bin/env: 'node\r': No such file or directory

It can't be executed successfully. 
Could you help solving the problem?
Thx. I have soveld this problem. because the file stf is dos filefomat.
Solution:
install dos2unix , and insert the command ```dos2unix /app/bin/stf && \ ``` before ```cd /app && \```  Hello there!

**What is the issue or idea you have?**
Recently we bought a Mac Mini and I migrated STF from our Mac to the Mac Mini. Everything's working well, but there's this issue that I don't know why happens.

The problem is that sometimes when I plug/unplug a phone, it seems like openstf's devices all unplugged and they restart connecting again.


**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
With STF running, just plug/unplug some devices and it will eventually happening.


**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

It gets wiped to the state when I start using the device..
Is this some kind of secure feature in development, or is this a bug?

I will attach logs after it happens again Yep, that's exactly what I mean Ok thanks, didn't know about this feature.. It works just on some devices.. On Samsung Galaxy devices this does not work
Anyway thanks for clear this out.. 👍   **What is the issue or idea you have?**
I want to have multiple providers in the same machine, filtering the devices that connect to each provider by USB port, that is, if some device gets connected to a range of ports, it will be served by provider X.

In the "Deployment" documentation one can find the following:
"_Note that you cannot have more than one provider unit running on the same host, as they would compete over which one gets to control the devices. In the future we might add a negotiation protocol to allow for relatively seamless upgrades._"

My question is, in order to prevent which provider gets control over the devices, a configuration file could be used in order to force a certain provider to access only the intended range of ports.

This would allow for different devices to show in frontend with different tags, ultimately allowing for finer control over them.

 I got confused, `Usage: provider [options] [serial...]` this serial is related to the device, and not the USB port, right?
We should have a service that gets the serial numbers of the devices connected to the ports we need and then send these serial numbers to the provider at start-up. something along those lines?  To deal with the issue 'bower ESUDO         Cannot be run with sudo', add '--allow-root' in package.json file.  Hello,
I followed this tutorial (https://gist.github.com/yasuyk/bbaa28568c497d95ff92566efc4ecc3c) and successfully installed openstf (STF version 2.0.0) on a machine running Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit. It works very well -- I can login to the system and interact with my real device.

Since I want to modify the STF a bit, I have tried to build it from source by skipping the 7th step in the tutorial and running "sudo npm install" and "sudo npm link" from STF source folder; however I face the following issues
1. If I compile the newest version of STF from source, there are some compilation errors which seem to be relevant to the NPM version (my NPM version is 1.3.10) 
2. I think the first problem is because the newest version of STF is v3.0.0 while the installed dependencies are for STF v2.0.0 so I tried to checkout the commit for STF 2.0.0 (5a2af57fc5aafeedcbc5e6e215fdd0d609e4cf84). Using this revision, I compiled the code successfully without any errors. However, when I run "stf local" and try to access the front-end at 127.0.0.1:7100, I got a blank page -- no login screen. I checked the STF output and saw several errors while building app and web_modules (as attached).
[stf_output_error.txt](https://github.com/openstf/stf/files/1159464/stf_output_error.txt)

I also tried to run "stf doctor" and following is the output. It seems that the Node version is too old.

Have you faced similar issues and successfully resolved them? Your suggestion would be really appreciated.
Thanks,
Thuan Thanks for your prompt reply. I have tried to setup newest version of OpenSTF on another machine running Ubuntu 16.04 and faced similar issues. Following is the output of "stf doctor" and attached file is the error log when I run "stf local".

 Now, it works :) I think it did not work because bower and gulp were not there. After installing the two packages and run 2 commands "npm install" (without sudo, and without -g) and "sudo npm link" the system works well.  hi, how to turn down the frame rate of capture screen?  Hi All,

I am getting websocket exception  while running the docker image while selecting allow remote and public ip option 

but when  i run the image without these options like public-ip  , I am able to run STF successfully without any exception 

I have gone through other similar  issue on github , the solution mentioned was that the "configuration was wrong " if the configuration is wrong how is it possible to connect to the device without using public -ip option

Also in some issues it was mentioned that the websocket should also connect to 7100 port , but in the cases  where STF was working successfully(without public -ip options). websocket was connected to 7110 port only.

I am trying to figure out in the repository , where exactly this connection is being established  . Please help me out with this issue 

Thanks and Regards, Please find the steps along with the Logs

While I agree that "your configuration is wrong" is vague, we simply don't have time to help with general configuration issues unless you provide all the necessary details by yourself. It takes a lot of time if we have to ask for those one by one.

For example, when you created this issue, you decided to remove the issue template. So now I would have to spend a few minutes asking you to provide those details instead of being able to help you directly. In this case, it would have been particularly useful if you had provided the exact commands you used, and the full output of those commands. Otherwise you're sort of expecting me or someone else to simply keep trying various random combinations, which is a huge waste of time.

Please try to proactively provide as much detail as possible. It increases the chances of someone willing to look into your issue.

 I have got the workaround to the websocket issue 

Solution: We need to add the port which is appearing in the websocket exception to the  Port forwarding rules of the vm used 

It will  start working . Closing this issue now 

  1. Although it's a bit repetitive, I think the independent serial parameter tells the reader that entry contains serial.
2. Just remove useless parameter "url“.  When I connected mobile devices into STF from Windows system, some emulator devices were joined unintentionally, so I added a new option "-exclude regex" in provider to exclude devices whose serials match the specified regex pattern like "^emulator.*".

Another benefit for the feature is that we can prevent multiple local devices from joining STF provider. Thanks. I would be very happy to join the Slack and become a `formal` contributor. Email sent. Thanks.  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

I am running this 2 commands inside Docker terminal to Setup STP

I am still getting the error even after running the adb docker image seperately  hi,
I am trying to deploy stf but all containers are UP except the containers which are trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:28015 are exited. All those are showing this error(please see the attached image)

 Working with port 7111 (on local) and priority from 1 to 7. Port 7150 didn't work on local setup.  For people that come across this via google or something in the future, see this issue for information on connecting virtual devices to STF: https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/453#issuecomment-256832772  I modify some code, and then build docker image myself.
when I run sudo docker build -t stf . , some problems happen.

  Hi,
The question can be a bit confusing, sorry for that. But the problem is when i run openstf on any browser then it is still using the hardware(microphone,camera,etc) of the physical device connected with server not of my device on which i am running openstf. Now please tell me how to access the hardware of the device on which i am running openstf?

 So there are not any plugin's for that? Is there any way by which i can make it on my own?
 So sweet of you, thanks  As subject, devices at "automation" status can't be listed in static order. 

Seems it's due to the status of "automation"  missed in compare function in `res/app/device-list/column/device-column-service.js` .

```javascript

With Android devices its working fine.
Is there anything i am missing ? Please help me with the solution?
  Hi,

I'm trying to install an apk to my device connected to STF.
However, when I have STF running and do "adb install -r <filename>",
I get disconnected from STF when I get "* daemon started successfully *"

My guess is that by trying to install a file to device, I'm killing the adb server connection, which is also killing my STF connection.
Is there anyway to solve this?  Hi,

When I'm trying to run **stf local**, the error is  "Identifier 'options' has already been declared" and "Child process had an error ExitError : Exit code "1" at ChildProcess.<anonymous>" with procutil.js.

I'll try to force full size as suggested in: https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/623#issuecomment-308672907 and post a result.  Hi,
 I am currently using stf on localhost but i want to use stf on external network too, from the issues i have  found that stf can be deployed to real servers by following the tutorial from Deployment.md but first thing is **i don't have any actual server right now so can i deploy it again on my linux machine behaving like a server and the second thing is a bit straight forward video tutorial of deploying stf on real servers would be best.**  I've worked out a Shell script to automate the procedure of deployment. Hope this would be helpful.

I think that nginx.conf file is having some issue. Can you please help. 
Thanks in advance ```
cp -rf systemd.unit/adbd.service /etc/systemd/system 
  assert_run_ok
```
this was showing an error so I have to remove it as it is simply copying the adbd.service file so I made my adbd.service file in etc/systemd/system. after that when I ran my .sh file it is showing error in creating a container for nginx. I had replaced the nginx.conf file in etc/nginx/nginx.conf as per the DEPLOYMENT.md. I can connect to rethinkdb WebUI on port 8080 and when I ran 192.168.104.183:3200 it is redirecting to auth/mock but it is not able to load entry.js and commonentry.js when I look in the chrome debug tool. Not able to figure out the issue. Please guide. 
after running the .sh file, the console was mentioned in the previous comment
Thanks in advance. @rahul0698 and @suvansh-dev I've created a new repo for automation deployment of stf with docker.
Please try and feedback.

https://github.com/thinkhy/deploy-stf-docker
 hello,
Those who are having the problem in deploying stf to a real server, can now deploy with one click by the shell script written by @thinkhy. You can clone the repo [https://github.com/thinkhy/deploy-stf-docker](url) and then you just need to run the script. 

After running the script if you encounter problem like not able to connect to 127.0.0.1:28015, it may be due to initially installed rethinkdb locally on your machine. So deploy it on a freshly installed Linux machine and just pull the repo and run the script without installing other dependencies and you are good to go. 
Thanks! It's my pleasure. @rahul0698 Thanks for sharing your experience and solution. With the script I get a blank page at localhost:3200/auth/mock.
Do I need to change something?
I tried to look into the stf logfiles but i dont know how I can find it inside the docker container. And isnt the rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service required?
Thank You for the nice skript anyways! @xell66 you can check log of docker container using the command "docker logs CONTAINER_ID" Hi i have the same error that @xell66 and I check log of docket container (stf-auth-3200) and i see this:

`INF/auth-mock 1 [*] Listening on port 3000`

please help
 This log shows your stf is running well ...  @terminalone  OK. I will enhance my scripts. @thinkhy Thank you very much for your script, I run STF successfully in Virtualbox , but there is a problem that I can't access app through the browser on host, I have forwarded rethindb port (8090) and app port (3100) on vitrualbox, and I can get the DB page through 127.0.0.1:8090 on host browser.  but I can't access app (auth/mock) page  through 127.0.0.1:3100. I've tried many manyways, such as ngrok and deploy via docker,  but none of them can work. 

My problem is very similar to this: https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/700

Thank you very very much !   Hi,

I'm running some Android automation with Appium remotely using openstf.
One problem I am having is, when I try to disconnect all network (eg, go to airplane mode),
I realized that openstf will also disconnect.

Does anyone know a way I can get my device to have no network, but have openstf connected?

Thanks. I am able to use STF in airplane mode.
But when I go from Non-airplane mode -> Airplane mode, STF connection also disconnects.
If it is not a STF issue, maybe it's a Appium issue.
I'm using Appium Driver to disconnect from all networks, and maybe STF also disconnects because of how Appium executes this.

Has anyone tried using Appium and disconnecting from all networks? Are you running the Appium tests on the same machine that hosts STF? I had STF online while running some Appium tests of my own (not related), and at some points STF decided to disconnect as well, I think there might be some kind of conflict between both servers when they're up.  
 **Plus even if you could** means there is a possibility?What if i remove the drop down list of all devices and the devices section from the UI? You are right changing the url will show whole of the stuff. If you want to implement this properly, it would require to implement first an user-specific permissions system. ok thanks but what after that? After having a permissions system, assigning which user can see which device should be doable from the database at least. This will take effort and we don't have plans to do this right now, but contributions are welcome. ok sir, i will try to do this, if you found anything else that can help me to achieve this then please comment over here. Thanks! One thing more what kind of user-specific permission system i should make, please provide a brief summary like **how should i start? In which language and how can i connect that with the existing code?** 
I am currently using **stf local** to access it on the web browser.  Hi, I'd like to use LDAP filter option.
This PR add the `ldap-search-filter` option for `auth-ldap`.  


The documentation of `parseFilter` is http://ldapjs.org/filters.html @sorccu Thank you for your comment!
I have fixed some bugs and tested both simple and complex filter.
 Great, when this feature will be available in the master branch ? Thanks !  Hello,

I'm using openSTF to run automated tests for my android app.
I was wondering if it is possible to have adb commands within my automation code to run them remotely in STF.
For example, I want to run adb logcat for every test failures.
I can connect adb remotely, but I was wondering if I can run adb remotely within the automation code.

Thanks! It's not really a job for STF, but you can get logcat while testing on
devices connected through STF.

While connected through STF, devices behave almost as though they are
attached to your PC.

Getting logcat during tests is a job for your testing framework.
I get the most out of instrumentation tests using the [Spoon runner](
http://square.github.io/spoon/)

I hope this answers your query

 You can extend device component. I've implemented a similar function to send all the logcat entries to Graylog based on ElasticSearch.  This is booking feature with new architecture. retry work for #101 .
#101 is too much behind. So now I'm coding from scratch.
I'll make divided PR for this as follow later.
- device plugin
- reserve unit
- booking ui

If you have better way for this work, please instruct me.
ex: make feature branch on your organizer repository. then I'll make PR for it.
 Is this booking feature under development or available from now ? I forked the master branch but I don't see the booking feature available through the UI, what branch I have to fork ? sorry the booking-renew thanks.. Sorry again it does not change anything with this branch (booking-renew), I don't see the booking feature available through the UI, I don't see any additional parameters available while launching STF, so please tell me what is the way to activate this feature ? https://github.com/hogehoge-banana/stf/pull/3
I made sub task on my personal repository.  There exists an incompatibility problem as the shell command "ps comm" is invalid in some devices such as Google Pixel.

Below is the output when I issued "ps com" in Pixel:

 sailfish:/ $ ps com
 bad pid 'com'
 sailfish:/ $ echo $?
 1

So I replaced "ps comm" with "ps" which is workable for all the Android device. I wrote following shell script to do perf test

     cnt=1
     while read sn device; do
        echo "device ${cnt}"
        echo "---------------------"
        echo "ps com.android.mms: \
          $((time adb -s ${sn} shell 'ps com.android.mms >/dev/null')  2>&1     \
          |awk '/real/ {print $2}')"
        echo "ps: $((time adb -s ${sn} shell 'ps >/dev/null')  2>&1  |awk '/real/ {print $2}')"
        echo -e "\n"
        let "cnt=$cnt+1"
     done < <(adb devices |grep device|sed -e '1d' -e '/^\s*$/d')


I have performed the perf test for several times. The results show that the perf difference  between "ps" and "ps comm" is not significant(<10%).

 Sure,  I'm a SDET,  testing some mobile APPs and creating some automation tools.  Seems we intended to filter header line in the output of "ps comm",  it's supposed to initialize flag variable "header" to true. I found it when reviewed code in the component of "device" in order to add a device plugin for testing.

Actually in the function of "listPidsByComm" in devutil.js, there still exists an incompatibility problem as the shell command "ps comm" is invalid in some devices such as Google Pixel. 
Below is the output when I issued "ps com" in Pixel:

     1|sailfish:/ $ ps com
     bad pid 'com'
     1|sailfish:/ $ echo $?
     1

So I suggest to replace "ps comm" with "ps" which is workable for all the Android device. 
 Pixel is not common in China neither, someone sent me this device from US.
OK, I'll create a new patch which only replace "ps comm" with "ps" in listPidsByComm.  Any updates on this issue? How can I donate a device? Also, what is the cheapest device that I can use with this software?  linux:192.168.31.202     with stf ,android sdk
windows:192.168.31.135     without stf, have adbkit and android sdk

devices are connect to windows

1.start stf in linux `stf local --public-ip 192.168.31.202 --allow-remote`
2.windows run `adb -a -P 5037 fork-server server`
3.linux run`stf provider --name mikezhoudeMac-mini.local --min-port 7400 --max-port 7700 --connect-sub tcp://127.0.0.1:7114 --connect-push tcp://127.0.0.1:7116 --group-timeout 20000 --public-ip 192.168.31.202 --storage-url http://localhost:7100/ --adb-host 192.168.31.135 --adb-port 5037 --vnc-initial-size 600x800 --allow-remote	`

then i can see my remote device on the web page,but i want to see my devices in my adb.

All works well except the below issue:

When a device is under control through the GUI, if I download a file using the 'File Explorer' window (i.e. picture in sdcard/DCIM/Camera), then the mobile screen freeze so that it becomes impossible to interact with it, until I globally refresh the brower window.
 I used the docker hub images <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

**What is the issue or idea you have?**
Lastest release used, I use your official docker image available from docker hub.

 I talk about the 'Automation' tab in the GUI ? The appium example uses the RESTful API to connect to the device, and then runs the test, I experimented that yet and it is great, but I don't see where the 'Automation' window of the device under control is used in this use case, this is why I asked the question. In this 'Automation' window, there is the 'Store account' box with "Sign-in" button etc. but I don't know what it means ? I agree with you, so what means 'Automation' window and how to use it ? Thanks.  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

**What is the issue or idea you have?**
i have to run the 'adb connect 192.168.31.202:8088' twice that i can see the remote device after i run 'adb devices',and the connect will occur an error in a few secends

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**
it is not only happen on a specific device,i can control the remote device well before i run 'adb connect 192.168.31.202:8088'. 

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
linux ip 192.168.31.202 ,windows ip 192.168.31.135
1.linux run 'stf local --public-ip 192.168.31.202 --allow-remote'
2.windows run 'adb -a -P 5037 fork-server server'
3.linux run 'stf provider --name mikezhoudeMac-mini.local --min-port 7400 --max-port 7700 --connect-sub tcp://127.0.0.1:7114 --connect-push tcp://127.0.0.1:7116 --group-timeout 20000 --public-ip 192.168.31.202 --storage-url http://localhost:7100/ --adb-host 192.168.31.135 --adb-port 5037 --vnc-initial-size 600x800 --allow-remote	'

(i can see the remote device now)

4.see the remote debug cmd in device control page,and  linux run the cmd( 'adb connect 192.168.31.202:7401')
return 'connected to 192.168.31.202:7401'
log:
whitiancai@whitiancai-OptiPlex-3046:~$ adb connect 192.168.31.202:7401
connected to 192.168.31.202:7401

but i can't see any device when i run 'adb devices',and i run the step 4 again and now i can see the remote device
log:
whitiancai@whitiancai-OptiPlex-3046:~$ adb devices
List of devices attached
192.168.31.202:7401	device

5.linux run 'adb logcat',after a few secends the error happened.

**What is the expected behavior?**
the remote device connection will keep alive when i run 'adb connect 192.168.31.202:7401',so i can do something i want 

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

 no, i need add the remote device without stf to my stf. i have two `provider` but one is for the localhost and another one is for another pc ,when i run 'stf provider --name mikezhoudeMac-mini.local --min-port 7400 --max-port 7700 --connect-sub tcp://127.0.0.1:7114 --connect-push tcp://127.0.0.1:7116 --group-timeout 20000 --public-ip 192.168.31.202 --storage-url http://localhost:7100/ --adb-host 192.168.31.135 --adb-port 5037 --vnc-initial-size 600x800 --allow-remote	',the second `provider` start for the windows pc ,i can see and control the remote device which from the windows.And then i run 'adb connect 192.168.31.202:7401' twice,you means i register the remote device in my first `provider` in `stf local`?And two `provider` both control the device,so the error happened?
But if i not start the second `provider`,i can't see and control the remote devices.how can i do?please tell me what's the right way to see,control and debug the remote device with the remote pc  not have STF    Hi,  an other issue.  
I use STF to execute monkey, set 10 hours, and collect logs at the same time. But 2.5 hours later, the execution was interrupted. What's the reason, please? I visit the devices by STF, at Shell, enter the Monkey command: "ADB shell monkey -p com.huajiao.camera -s -v -v -v 1000 --throttle 500 --pct-touch 10 --pct-motion 10 --pct-trackball 10 --pct-nav 10 --pct-majornav 10 --pct-syskeys 1 --pct-appswitch 1 --pct-anyevent 1 --ignore-crashes --ignore-security-exceptions --kill-process-after-error --monitor-native-crashes 100000"

At the same time, locally connect the device, enter under the CMD: "ADB -s 99.33.77.10:11193 logcat -v time >D:/toushijing.txt" to collect the log
Two hours later, the execution was interrupted

  fixed a typo in apk storage plugin  As subject, suggest to open the timeout value as a command argument rather than hard coding it, so users can specify survival time for temp storage(apk/image/log ...) With the feature, timeout value can be set to longer, which will be usable in many scenarios:
     1. share a screenshot link to other colleagues
     2. cache apk files and save time to upload the same apk file
     3. store log files for later diagnosis(we use STF as internal test platform and store logcat to filesys after each testing)   The device requires sim card in the device.
If doesn't, **Install via USB** (needed for installing STFService.apk) and **USB debugging (Security settings)** (needed for running minitouch) can't on. MIUI 8.5.1.0 Yes , perhaps the os is different in China. Any update on this matter ? 
Same issue here. I need sim card inside the phone to install/dev apps on the phone too. 
I have unpacked new Redmi Note 5A with android 7.1.2 N2G47H (2017-12-01) and MUIU 9.2.1.0 NDFMIEK and the issue persist . 
In android studio INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED, which implies the admin app has not permitted such operation. And in Xiaomi phone it is part of MIUI as I recall.
 You're right. There is nothing you can add to this matter. I have researched about it a bit more and this is really an issue of MIUI 8+. They have added verification on chinese servers and gather unique id (UUID) of the phone on unlock of unknown souce apk. This  UUID is generated from sim card secure element and thus you need a sim card indeed. Foremost thanks for really fast answer 😉 So for anybody else reading this, you need any sim card inside. There is no need for sim card to be active on cellular. On the other hand internet connection is required too.   I want to develop stf just like 'node-debug app.js', but 'node-debug ./bin/stf local' always output 'address in used'.
Would you mind tell me a way to debug stf ? 
Would you mind just give an example like 'node --inspect' or more clearly cli that I can debug
  @vbanthia 
I took a stab at https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/594

Appears to address the issue.  I read the STF source Code.
In triproxy/index.js, I know it publish  message  to all  subscribers. But, how the subscriber get the message owned by it .
For example, when I tap device A on the STF website,  triproxy  publish 'tap' to all devices. Device A and device B both subscribe 'tap' infomation. however, device A handle it , device not handle it . how STF do this?
Thanks.I don't know if you can understand me. My English is not very well.
 Ok.
New question.I can understand the unique channel. I read ZeroMQ. The Pub/Sub example is as follow:

- Publisher  pubber.js

```js
// pubber.js
var zmq = require('zeromq')
  , sock = zmq.socket('pub');

sock.bindSync('tcp://127.0.0.1:3000');
console.log('Publisher bound to port 3000');

setInterval(function(){
  console.log('sending a multipart message envelope');
  sock.send(['kitty cats', 'meow!']);
}, 500);
```

- Subscriber  subber.js

```js
// subber.js
var zmq = require('zeromq')
  , sock = zmq.socket('sub');

sock.connect('tcp://127.0.0.1:3000');
sock.subscribe('kitty cats');
console.log('Subscriber connected to port 3000');

sock.on('message', function(topic, message) {
  console.log('received a message related to:', topic, 'containing message:', message);
});
```
In the  subber.js,  `sock.subscribe('kitty cats');` the subscriber  subscribes the channel named kitty cats. However,  in  `/stf/lib/units/device/support/sub.js`,  which I think every device has it own sub socket by this file,does not has the similar code .The publisher send data through the special channel , however,the subscriber doesn't subscribe the special channel. Is something  I missed?
  I need use android device without screen - tests some device. In my case Odrino C2. I think the same problem will by with Raspberry Pi, Banana Pi, Orange Pi, LattePanda etc.

When I start OpenSTF, minitouch doesn't work. Dosen't see any touchscreen and stops working.

Following I have the STF log.

I plant use more then 100 devices and I can't use 100 touchscreens. I think about virtual touchscreen, but I don't have any idea how to do it. Any idea ? I use Git repository: https://github.com/LoCorVin/minitouch.git

Didn't help :(

Any ideas ? What can I do more ?  @d0c3ntOS Hello, have you found any solution? I fell into similar issue... I have a similar problem on ODROID C2 when trying to connect to it. I can get Minicap to stream on one device, but not OpenSTF. Is there a way to disable the  minitouch feature? I have already tried to comment code here 'https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/badb3ed3be5d1b5cf889ad61244c3ca1a4fc6de5/lib/units/device/index.js#L31', but unfortunately it did not help..  @	d0c3ntOS 

I also encountered the same problem with you.
My device does not have a touch screen.
error is Unable to find a suitable touch device。
I have already solved。
Find out the device's initialization code and modify it.

 @xingkong130 , what part of the device initialization code did you modify, and on what device, and android version?  Hi,

I am trying to set up an STF-Server using your Deployment-doc. I can log in, but there are no devices shown. Doesn't matter which device I try to connect. In addition after some time the screen on the stf-dashboard shows "Disconnected"

stf local works just fine.

Following I have the stf-providers log.

What might be the problem here? Ok, sorry for removing the template. The devices in question are a Samsung A5, Samsung S6 and Sony Z1c.

I realized I've been running two instances of the provider.

Now I still cannot see my devices in the dashboard, though the provider says it is there:

    at /app/node_modules/engine.io/node_modules/ws/lib/Sender.js:270:10 when stf run several days or several weeks, this error occurs, I know it is there for information purposes, but it does lead the websocket exited many times, I guess there is a buffer to small, I don't know which one. @sorccuI, I finally found this is a bug in older versions of websocket, It's just a coincidence when it appear together with datautil's log, is there any plan to upgrade websocket to a newer version? This is the origin bug of websocket, https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/758 Yeah, I had upgrade socket.io to 2.0.2 which depends on engine.io@3.1.0, and engine.io@3.1.0 depends on ws@2.3.1, It worked fine for several days, but I'm not sure if there will be problems a few weeks later.  I am successfully running stf local and stf local --public-ip commands to view and control my android devices using a raspberry pi. What I plan to do is have such multiple Raspberry Pis connected to a central server such that now I can access all my devices from anywhere and not just my local IP. I have checked the Deployment.md files. However can I use multiple Providers and still connect to STF such that post login I can view all the *x* number of devices connected over *n* number of Raspberry Pis. What I intend to achieve is have multiple such Raspberry Pis sitting at different locations which connect to a central server for access from anywhere. Can this really be achieved using the STF Deployment strategy? This would work where I have all my android devices connected to a single Raspberry Pi. What if I have a single android device connected to each Raspberry Pi and now I want to access them centrally? What all services should I be deploying on the Raspberry Pi and what should I be running on the server?  I modify control-device.js

**What is the issue or idea you have?**
The STF api [docs](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/API.md) refer to v2 of swagger-js.  `npm i swagger-js` installs v3 of swagger-js and has breaking changes.  The swagger-js migration [document](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/blob/master/docs/MIGRATION_2_X.md) helps, but I ran into an issue that may require changes to STF's Swagger spec (& implementation?).

The STF Swagger Spec does not explicitly set `content-type` for empty POST requests.   Invoking swagger-js omits the `content-type` header for the operations where the device serial number serializes into the path. 

`client.apis.user.remoteConnectUserDeviceBySerial( { 'serial': '1234' })` 
becomes a POST against `/user/devices/1234/remoteConnect` with no body or content-type

On STF api service, the `content-type` is inferred as `application/octet-stream`, which does not conform to the swagger spec, and the request fails.   Can reproduce from swagger-js or from curl commands

swagger-js should (IMHO) follow the spec.  If the global `content-type` is specified in the `consumes` array of the swagger [spec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstf/stf/master/lib/units/api/swagger/api_v1_generated.json) then swagger should use it [swagger-js issue 1022](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/issues/1022).  

That said the STF Swagger Spec (/implementation?) should be more precise and allow empty POST bodies where appropriate.  This would conform to RFC and fix the issue.


**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**

n/a

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
Using curl, reserve the device, and send remoteConnect with no content-type specified
```
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"serial":"SERIAL"}' -H "Authorization: Bearer BEARER_TOKEN " http://ENDPOINT:7100/api/v1/user/devices

{"success":true,"description":"Device successfully added"}

curl -X POST  -H "Authorization: Bearer BEARER_TOKEN " http://ENDPOINT:7100/api/v1/user/devices/SERIAL/remoteConnect

{"message":"Validation errors","errors":[{"code":"INVALID_CONTENT_TYPE","message":"Invalid Content-Type (application/octet-stream).  These are supported: application/json","path":[]}]}

```

It works if the content-type header is specified (erroneously as there is no content):
```
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer BEARER_TOKEN" http: //ENDPOINT:7100/api/v1/user/devices/SERIAL/remoteConnect

{"success":true,"remoteConnectUrl":"ENDPOINT:7461"}
```

Swagger v3 does not expose the ability to explicitly set `content-type` on a per-request basis. 


**What is the expected behavior?**

Per [S.O. on RFC-7231](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28652339) when there is no content-type provided `application/octet-stream` may be inferred.    The STF Swagger spec should be updated to allow empty POST / default content-type

 Yes, I'm using --allow-remote option, but I'm not adding any device to STF with 'adb connect',
maybe another process is using adb? I will check it.. After reboot PC, STF is OK now...   I installed UBUNTU16.0.4 on a virtual machine.

 @vbanthia 
Thank you. It would be nice if  could solve this. For someone else with this problem using Arch Linux, [here](https://gist.github.com/franciscocpg/05d01d525aff5f34765f94121e1dc8b6) is some instructions that may help.  Where is the phone manufacturer of country?I never hear the brand. Hello everyone.

I searched for information and found that the user interface does not looks
like android and there are mentions of KaiOS created by KaiOS Technologies
Inc https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/13291989/?pathWildcard=13291989

I think that KaiOS is based on Firefox OS

Maybe the output of this commands helps to identify the OS version

adb shell getprop
or
adb shell cat /system/build.prop

I hope it helps.
regards

 Perfect!, it only remains to know if it is a FirefoxOS

I do not know anything about FirefoxOS, it is based on some data that I
found on the internet.

adb shell ls /data/b2g/mozilla/*.default/prefs.js

or running the ps version of b2g

adb shell b2g-ps

What is the issue or idea you have?
I am trying to get Cell Info (CID, LAC ,TAC ,RAC) & Signal Strength showing in Dashboard under Network

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
I did try to modify the monitoring java files under STFService, by adding `onCellInfoChanged(List<CellInfo> cellInfo)` & `onSignalStrengthsChanged(SignalStrength signalStrength)` methods under PhoneStateListener. 

I haven't added the changes to wire & writer yet, instead I am reporting the log as info and checking logcat but nothing is getting triggered. is this a known issue by any chance ? 



 Here  are nobody worked for you.Solved problem by yourself.  I am not expecting anybody to work for me ! I asked the question after spending hours trying to get it working.  This is code for **PhoneStateMonitor.java**, I am expecting Cell Changed is logged every time cell data is changed.

`  Cause one stf server can't connet too many phones or it may be done for some other reasons, I need more than one stf servers for our project.  If I run 2 stf servers like http://1.1.1.1:7100 and http://2.2.2.2:7100 , both of them are connected with some phones. 1.1.1.1 with phone A and B, 2.2.2.2 with phone C and D.
Question 1:
How can I see all the phones A , B ,C and D on one website (1.1.1.1)
Question 2:
If Question 1 was sovled , how can I operate phone A, D can do the same operation.
Thank you very much.  Hello there!

I getting erros during apk instalation by interface..
I'm using the last version of the branch master.

``` What is the name of apk?  When I read and test by myself, devices must connect to stf server by wire for adb connect. can I use wifi instead of connect to stf server? If I can't , can I modify stf code?how? I got it, thanks a lot  Hi @sorccu , thanks for your great works!  After read the deployment.md and the core topology, I just confused how message transmit between ZMQ's end-points, especially DEALER and DEALER.
Could you give a example in actual scene to explain it?
Sorry for my poor english, thank you again!

64966 verbose exit [ 1, true ] thank you . The problem has been solved  I'm trying to connect a device using 'adb connect' with the device.display.url value <"ws://ip:port"> but the device doesn't appear in the list. Then I tried to connect using the Remote Debug URL and it works. Shouldn't it be the same value in both cases?

Thanks for your reply Thanks, I SOLVE the problem.
Yesterday,I change some codes to fix  "screemshot" picture not show.  Now I change back ,"App Upload" FIXED, but "screemshot" not  show  back ......
I will try to fix it ,thanks for your reply  First,Thanks for your great Tools! My English not so good...

I change some codes in /stf/res/app/menu/menu.jade, 
Then input "gulp clean && gulp build "  but faild ....
It show  " No gulpfile found".
What show I do to make the changed STF work?

 Possible, but very very hard. A work arround is to install STF on a virtualization system like Virtual Box for instance !  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

I have pulled latest code and I am getting error when running STF locally. 
and also rethinkdb is started in another terminal.

Node version is **7.8.0**

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
Run $stf local
Run $rethinkdb

**What is the expected behavior?**
STF should start locally

Much Appreciated for help! apologies for bothering.

Cheers
SK  I noticed that while running openstf, I can directly connect to a device's websocket address to stream the screen. Is the same thing possible with touch interactions?

I know I can directly use minitouch, but it feels a bit too "low-level" if using it through openstf is exposed. Thanks for the super fast response 😄! I'll give that a try and see if I'm better off just using minitouch.  stf local output :

 https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/548#issuecomment-282198766 @sorccu i am not using https on my setup and i am only using http. 

@vbanthia the issue you have related to is about upload throwing 5XX error. In my case it is 301. Some redirection to the backend from nginx is not working.  Remote Debugging is not working.

Hello!
When I try to execute "adb connect 10.70.xx.xx:7577" after checking address and port on the Remote debug tab connecting device, then it always run successfully with response like "connected to 10.70.xx.xx:7577".
but I cannot find the device in the result of "adb devices". This happens only on small part of PCs including mine.

Also, my adb key can not be added in STF Web with "pbcopy < ~/.android/adbkey.pub".
~/.android/adbkey.pub file is a little different on my pc from one on another pc which works well.
If you look into my file, there is 0x00 between key and name, whereas there is only white space there in successful others' file.
Though I tried to recreate new adbkey file after deleting old adbkey file and run adb, 0x00 was included in the reulst again.

I am wondering if my issue has something to do with it.
If it is not in the case, what can I do to run adb connect?

My STF version is 2.3.0 and my adb key is same as below.
Please feel free to contact me if you need more information to figure out the cause.

I download android sdk from [tools_r25.2.3-macosx.zip](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r25.2.3-macosx.zip)

We are using latest stf@2.3.0 and adbkit@2.10.0. Yes, I am 100% sure about it. We are hosting stf in docker and I just tried `npm ls --depth | grep adbkit` in docker container. Then it says:
```
+-- adbkit@2.10.0
| +-- adbkit-logcat@1.1.0
+-- adbkit-apkreader@2.1.1
+-- adbkit-monkey@1.0.1
```  **What is the issue or idea you have?**

I changed in rethinkdb the model of all devices in the database so that the name of the phone displayed is clear (some devices had weird model names), but the moment I disconnected a device and connected it again, this value resets to the previous one that confuses people.

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**

Happens in all devices

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**

1. Connect a phone to OpenSTF
2. Connect to the rethinkdb admin
3. Make a query to change the model name of the device connected in step 1
4. Refresh and check that the model name changed succesfully
5. Disconnect the device
6. Connect the device

**What is the expected behavior?**

Model name changed in step 3 doesn't change when disconnecting and connecting
 Thanks for the quick reply!

Is there anyway I can change these values so that they stay permanently in the db? (Or any workaround that would just let users see quickly which device is which by their known name without knowledge of device model) My workaround is: create a script to update model name in rethinkdb, and add it to cronjob to run every 5 minutes :)  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->
Hi, I'm using the latest version of STF - 2.3.0. 
**What is the issue or idea you have?**
Devices are properly connected and detected by computer but STF is not detecting them. Note that on the same machine with an older STF version, this used to work fine. This issue started occurring only in this newer version 2.3.0

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**
When I run adb devices, list of devices is showing blank.

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
Connect the devices to computer, notice the computer has properly detected the devices

**What is the expected behavior?**
STF should also properly detect the attached devices.

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

 My bad, I'm closing this issue. Actually those attached devices' USB debugging setting was not enabled, because of which the adb devices was resulting blank. 

STF is working great. Thank you. closing per above comment  Hi 
    I wonder if stf can Sync Operation on several devices ? For example, I'm operating one devices, other devices do the same operations. Thanks ~  Android O source code already release: 
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/selinux/+/android-o-preview-1 Developer Preview 2 released. https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/selinux/+/android-o-preview-2  The news said that Android O Preview 3 released. Wish that STF could support this release. ^^ Thank you very much for your investigation. I browse this page every day and expect a good news. It's too hard for me to solve this issue by myself - :'( Dear Simo, is it possible to provide a limited edition of STFService.apk to support Android O Developer  Preview 3? ありがとうございます. um...not work on o preview .... looking forward it ..... Developer Preview 3 released. https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/selinux/+/android-o-preview-3 https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/selinux/+/o-preview-4,  it's almost the final official release. I got the final official image of Android O and flush it into my Pixel. There are two problems til now:

  1. In STFService.apk/app/src/main/java/jp/co/cyberagent/stf/monitor/RotationMonitor.java
      * This line  `report(writer, wm.getRotation());`  ==> wm is invalid, so the invocation of wm.getRotation() will cause connection stopping and stf device component attempt to restart service recursively until timeout.
         * Work around is to comment out the line of  `addMonitor(new RotationMonitor(this, writers));` in STFService.apk/app/src/main/java/jp/co/cyberagent/stf/Service.java   

  2. minicap doesn't work for Andriod O, it's a known [issue](https://github.com/openstf/minicap/issues/67)  
      * minicap error: "ERROR: (external/MY_minicap/src/minicap_26.cpp:281: errno: None) Unable to find neither AOSP nor O Developer Preview 1 BufferQueue::createBufferQueue"

Anyway, I'll try my best to resolve the problem of minicap on Android O
  **Environment:**

- STF Version 2.3.0
- Running in Docker Container after your deployment.md
- Serveral Android Phones, Tablets and Smartwatches connected to the different device hosts in different locations
- Wiko Lenny 3 (Android 6.0) with activated USB Debugging

**What is the issue or idea you have?**

STF Service App was automatically installed on the device.
The STF Service doesn't start on the Wiko Lenny 3.

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**

Yes, it happes only to Wiko LENNY 3.

0123456789ABCDEF       device product:V3702AN model:LENNY3 device:V3702AN

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**

Check if any old version of the STF Services is installed on the phone. If there are any old versions than uninstall them.
Plug the phone to device host with the USB Debugging enabled on the phone
--> STF Services doesn't start on phone. The phone is not listed in the STF web front end.

**What is the expected behavior?**

After plugging the phone to the device host.
The STF Services get installed and are started automatically by the device host.
Afterwards the Smartphone is listed on the STF web front end.

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

Felix Hahn I can't find any similar settings on the Wiko phone. I will look into the topic after my holiday. I will be back next week on monday.

Thank you for your fast response @sorccu Sorry, the mistake was on our side.
To use the Wiko Lenny 3 with STF you must deactivate the 360 Security app (is installed by default by Wiko) and allow STF Services in Protected Apps.

For deactivating Wiko 360 Security App: 

Settings -> Apps -> 360 Security -> than deactivate App

Allowing STF Service App in Protected App:

Settings -> Protected Apps -> Set the slider for STF Services on active

After you did these settings the Wiko Lenny 3 runs fine with STF :).

 Thank you for the advice. We already noticed this behaviour with several cheap phones from smaller manufacturers. This is a problem for us. Because from what I know the only way to set this serial number is to root the phone and this is no option for us. Am I right? Thank you :). The Proxy is a good idea. When there is time we will look into it. I will talk to Benjamin who did already the Appium Connector for us.

**What is the issue or idea you have?**
Hi there, STF is a great tool but I'm wondering if possible to configure the screen capture module (minicap?) for lower color depths. The thing is, one single device can eat up to 10-15 mbit/s bandwidth, even more if has HD screen - for debugging, you might not want to have full color palette (24-32bit) but instead, optimized bandwidth and reduced memory/cache usage may be a reasonable decision. What do you think? Is it already available maybe?

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**
Any

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
N/A

**What is the expected behavior?**
N/A

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**
N/A

**Please run `stf doctor` and paste the output here.**-
N/A
 Where I can find the option in configuration in master branch?
Thanks!  why code of storage-temp/index.js is require('../../units/storage/s3') and code of storage-s3/index.js is require('../../units/storage/temp')?Is there anything wrong?
 yes,i get it ,thank you!  The following error log was printed when some apk was install.

I am very sorry for my poor english.
I really hope to get your help.
Thank you very much Thank you very much for your quick reply.
There is also a problem, some phones open camera, the STF screen is black, turn off the camera, the STF screen is normal, what might be the reason?
About that three devices ,If you have time and would like to study and solve the problem, I will donate and express the parcel to you,as long as you give me the address.
Thank you very much for your open source spirit, to the vast number of programmers to bring a lot of Gospel  I've made some serious strides in my understanding of docker but I am having one last problem with the final connection.

Now it says it's unable to connect to `127.0.0.1:28015` but rethink says its listening on `port 28015`

Am I missing something? 

I've been reading other issues that have "no hosts left to try" and it's usually because rethink isn't running - but I can actually connect to it using a separate computer and `http://192.168.0.8:8080 `. So it would appear (at least to me), that it is up and working.

Also thank you for being around and answering questions, I know you must have better things to do than to help someone with their odroid testing cluster. 
 

  I now need to secondary development of STF, see the source code and found that the front-end procedures using Webpack package. Would like to ask you, in the project how to make their own changes in the JS source code effective? Ok, thanks, it seems that you are using the Webpack & Glup mode, to achieve on-demand loading and modular. Yes, I will always be concerned about this project. Wish good ~ @sorccu   I have an idea, that maybe the user can listen the audio inside the phone maybe awesome.
So, did you have tried this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15125139/android-get-device-overall-audio-output-in-pcm

I have tried this method, but the audio's quality is too low, can't heard clearly. Perhaps the native lib corresponds to the java be better. you might feed the device audio via host-PC's mic.

I believe there is a node to capture mic audio and stream it to the client browser.  stf local

Nevertheless, in my target deployment all these machines will not be in the same place, and it seems to be sure that a VPN connection will be required between the STF server and the STF provider. In such assumption, even if this VPN connection works well, clients will no be able to reach the provider to remote debug the phones, except if they are part of this VPN, isn't it ? Do you have experimented such architecture or do you have some recommendations about that ?

So, to progress in labs I established a simple VPN connection between the STF server and the STF provider machines, like this:
```
(provider: vpn server) # openvpn --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.1 10.4.0.2
(server: vpn client)   # openvpn --remote @provider --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.2 10.4.0.1
```
After what, I started the STF server and the STF provider services using the previous tunneling information, all work well through the GUI
- file explorer
- shell
- app upload
- remote debug url (ex: adb connect 10.4.0.1:15009 run from the STF server of course)
- ...

EXCEPT the phone screen appears as blank, so it is impossible to interact with the phone through its screen !

When I click on the "Use" button for a device, I don't see any network traffic on the VPN except the traffic on the ports 7250 and 7270

Here is an extract of the relating nginx configuration:
```
    location ~ "^/d/10.4.0.1/([^/]+)/(?<port>[0-9]{5})/$" {
      proxy_pass http://10.4.0.1:$port/;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
```

And the web console in Chrome:

<img width="1164" alt="capture d ecran 2017-02-22 a 14 53 27" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22766602/23214396/d838cde0-f90e-11e6-987f-d12db00fcdc6.png">





 I found a work around but I don't know if it is the correct solution : at STF provider side I changed the "screen-ws-url-pattern" parameter value in the corresponding systemd configuration file, replacing the VPN IP address of the STF server by its public IP address, and all work fine now !

But is it a correct solution ?  I tried instead at STF server side to modify the nginx configuration file doing the opposite modification, that is replacing the public IP address by the VPN one at websocket section, but it does not work !
 Is it possible to have an answer to my intial question : knowing that in fulll deployment architecture a client has an ADB direct access to the STF provider, and with the assumption that a VPN is required between the STF server and the STF provider, and so between the client and the STF provider for ADB traffic, do you have some recommendations about network configuration to deploy ?
Thanks. Yes I imagined to do that work, thank you very much to confirm that :-) Regarding the work around I used to get screen displayed through a VPN, that is specifying at provider side the public IP address of the server into the "screen-ws-url-pattern" parameter, I made a network trace and it seems the provider never establishes a connection to the server using this public IP address, so I suppose the "screen-ws-url-pattern" information is transmitted to the server through the VPN to be processed at server side, may you confirm that to me please ? 

If it is well the case so it is satisfactory for me because the VPN principle would be not violated by a websocket flow which would bypass the VPN.

Nevertheless, don't you think it would be more logical to specify into the "screen-ws-url-pattern" parameter only the IP addresses of the interfaces used by the provider and the server to communicate ?

 port mapping does not work because I use the "--net host" parameter in the docker run command, is there another way (i.e. except the full deployment) ? it works fine, thank you very much !  Don't know how the password is getting displayed whenever we access some devices. If we access browser it comes in url section. This looks like _adb shell input text <password>._ 

Please find the video in pptx. 
[ldap_video_Presentation.pptx](https://github.com/openstf/stf/files/782375/ldap_video_Presentation.pptx)

We have cluster setup and inside auth service we kept the LDAP user password same get's displayed to user who use the device. Please need a solution for this.

Steps to reproduce : 
1. click on device 
2. launch with browser and type the password 



![ldap_password_discovers](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17309586/23053305/6d8a1bf0-f4a6-11e6-860a-33bb8a187906.png)
 Is there any way to stop this as it only reads the value from password field? I am using my credential for LDAP auth and same using for login in stf :) @tadesushilgithub What browser are you using?

We might just add an `autocomplete="off"` to the input field [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/res/app/components/stf/screen/screen.pug#L16)

However it looks like new Chrome versions are ignoring it, so we will need to do cross-browser testing before doing it. Unfortunately its one of those places that its not possible to do automated testing.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15738259/disabling-chrome-autofill Thanks @gunta I am using Mozilla Firefox 51.0.1.  The Firefox password autofill can be incredibly aggressive, filling in any `<input type="password">` in the page, and even filling the preceding field (if there is one) with your username.  One workaround may be to insert the field with `type="text"` and then (almost immediately) change the type to `password` in JS, though I'm not sure how that would affect the cross-browser and non-Latin issues referred to above.  It might be worth testing, though, if you haven't yet found a better solution for this issue. Issue confirmed on Google Chrome 63.0.3239.84.

Apart from the autocomplete popup being really annoying, the fact that the password autocomplete inserts a saved password to the application with on wrong click is a serious problem for me.

As we use STF on a company domain, all the other company system's login details are offered. Using a password field for this is a very bad idea, but if you must, `autocomplete="new-password"` is how you can turn it off on newer browsers: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Securing_your_site/Turning_off_form_autocompletion#The_autocomplete_attribute_and_login_fields So when you focus a password field, the browser automatically switches to a latin keyboard layout for you.
This is a convenient feature, sure. But if you want to type a comment in English right here, you have to switch to a latin layout, no? Why can't you do the same in STF?
IMHO not having our passwords exposed like that is more important than automatically switching to a latin keyboard if someone happens to be using an IME. We fixed this by monkeypatching stf's js code on startup:

Put this into the systemd config of stf-app
```
ExecStartPost=/usr/local/bin/stfinputhack.sh %p-%i
```

And save this as /usr/local/bin/stfinputhack:

```
#!/bin/sh
sleep 10
/usr/bin/docker exec --user 0 "$1" sh -c 'cd /app/res/build && for file in *.js; do perl -pi -e "s|type=\\\\\"password\\\\\"([^>]*?)(\\\$root\.screenFocus\\\\\")|type=\\\\\"text\\\\\"\1\2|" "$file";done'
```

I also tried type="tel", type="url" and type="email", but none of those autoswitched like type="password". So I'm sorry, but the perfect solution you're looking for doesn't seem to exist, at least not in browsers that don't support ime-mode. `new-password` might also be problematic because the browser might show some ui to generate a new password, or it might save the new password into its password manager.  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

**What is the issue or idea you have?**
If I build stf locally after cloning from github, I cannot connect devices, the following error keeps appearing upon device connect and the stf is not available via browser:

If I install openstf as a global npm module, it works like a charm - but with local instance, no luck. I've seen some minicap-related issues, but not like this typeerror: cannot read property... so I opened a new issue ticket. 

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run adb devices -l and paste the corresponding row.**

 + as long as devices are not connected, everything works fine. When I connect a device (either before or after launching stf) the errors start appearing.

 The ide is android studio 2.2.3. The eclipse does not have this problem. I am confused.  This PR adds ability to specify domain of authorized email addresses.
If option is not set then behavior is not changed and any (excluding missing) email address is authorized.

In case of not authorized domain (including missing email address) simple error message is shown.

This theoretically also fixes bug with infinite redirect loop in case of missing email address in response from OAuth provider. At least with Google, unconditional redirect to `/auth/oauth/` used to cause such loop, not sure if email can be missing despite `email` scope is requested and if infinite loop was also applicable to other providers.

 @vbanthia 

Perfect mate.
Spot on working now.

Do you know can we run appium Automation scripts on this devices ?

 Hello @vbanthia
effectively the example that you show us is perfect.

My question is I can send the execution from another computer that is in the same network, when I launch the command DEVICE_SERIAL = XXXXXX ./scripts/run_integration_test.sh, I'm doing it from a windows and the STF I have it in a MAC  **DB is not initialized when running stf local first time**

**What is the issue or idea you have?**
Hey,
EACH device will be ignored by provider service. 

```INF/provider 1 [*] Subscribing to permanent channel "NMTZ2IqATEWH19zK+hCkdQ=="
INF/provider 1 [*] Sending output to "tcp://qadevicefarm.de:7270"
INF/provider 1 [*] Receiving input from "tcp://qadevicefarm.de:7250"
INF/provider 1 [*] Tracking devices
INF/provider 1 [*] Found device "47900b6e9dd21100" (device)`
INF/provider 1 [*] Providing all 0 of 3 device(s); ignoring "47900b6e9dd21100", "47900b6e9dd21100", "47900b6e9dd21100"
```

No STFService.apk will be installed on the device.
The setup is almost the same like in the DEPLOYMENT description. The stf-triproxy-dev.service is running.

I also did the setup on another machine with the same result.

In front of the machine where STF is running, an apache is installed, which provides the host name and forwards https access. Therefor I had to adapt the nginx.conf to get rid of mixed content.

But now I'm at my wit's end.

Do I need to configure IPs in the services and let nginx handle all hostname related stuff?
Or do I also have to provide full hostname in the service files?

Thank you for your help.
Martin 

 Sorccu!! It is working now!! Changed the domain name to the correct IP.

Thank you for your support!!

(Due to privacy considerations I changed the original domain to a not working one) I have the same problem?? Where I change it the domain for ip??

Thanks  **What is the issue or idea you have?**
There are artifacts on screen preview like on attached picture.

**Does it only happen on a specific device?**
Yes. Samsung Galaxy SM-G350
`product:cs02xx model:SM_G350 device:cs02`

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
Start using the device.

**What is the expected behavior?**
There is a clean preview visible.

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**
Not using local but docker containers, however here are the logs:

```  There are a few docker containers that run android emulator inside of them. The one below in particular you can expose your adb connection to the host machine. Just curious if anyone has attempted this or if it would even work with openstf?

https://hub.docker.com/r/tracer0tong/android-emulator/~/dockerfile/
 Interesting. I can get the emulator screen to appear and fully interact the STF controls when gpu in ON. With gpu off, it unfortunately does not work. I was running a generic_x86_64 on SDK 23 on my local OSX machine, not in a container.

emulator -avd EM1 -no-window -gpu on  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

Except the below issue, all works fine.

I used the latest image and I met the same issue than #100 , in a similar configuration, I mean with a stf-provider in one machine (linux) and the other services in another machine (linux), both located on the same network. 

I read answer at #104, and then I set -e "ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE=1" and -e "ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=30000" when launching services through docker, for instance stf-triproxy-dev.service:
```
....
[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/etc/environment
TimeoutStartSec=0
Restart=always
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill %p
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm %p
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm \
  --name %p \
  --net host \
  -e "ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE=1" \
  -e "ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=30000" \
  openstf/stf:lastest \
  stf triproxy dev \
    --bind-pub "tcp://*:7250" \
    --bind-dealer "tcp://*:7260" \
    --bind-pull "tcp://*:7270"
ExecStop=-/usr/bin/docker stop -t 10 %p
....
```


but it seems it does not change anything I mean after a while I get totally blank screen after click the use button on device.

My questions are:
- the value for ZMQ timer must be specified in seconds or milliseconds ?
- what are the precise services I have to set ZMQ variables ?

Thanks.


 No I have 5 devices and the issue is the same for all.
When all services are on the same machine I have no issue.
Before to set ZMQ variables I tried to set net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=30 on the host before to launch services and with the '--net host' option I verified that connecting to the container with bash there was the same value, but I met also the same issue.
For information on device side, I used the openstf/atf-armv7l image because the host is raspberry PI.
May you help me please because it is very blocking for me ?
May you also answer to my questions please ?
Thanks. Great ! It works fine now !
Thanks From your point of view you what is the good value ?
Thanks

I updated those old comments that had the weird value of 30000. You had to read the issue all the way till the end to see that the values were actually supposed to be in seconds. Also, not sure if 300 seconds is even a good value or not.

I think timeout unit depends on host OS. For MacOS it is ms & for linux it is seconds. I tested it with MacOS first that is why it was in ms before but later all the issues were on linux system that is why in seconds later.

Also, 300 seconds is working fine with all the past issues, so I think it is okay.

 After a quick research i figured out that this turns out be a bug in nodejs core documented here:
https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5108

Does anyone have a workaround for this leak problem?

Thank you all  I create a translating to Portuguese, can you merge?

Thanks @gunta can you help me?  Hi,
I've been trying to set up a server with stf for some time now. My problem is that all the services fail because they cannot connect to rethinkDB. The reason for this might be the following:
in Deployment.md you state that after starting rethinkDB one should open the webinterface and run this command:

`r.db('rethinkdb').table('cluster_config').get('auth').update({auth_key: 'newkey'})`

In my case this always throws following error:

> 
{

    "deleted": 0 ,
    "errors": 1 ,
    "first_error": "It's illegal to delete rows from the `rethinkdb.cluster_config` table." ,
    "inserted": 0 ,
    "replaced": 0 ,
    "skipped": 0 ,
    "unchanged": 0

}

In my opinion this is the reason why nothing works, but I may be wrong on this one.

Thanks for your help. You can try setting up the password on the first run of your rethink server.
`rethinkdb --initial-password yourBrandNewKey`

Or you can try this in the console instead:
`r.db('rethinkdb').table('users').get('admin').update({password:'yourBrandNewKey'})` and it seemd to do the trick but I'm not sure if the 2 commands do the same thing. So the solution I've found that seems to work is as @mirceanis suggested:

`r.db('rethinkdb').table('users').get('admin').update({password:'yourBrandNewKey'})`

It seems that you can enter whatever password you want there. At least now all of my services can connect to rethinkDB.

Thank you guys.  **What is the issue or idea you have?**
I've been able to access my devices remotely with different machines that are in the same network. Now I want to do the same from a different network but I'm unable even though I have created a redirection in the router.

Could you please give me some indications on what should be done? I'd be really grateful to you.

Thanks!
Victor Everything's working now, was making a noob mistake with the IPs  Will you please tell me how you did that? @viktors89 Can tell me how? I am trying to do the samething? any guide would be appreciated!Thanks   QualiTests-Mac-mini-2:stf03012017 qualitest$ sudo npm install -g stf

I'm running rethinkdb in terminal 1 and trying to run stf local in terminal 2. When i run stf local i'm getting this error. Also i updated node.js  and npm, but still i'm getting this error. Please help.
  Is it possible to restrict access to a specif group on STF when using LDAP?

In my company I added a group to manage who will have access to STF.

First I run STF without selecting the group and that works and I'm able to authenticate

`stf local --auth-type ldap --auth-options '["--ldap-url","$URL","--ldap-search-dn","DC=inner_dc,DC=inner_dc,DC=com","--ldap-bind-credentials","$PASS", "--ldap-bind-dn","CN=user_stf,OU=inner_ou,OU=inner_ou,DC=inner_dc,DC=inner_dc,DC=com","--ldap-search-field", "sAMAccountName"]'`

When I change the command to restrict a specific group I get a message of "authentication failed for user xxxxx"

`stf local --auth-type ldap --auth-options '["--ldap-url","$URL","--ldap-search-dn","CN=specific_group,OU=inner_ou,OU=inner_ou,DC=inner_dc,DC=inner_dc,DC=com","--ldap-bind-credentials","$PASS", "--ldap-bind-dn","CN=user_stf,OU=inner_ou,OU=inner_ou,DC=inner_dc,DC=inner_dc,DC=com","--ldap-search-field", "sAMAccountName"]'`

How can I grant access to STF for a specific group?
 relevant to #714  Hi, any advanced about stf login ldap as member group??

 I've got exactly the same thing happening on a Lenovo Tab3 Essential.  It seems to be related to rotation; if I physically rotate the device so that it goes into portrait mode, the live image appears fine, and I can then lock the orientation and it'll be fine until the orientation gets unlocked again.  Attempting to rotate the device in STF seems to unlock the orientation though, resulting in the image becoming garbled again - so it can only really be used when locked in portrait orientation.

I wonder if this is related to the Tab3 Essential allowing full 360 degree rotation (i.e. you can have it portrait but upside down, or landscape with the "top" of the device either pointed to the left or the right); does your Fire device allow full rotation too, @shivshankark? Interesting I noticed the same issue on AWS device farm seems like they are using STF.  * translations are inconsistent: e.g. "access tokens" got different translations. "app" got no translation and translations to "应用“
* incorrect translation: e.g. "keys" should not be "按键". I found that old translation was correct, it was "密钥" in zh_hans.json
* weird translations: e.g. "ADB keys" translated to "安卓调试桥的密钥". Acronyms should not be translated. I'm the translator. The translation maybe unable to meet everyone's standards.
You can modify the code to your version. 
The path: /res/common/lang/translations/stf.zh_CN.json It's not about the taste. It's correctness, accuracy, consistency and common translation standards.
I would make a PR when I have time.  I find some phones even  'nexus 5x' ,'huawei honor 6' , 'lenovo' can't export logcat.
I have used cmd 'adb logcat -B' to export logcat.
Compared the normal devices ,I found something wrong with the err devices.
The err devices  output the first line have some garbled like this.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18346467/21413905/c0716f00-c835-11e6-8239-7bf996ab03d6.png)

It that caused the logcat can't export ?


 Yes You means to upload the logcat file? I have used to adb-kit to write a test code to locate the problem.But adb.openlogcat can't read this nexus phone' logcat.It doesn't work too.Maybe something special like this  kinds of phone.
The code :

```
var adbkit = require('adbkit')
//var Promise = require('bluebird')
var adb = adbkit.createClient({host:'127.0.0.1', port:5037})
adb.Keycode = adbkit.Keycode
var serial = 'D8YDU16115003258'
//var serial='012e8e2764d6bccc'

adb.openLogcat(serial,{
      clear: true
    })
      .then(function (logcat) {
        function entryListener(entry){
          console.log(entry)   //      nexus  entry nothing
        }
        logcat.on('entry', entryListener)
        logcat.on('error',function (err) {
         console.log('entry error')
         console.error(err)

        })
    })
``` @sorccu 
I have found the problem.Because some phones do not have command(logcat -c).It occured permission denied.Do  you have a better idea to solve it?
Like this:

  Hi all,
well I'm beginner, and I'd like to know, whether was used anyone Designer patterns on development of STF, I'm learning the source code, to understand how things happens there, but it's quite hard to understand them. Do you have any help to developers? STF it's a hard project to study without a apprenticeship direction.  Hi, mates!
Have you tested or recommend any other micro USB cable model different from those described in the "Recommended Hardware"section? I'm not having technical issues with the _monoprice_ cables, but it would be nice if I could find another seller.
Thanks!  when the same user is logged in two different sessions, the socket is shared... it should be two different sockets!
 Thank you for the quick answer. I´ll work on a decent workaround to this issue. and if we got to a possible interesting solution we´ll share it  Hi,

I have cloned the repo from here. It is pointing to master branch.

I followed the below steps to build and run stf.

> First, fetch all NPM and Bower modules:
> 
> `npm install`
> You may also wish to link the module so that you'll be able to access the stf command directly from the command line:
> 
> `npm link`

After this I started stf with the below command.

`stf local --public-ip <<my ip>>`

From my local machine, i am able to access stf and the devices. When my colleague tried launching via IP, she was able to launch. However when she clicked on `Use` for one of the devices, the device section was blank and grey. Then it moved back to device detail page and showed that devices are disconnected.

However, I was able to see the devices all this while.

Please help!  @sorccu Can you please help me with this? Hello,
Did you check it is not simply a Firewall issue because it seems to be ? @denis99999 yes this was a firewall issue.   I am trying to setup oAuth login with office 365 for STF.

```
stf local --auth-type oauth2 \
  --auth-options '[ 
    "--oauth-authorization-url", "https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/authorize?resource=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com",
    "--oauth-token-url", "https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/token",
    "--oauth-userinfo-url", "**<What should be here?>**",
    "--oauth-client-id", "<my-client-id>",
    "--oauth-client-secret", "<my-secret>",
    "--oauth-callback-url", "https://stf.example.org/auth/oauth/callback",
    "--oauth-scope", "openid email"
  ]'
```

Wanted to understand what should be the _--oauth-userinfo-url_ ?

Please help. @sorccu Thanks I was able to set it up. However, getting this error in the logs

`WRN/auth-oauth2 8996 [*] Missing email in profile`

This is because the response doesn't contain the email field. 

I am trying the modify the code and building locally now. Is there any other way? I solved the `Missing email` issue by locally modifying the code and building it. 

This is the change i did.

- Under `lib/units/oauth2/`
- Modified `index.js` router method `app.get(
    '/auth/oauth/callback'
  , function(req, res)`

- Added the below block.

```
      else if (req.user.unique_name) {
        res.redirect(urlutil.addParams(options.appUrl, {
          jwt: jwtutil.encode({
            payload: {
              email: req.user.unique_name
            , name: req.user.unique_name.split('@', 1).join('')
            }
          , secret: options.secret
          , header: {
              exp: Date.now() + 24 * 3600
            }
          })
        }))
      }
```

Then it worked!  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

**What is the issue or idea you have?**

When I control some  virtualkey android devices (doesn't have physical key), the menu button cannot work in stf.  I click menu button in stf ,but android device has no response.

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**
1、connect a android devices (has virtualkey)
2、click menu button in stf

**What is the expected behavior?**
  menu button will work


**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**
no

**Please run `stf doctor` and paste the output here.**
   Menu,home ,back key are present on the device. 
And Home and back key can work well. But menu key cannot work.  Oppo A37 after installing apk restuns an err.

as you can see, I rebuild the "Devices" tab content to many canvas so I can watch every devices screen change real-time. so I met the performance issue. cpu 100% and memory 100%.

my solutions:
1. I create a angular directive which contain just one canvas. then i get the screen data from many node process( i have read the code , when a device plugin the a new process was created and a port was distributed).  then i use canvas drawimage function to draw the each blob data at it right position.  it seem has some good effect. memory consumption has down。

2.another solution is that restrict the amount of websocket information transmission。 i setInterval in each node process( the file is stf/lib/units/device/plugins/screen/stream.js ) to control it send frame data every 1000ms.

3. divide into pages. limit  maximum 18 devices send data at each 1s

but there also some problem:
1. send data each 1s make it seem not smooth in browser. but if i send data more faster there are so many request .  chrome not work well.

do you have some advice. i really need a more efficient solution

  yeah. I now, thank you. I already worried about the performance when i get the product demand. if it's a C/S architecture not a B/S architecture or using some efficient language like c/java, may be it's more fast. this project seems not suit for this scenario. I have't forgot to minify the scale of the screen to 250*300. it made some help Interesting. Definitely not easy but not impossible neither.

So where did you found the biggest bottleneck right now? 
Canvas drawing / Network / Etc?

If the problem happens to be in client side / canvas drawing you could try drawing in a big single canvas. I suspect browsers are not optimised to have so many canvas drawing at the same time. I found two bottleneck.
1. Canvas drawing.  although i draw in a big single canvas. but there are so many drawImage function call. now one page max 18 devices. my core-i3 cpu show 60%-70%. if i put more device in one page.  it can expand 100%.
2. Network. one page max 18 devices means 18 websocket requests to handle in one seconds. if chrome can't handle all.  the screen in browser is slower than actual devices.  For example, if i open a second chronograph， it need more than 1s in chrome change from 53s to 54s ok. i also try use node-canvas to merge all imgs into one big img, then send to client. at it reduce the num of request and client's drawimage call.  it solved client performance issue. but node server has more consumption. it's not a good idea. may be this idea can help you For canvas drawing in this case the biggest bottleneck inside `drawImage` should be JPEG decompressing (and uploading to the GPU).

It might be worth investigating to do the image mixing on server side, it will add a lag for sure but it will make client side not eat so much CPU. Definitely doing the image mixing on a separate unit / server (and not with node.js but with something fast like https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips) might be better.  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

Is it possible to use the stream of screen from minicap or from openstf from an other webpage ? I want to embed the screen in one tv dashboard we have.

Thank you for your help.

Rgds.
 Cool. I will try this. Thanks for the update. I will try the node.js example in the repo.  <Not a bug>

Is it possible to take touch events from one phone and mirror it across other phones? It might sound crazy but would be so usefull? 
 Oops sorry about that. 

Thanks for the quick reply.  
Firstly, thanks for you guys create this great tool。as you can see, I met this problem you have listed:
> unsufficient USB host controller resources

as you describe, I run 'stf local' on ubuntu16.04 and plugin maximum 9 usb devices, if go on to plugin more, then i get this error. I know that i can extend the scale by deploy on server, but own demand is that plugin 30 nexus5 in one host computer.


I can't find disable usb3.0(or xhci) options in my bios, so I bought a PCIE extension card like <a href="https://item.jd.com/1004542.html">this</a>. so can you explain why we need usb extension card to solve this problem , i am so curious。

 @vbanthia Is this web session timeout? or adb timeout? Because I ran automated test cases for 4 hr 42 min that time device was alive. But adb disconnect is sporadic. let me check while reserving device if I configure maximum timeout how it helps? @vbanthia getting exception {"message":"Unexpected token '","body":"'{serial:c8ee0c840836f31a,timeout:86400}
'","status":400} @vbanthia  Can I override the timeout while reserving the device? 

Please find below request :

### My context
- **latest openstf image from docker hub build last day**
- debian jessie 3.16.0-4-amd64
- full deployment (DEPLOYMENT.md) with one machine running all services except provider service running on another machine (ARM one: openstf/stf-armv7l image)
- see other configuration details in my previous issue #479

### What the issue
- when I connect to the login page, I enter my login/passwd (i.e. mock authentification), then an empty page is returned !!!
- note this issue appear with or without SSL configuration
- note this issue didn't appear in the previous build

### Work around 
- I switched to the previous release v2.3.0 in which this issue doesn't appear
 Hi @sorccu,
I made 4 screenshots, see joined files, I hope it will be sufficient for you to investigate about this issue, I'm waiting for further instructions

 I saw a new release was build this night, so I updated but I have always the same issue, do you have any news about that ?

Note in v2.3.0 this issue doesn't appear so it is not a configuration issue, isn't it ? To simplify my configuration, I made a full deployment on a single machine, but it doesn't change anything.

 I checked 4 hours ago with latest docker image and it was not resolved. It's great it works fine now, thank you very much  @vbanthia !!!  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->
### My context
- debian jessie 3.16.0-4-amd64
- STF local has worked fine !
- I am trying to migrate to the full deployment (DEPLOYMENT.md) with one machine running all services except provider service running on another machine

### What works fine 
- all services are started correctly
- all devices on the provider machine are well detected and signaled to the main machine for registration in the rethinkdb database : I well verified through the "data explorer" the database was populated checking for instance all present devices
- so it seems internal communication between all services works well !

### What the issue
- when I connect to the login page, I enter my login/passwd (i.e. mock authentification), then I validate and STF returns me to the login page, so that I never go further. Looking the logs I saw I was well authenticated but a "304 Not Modified" was returned ! 

### What I made 
- I tried to switch from the "STF rethinkdb.service" to the old "LSB rethinkdb.service" I used with the STF local version but it didn't change anything
- I tried to switch the nginx configuration from https to http, so without ssl, but it didn't change anything
- I read the #76 issue but I have no loopback address in my systemd service files, I also tried to replace the "location /auth/ ... " section by the "location /auth/mock/ ..." section, but it didn't change anything
- I feel this is a problem on my nginx configuration but I don't know what !!!

### My configuration
on the main machine:
- one public interface : 10.194.124.248
- one private interface : 192.168.29.56
- Systemd services : rethinkdb.service, rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service, stf-api@3700.service, stf-app@3100.service, stf-auth@3200.service, stf-processor@proc1.service, stf-processor@proc2.service, stf-reaper.service, stf-storage-plugin-apk@3300.service, stf-storage-plugin-image@3400.service, stf-storage-temp@3500.service, stf-triproxy-app.service, stf-triproxy-dev.service, stf-websocket@3600.service, nginx.service

on the provider machine:
- one public interface : 10.194.128.171
- Systemd services : stf-provider@floor1.service, + adb (1.0.36 version)

no FW between the two machine, so that all is open

 Hi Sorccu,

Thank you very much it works fine now !!! But it is a little shame for me not to have seen this error lol

In fact, **it doesn't work fine with _the latest version_ build this day, it seems there is a regression** because when I logged I have only a blanck screen, and the logs return a "304" ! Did you have the same conclusion ?

So, waiting for the bug fix I made a rollback to the v2.3.0 version which seems to work fine.

In addition, where is the place to ask for new openstf features ? For instance, the main feature I would like to have is a reservation system enabling users to reserve smartphones for a time slot, is it planned in the roadmap ?

Denis. Thanks @gunta but is this PR always active because it seems the author left this project, do you plan to continue this work ?

Denis.  <!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of STF.* -->

Running 2.3.0 with stf local on an ubuntu 16.10 machine

**What is the issue or idea you have?**

The user is able to use the device through the web interface, but adb connect does nothing. It says you are connected to the device, but then running 'adb devices' comes up empty. Killing/restarting adb, stf, rethinkdb, or the system does not help.

Re-adding the key through the UI also doesn't help, the 'add' dialog goes away but it doesn't add the key/change anything.

The only workaround/fix I have found so far is to remove the adb keypair of the user on their machine, restart adb so it generates a new one. Then the browser shows a dialog to add the new adb key, and from then on it works fine.

Note that when a user with this bug does 'adb connect', the logs in the terminal on the server do show a new successful connection.

**Does it only happen on a specific device? Please run `adb devices -l` and paste the corresponding row.**

Doesn't seem to be related to devices, it happens randomly.

**Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.**

Happens at random and rarely, had it on both windows and macos machines.

**What is the expected behavior?**

adb connect actually showing the device after in adb devices.

**Do you see errors or warnings in the `stf local` output? If so, please paste them or the full log here.**

No errors Interesting...however, these cases all happened on machines other than the PC that is running STF, and the adb keys were not copied/shared intentionally anywhere. I see how re-adding the key wasn't helping because of this limitation, but why did it initially happen?

Basically, if we're not actually trying to use the same keys on multiple PCs, do you see why this problem could arise? And how we can avoid it? Ah, so if a user forgot his/her login credentials and made a new login with new username but old adb keys, this issue would happen? So once we use active directory accounts and users can't just change their logins, this will stop happening?

That clears up everything, thank you very much! While some error message or feedback would be great to have in these cases, I consider this mystery solved and you may feel free to close the issue.  INF/device:plugins:touch 4553 [7d068e69] Launching screen service

Is this an Ubuntu problem or STF?
 so how strong suppose to be my PC to run more devices?
we use now:
i5-4590, 16G, with SSD

Or can you give us recommendation on server specs to run more devices?

  Hi ,
I Setup Stp as mentioned in Github, but when i connect my android device locally and open the url in browser -> Sign in  -> Connect to the android this appears:
<img width="1436" alt="screenshot 2016-11-14 15 05 35" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5002269/20260550/2d76b250-aa80-11e6-9009-a6c6549e6489.png">
In Console this gets printed:
INF/util:datautil 1703 [*] Device database does not have an entry for "ZY222XRRBT" (model "XT1562"/"lux_retasia_ds"). This is not an error, it only means that we don't have data for it yet. @sorccu  You are right 
Error:
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:7400/' failed: Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
Please help to resolve this error.
 It appears that you may have your system misconfigured.   According to that error, you are trying to get the screen data from "localhost" instead of your server.   Unless you are testing on the machine you are running OpenSTF on, this won't work.

So, a couple of things to check.  First, in your nginx.conf, make sure that everything references the IP address of the server, and not "localhost".  (This includes the portion that defines the address of the provider service.)    Next, if you are starting it with systemd, make sure that you use the IP address of the server in all of the systemd configuration files.   Also, make sure that nginx is set up to serve the websocket data on port 7400.

The other thing that jumps out at me is that the URL above is "ws://localhost:7400".   If you followed the instructions on the web site, you should have been configured to use HTTPS.   The "ws://" portion tells the browser *NOT* to use an SSL connection to the server.   So, you want to make sure that, if the server is running on HTTPS, that you use "wss://" instead.

(Note : I am not a developer, just a fellow user trying to help out. ;) I met the same problem and succefully solved it. The probable reason is that you give a incorrect --screen-ws-url-pattern when starting the provider. this url is used for the web browser to get the device screen infos and show them on the web browser. need more infos to help you. Did you deploy openSTF in local mode or production mode？  Was able to setup STF using docker. But the devices connected to it are not being listed in the UI. Its showing an error window saying, 'Disconnected'. This is to setup stf locally. Also the operating system is windows 10.
This issue happens with all the devices we connected.

 Thanks sorccu. It was giving the following error:-

I removed the ip and ran stf again. Its still giving the error:-

Could you please help?
 I had ran the following command to run stf:-
docker run  --privileged -itd --name stfpublic --link think_db:rethinkdb -p 7100:7100 -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb chuross/stf-adb stf local

I had used the dockerfile available in docker hub. Do I need to setup STF as mentioned in deployment guide? I am new to docker and I have no idea how to begin. :(
 I tried setting up STF as mentioned in deployment.md. I do not have any server where I can deploy it. What I did was created 2 virtual machines(Ubuntu) and set 2 different static ips for them. Created unit files as mentioned and started all the services. Tried accessing STF in browser using one of the ip(given in app-url). 
 Did not show any error but nothing got displayed.
  I'm new to these and not sure where I went wrong. Could you please help.  Hi,

I have installed stf on OS X 10.11.5, there's a problem while I pluged an phone,
The stf log print that it has found my devices,

How can I solve this?  STF serivce can't run in SUMSUNG S6. STFservice haven't an ativity,and SUMSUNG OS is forbidden to this service.

Feel free to contact with me. Thanks I have same problem with LG V20 (H990). Not sure if is cheaper but the same issue occurs on LG-K500n (X screen).

 > it seems that there's an area above the usual menu bar that's part of the touch screen, yet operates as a separate tiny display for icons. It seems like the coordinates are off by just about the height of the icon area.

It is true for LG X screen, there is an tiny LCD above the normal one. By default it displays status bar icons when main screen is off and owner's name when it is on.
And the offset seems to be equal to a height of a tiny screen.
So correcting touched point coordinate by the height of that screen can fix this issue.

> It would be great if you guys could ask your respective companies to donate to the project to cover the costs.

I can't make such donation but can try to implement some fix.

On that device, display height reported by [Display#getRealSize()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Display.html) is smaller than [Motion range](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/InputDevice.html#getMotionRange(int)) for AXIS_Y. While on device w/o additional screen they are equal. Maybe that can be starting point. Both input device and screen resolutions and can be obtained via API, so it seems to be possible to use them. Any advice, where is the right place in the code to add that offset?
I can try to figure out how to calculate it and make a PR fixing this issue. I meant `figure out how to calculate it` rather than hardcoding. ```WINDOW MANAGER LAST ANR (dumpsys window lastanr)

 When running 'stf doctor', it shows
 _ERR/util:doctor 11404 [*] Current ProtoBuf version is not supported, it has to be ~2_
But the _protoc --version_ prints 
_libprotoc 3.2.0_
Maybe we should use the proper protobuf version to make the screenshot feature work.
 Mostly looks like the stream argument which we pass to plugin.store(line 15) for image storage:
lib/units/device/support/storage.js 
is bad.
The body looks:
{"stats":{"bytesTransferred":0},"_readableState":{"objectMode":false,"highWaterMark":16384,"buffer":{"head":null,"tail":null,"length":0},"length":0,"pipes":null,"pipesCount":0,"flowing":null,"ended":false,"endEmitted":false,"reading":false,"sync":false,"needReadable":true,"emittedReadable":false,"readableListening":false,"resumeScheduled":false,"defaultEncoding":"utf8","ranOut":false,"awaitDrain":0,"readingMore":false,"decoder":null,"encoding":null},"readable":true,"domain":null,"_events":{"end":[null,null]},"_eventsCount":3,"_writableState":{"objectMode":false,"highWaterMark":16384,"needDrain":false,"ending":false,"ended":false,"finished":false,"decodeStrings":true,"defaultEncoding":"utf8","length":0,"writing":false,"corked":0,"sync":true,"bufferProcessing":false,"writecb":null,"writelen":0,"bufferedRequest":null,"lastBufferedRequest":null,"pendingcb":0,"prefinished":false,"errorEmitted":false,"bufferedRequestCount":0,"corkedRequestsFree":{"next":null,"entry":null}},"writable":true,"allowHalfOpen":true,"_transformState":{"needTransform":false,"transforming":false,"writecb":null,"writechunk":null,"writeencoding":null}}

but the tmp stored data located on machine in tmp folder looks okay. So that exclude issue with protobuf.

Also mostly looks like the image stored in as blob is correct one. I missed one thing. My bad. The screenshot will work after we use this import.
var gm = require('gm').subClass({imageMagick: true})
I created pull request with my changes, which fix described over here issue.
https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/738
Those changes works for me and I have that it will work for you @onlinesen, @xiaobeiying , @kennethzhu  too. I'm crossing my fingers :) .
 I missed, my changes need to have installed imagemagick on stf server machine  Hi:
I ran the STF in localhost, someone else(not same with my ip) accessed my STF website. I tried  get his IP address  by 'req.connection.remoteAddress', but the value is always '127.0.0.1'. Why and how to solve the problem.
English is not my first language.Thank you . Thank you very much. I troubled by this issue for 3 hours.Thank you again
 @yulishuta How do make my STF Public? Can tell me how please. I have tried port forwarding on my router but it redirects top local ip (192.168.1.9:7100) but I want make publicly Accessible. any help would be appreciated. I have also tried to NGrok still the same.   ```

During my debugging process, i found the  'register' event never be triggered.

How about use 
'''
resolve() 
'''
to replace the line 
'''
privateTracker.once('register', resolve)
'''

 @sorccu  
But 'change' and 'remove' event always works and can be triggered. 
I didn't seek out the root cause why register process can't be invoked.  :(
Could you give some suggestions for trouble shooting.
 After remove & install  again the stf package.
All things work fine on node v6.9.0 runtime~~~
Maybe some of the dependencies have been installed incorrectly.
  Here i paste the output messages derived from terminal, i have tried several times, still can't recoginize the android device connected to my desktop.
I have tried installing STFService APK manually and launch the service instance. It didn't work also.
By typing 'adb devices' command, the device status seems good, and with 'adb shell' i can access the device from my desktop~

IF YOU REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE WE WILL CLOSE YOUR ISSUE WITHOUT RESPONSE.
Just read it. See the commonly asked questions and fill in the details we're asking, it saves so much of our time.

Hi there!

Please be sure to run `stf doctor` before submitting an issue. Please include screenshots, command output and log files if any.

=== SUPER COMMON QUESTIONS ===

Q. I'm having issues when multiple devices are connected.
A. Usually caused by insufficient USB power supply or other hardware issue we can't do anything about.

Q. Can I connect a device to STF over WIFI?
A. Yes, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, ADB over WIFI can easily be 10x slower than USB, so don't expect too much.

Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?
A. Try the `--public-ip` option or do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Q. Can I run STF on multiple machines?
A. Yes, if you do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.
-->
## What's the problem (or question)?

<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->

<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->

Launching stf (locally), then launching 2 virtual devices. The first one loads up fine, and the second one gets to the boot screen then crashes with the following:

```

```
## What should have happened?

<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->

<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->

Both boot and are available in STF
## Do you have an idea for a solution?

<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->

<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->

I'm using pretty much the same values for both AVDs, except for the name. This could potentially be an issue?
## How can we reproduce the issue?

<!--- Provide unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
1. Launch STF locally
2. Launch a virtual android device, wait for it to boot and connect to STF
3. Launch a second virtual android device, wait for it to boot, it will crash.
## Help us understand your issue by providing context.

<!--- How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish? -->

<!--- Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world -->

N/A
## Please tell us details about your environment.

<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->
- Are you using `stf local` or a [full deployment](doc/DEPLOYMENT.md): 
- Version used (git hash or `stf -V`): 
- Environment name and version (e.g. Chrome 39, node.js 5.4): 
- Operating System and version: 
- If there was a problem with a specific device, run `adb devices -l` and paste the relevant row here:

Thanks for any help/insight into this.
 Attached is the debug log. Looks like it just timed out on this run:

EDIT: linking to gist since its a pain in the ass to scroll through. Debug log here: https://gist.github.com/strong-code/bef192fcc2a93952a44124bb9f16416d
 After some further testing with launching the AVDs without STF running, it appears they never get past the boot screen if more than 1 is booted. I don't think this is an STF problem but rather something on my end. I'll play around with it more this weekend and report back. Thanks for the debug tip @sorccu!
 Turns out it was an issue with my HAXM/AVD memory configuration. HAXM, by default, is installed with 1024 MB of memory allocated and my AVD configurations (again by default) were requesting more than this. To solve it, you can either increase HAXM memory allocation or reduce your AVD's memory to an amount less than or equal to the HAXM allocation.

Happy to say I can confirm STF works fine with multiple AVDs!

 Sadly it is not - just a black screen. I haven't played around with display configuration too much though since I do not need that feature currently. If anyone has interest in trying to get that to work, let me know and I can mess around with it a bit more. Feel free to close this issue and thanks for the rubber duck debugging!
 @suvansh-dev I have not. I've only tried using the AVD utility. I can't imagine adding an additional layer of virtualization would help with the black screen issue though.  when i run

Hi there!

Please be sure to run `stf doctor` before submitting an issue. Please include screenshots, command output and log files if any.

=== SUPER COMMON QUESTIONS ===

Q. I'm having issues when multiple devices are connected.
A. Usually caused by insufficient USB power supply or other hardware issue we can't do anything about.

Q. Can I connect a device to STF over WIFI?
A. Yes, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, ADB over WIFI can easily be 10x slower than USB, so don't expect too much.

Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?
A. Try the `--public-ip` option or do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Q. Can I run STF on multiple machines?
A. Yes, if you do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

 Thanks for you reply, sorccu. 
But press the home just make the program running backgroundly. 
If we can make it optional it's better...

To those who needs same feature as me.

comment **servcice.pressKey('home')**
  When I access http://stf_url:7100 via mobile browser, there is no home/menu/back button in the webpage. If I press smartphone back button then it exit.
 Thanks for your answer! Although the device may provide its own home/back buttons,  I think these buttons are different from those in webpage. For example, if press device home button, the device will go home screen, and if press webpage home button, the device that connect with stf will go home screen.

googled out this method, recorded here. But I have to say I really do not like java.
 yep, maybe need to use `shell export CLASSPATH=.... app_process ...`, anyway something like this. Still a long way to go.
 I write a program which use screencap can reach 1~2 fps. Maybe totally write in C will up to 4~7 fps

I see that the minicap binaries are removed from stf/vendor directory, So where can I find the lastest binary? thanks.
  There is a sad new that company behind rethinkdb is shuttingdow.Whether STF would plan to replace the database?
  While I can't donate my Pixel, I wanted to share the errors I'm seeing when STF is "Preparing" the device:

Hi there!

Please be sure to run `stf doctor` before submitting an issue. Please include screenshots, command output and log files if any.

=== SUPER COMMON QUESTIONS ===

Q. I'm having issues when multiple devices are connected.
A. Usually caused by insufficient USB power supply or other hardware issue we can't do anything about.

Q. Can I connect a device to STF over WIFI?
A. Yes, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, ADB over WIFI can easily be 10x slower than USB, so don't expect too much.

Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?
A. Try the `--public-ip` option or do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Q. Can I run STF on multiple machines?
A. Yes, if you do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.
-->
## What's the problem (or question)?

This is more of a community question, but I am wondering if anyone knows of a used phone that can be purchased for <$30 USD for testing that is known to work with STF. I currently do not have any physical Android phones on hand, but am very eager to test with a physical device.
## What should have happened?

N/A
## Do you have an idea for a solution?

Potential to add as a suggested "testing" device for new users looking to get setup for cheap.
## How can we reproduce the issue?

N/A
## Help us understand your issue by providing context.

N/A
## Please tell us details about your environment.

If this is too broad/off topic, feel free to close. I just wanted to field some suggestions from the community. Thanks so much for your continued development of stf - its truly a great suite of software!
 Those were my thoughts - I'm fine getting something in pretty beat up condition just to test with. In the meantime, I've been using the AVD emulator (which works great, by the way!)
 Thanks for testing and the helpful info @sorccu! Is there any way around the uninitialized USB serial issue? Can it manually be (over)written? For $32 this seems like a great option for people looking to get a small test farm up and running on a budget.
  Hi,

I am developing new app with STF API but when i post 
url: /auth/api/v1/mock 
data : {"name":"test", "email":"test@gmail.com"} 

over postman, API return "invalid csrf token" error. I guess csrf can go in session. What i can do for it or must i change the authentication strategy over API ? 
 You should use token for authentication
 @codeskyblue how can i do with Postman ? I know, i tired you but i need help :(
 login must be manual
 this is not usefull API, thank you so much
 @sorccu you are right man but i dont want to login on browser screen, my web web application use that API step by step login>devices list>device details and test.

A lot user(recorded in rethink) can uses STF over my web application, how can i generate different  token for each person? Because they want to use same device and i cannot handle this situation.
  yeah it is a necessity, I have read all issues about logout and timeout, anyone resolve that. 
you may direct us simo
  I also tried to chmod via adb, also no effect at all :(
Seems this phone is kind of SPECIAL...
 We manage to solve this issue by turning minicap/minitouch into dynamic libraries, and loading them from Java. Jars need no +x permission to be executed. An extra benefit is that we dont have to deal with the PIE problem.
 No need to root, but have to create an extra shell script to make it run, extractly how /system/bin/pm and other java-based cmdline tools work. Is this the app_process trick you mentioned?
 @dkw72n hello，when i use zuk z1 and adb devices, it shows'no permission',i want to know how to solove this problem and what is the shell script you mentioned @sorccu thanks,i'm trying``` @liuang68 
1. build a JNI version  `minicap/minitouch`
2. make a java CLI wrapper that loads the JNI lib which was built in step 1

To run the java CLI wrapper, take a look at https://github.com/openstf/RotationWatcher.apk
the script is just those commands bundle together
 This issue is gone on my ZUK z2 plus after an official update to `Android N`.

also i have theoretical work-around for the `Android M` Zuk, with no code modification needed:
simply change every `/data/local/tmp` to `/data/data/com.android.shell`, too shame i can't verify that.
  Angular has publish 2.0 version. Wether STF upgrade the angular version?
 When that day comes, angular 3.0 comes out.
  step:
1.connect an android 7.0
2.restart stf
3.the devices can't be recognized
devices list:
012e8e2764d6bccc       device product:bullhead model:Nexus_5X device:bullhead

this is the err log:

 I have used the old version because I was rewited some code . So I try to Merge the new code.Thank you.
  hi,
I want to know that if I want to customize a page in STF and then after customization if I build my own image and push it on dockerhub, and then pull it while deploying it to real server, the docker file that you provided will do work for building that image or I have to modify something in the docker file? 

Thanks in advance!  There is a bug with android 6.0. Maybe it happened in adbkey-logcat.

 Which module cause the problem?Which file should be fix?It is module of adbkit?
  Hi!
When [check()](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/provider/index.js#L304) executed with values `device.present = false` and `willStop = false`:

``` node
function check() {
  clearTimeout(timer)
  if (device.present) {
    <...>
  }
  else {
    stop()
  }
}
```

from [stop()](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/provider/index.js#L296) started `worker.cancel()`:

``` node
function stop() {
  if (worker) {
    log.info('Shutting down device worker "%s"', device.id)
    worker.cancel()
  }
}
```

get into [catch(Promise.CancellationError, function()](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/provider/index.js#L250) starting `procutil.gracefullyKill`:

``` node
.catch(Promise.CancellationError, function() {
  log.info('Gracefully killing device worker "%s"', device.id)
  return procutil.gracefullyKill(proc, options.killTimeout)
})
```

and if in `procutil.gracefullyKill` will error, get into [catch(procutil.ExitError, function(err)](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/provider/index.js#L279):

``` node
.catch(procutil.ExitError, function(err) {
  if (!willStop) {
    log.error(
      'Device worker "%s" died with code %s'
      , device.id
      , err.code
    )
    log.info('Restarting device worker "%s"', device.id)
    return Promise.delay(500)
      .then(function() {
        return work()
      })
  }
})
```

since value `willStop = false` worker endlessly restarts.
I'm not sure that properly understood the provider logic, but this small fix helped me.
  Hi @sorccu 
I want to ask some questions.
1.Whether STFService.apk can obtain one of the process's performance datas? 
2.Whether STFService.apk can read files  from the phone's storage?
3.It STFService.apk are opened source ?
 Thank you

 Thanks for the quick response. HUAWEI uses its own CPU(named Haisi), not sure whether it is relevant to the minicap issue. I think it is a appropriate way to do so. if you fix some other Huawei device for similar issue, please update comment on this ticket, i will keep monitoring and then try if it also works
 ok, actually i close it by mistake. I just thought "Close and comment" means close the page. :0
 @sorccu I know some device not working well with minicap. So is this solution OK. Try to find another screenshot method if minicap not supported.
But as far as I know, the default android tool screenshot is too slow, do you know some other tools that can make screenshot a litter faster? Thanks any way.
 Maybe I can do it, just need ideas.
 @sorccu I have tried with servel methods.
- screencap   about 1.0s
- uiautomator screenshot about 0.7s
- use the outside camera, can reach 30fps, but the image quality is very low.
 @sorccu waiting your ideas....
 It is OK, currently I can use screencap instead.
 Maybe your idea is like https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vysor/gidgenkbbabolejbgbpnhbimgjbffefm I guess.

## What's the problem (or question)?

<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->

<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->

Haven't dig into it much. So I'm not sure if it's an issue or a restriction made by intent.

I have one OS user, one adb-key, two stf-user tokens. And I'm not able to connect devices via API using second token. Currently we are using docker to connect devices and run tests and we need to rebuild docker image for each stf-user.
## What should have happened?

I would like to be able to use devices based only on stf-user token
## How can we reproduce the issue?

<!--- Provide unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
1. create two stf-users
2. try to add same adb-key to each user.

Only first one will be able to
## Please tell us details about your environment.

- openstf/stf:v2.0.0-beta
- Mock auth
 Got it. Sorry for bothering you and that i haven't found #170 by myself )

The reason we are using two different tokens is because we have two different teams (slightly more actually) and would like to distinguish devices used by them in webapp. Different users from this teams are also using farm to write tests. So we would like to share docker image for running tests instead of Dockerfile, because it would make it much easier to fix bugs in it.

So, there are two ways of fixing it – hack around with adb or add some device lockdown logic, that will provide `adb connect` url after it's done. Both of ways look cumbersome.

Can I close this?
 thanks @vbanthia @sorccu 
  STF version: 2.0.1
Hardware: all as recommended on Linux

To be able to extend idle user session to 1 hour we start provider service is started using "--group-timeout 3600"

But real timeout was set to 900*1000 ms

<STF_HOME>/lib/units/device/plugins/group.js (48-51 lines)
          channels.register(currentGroup.group, {
            timeout: timeout || options.groupTimeout
          , alias: solo.channel
          })

Not sure why but options.groupTimeout is not set correctly and default on is used. Only after hardcoding 3600000 we received extended user session.
Thanks.
 Vishal.
We start stf-provider by regular shell script command:

nohup stf provider --name NAME --connect-sub tcp://HOST:7250 --connect-push tcp://HOST:7270 --storage-url http://HOST --public-ip HOST --group-timeout 3600 --no-cleanup &

Absolutely the same command is used in systemd unit file:
ExecStart=/home/build/.linuxbrew/bin/stf provider --name NAME --connect-sub tcp://HOST:7250 --connect-push tcp://HOST:7270 --storage-url http://HOST --public-ip HOST --group-timeout 3600 --no-cleanup

As additional note: this provider service is configured remotely. Rest of the services are started on different servers.

To debug issue I updated a little bit group.js
log.info('Subscribing to group channel "%s"; timeout "%d"', currentGroup.group, timeout || options.groupTimeout)

and as result during startup I see there "900000" instead of desired "3600000"
Thanks.

  Hello,
2 years ago, I've create an android device lab like the one in this project. I've plugged 18 android on 2 [Anker USB 3.0 9-Port Hub + 5V 2.1A Charging Port](http://www.ianker.com/product/68ANHUB-B10A), 1 hub plugged to 1 Mac Mini.
Everything was ok, I was able to make Appium auto tests, etc...
But after 2 years, I have a lot of swollen batteries. One year ago, I've scheduled a "power OFF" for the hubs during night to limit this swollen batteries phenomena, but it was not enough.
So I have one question : how do you manage this ? My purpose first was to send a lot of power to the devices so they don't die, but even with this Anker (that you rate 2/10 because of "insufficient power"), it was too much. Now I'm thinking about regular hubs without power supply to see...
Thanks
 Thanks for the fast answer,
I've tried to plug my android without battery and they didn't want to start...
Last year I've plugged a Nexus 6 on my hub and 10 month after the battery looks like it will explose.. Same for my Galaxy Note 3, a Huawei, a Galaxy Tab 4, ect...
So it's more about security (I'm afraid that a phone will start a fire) that care about batteries.
I will try fex days with 4 x 4 ports hub to see if it can deal with charge...
 I have an idea but never tried before. Because some device have to got a battery so the device can be started. What about change the battery into a large volume capacitor. So there is no worry about the swollen batteries problem. ^_^
 Device complains about that I need to rest every month. :)
 Did you find any solution for this? Do you have experience in the airflow stuff? How should this stop the batteries from gasing? That's right. Did you try it and do you have some statistics over the effect of the fans?  Hello guys, i am developing a module to integrate openstf with selenium grid to tests automation. 
I need some help and advices, the idea is make a plug and play on selenium grid using the openstf, when openstf detect a phone i will informe grid  with new device ready for work.
My Questions is, STF have already some service that can provide me this information when device is connected? Aswell i need 4 infos like udid, device name, plataform, and plataform version of this device. or a should make a module and import to stf and rebuild it?
 @gunta, I am try a new approach for implement the solution, now i am using zmq to try catch some message that show a new device connected. But zmq is new thing for me, i need to find channels and start getting the info  and with that i will launch my scripts at same time  that openstf recognize a new device :)
 @gunda can you confirm if i am acessing to the correct port fo recibe information about new devices?
i am connecting to  "tcp://localhost:7115 and  subscribe '*ALL'  or with that i will receive the new connected devices?
  I see that jade have been rename pug.Is there any changing or it just being renamed?

Hi there!

Please be sure to run `stf doctor` before submitting an issue. Please include screenshots, command output and log files if any.

=== SUPER COMMON QUESTIONS ===

Q. I'm having issues when multiple devices are connected.
A. Usually caused by insufficient USB power supply or other hardware issue we can't do anything about.

Q. Can I connect a device to STF over WIFI?
A. Yes, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, ADB over WIFI can easily be 10x slower than USB, so don't expect too much.

Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?
A. Try the `--public-ip` option or do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Q. Can I run STF on multiple machines?
A. Yes, if you do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Hi,

I have a pretty long-running test, and my script is to call the api to reserve the device before testing starts, and release the device after testing ends.  When testing started, I can see the device was reserved successfully, but after around 15-20 minutes, the device was released automatically even though my testing was still going on.  That is really an unexpected behaviour because someone else can reserve and use it while my testing has not finished yet.

So, can anyone please share why this happened, and any way to avoid it, or extend the timeout? Thanks.

 Hi Sorccu,

Thanks for the reply.
I have a separate automation platform, and just want to reserver/release device during test, so others cannot use them.  So, there's no interaction on STF platform, just on devices (running automation scripts).

So, --group-timeout parameter should be used while starting provider, right?  Then it will be passed to each "stf device" process when starting them?
 Have tried to start provider with --group-timeout parameter, seems working now. Thanks!
 Thanks vbanthia for your another great solution!
 Just to extend @vbanthia answer - you can set the timeout to zero, which will reserve the device for for infinite time, until you free it again using API delete, or clicking Stop using button in UI
  I need to add some modules to extend the UI features in stf, how to add the modules,
So that i should not get any dependency injection module error.

Please help me out in this.
 i tried adding new bower modules and got success in that. without any module error.
Thank you.
  I meet a problem, and I red https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/250;but it seem to no  effect;I have tried npm rebuild zmq;

## What's the problem (or question)?

Hi,
First: Thanks for this wonderful tool! You did a great job!! 

While using STF one question appeared very often: Is it possible to increase the timeout of a device stay connected to a user? After some time of inactivity the user will be removed from the device and the session will be cleared. This means the app under test with all its data is also gone and has to be installed again. Sometimes this is very painful.
## What should have happened?

Let the device stay longer occupied by a user.
## Do you have an idea for a solution?

Add a parameter while starting stf, e.g. --session-timeout 120 #min

- we are using `stf local`
- Version used (git hash or `stf -V`): 1.1.1
- Environment name and version: Chrome  52.0.2743.116 (64-bit), node v4.2.6
- Operating System and version: Ubuntu 16.04.1
  Hi, this is not a bug, but a suggestion for a new feature.

Would be possible for you to add a button to restart adb `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

At least in mac os after a random time some devices disappear, and sometimes restarting adb fixes the problem.

Regards,
 I have the same problem i can't find the reason for this to happen, i think the problem can be associated to hubs. 
 yep, have to restart adb every day in OS X.

I pulled below docker images on my Ubuntu server 16.04:

```
test@ubuntu:/etc/systemd/system$ docker images

openstf/ambassador   latest              b1f0eb8297cf        12 months ago       6.46 MB
```

Then I tried to start each .service to make sure it can be started successfully.

I started nginx.service successfully by "sudo systemctl start nginx.service", and I saw it's running by cmd "docker ps":
test@ubuntu:/etc/systemd/system$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
1b7abcbf9268        nginx:latest        "nginx"             19 minutes ago      Up 19 minutes                           nginx

But when I tried to start adbd.service, it showed in "docker ps" for a few seconds, then disappeared.  So does it mean that adbd.service FAILED to start?  

```
test@ubuntu:/etc/systemd/system$ sudo systemctl start adbd.service
test@ubuntu:/etc/systemd/system$ 
test@ubuntu:/etc/systemd/system$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED                  STATUS                  PORTS               NAMES

```

when I checked by showing process, I saw following:

```
test@ubuntu:/etc/systemd/system$ ps -ef | grep "docker " | grep -v "grep"
root      3327     1  0 16:12 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/docker run --rm --name nginx --net host -v /srv/nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro nginx:latest nginx
root      6358     1  2 17:22 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/docker pull sorccu/adb:latest
```

There is always a docker pull for adb image, why is that?  Is it the root cause that adbd.service cannot be started?

BTW, I used the exactly same unit file for adbd.service as in deployment.md

```
test@ubuntu:/etc/systemd/system$ cat adbd.service 
[Unit]
Description=ADB daemon
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

  --net host \
  sorccu/adb:latest
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker exec %p adb kill-server
```

Regarding rethinkdb.service, I created unit file as below:

```
test@ubuntu:/etc/systemd/system$ cat rethinkdb.service 
[Unit]
Description=RethinkDB
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]

  rethinkdb:2.3 \
  rethinkdb --bind all \
    --cache-size 8192
ExecStop=-/usr/bin/docker stop -t 10 %p
```

I cannot start it successfully either.  

```
test@ubuntu:/etc/systemd/system$ sudo systemctl start rethinkdb.service
test@ubuntu:/etc/systemd/system$ 
test@ubuntu:/etc/systemd/system$ docker ps

```

In deployment.md, for rethinkdb version, it mentioned:

```
Update the version number in rethinkdb:2.3 for the latest release. We don't use rethinkdb:latest here
```

So, how to get the version number for rethinkdb after pull latest image?  Is this the root cause that rethinkdb.service cannot be started?

 Thanks for your response!
I need local adb running because other programs need to use it.  So is it possible that stf can use local adb instead of docker adb?  If it's true, that means starting adbd.service is not necessary, right?

How about rethinkdb.service?  I still cannot start it.  Please help, I am really blocked right now :(
Thanks!
 this is what I got:

Hi there!

Please be sure to run `stf doctor` before submitting an issue. Please include screenshots, command output and log files if any.

=== SUPER COMMON QUESTIONS ===

Q. I'm having issues when multiple devices are connected.
A. Usually caused by insufficient USB power supply or other hardware issue we can't do anything about.

Q. Can I connect a device to STF over WIFI?
A. Yes, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, ADB over WIFI can easily be 10x slower than USB, so don't expect too much.

Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?
A. Try the `--public-ip` option or do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Q. Can I run STF on multiple machines?
A. Yes, if you do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

-->
## What's the problem (or question)?

I want to deploy STF on multiple Ubuntu machines on which I could not use docker solution.  I have to use stf local, but need detailed instruction on how to do it.
I want to use box1 (10.241.54.10) as the master box, and connect box2(10.241.54.16) to box1, so from http://10.241.54.10:7100/#!/devices, I can see all the devices connected to both box1 and box2.
## What should have happened?

My steps/cmds to run stf:
on box1:

```
start rethinkdb
stf local --allow-remote --public-ip 10.241.54.10 --provider 10.241.54.10 --provider-min-port 15000 --provider-max-port 20000
```

on box2:

```
start rethinkdb
stf local --allow-remote --public-ip 10.241.54.16 --provider 10.241.54.16 --provider-min-port 20000 --provider-max-port 25000
```

Then I can successfully see devices showing up from http://10.241.54.10:7100/#!/devices and http://10.241.54.16:7100/#!/devices
Above steps mean my stf env for both boxes are correct.

I tried to start stf local on box1:

```
stf local --allow-remote --public-ip 10.241.54.10 --provider 10.241.54.10 --provider-min-port 15000 --provider-max-port 20000
```

I checked the processes started by stf local and get the provider one:

```
test     16054 16018  0 Aug30 pts/15   00:01:22 /home/test/.linuxbrew/Cellar/node/6.1.0/bin/node /home/test/.linuxbrew/lib/node_modules/stf/lib/cli.js provider --name 10.241.54.10 --min-port 15000 --max-port 20000 --connect-sub tcp://127.0.0.1:7114 --connect-push tcp://127.0.0.1:7116 --group-timeout 900 --public-ip 10.241.54.10 --storage-url http://localhost:7100/ --adb-host 127.0.0.1 --adb-port 5037 --vnc-initial-size 600x800 --allow-remote
```

then tried to start stf provider on box2(with same port as above):

```
stf provider --allow-remote --name 10.241.54.16 --min-port 20000 --max-port 25000 --connect-sub tcp://10.241.54.10:7114 --connect-push tcp://10.241.54.10:7116 --storage-url http://10.241.54.10
```

but it shows:
INF/provider 11938 [*] Providing all 0 of 5 device(s); ignoring "0123456789ABCDEF", "284cd8fe", "639aa439", "YLHU657DMRG6NNN7", "7TTKM78PNFS8SW7D"
I cannot see devices connected to box2 from http://10.241.54.16:7100/#!/devices

So far, docker solution does not seem to be possible for me to go, so I want to achieve production-like deployment with stf command manually.
## Please tell us details about your environment.

<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->
- Are you using `stf local` or a [full deployment](doc/DEPLOYMENT.md): stf local
- Version used (git hash or `stf -V`): 2.0.1
- Environment name and version (e.g. Chrome 39, node.js 5.4): node 6.1.0
- Operating System and version: Ubuntu Server 14.04
- If there was a problem with a specific device, run `adb devices -l` and paste the relevant row here: 
 Do you solve the problem?The same as me.
 No, I finally switched to docker solution.  Suggest you do the same :)
 yeah,i had done it.
However,a new problem.I can see device ,but the device always disapeared and disconnected when i click the device icon.Then it shows "the devices is disconnected".
Form adb devices,the device is inline and it's ok.
So,could you tell me how you deploy stf on multiple Ubuntu machines? Thank you so much.
I had tried many smartphones,make no difference.
 just follow the deployment guide.  First download docker images on multiple machines, then select one as the main host, create almost all .service file accordingly on it; on other hosts, only need to start provider service.
 I use  "--connect-sub tcp://127.0.0.1:7114 --connect-push tcp://127.0.0.1:7116" instead of  "--connect-sub tcp://publicip:7114 --connect-push tcp://publicip:7116" in the "stf provider" command and the problem  is solved.
  Hi, now I hava an issue，expect to get your consult.

I have researched some applications that realize remotely control to devices.  But almost all require  devices to have root permission.

**So, can you talk about how to realize control devices remotely  in STF ? especially devices don't have root permissions?**
Thank you very much. 
  Hello,

Apologies in advance if this question seems too basic.

I have been using appium to automate many app on real devices using Java.
Now I would like to run the same scripts via OpenSFT. Is this possible? If so, what are the exact desired capabilities i need to set during my driver creation?

Thanks and Regards,
Poorvika
 @poorvikamahesh : Refer this www.vimalselvam.com/2016/08/07/appium-parallel-execution-on-openstf/ for java implementation.
  ## Issue:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8802748/17879128/cc4f8d02-6921-11e6-90e1-56fa57170a92.png)

just like mentioned above，when I connected to my Huawei Phone, the issue comes.
It says : FTL/device 6054 [582af7670d26] Setup had an error Error: Service had an error: "Error: Not found; no service started."
## My doubt

Why? I have tested on 5 phones, just this phone has this problem。  
At  the same time, I find no STFService.apk installed on it.
 this is the modle of this phone, made by Huawei:

```
List of devices attached 
582af7670d26           
device
  usb:14100000 
  product:C8817D 
  model:C8817D 
  device:hwC8817D
```

I guess the reason is antivirus apps，I have installed many antivirus apps on my phone.

Thank you for your reply!
@sorccu 
 I have checked my running apps through “Settings”，then stop some antivirus apps manually。

So, I still use "rethinkdb" and "stf local" commands.  At last, I find I can manipulate my phone through web browser remotely.

At the same time , I uploaded STFService.apk to  some antivirus-checking site, the result is "Safe".
**But I doubt why antivirus apps prevent to install STF.apk, or prevent this apk to start ?**
 I encountered the same issue, uninstalled a few antivirus apps(e.g. 360), but it is not working.  Could you please help take a look? Thx!

 @xiaweixing  I have the same phone(le_x6) and the same problem. I sovled it by pushing STFService.apk to /system/priv-app/STFService/STFService.apk, the service will automatically start after a  reboot, and everything works fine now.
 @test01wrk Thanks a lot for the info!!  But how and where can I download the latest STFService.apk?  I couldn't figure it out yet :(
 Great!! It worked like a charm!! Thank you so much!!
 @sorccu I posted another device issue earlier together with le_x620, but it is still not resolved.  Is it possible for you to test it? Or any ideas how to troubleshoot? Thx!

 hey @sorccu could you please see the comments. I am seeing here every time mincap is going down and while starting it's facing issues.
 Same issue is present with Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo (also with 5.1.1). It seems that it's triggered once you start interacting with the device in the web interface - The connection is stable without that...you can deploy/start the app and interact through adb.
  WHAT A GREAT JOB！
But I find a small problem . 
when i use the adb command ,"input keyevent XXX"，it too slow .
so i want have a function call "minikey" that can input keyevent faster !
poor english , sorry ......
thanks for your coding!
  I want to research minicap how to capture phone screen and adapt myself mobile phone,
where can i get the minicap.so source code and how to compile it?
thanks!

=== SUPER COMMON QUESTIONS ===

Q. I'm having issues when multiple devices are connected.
A. Usually caused by insufficient USB power supply or other hardware issue we can't do anything about.

Q. Can I connect a device to STF over WIFI?
A. Yes, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, ADB over WIFI can easily be 10x slower than USB, so don't expect too much.

Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?
A. Try the `--public-ip` option or do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Q. Can I run STF on multiple machines?
A. Yes, if you do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

 I want this feature too.But only by yourself to finish it.
 We are working on a feature for managing users / devices the idea is to create a simple groups management table and attaching each user to a permission group, We hope to deliver a pull request in 2 weeks if you have any ideas feel free to share
 @kobikal1, is this feature available now? I am very interested in seeing it working. Thanks.  <!---

No specific reason i just updated it.After updating got an error.
I looked at all possible solutions,tried changes in gulpfile.js file still getting same error.

Any solution please.
 thank you
  ## What's the problem (or question)?

I'm an author of https://github.com/email2vimalraj/appium-stf-example. There is no problem, however it is an ask for the new feature. As for the automation, after executing the script, we would like to watch the execution. So it would be great if we can add an execution view where it shows real time streaming of test execution.
## What should have happened?

I triggered an execution using appium and opened the STF dashboard which shown a Devices page. I clicked on the device where the execution is happening, because I was expecting it will show me the execution. But the moment I clicked on it, it released the device from me causing the automation failure.
## Do you have an idea for a solution?

Idea way could be add an execution view where user can view the live execution with no controls (Ex: Perfecto's device dashboard).
Another suggestion would be, we should not immediately allocate / release device when the user clicks on the particular device on the Devices view. Rather, it should be a button to select / release. Because, I sometimes mistakenly clicked on the device causing allocation / releasing.
## Help us understand your issue by providing context.

This ask is better to have and help for automation.
## Please tell us details about your environment.
- Are you using `stf local` or a [full deployment](doc/DEPLOYMENT.md): `stf local`
- Version used (git hash or `stf -V`):  `v2.0.1'
- Environment name and version (e.g. Chrome 39, node.js 5.4): `v6.2.1`
- Operating System and version: `Mac OSx 10.11.5`
 @vbanthia : Yes that solves the purpose. But still I'm looking a separate execution view with nothing other than the screen streaming. This will avoid people playing around with un-necessary interactions while the execution is on.

And when the execution is completed, I'm getting this:

<img width="1249" alt="screen shot 2016-08-10 at 8 28 49 am" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1214686/17540567/c4f36742-5ed4-11e6-9375-247ff12700dd.png">

I'm looking for something like this: https://community.perfectomobile.com/posts/913782-device-dashboard. This will let me to just watch the execution, that's all it.
 @gunta : Yes something similar to SHIFT+CLICK and prevent touches.

run the command stf doctor failed....
need help!!!
 Check zmq folder is available inside /usr/local/node/lib/node_modules/stf/node_modules/
if not present run brew install zeromq.
 @tadesushilgithub  command brew in CentOS does not work!
 I have also encountered the same problem.I'm on OSX.how can I  fix it. I'm on Mac OS.I also have this problem.And I rm node_modules but also get this problem....How can i fix it...  There is a remote PC connected with a devices, I can use `adb devices` to see it.

``` sh
$ adb devices
List of devices attached
S8GMTO7TT44P599S        device
```

Now in another PC, I can use `adb -H 10.0.0.2 devices` to list devices too, but each command executed are slowly(I guess it is because the network connect time cost). I have seen that with stf can do `adb connect 10.0.0.2:7001`

@sorccu Can please give some suggestions how to implement this? I want split out this feature from stf.
 I like to make stf better, and I have made some prs to stf already. But stf is very big, sometimes we only need some small part, Make it simple make it better to maintain it, also make it stable to use too. Stf's js code is some kind complex that hard to locate the real part, so it really helps to have your some suggestions.
Split it as a single tool will make this part code more rebust, it is also a way for me to make stf better.
 I can easily find it, but it is not easy at all when I see the implement code (need socket.js, packet.js) ...
 @codeskyblue Hi, do you implement is feature?
Actually I just want to use adb connect and without reserve the device?
It seems you have tried this. 
Any suggestions will be appreciated
 @WillPangZi you will know that with

```
npm install -g adbkit
adbkit -h
```
 @codeskyblue, awesome feature. Now I can share USB to network directly without fingerprint confirm.
But it seems when click the "Stop Using" button,  the adb share will be disconnected. I'm checking this point.
If you have any suggestions please let me know.
  Just a simple question, but I want to duplicate the physical device setup shown in the project README (image link below). Where can I purchase such a rack, and what is it called? Additionally, can we add this information as a caption to the README image?

https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/shelf_closeup_790x.jpg?raw=true

P.S. I don't think the issue template applies to this question, so I edited it out.
 Thanks, I appreciate the description. I didn't see #1, so thanks for the link there, too. If you have time, I'm curious how you got the rails mounted at that angle. I've been searching for something similar online but no good results are turning up.

Either way, you guys have a great setup to have so many people curious.

=== SUPER COMMON QUESTIONS ===

Q. I'm having issues when multiple devices are connected.
A. Usually caused by insufficient USB power supply or other hardware issue we can't do anything about.

Q. Can I connect a device to STF over WIFI?
A. Yes, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, ADB over WIFI can easily be 10x slower than USB, so don't expect too much.

Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?
A. Try the `--public-ip` option or do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Q. Can I run STF on multiple machines?
A. Yes, if you do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Hi,

first of all: Thanks for the API to @vbanthia, for the tests i have done yet, it works like a charm. What I could extract from the discussion in issue #219, STF seems to be planned currently as a device provider for automated tests with Appium (or other automation frameworks) via the REST API. 
Do you have any plans to make a deeper integration of automated tests into STF? Maybe for parallel testing?

We think about something like the following procedure to provide a convenient way for the test developer:
- write your test
- upload test to STF
- select multiple phones to run the test on and start test
- background service (maybe part of STF) does the following things:
  - start all the needed Appium Servers and reserve phones in STF
  - let appium servers make the tests
  - provide test results to the test developer

(Since we are only using Appium, i'll descriped it with Appium, but one could write such a feature more generic to add other automation frameworks later maybe...)

Greetings
Benjamin
 Hey, thanks for the quick answer. 
What du you exactly mean by "new repository would be expected"?
Like some kind of "new project" which is afterwards used by STF? 
 Hi, I'm trying to integrate Selenium Grid with OpenSTF, can you give me your opinion about what is the best way to do it? In the first plan, we thought of creating a module to merge the occupations of devices and thus prevent Selenium Grid to run a test on a device that is being used in OpenStf and the other way around.
Looking forward to know some opinions.
 I see that this is quite old and closed issue but it seems to be the most appropriate place to submit links related to automated testing CI/using STF.

[Integration](https://github.com/DroidsOnRoids/bitrise-step-openstf-connect) for [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) is available. Parallel testing is also supported when [spoon Gradle plugin](https://github.com/stanfy/spoon-gradle-plugin) is used.

For "rethinkdb:2.1.5", read "rethinkdb:2.3"
  I have 20 devices connected sometimes some devices goes offline means 20 becomes 17 but it's very critical to know which device goes offline. So I renamed devices by setting up there custom name like RACK1DEV3 so that it would be Identified. But I need to extract that and bring it to UI. So I went through some adb getprop i couldn't found. 
My question if I need to bring device name in UI do I need to change stf.apk? or adb getprop can help me so that I'll write API to get that.
 But the problem is that User's are often change the Notes value every time. Can I get Device name from Android?. The reason of devices goes offline is H/W issue only because I seen that device is not getting connected to the same server but if I remove and add to another server it's work fine and after some days again goes offline :(. I kept usb connection in MTP mode. 
 Please find the Images for more clarity. I want to see **RACK 2 RIGHT5** as my device name in UI.

 Ok Thanks @sorccu
 Ya I will try that :).
  Hello OpenSTF,

I was checking OpenSTF and need to know can we do Manual Synchronous Testing i.e., if 10 devices are connected and i perform button action on one device it should reflect of others too. Can we do that using OpenSTF?
  Use adb connect to connect to a remote device as if it was plugged in to your computer, regardless of ADB mode and whether you're connected to the same network
Run any adb command locally, including shell access
Android Studio and other IDE support, debug your app while watching the device screen on your browser
Supports Chrome remote debug tools

If I want to learn this function, so could you tell me where is the relative code in the project? Thx.
 Could you show me the detail? I am not very clearly yet.
 OK, I got it.
  I want to use this with one fixed username and password ,and I don't want to login with input the name everytime when I open a new page ,can I do something to login in with my application  for example  setting cookie
 @sorccu I have my own login page created, Now I need to bypass login and redirect the user to dashboard. Is it possible if I pass required credential in session? 
 excuse me, I have no username and password; where I can sign up.
 thank you. I just solved this problem
 how.?

 Ok. I regenerated it and its working now. I dont know why. It was maybe corrupted. Thanks
  Why stf  is used rethinkdb not mysql/mongodb? What is the advantage of rethinkdb?
  Hi developer,

 i found a problem as title,  I hope it works like the touch event when i'm using from remote web page to  control a device. 

Descriptions:
1. I start stf with command :  stf local --public-ip <my ip>
2. I login stf from another computer with web (Actually, the login process is very slow.)
3. select one device and then try to control it by touch screen, the action is worked as fast by it's screen show sync need to long time with drop frame.

Could you give me some advance?
 @sorccu  Thanks this feedback ,  maybe this is some mistake in my question, both my compute are in the same network. 
 my ip like "10.252.162.10" and another ip is "10.252.163.5" 
 reduce the image size which produced by the stf client is also a way. @boxerxing 
 I get the same problem. But I can't find the way to reduce the image size @codeskyblue. 
 You need to change the code. @FengJianjian

Hi there!
Sometimes during remote connection (adb connect) device just unexpectedly disconnects, and becomes "Free" in STF web-interface (and is fully operational), and in STF Provider log I see such error:

```
IMP/device:plugins:group 9702 [E9OKBC204913] Now owned by "example@email.com"

ERR/provider 1 [*] Device worker "E9OKBC204913" died with code 1
INF/provider 1 [*] Restarting device worker "E9OKBC204913"
```

It happens with different devices and it's hard to reproduce.

<!--- Provide unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
1. Get adb connect string from remoteConnect API method
2. Connect device via adb connect string
3. Run appium UI tests
4. Wait

If I skip step 3 (Run appium tests) I can't reproduce the problem, but it seems appium itself has nothing to do with the problem, maybe pushing big files during tests cause the problem.
### Environment:

<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->

<!--- Are you using `stf local` or a [full deployment](doc/DEPLOYMENT.md): -->
- **full deployment**

STF-Provider on desktop host with devices connected and all other STF services on virtual machine

<!--- Version used (git hash or `stf -V`): -->
- **v2.0.0-beta docker image** from docker hub

<!--- Environment name and version (e.g. Chrome 39, node.js 5.4):  -->
- **nodejs v4.1.2**

<!--- Operating System and version:  -->
- **ubuntu 14.04** on all nodes

I will continue to experiment to find the specific conditions to reproduce the problem, but I want to ask for help in the investigation of this problem from error in the STF Provider log - it seems that something just unexpectedly drops some TCP connection (maybe ADB server?), and I don't know how to determine what TCP connection drops and what else can I do about it (maybe get some TCP dumps)

Thank you!
 Usually it works fine, we run a lot of tests on several devices, but sometimes one of devices unexpectedly disconnects with such error.

It doesn't affect other connections with other devices and device become fully operational just after worker restarts
 @sorccu hi!
Now on openstf/stf:v2.3.0 we getting this error. Sometimes, but often - 4 of 5 disconnected.

```

But we don't exactly know why this happens. Device trouble, maybe. I too get the same issue for Android handsets wherein adb disconnects from the device with ECONNRESET when Appium executes the tests. How can we make adb connect back to the device.  I want use the Icon of stf,but I can't find them.  (Some jade'Icon corresponding list of names  like 'fa-gears' ,'fa-upload' ,etc.)

  I was wondering if someone can update the documentation to get STF setup using docker, I have seen the current doc's and it's slightly confusing to people who never used docker before. I have got STF running on a mac very easily via the terminal, but would like a similar guide on setting up STF docker container via the terminal.  

https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md
 Yup, a setup guide would be nice... I tried with this `docker-compose.yml`:

```
rethinkdb:
    image: rethinkdb

openstf:
    image: openstf/stf
    links:
        - rethinkdb
    ports:
        - "7100:7100"
        - "7110:7110"
    command: stf local
```

I get access to the login page at `http://localhost:7100`, can login, but I'm stuck with the `No devices connected` message (I tried 3 different devices, adb works fine but stf doesn't seems to find them). Did I miss something ?
 Hi,
There must be a good reason people keep saying `stf local` is not meant for docker.
However, I've managed to put together a `docker-compose.yml` that seems to work.

```

Obviously, you'll have to replace the `--public-ip` from the last line with the IP address of your docker host.

With this setup, I'm able to access my devices by going to http://192.168.1.127:7100

I hope it helps "mirceanis" solution works on my mac, thanks. @jabed-m-talukder, did you change links to depends_on in docker compose file? I think links doesnt make sense when all 3 containers are in same network I found this project for a single host deployment of STF by @nikosch86 using docker images
It works well for me on Linux 

https://github.com/nikosch86/stf-poc  Hi STF team,
I downloaded the code from master branch followed below steps:
1. npm install
2. npm link
3. cd bin
4. ./stf local --public-ip ip_address

but after 24 hours server goes down, STF log stops. And I am getting below error in rethinkdb 
**The issue reported is: Some RethinkDB data on this server has been placed into swap memory in the past hour. This may impact performance.**

Now I am sure this is happening because of rethinkdb error OR problem with ubuntu. I am having another STF running from 3 week over mac connected with 30 devices :) but over mac I installed STF using npm install stf -g. What could be the reason? How can I keep STF continuously running over a week. 
 Thanks @sorccu. No I am not doing anything like nodemon. I thought STF stops because of rethinkdb error related to SWAP memory. I will try to fix SWAP memory issue then l'll see how may days stf local continuously works on ubuntu box.
**Also Please clear my below mentioned doubt :**
But I have scenario like Ubuntu-1 has 20 devices + Ubuntu-2 has 20 devices. Can Deployment guide helps us to bring both 2 boxes under 1 url, Where I can see total 40 devices after login?. I got success using Deployment guide help in setting up the STF in Mac OS but Failed in Ubuntu. 
  This is not an issue, just want to know how can I delete an entry from rethinkDB database..
In my case I want to delete a device from there, I just don't know how to make the query to do it.

If someone can help, I will be much appreciated.
Regards,
João Pedro
  Removed
  the device status will be disconnected after run some time,and when I  restart the stf it recovers,but it changes to disconnected some time later again.Why is so unstable?
1.the system is OS X Yosemite 10.10.5,
the stf version is 1.1.1
node.js version is v0.12.4
rethinkdb version is 2.3.2
2.when I use the dmesg |grep usb nothing print 
3.have start the developers mode and commit pc to connect,
4.Does the phone install the stf-service automatically when connected to pc and start the stf ?

Hi there!

I have 2 questions. 
1.Can we use a high end Server (HP Z640) with Ubuntu OR Mac Pro( Cylindrical Server)? which one is better?
2. If I install STF Local on a high end machine, will STF local handle 100 devices?

=== SUPER COMMON QUESTIONS ===

Q. Can we use a high end Server (HP Z640) with Ubuntu OR Mac Pro( Cylindrical Server)?.
A. 

Q. I will install STF local into one box . Can it handle 100 devices if I connect into 1 Box
A. Yes, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, ADB over WIFI can easily be 10x slower than USB, so don't expect too much.

Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?
A. Try the `--public-ip` option or do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Q. Can I run STF on multiple machines?
A. Yes, if you do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

 How did you start stf?The command "stf doctor" is one of parameter.You can see stf --help.I don't know why the "stf doctor" output nothing.
 @0x88l I used this command：stf local to start stf
 I have exactly the same problem as niuniudd had. Can someone help out there? Thanks! Thanks for comments @sorccu.
Here is my gm status, is that possible to fix the problem from these information?

There is hardcoded timeout for boot operation in <STF_HOME>/lib/units/device/support/adb.js
And if in your pool there is slow device you will receive this exception every time after its reboot.
Sometimes it crashes everything in our case and only failover service returns STF back to normal state.
So we increased default timeout on line #25 to resolve this issue:
        .timeout(5*60000)
 @vdelendik I've tried to increase the default timeout to 5*60000, but it's still not working... The device is still in 'zombie state' and the log keeps printing the same error. ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE and ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE setting is NOT working...

I've tried to figure out what causes this timeout, it turns out to be the code 
`devutil.waitForPort(adb, options.serial, service.port).timeout(15000)`
I've tried to increased the timeout to 15000*5, but still the same.

And I also found out that at this moment, the adb command of this device becomes **very very very** slow( adb -s SERIAL shell), almost not responding, maybe this is what causes the timeout.

The problem now is WHAT may be the reason that causes adb command of the device slow?
 @sorccu no, and this error seems only happens on Android 6.0.1. @sorccu The latest version of STF works fine! The device remains stable for a long time till now.  <!---

=== SUPER COMMON QUESTIONS ===

Q. I'm having issues when multiple devices are connected.
A. Usually caused by insufficient USB power supply or other hardware issue we can't do anything about.

Q. Can I connect a device to STF over WIFI?
A. Yes, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, ADB over WIFI can easily be 10x slower than USB, so don't expect too much.

Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?
A. Try the `--public-ip` option or do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Q. Can I run STF on multiple machines?
A. Yes, if you do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

 @juliusspencer the only way I could find is to use ADB Shell Commands from within STF
`input keyevent 219`
It should bring up the application switcher dialog :)

Someone can create pull request for making this as a button.
Would love to do it, but for now I don't know how :)
Maybe someday.
 Thank you @pwicherski for the quick feedback. I'm don't know enough about how it all works. I should take a look at the source.
 A solution I found that I managed to test on 3 different phones is also using an ADB command but slightly different.

`adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_APP_SWITCH`

When connected to a device using the console I've sent this command and all 3 phones responded correctly by opening the Recent Apps Screen.

I would suggest that instead of the "Menu button" there would be the "Recent button". Or at least have an option somewhere to select which button you'd like at that position.
 With this solution, you can change the behavior of the context menu button to app switch button behavior:

1. Stop the OpenSTF server and open this file:
//usr/local/lib/node_modules/stf/node_modules/adbkit/lib/adb/keycode.js

2. Modify the value of KEYCODE_MENU to 187 (It's the value of KEYCODE_APP_SWITCH key):
KEYCODE_MENU: 187,

3. Start the server. Now you can use the lower left key for switching apps:

Hi there!

Please be sure to run `stf doctor` before submitting an issue. Please include screenshots, command output and log files if any.

=== SUPER COMMON QUESTIONS ===

Q. I'm having issues when multiple devices are connected.
A. Usually caused by insufficient USB power supply or other hardware issue we can't do anything about.

Q. Can I connect a device to STF over WIFI?
A. Yes, with the `--allow-remote` option. However, ADB over WIFI can easily be 10x slower than USB, so don't expect too much.

Q. How do I connect to my local STF from another computer?
A. Try the `--public-ip` option or do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Q. Can I run STF on multiple machines?
A. Yes, if you do a full deployment. See DEPLOYMENT.md in the doc folder.

Hi, I just want to know, if I connect to a device, regardless of using adb or not, let's say I connect via a socket I create, to whatever port in the device, could this device still be "seen" by stf? Or should I use adb no matter what.

I'm trying to connect via network, not just local wifi, but to connect to a device even remotely, and I mean via public network, like I can do with a server daemon, or cliente/server environment. Thanks in advance!

 adb is still needed, because stf  use [adbkit](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit), and adbkit is only a adb client, not adb server.
 Thank You very much @codeskyblue , if I create a new plugin, or maybe dependency, which can connect by ssh, could I add it to stf?

Also, is it possible to create a ssh access to a device, using ssh over adb?

Thanks in advance!
 you do not need ssh. adb is just enough.
 Okay, Thank you @codeskyblue , What I was trying was to access a device through public network or 3g/4g, still don't know if this is possible, I'm doing my research, Than You
 Oh, Ok, Thank You very much @sorccu 

I'm sorry if I ask something out of stf, but, as far as I know, Teamviewer offers remote without rooting, do you have an idea, which technologies or scenarios could allow that? 

Or is it just plain impossible

Sorry for that question, I know it's out of the repo, just curious if You know something about it.

Thank You very much.

 @sorccu OK, updated. Sorry.
 ahhh. You are right! Thank you :)
 Just for the record:

The other workaround is to simply get rid of libmtp  with `sudo apt-get purge --purge libmtp9 libmtp-common libmtp-runtime` ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/a/35506088)) if you don't need to use it (some devices may not be accessible with your file browser etc.).

Just remember to check if `/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules` needs to be updated with your device ids ([source](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html#setting-up)) and to reboot your computer.

This way `adb` will be able to work properly without `root` privileges.
  Suppose, I have my own authentication UI which is developed using nodejs, express, jade.. blah blah..

Now I need to integrate this screen as the first Login screen which internally would connect to my LDAP server, authorizes the user and then come to Device Screen.

How can we do this? Can you give us step by step description?
 Sure thanks, Sorccu I will try this. 
 I want to add logout button in STF page. I did some changes in menu.jade file but it's not reflecting over UI. How the communication between webpack and js file happens? After every change I am restarting STF module using ./stf local But still not reflecting the changes :(. Who can help us in development related activity?
  Browser:Chrome(ch_zn,win 8)
STF server: ubuntu 16.04

It's this a bug? 
 I got the same issue as well but in OS X.
Some news about this?
 I think issue could be here
`INF/device:support:storage 30486 [F8UDU15131003748] Uploaded to "/s/image/59653267-52dc-416f-9c9d-3f6eb82b0ee1/F8UDU15131003748.jpg"`

the /s/image directory does not exists...
 I don't really find where is the problem. The screen cature is fine ,maybe it was err when tranfer process or  write file.
The core maybe err at the lib/device/screen/cature.js  50 line.But  I'm still not quite understand nodejs .It take me some time to learn nodejs and angularjs.

.......
          return adb.pull(options.serial, file)
            .then(function(transfer) {
              return storage.store('image', transfer, {
                filename: util.format('%s.jpg', options.serial)
              , contentType: 'image/jpeg'
              , knownLength: stats.size
 I tested now in my setup on Linux , and the screenshots problem is not found , so probably the problem may be related to OS X.

  Hello,

i'm trying to change orientation for m2 note device (Android 5.1) by  clicking Landscape button on STF UI, but nothing happened. If I change it manually, working fine. Also switching from Landscape to Portrait works good via button click

No changes in STF logs after clicking Landscape mode 

Thanks,
Maria 
  STF has been run.
Operating:
1.choose one of the device.
2.upload the apk and install it.
3.to disconnect device.
4.to choose the same device again.

Result:
Already installed app is deleted when the second use.

Question:
Whether has a feature that to del the last user's record?

 OK,thank u.Next time I will do
 start stf:
stf local --public-ip your_internal_network_ip_here
another computer can connect stf now.
 Hi @zjj796 @sorccu 

I can run Stf locally ,I am trying to run on remote and followed 

**stf local --public-ip <your_internal_network_ip_here>
stf local 10.x.x.x 10..y.y.y**
I can still see its running locally but not on remote address which i mentioned above.
Please let me know If I am doing anything wrong ?

  @sorccu 

I have deployed stf in production mode on coreOS.
After starting all the services all devices start showing and are accessible. Now after 24 hours or so, 
few of the devices only show on screen and rest go in disconnected state ( Although the devices are connected to the same machines ). 
When i access a device in this state it shows up grey screen and on performing any action ( take screenshot ) it throws error. 
Have attached the screen-shots.  

When i restart the services, all devices start showing up again and are accessible.  Can you please guide me where can be the issue ?

 The changes was only the logo to check and deploy the changes with docker. 
At the time of starting units all devices starts showing up correctly. But after some time they go in some zombie state. 
 @vbanthia - I have to pass them to providers only ?
Is below given unit file looks okay ?

 Thanks @vbanthia 
I am using COREOS + fleet

I have made the following changes
-e "ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE=1" \
-e "ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=30000" \
to the below unit-files
stf-triproxy-app
stf-triproxy-dev
stf-websocket
stf-provider@
stf-processor@

The setup works absolutely fine. But when i change the value  "ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=30000" to 
 "ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=600000" it starts  failing with the error in all above unit files with 
Invalid argument (tcp.cpp:121)

Any work around or is there any max limit to the value ? 
 @vbanthia  - please check if u get some time 
 Same issue here on my production deployment. Over time (usually a few hours), devices become inaccessible through the Control screen, but still show up as accessible in the main Devices list.  This issue is repeatable on both the master and v2.0.0 versions.

Adding the `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE=1` and `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=30000` environment variables to the systemd unit files did not seem to remedy the situation.

Not sure if this helps to diagnose the issue, but restarting only the provider services is sufficient for me to fully restore device access, but only to have the timeout occur again several hours later.
 Looking good so far passing 6 hours uptime with `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=300`. 

By now, without any direct interaction with STF, I would expect to see at least one provider start to become unresponsive. I'll follow up with on-going feedback since the issue intermittently took as long as ~48 hours idle to occur, but I expect this resolves the issue for me, thanks!
 Tried with  value ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE=300  and it failed after approx 8 hrs.
 Four days uptime, all devices and providers still responsive. This definitely fixed the issue for me!

@sj2208  if the connection is still failing, I would try further reducing the value of `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE`. Presumably the connection fails due to idle timeout; this will reduce the time period before the keepalive probes will start to fire to maintain the connection.
 Yep this is working. Thank you guys :) 👍   @vbanthia  @mitchtech  @sorccu

 thanks，reinstall zeromq,then ok
  I am not able to connect device even using "Remote debug" connection string. I have some problems with standard STF functionality.

When I click "Use" in web-interface, and then execute 'adb connect host:port', and still can't see device in adb devices. 
When I execute remote debug string in shell 'adb connect host:port' i get,
- daemon not running. starting it now on port 5038 *
- daemon started successfully *
  connected to 192.**_._.**_:_***

after this when i execute 'adb devices' i get,
- daemon not running. starting it now on port 5038 *
- daemon started successfully *
  List of devices attached 

There is one device connected to stf but it is not being displayed.

My aim is to connect and bind the devices connected to openstf from my system to run the test cases.
Can you let me know how will I come to know when the devices are binded and ready to use from my system? I am using python-stf-utils to bind and connect to stf devices.
 The below image is the stf doctor output..

 How much devices have you access?
 I am connecting only one device, HTC desire 600. And the others which appear in the log are the ones which I connected once for testing but haven't used them since long.
 So what might be the reason for adb not getting the list of devices connected from the web interface of stf shell command? Am I missing something?
 What else can I post, can you suggest?
And I also got two errors in stf doctor. To update the node and protobuf, Does that have any effect?
 I think you can try to del the recored from rethinkdb.
   Hi~

Thank you for your awesome stuff. stf is really great job.

I am trying to install stf in my workspace. But, I have a problem when applying ldap auth.
I think that my workspace ldap settings are uncommon. cn field is a array. ex) ['employee ID', 'employee name']

So, I would like to add an option which can select ldap field for stf username.

Please check this PR.
thank you in advance
 @sorccu Thanks quick review!
I fixed typo

Thank you for merging!!

Could you please help with this, so I can start to use STF.. :-)
Much appreciated for all your help here..

Cheers,
 You can try to reinstall stf and another version of rethinkdb that I was doing.

The issue I have ask: https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/305
The link of rethinkdb:  http://download.rethinkdb.com/apt
Choose a suitable one

I hope that can help you.
 It's been fixed, It just need to upgrade rethinkdb version to latest version..

Thanks @0x88l @sorccu  for all your supports
  @sorccu - Need help regarding the production setup on coreOS:

I have done the production setup for STF on  4 coreOS machines. Now the major problem that i run into is that every other night one or the other COREOS machine restarts and the services restarts on other machines. I have to go and then edit the nginx.conf file with the updated end-points. 

Need to know if there is a way to disable the reboot for the machines ? or is there any stable way for production setup so that they don't bring the complete production setup down ?

Below are the setup details:

CoreOS version - stable 
I have coreOS machine with an entry for "reboot-strategy:off" in cloud config. 
coreos:
  update:
    reboot-strategy: off
 Sure I agree that it belong to a COREOS problem, thought if you have some ideas to share on it. 

I validated my cloud-config at this [link](https://coreos.com/validate/) and it has no error.

I have made the changes to my unit files to run on the basis of machineID for now.  I saw your reply on the [thread](https://github.com/coreos/bugs/issues/161), so posted the question here. 
Thanks,
Closing this issue.
 I completely understand  👍 
Will try to be precise about the issues from next time :) 

You have developed an amazing tool and its so helpful. Hoping for some new features \m/
  does stf support to connect to  phone or Simulator(genymotion) with wifi, if so ,  how to make it.
 could you please send me a link?
  I receive the following error when trying to run the stf-migrate docker.

I really liked your project. I want to test it. But I can not figure out how to run it on Linux.
 Yes, you wrote to me how to run . But, how to install?
 You can google it.

Please help,
I fixed the above issue by downloading the [correct binding](https://github.com/sass/node-sass-binaries) for node-saas for specific platform and built a docker image on my local. 
But now when i try to run it on my local ( macOSX ) it throws this error: 
**command: docker run local-image stf doctor**

/app/node_modules/bindings/bindings.js:83
        throw e

How do we build a docker image with local source code and deploy it on CoreOS cluster ?
 I will do as you said and will update. 

Thanks
 It worked. Thanks,
Closing
  It would be nice to allow multiple users to view the same device so that users can demonstrate features or bugs like in vysor. 

http://www.vysor.io/
https://github.com/koush/vysor.io
  All of  devices can be used by one person. How did STF to manage the devices or limit the maximum connection of devices？
 You can change the code for such feature, invite a new device after kick off the last one automatically.
 I tried to achieve this feature.
  Hi there,

I'm trying to get STF working on my MacBook. I have tried it on a linux VM before and it works pretty awesome. It's now running on OS X, but I met a challenge: screenshots feature is not working.

I'm using `bin/stf local --public-ip <my-IP>`, and console shows following error when screenshot button is clicked:

``` bash

I noticed that minicap service stopped after each time I trigger a screenshot, but I don't know why this is happening

The `stf -V` is `1.1.1` with git hash `commit b61df410f72505367728c4d05ef53449eadd4d69`

Any thoughts/suggestions to help me overcome this issue?  
 hi @Lubricy,

Did you already solve this issue? 
I'm with a similar problem , but in my case the MiniCap works perfectly , at least openstf stderr shows no error , but the screenshot is not shown in openstf web interface . Follow the log openSTF and managed to open the image without problems , so the problem is not in taking the screenshot but the referral to the openSTF interface.
Any suggestion @sorccu ?

I'm using OS X as well, with El Captain 10.11.5.

Regards
 I have all installed dependancy . I had before the openstf housed in a machine with Linux , and screenshots working properly , only since I moved to OS X is no longer functioning properly .
I leave here a screenshot of the interface and openSTF as appears screenshot:
http://imgur.com/KEUI1CV

My stderr file shows this output:

```

Thanks for your help.
 yes, graphicsmagick commands works. 
This is the output of gm version command:

 Hi @joaopedroms22,
In my case I found that there is a firewall on my macbook blocking all incoming connections even they're from localhost. After I turned it off everything goes well.
Not sure if this helps ...
 When using homebrew to install graphicsmagick gm binary is located at ``/usr/local/bin`` (actually, it's symlinked).
So make sure that your ``PATH`` env contains that folder when launching stf. That was the problem that I and @joaopedroms22 had.

 Thanks, has been resolved
 @siterui Hi, I have this same problem with you, but I execute `gulp webpack:build` after `npm install`  and `npm link` , so Can you tell me how can you solve your problems?
  
@gunta Look forward for you apply too! Thanks! I have resolved this problem, by execute`bower install` to install web modules in bower.json. Effectively I solved the problem with bower install, but before that I sudo chmod -R 777 / Users / jrolon /. config  It's possible that  I want to set 'zh_CN' for default Language ?And what should I do?

Thanks.
 I want  the first time who has logined is Chinese rather than English. Is it  possible?
 Thank you very much.

I don't think the size of the package is related. The automatic launcher activity detection seems to be failing for some reason. Is there any chance you could send the .apk file to me?

 I didn't have docker deployment. But I can build it on Monday.What do I need to do if I build it up?
 @sorccu Hi,I have build docker. what do I need to do now ?
 Hi, about the "越南棋牌大厅体验包-4.28-10h.apk", it's funny, you can remove the "包" from the file name of your apk, then this apk file can be installed normally.

I think you want to solve this kind of problems forever, you can rename the Chinese file name to a Latin one, after you receive file and store it to /tmp on sever

And you're supposed to know the code of temp.js, aren't you?
 Oh my god!!!Why didn't I think of this issue yet.Thank you for @chenpig1123 .
  version：master
The webside crash down every time when you upload a package(.apk) over 40MB.

3. I add "stf.th.po"  in  "res\common\lang\translations"
4. I reboot the stf
but it doesn't works , is there somting i need to do????

 thank you very much!  thank you
i'am a rookie student
    @sorccu 
What should be the CallBack URL set to the command when setting up OAuth2 authentication on Local ?
current command:
./stf local --auth-type oauth2 --auth-options '["--oauth-authorization-url","https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","--oauth-token-url","https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token","--oauth-userinfo-url","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email","--oauth-client-id","XXXXX","--oauth-client-secret","XXXX","--oauth-callback-url","http://localhost:7100/auth/oauth/callback","--oauth-scope","openid email"]'
 So here is the error that i am getting after starting STF with the below command:
 ./stf local --auth-type oauth2 --auth-options '["--oauth-authorization-url","https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","--oauth-token-url","https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token","--oauth-userinfo-url","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email","--oauth-client-id","XXXX","--oauth-client-secret","XXXX","--oauth-callback-url","http://localhost:7100/auth/oauth/callback","--oauth-scope","email"]'

Not able to get passed this. 
 Thanks,
It worked like a charm.  

There is one small doubt that i have here is:

After i use --public-ip flag to host on a private address and then change my redirect URL to a private IP end-point, I am getting below error 
400. That’s an error.

Error: invalid_request

device_id and device_name are required for private IP: http://172.20.49.41:7100/auth/oauth/callback
 Hello, friends !! I am having the same problem. I want to develop twitter app for Windows 10. For OAuth 2.0 authentication I need to send them a valid redirect_ url. My question is what is my redirect url. How can I find this ? I am new in developing. Give me a solid example please. I have no website. Is it still possible to make LinkedIn app and send redirect url ?   the open-stf  just suport adding an android device through  usb-cable( or usb-hub ) ???????

how to add an android devices through wireless network (wifi ) ?? does it suport it ?

thank you very much ! !
 something i have to do  in my android devices ???
 thank you for your answer

C:\Users\Administrator>adb connect 172.27.150.58:7100
connected to 172.27.150.18:7100

it shows success ,but i can't see any devices in http://172.27.150.18:7100/#!/devices

why ??
  Let say if i want to use this for tracing some android smart phones , does it need to connected all time with the system ?

Does ADB installation is also needed in the same system 
  Ensuring that brew is up-to-date before running installs on packages.
 Should we also add `node` to the list of formulas?

`brew update && brew install node rethinkdb graphicsmagick zeromq protobuf yasm pkg-config`
  I'm running ' stf local ' and it cannot be run for my device

 I didn't change the version of rethinkdb. And it work before  I try to  npm install sft again.
 Just update RethinkDB, 2.3.0 is OK.
 @gunta  NO, stf  doctor isn't work too.  I try to del all of stf \rethinkdb  and reinstall them.But there is err when  npm download . I think that my rethinkdb(version 2.3.0) is noproblem. 
 I have remove stf and rebuild the enviroment again. The err has been dispose off.  But I still  try  to 
recurrence this problem.
 @gunta  I try to install master version that you have been updated with translation of zh_cn,but there is err like this:

 I use git to download the master-version and do "npm link",and it's works.Thank you sorccu's and gunta answers.
 Just in case someone stumble upon this issue:
- run `npm rebuild` if you switch node version
- For RethinkDB. Make sure installed rethinkdb is compatible with our rethinkdb package. In my case I'm using RethinkDB 2.2.2 against rethinkdb 2.2.0 (npm)
- For jpeg-turbo issue, don't use 6.x. use node 5.x instead
 I got the jpeg-turbo issue and followed @neofreko advice, using node 5.x.  This was during initial install, but a search got me here so I'd like to say thanks.  Hi @gunta @sorccu ,

some fans like @buaawp and I has done the translation of STF in Chinese(China) in Transifex. Could you review it and merge the language to github? I believe many people are waiting for that, including me :-)
  ## Current Behavior

Just update Chrome from 49.\* to 50.0.2661.75 (64-bit) on OSX 10.11.4, then Device Screen not show up

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3265208/14525833/01c0e4a2-0272-11e6-90ec-2b2ba0ce5971.png)
## Possible Solution

Works well on Safari 9.1 (11601.5.17.1) and Vivaldi 1.0.435.40.

Works well on Chrome 41.\* and Chrome 49.*.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. Update Chrome to 50.*
2. Open /#!/control/[SN] page
3. You can see it now.
## Your Environment
- OSX 10.11.4
- Chrome 50.0.2661.75 (64-bit)
- STF (latest on npm , and master at 04 Jan, 2016)

Thanks :)
 @sorccu It works well now 🍻 
 I'd rather not open a new issue.. but @sorccu I've updated to specifically that commit (e06b2f2, checked that with npm list stf), but I still get the same exact errors:

Uncaught Error: Unable to read bounds; container must have dimensions
  I'm new to stf. After read the deploy doc , I found it will cost alot of time to deploy stf on Linux or Mac OS.
I wonder if there's an easy way to deploy stf on Win7(my pc os). And hopefully a detailed doc about all steps attached!
  Hi all,
# I see @vbanthia asked automation issue(below) one year ago. I want to know the progress about this. Could any developer @sorccu @lenciel @aberoham @gunta @jlhonora  help to answer this?

Hello guys,

Thanks for this awesome tool. I had fun in setting up this locally and its quite useful for debugging my apps.

The kind of feature I wish from STF is running UI Test Suites (Appium, Robotium, monkey runner etc) parallel on multiple devices similar to services such as testdroid, AWS Device Farm etc.

For this, they provide a feature for creating custom device pool where user can create a device group of their target devices. Then you upload your apk file and test suites then they will run your test and provide test results. They also provide apis for these features which makes CI integration easier.

I think it will be really helpful to have this kind of facility On-premises. It will give better control.

I want to know if this feature or something similar to this, is in your roadmap? If it is, please share how you want to implement this. I will be glad to contribute :)

Thanks,
  sometimes log say "Shell keeping minitouch running ended unexpectedly"
There is not any exception or backtrace in stf or device log.
How can I debug this issue?
 Modify the minitouch source code and rebuild it, push your new .so to device, then exec them.
You need android-ndk for building the minitouch source code.
  as described below, I want to deploy STF in production mode with more than one host which has devices plugged in:

<img width="440" alt="2016-04-08 8 23 25" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9692934/14383455/ce344d30-fdc7-11e5-84dd-313ee68416dd.png">

I distribute the service as displayed on the right side. (ps: I succeed to deploy STF when there is only one host with devices plugged in according to this service distribution, now I want to deploy STF with two Dev side hosts)

I see the [DEPLOYMENT](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md)，"devside.stf.example.org" only appears in stf-processor.service and stf-reaper.service, so I guess I only need to config the two ip in these two services, like below:

`stf-processor@.service`

After I deploy STF, I try to use the device in browser, but I find I can not manipulate the device from browser side, I know there must be some problem in the unit file configuration, but I really do not know how, any suggestions and help is appreciated, thanks in advance.
 @sorccu Thanks for your quick reply.
Actually I did as you said at first, start stf-triproxy-dev service in the application service side, but all devices are ignored when I start stf-provider service at last in dev side, then I try to start stf-triproxy-dev service in dev side and solve the problem, you can find the detail in this [issue](https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/294) I closed.

if really as you suggested, I should start stf-triproxy-dev in application service side, then what can I do to avoid the device ignorance problem? 
 really as the [DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md) said, I read it thoroughly and finally I find the problem, I misunderstand what devside.stf.example.org really stands, now everything goes fine now except some device will offline suddenly, I will handle it.

Thanks again for this excellent project!  
 @krisdyZJU could you please share with us what your final solution is?  Thx!
  Add Simplified Chinese translations.
 👍 
 Hi buaawp, have you check the functionality for this PR? As I know, STF use Transifex for the Localization of different countries, so I am not sure the files you changed is generated by the Transifex client and works well?
 Ok, I will do that in transifex.
 yes, I have a look at your translation, it seems well, many words were translated clearly. hope you can complement the simple Chinese translation in Transifex and then merge in code. I also wait it. :+1: )
  Hi,

Today I have installed the STF local but I am getting below error  "Received an unsupported protocol version. This port is for RethinkDB queries"
Rethinkdb version is : rethinkdb 2.2.5 (CLANG 7.0.2 (clang-700.1.81)). Can you please tell me what is wrong. Please find attached snapshot for more details,

 My apologize @sorccu.. It's been fixed when I upgrade rethinkdb version to latest version..

Thanks...
 @sorccu Yeah, npm rebuild is helping me resolving this issue, But another thing that we need to consider is RethinkDB version which somehow not supporting STF version related with this issue..

Thanks for your support anyway.. Really appreciate it much...
  I follow the step as described in [DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md), start STF in production mode, everything goes well except screenshot and install apk files, I dig into the log, and find the log like:

Am I missing something?
 Thanks @sorccu 

my fault, I add "http://" before the ip of "--storage", it works fine now, so close it.
  Change handler order for device worker promise
 @sorccu this is good news. We are using version 2.0.0 with api and are interested in a merger
 +1
  We have set up the cluster and we were able to get the stf up and running with the 172.8.... Stuff..

When I connect the device I am not able to see the device. But when I did adb devices in coreos-1 console , I am able to see the device listed. But not in stf. Please advise
 The device is android device.. 
 Agree, thanks a lot we were able to get that up.
 @vbanthia 
I follow the steps as described in DEPLOYMENT.md and try to deploy STF in production mode, I start adbd and stf-provider service in one host as Provider side which has one android device plugged in, and the other services started in another host as App side, but when I start stf-provider service at last, the log said:

as you can see, the device is ignored, can you help to see and give some suggestions, thanks in advance.

and also @PattabhiramaPandit ,can you give me some hint how you fix it? thanks
   We are eagerly awaiting your response on iOS support 
  STFService successfully installed and running (all device information is available on Devices list), but it's impossible to remote control the device (the device physically disconnects with Try Again message in STF dashboard).

My system is Mac。
  When accessing STF on remote connection (I'm using mobile, 30ping, 30mb download, 2mb upload, but this also happened while at friends house) the screen sharing is really sluggish, after an action is done there's a 1-2 second delay, but on the device itself action is instant - after the delay, everything is shown in a slow-motion manner.

Like this:
https://youtu.be/7-YthBI6TTY (the "freeze" happened for the first time on the video though, never had this before).

I've opened all possible ports, I've removed all kinds of protection off my router, I've double checked upload/download speed (250/30 on my server machine, 30/2 on my test machine). The fun thing is, that the bigger the device is, the quicker it reacts - I thought it should work the other way around, as older devices produces smaller data packs (smaller screens/resolutions). I'd really love fix this, as right now it's better for me to connect through teamviewer/splashtop and work "locally" rather than use the remote functionality :(
 I showcased how it works on a mobile because its easier having devices next to each other - it works exactly the same on a pc :)
  hi there!

are there any updates on the recommended usb hubs? http://plugable.com/products/usb2-hub7bc is not available (at least in europe). I'm especially looking for more information concerning "Note that ORICO also provides hubs that are identical to Plugable's offerings, the latter of which seem to be rebrands."

Best,
Roman
 Being you I'd just try to find hubs with good external power source - 60/48W should do.

Also, I'm using a normal, 4-port hubs without any external power source and it works for me, although I'm connecting just 14 devices at once.
 @Rabusek, are you using 4 port hubs with usb 2.0 or usb 3.0?
 @harishnazief 3.0
 @Rabusek, could you share OS, USB PCI Card and USB Hub that you use for STF? Are you disable the 3.0? Is it stable using 3.0?
 @banoraga Mac OSX 10.10, it's not PCI card, it's just a hub - TP Link UH700. I'm not disablind 3.0. It's stable, but i can't connect more than ~20 devices
 @Rabusek @banoraga Linux FTW in this situation?
  I'v read the document of Android N. It says 

> Android N includes namespace changes to prevent loading of non-public APIs. If you use the NDK, you should only be using public APIs from the Android platform. Using non-public APIs in the next official release of Android can cause your app to crash.

[http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-cn/preview/behavior-changes.html#ndk](url)

So, can STF still work on Android N ?

thx.
 Thanks, man. I'll update my Nexus 9 to N, and have a try. I'll let you know the result.
 When will you release a library for N? Any plan?
 Keen for N support, just donated. I have a Nexus 9.
 That's great @sorccu :)

I have a few other devices that are not showing up or have a grey screen. If I were to capture logs etc for you that would be useful, what would you like or where would I get them from?

I hope this isn't taking the thread too far off topic, I could make an issue for each and post it here. I

I'm also not sure whether the version I am using is correct. I installed using the README.md:

`brew install rethinkdb graphicsmagick zeromq protobuf yasm pkg-config`

and

`npm install -g stf`
 Hey, it is now working on our Nexus 9. Sweet!
 Hello, I want to use Android N Preview 4. Could you plz check STF working?
 You may want to test your app with SDK set to 24. The behaviour may change:
http://android-developers.blogspot.co.il/2016/06/improving-stability-with-private-cc.html
 Just read your comment that in your verification you used target SDK=23 and there are different rules for 23 and 24 so thought I would let you know.
Never used stf myself so no idea what's that.
 Hello,
I have connected a nexus 5x with android 7.0(nougat)  and the device was in preparing status and then it became disconnected.
Does it works for somebody?
My rom version is nrd90m.

------------------------- Update --------------

The problem was that my node.js was not new enough on my ubuntu 14.04 machine.
Thanks to @sorccu for the help!
  For example, Nexus 6 shows, I guess, Nexus 4 or even S:

HTC One M8, a phone that was released just year ago, has no image:

 Is there a way to add new device pictures? And is it possible to edit device names?
e.g for my "Sony Xperia Z3 Compact D5803" I only get D5803 with a wrong device picture. Makes it kinda hard to find the right device.
 @sorccu any insight on this? I could provide proper images for each device and also share that on the project, it's really harder to move around your devices when it looks like this

 @vbanthia thanks, I'll look into it in the next week and will try to contribute.
  If I set my ip with --public-ip to my real public IP I cannot enter STF from any computer inside my network. I temporarily got around this by connecting to my mobile phone or setting the public ip to 192.168.1.115, but then I need to restart each time to make it working again from the outside.

Could you give me some suggestions, plz.
 Doesn't this just happen when you are scrolling the view or doing heavy animation things? If there's no animation ongoing, it works properly - so if you don't need to make a screenshot of the actual animation, my suggestion is wait until it stops before making a screenshot.

Also, sometimes after re-starting the device access ("stop using" and use again) the glitches go away

 Just for the record - it happens on Nexus 6P, but doesn't on 6 with almost identical OS. Both phones are clean after a factory reset without any additional software.

Also, 6P is connected through USB-C-USB, 6 is on standard micro-USB-USB

 When image is broken, just reconnect the minicap will fix the problem
  Hello !
I would like to use STF without plugging an USB cable on my device.
It works perfectly when it is plugged but when I use "stf local --allow-remote --public-ip 192.168.43.1", the phone is detected but I get "WRN/util:datautil 7829 [*] Device database does not have a match for device "192.168.43.1:5555" (model "KC-S701"/"KC-S701")" warning message and I don't have the screen of my device on my browser:

Thank you for your help,

 Indeed there is a failed WebSocket request.

First, when I try to connect to localhost:71000, I am redirected to 192.168.43.1:7100/auth/mock but the connection fails and I get warning on the console : The use of "getPeventDefault()" is obsolete. Use "defaultPrevented()" instead.

Then I replace the IP address with localhost and I get the authentication page:

Finally when I authenticate I am redirected once again to an url beginning with the IP and when I replace the IP with localhost, I get this error on the console : Firefox can't establish a connexion with server at address ws://192.168.43.1:7110/socket.io/...

 Ok, I launch with **stf local --allow-remote --public-ip 1.2.3.4**
 Am I supposed to have a "STF" folder (or similar) on my smartphone ? Because I just have the "STFService" application and I can't even locate where it is installed...
 Ok, thank you
 I solved my problem !
Actually I didn't have to use --public-ip.

I connected my device to the same WLAN as my computer, I ran **rethinkdb**, then **adb connect 1.2.3.4** in another shell and finally **stf local --allow-remote**
I have wireless access to my device from localhost:7100
It is indeed slower than through USB but there is less than 5 seconds lag

Thank you for your help and advice !
  Screen sharing on some devices only shows grey！
 Device database does not have a match for device "0123456789ABCDEF" (model " E50 T1"/"Hasee E50 T1")

Please tell me the reason and how to solve this problem！
 @sorccu 
My device is not bad;
I inserted two usb devices,
Serial numbers are
c349c632 device
0123456789ABCDEF device

The same performance,
Device database does not have a match for device "0123456789ABCDEF" (model "E50 T1" / "Hasee E50 T1")
Device database does not have a match for device "c349c632" (model "SM-J5108" / "j5xltezm")
 
Can you tell me which phone models and  pictures your supported ？？
 @sorccu 
This problem has been solved;
I inquired about your file called devices-latest.json ,
Nexus 5 phone is supported.
But I still want to add more supported models;
Can I  add other models? How do I add?
In addition to adding the file called devices-latest.json , but also to add images?
 Enable MTP in storage settings and this issue can be solved. I came across this issue yesterday.
 You need to make sure that STFService on the mobile is running and not blocked by any other application.
 Hi fireblue, where I can enable MTP in storage settings ? Is there a documentation somewhere about all these settings ?
Thanks.
  Hi guys,

First of all let me congratulate you guys for this excellent piece of software. CONGRATULATIONS !!!
I am truly impressed but can't make it work over the network.
STF does work when I have the phone connected via USB cable but not over the network.
This is how I have my lab configured:
STF server (192.168.1.66) -> Router (192.168.1.254) -> Android Phone (192.168.1.65)
![stf_lab](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1796032/13177831/7945d8c8-d713-11e5-80bf-9737de1d4a46.png)
I've configured the android phone to do ADB over network:
![android-phone](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1796032/13177993/7d162376-d714-11e5-9fca-e0187c1b64ca.png)
Then I started STF using the following commands:
stf local --public-ip 192.168.1.66
stf local --public-ip 192.168.1.66 --allow-remote
NONE worked unfortunately. I did forward port 5555 on the router to point to the smartphone but it still refuses to detect the phone.
Am I doing something wrong? Can you please point me in the right direction ? Many thanks in advance.
 When I connect the phone using the USB cable, STFService starts and everything seems to work fine.
As soon as I disconnect the USB cable the phone appears disconnected in the STF webpage.
I've also rebooted the phone and tried to connect 1st via network and no STFService was started. Meaning that the server couldn't see the phone?
From the STF machine (UBUNTU) I run the following command:
telnet 192.168.1.65 5555
The phone replied with:
Escape character is 'ʌ]'
Which means that there is a connection from STF to the smartphone port 5555 so why doesn't ADB over network works ?
 Spot on Sorccu ! I've read the following page to come up to the same conclusion:
https://www.learn2crack.com/2014/07/adb-android-debug-bridge-over-wifi.html
I did "adb connect 192.168.1.65" and it connected fine ! Great stuff. Thanks for that :)
Now the next step is to test STF with a "PUBLIC IP" and the smartphone over the 3G network instead of Wifi.
Again thank you for your support Sorccu. Much appreciated.
 @brunotvaz: can you tell something about the performance with stf over wifi? i believe it's pretty slow...
  Love the project, looking to use it to replace the current device management we use.

We do a lot of custom stuff, are there any guidelines for hooking into STF to provide extra features that might be very domain specific - Or should we just fork and maintain a local version.
  This is not about the stf project but the formidable node mudule, I try to upload app which is more than 2.5GB, "socket hang up" error happens. I think the http server maybe timeout cause every time the error happens two minutes later after I begin uploading files, but I changed the settings like so:

server.timeout = 1000 \* 60 \* 10

or:

req.connection.setTimeout(1000 \* 60 \* 10)

It not works. Does someone know this problem and how to solve it?
Thanks.

(I think I've solved it, this issue can be closed.)
 I met the same problem when upload apk file. Could I ask how did you solve it? Thanks. 
 @sorccu An old 3D game apk, it has a big size.
@Tierney0115 You can reset the timeout of server, not only the temp.js on storage server, but the index.js on processor server, just use "server.timeout = 1000 \* 60 \* 10", maybe a bad way, but it can solve my problem now.
  Hi!

In issues #57, #181 it was mentioned that emulator support won't be implemented soon, because it is low priority feature.

> No, STF isn't designed to work with emulators. It's because they don't use SurfaceFlinger for rendering like real devices. It might be possible to make some emulators work, but I don't think it's worth the time and effort. If you have a compelling use case, feel free to let us know.

Since STF has REST API and is used for test automation, it seems there is quite useful but cheap (?) feature like "Basic Emulators Support":
- it has nothing to do with emulator's screen - neither you can see it, nor interact (it makes feature cheap)
- you can reserve/release emulator using API
- emulator is available in interface, you can install apk, push/pull files, inspect logcat, etc.

Such feature is useful if you use emulators for test automation, and you want to integrate STF in this process, and it seems shouldn't be very expensive to add it.

So, what do you think about such feature?
Does it correlate with STF concept?
 OK, thanks for response.
Maybe I will try to implement this 
 Probably some good news about Android Emulators:

"New" Android Emulator Beta, which comes with Android Studio 2.0 (http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/emulator) works almost fine with stf without any improvements:
- it is visible in interface, you can bind it, you can establish a remote connection via adb connect.
You only can't see the screen of emulator, although you can interact with this "black screen" you see in stf web interface and control emulator's screen!
 Hi, 
Anyone can share what are the required changes in minicap? I'd like to use openstf to remote control emulators
 Some emulator are based on virtualbox  maybe you could try with virtualbox api
 anyone tried how it works with emulators: @rseek ?
 @bexp, STF works just fine with emulators except one thing - you won't be able to see emulator's screen in stf.
 Also, you can user this [dirty hacked minicap](https://github.com/nwlunatic/minicap/tree/ugly_horrible_screenshot_dirty_hack), which provides screen support for emulators.
 how do you use it ? I've tried to manually build minicap and push it on emulator
but STF still shows black screen. I found that minicap executable located in data/local/tmp/minicap-devel so I copy it to one level above. Anything that I'm missing ?
 Hi, I'm facing the same problem. Tryed rseek's solution, but I think I'm missing something on the build.
Tryed to run on the root directory:
```
ndk-build clean
ndk-build V=1
```

But with the same result. 
Can anyone share some light, pls?
 I noticed the same problems as you when I created avd: Galaxy_Nexus_API_25 and I tried to connect emulator to stf.

What I done:
I checkout minicap: https://github.com/openstf/minicap
and I done building process using android-ndk-r15c.

Basing on informations from run, when you are running minicap with run.sh is:

 adb shell 'mkdir /data/local/tmp/minicap-devel 2>/dev/null || true'
+ adb push libs/x86/minicap /data/local/tmp/minicap-devel
3891 KB/s (989164 bytes in 0.248s)
+ '[' -e jni/minicap-shared/aosp/libs/android-7.1.1/x86/minicap.so ']'
+ adb push jni/minicap-shared/aosp/libs/android-25/x86/minicap.so /data/local/tmp/minicap-devel
316 KB/s (17848 bytes in 0.055s)
+ adb shell LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/local/tmp/minicap-devel /data/local/tmp/minicap-devel/minicap -P 1080x1920@1080x1920/0
PID: 4232
INFO: Using projection 1080x1920@1080x1920/0

So what was important in my case, was to copy correct minicap.so ( jni/minicap-shared/aosp/libs/android-25/x86/minicap.so) to 
/home/luze/stf/stf/node_modules/minicap-prebuilt/prebuilt/x86/lib/android-25/ folder. ( I created emulator folder to separate real devices,from emulators.)

After that I copied: 
 - libs/x86/minicap 
 - libs/x86/minicap-nopie

to stf/stf/node_modules/minicap-prebuilt/prebuilt/x86/bin ( in my case emulator).
If you will not add as me emulator folder under prebuilt folders, screensharing of emulator framebuffer to STF should still work for you, but it will cause issue with real devices.

I'm in progress of adding changes to emulator folder to split real devices libs and binaries from emulator one. As created new binaries are not compatible with real device(with my nexus 5, so I think also with other one devices). So splitting minicap binaries for emulators and real device need to be done. If you are using separate stf, you can feel free to use one stf provider to run only emulators.
![stf_emulator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22797365/32054303-49abef82-ba5e-11e7-86ab-4f7f22895ca3.png)

It works quietly good. I'm running at current one emulator, and my machine is not powerful, so I observe some lags, which might to be caused with performance of my machine. It will be good to investigate this.

I have hope that part of described steps will help you to enable emulator with screen sharing on your stf.  Small changes, which enable running emulator and real devices( need to create separate binaries and libs and put them inside:
node_modules/minicap-prebuilt/prebuilt/x86/lib/android-X/emulator/
node_modules/minicap-prebuilt/prebuilt/x86/bin
folders you can find at:
https://github.com/lukzeg/stf/tree/enable_android_emulators
)
It is in progress, so my apologies. I'm not guru from nodejs, so please forgive me any mistakes Hi @sorccu,
Is there any possibility to add:
https://github.com/openstf/minicap/tree/master/jni/minicap-shared/aosp/libs
to minicap-prebuild npm package as separate aosp libs, which can be used for emulators?
Also if this will be possible, can we add two more binaries, generated during building process:

minicap
minicap-niop
to this repository under x86/bin  sub-folder(aosp or emulator as I done locally)?

Or do you agree to add those libs under vendor folder of STF, to enable emulator support?
I can share with you binaries, generated during building process which works for me on my ubuntu 16.04 LTS and macOS Sierra 10.12.6. Those binaries were tested for API25 and API26, or you can generate them by yourself.

Binaries were generated from minicap project:
https://github.com/openstf/minicap

rev: 61cd2e6b747a38d420a0fafe2a3443cc7a06fa72

build by cmd:
```
<path>/android-ndk-r15c/ndk-build NDK_DEBUG=0
```
 Hi @sorccu , 
My apologies for my last not fully clear comment.

The changes to run emulators(also restart emulators  on localhost) are stored at this branch:
https://github.com/lukzeg/stf/tree/enable_android_emulators

Inside those changes:
lib/units/device/resources/minicap.js

I'm changing location from where we load used by emulator minicap.so (to stream screen), as well generated during building process minicap and minicap-niope files( created from  master source code:
https://github.com/openstf/minicap)

The minicap.so is not changed binary, which was copied from:
https://github.com/openstf/minicap/tree/master/jni/minicap-shared/aosp/libs/
to minicap-prebuild node module:
node_modules/minicap-prebuilt/prebuilt/x86/lib/android-X/emulator/

About minicap-niop. I done typo, I should write minicap-niope. I double checked minicap-niope and minicap binaries, and there is no need to created any new one. Mostly mentioned in this ticket problems with streaming screen from emulator to stf was connected with usage generated minicap.so libs on emulator instead of prebuild from:
https://github.com/openstf/minicap/tree/master/jni/minicap-shared/aosp/libs/

I'm not sure, should I create pull request with my current changes or no. I will be grateful for anyone code review, and opinion, did those changes will be useful, or no, or what should be changed.

I know that mentioned by me implementation is limited(as emulators can be restarted on localhost of STF machine) but I will be grateful for any info.

Also I will add I hope today additional method to switch orientation of emulator, as adb cmd is changing orientation for a second. To change screen orientation of emulator, I should use as for restarting emulator telnet:
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-console.html
with cmd:
'''
rotate
'''

Once more, I will be grateful for any suggestions, what should be changed, to move those changes maybe to pull request.

 Hi @sorccu,

Today I wanted to reproduce all my previous issues, to deliver you as much informations as possible. 
I checkout latest repo and repo with sha:
c953779b983a487096a6d6afe49f1cd9bcd863f7

and I'm not able to reproduce my problems with screen sharing, which was caused by minicap.so. 
The emulators works without any troubles. I'm not sure what happened, I installed qt5 but this should not have any impact on way, how stf works.

I can't say, how guilty I feel by disturbing you right now. Once more time, my apologies. This issue is still valid?  Hi @mariuszs ,
This is a good question. Basic API, viewing screen and making action woks without on emulators which I created from AVD(Android Studio v3.0.1 - Linux). So we can say yes. 
The problems with setup of emulators you might to start to observe, when you have few providers. In current implementation, when you have two emulators working on the same port 5554 and both of them works on two different providers, the last started one will override data in db (device table). I described this problem in issue:
https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/753
I done changes which solve this issue. Instead of storing 'emulator-XXXX' serial number for emulator(which is not unique), I'm storing 'privder_hostname-XXXX' as unique serial number, which I'm parsing in the code to emulator-XXXX.
This is not nice solution, but it works. Also I added some extra functionality:
a) provider at start discover created by user emulators and add them to device table
b) in view of devices, end user will be able to find not runnign emulators, and start them. At current moment, emulators will be started with those flags:
 -wipe-data 
 -no-boot-anim 
 -no-window
Description of those flags you can find at:
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline.html#startup-options.
The changes are located at:
https://github.com/lukzeg/stf/tree/enable_android_emulators 

I'm not sure, should I create PR with those changes or no, as I'm not the guru from JS. If someone is interested to look at those changes, thats great. I will be grateful for any suggestions about what should be fixed and maybe how :).  Could you please give us the shopping link of the kind of shelves on your webpage? Thanks.
  Hello guys,

i got a short question regarding Smartphone connection.

Is it possible to connect a Smartphone with the STF service via WiFi and not via USB?

If not yet, are you planing features like that?

P.S: I'm the succesor of Felix Hahn. He was already in contact with you.

Thanks.
  Thanks for Sorccu's help
I have got STF running via stf local.
Can i just make a provider with adbd.service and stf-provider@.service on the other PCs to provide devices from multiple machines?
 I got it
Thanks for your help
 Actually, Use `stf local` + `stf provider` works fine for me.
  @vbanthia Need your help.

I can use rest api to reserve a device, but it will be released automaticly when timeout. (In my machine is 10min), Want to know how to rest the timeout use api. thanks.
 @vbanthia  Thanks
  I noticed that there is Location label in the Details‘s information.
So can i add devices in the other PC ? And what i need to do？

if i can’t do this，can you tell me what did you do？
my partner tell me that they did try control a large number of devices on the same PC.(use the usb hub), but the effect is not good.

I'm sorry about my English. and thanks for any help you can give.
 Thanks for your help

 @JabariDuan how did it go on?  did you succeed to just make a provider with adbc.service and stf-provider@.service on the other PCs to provide devices from multiple machines or do a full deployment as sorccu recommended in [DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md)

I am a newbie for openstf, still have the same problem as you mentioned, any advice?
  Hi all,

I have a device which can be recognised by stf. But when I choose it to use , it can't display device screen in control tab. On the same time I can't do any action in my device. I attached logs, please help for this.

 I used Samsung Note II, sorry for that missing. 
I look at the codes /usr/local/lib/node_modules/stf/lib/units/device/plugins/screen/stream.js:283:26, it may related to connect to minicap service timeout. Can you give some guidance for that? Which condition will causes connect to minicap service timeout? 
 @sorccu , model info:4df7015a2a2f3081       device usb:14200000 product:t03gxx model:GT_n7108 device:t03g.

I also found same issue in the list, but that guy doesn't say how he solved. https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/98
 Now you know, minicap doesn't work for all devices, two ways you can choose, one is that you can change the code of minicap and make it to .so, then update your vendor, another way is that you can know which device doesn't support minicap, and when minicap don't work you may change to the screencap, that works but slower than minicap.
 Is it possible that the model number could change after reboot the devices? I found this happened but our lab administer said no one had moved those devices. 
  I think there are many ways to do the access control from Android system side, such like adding Xposed module. 
Do you think there is any way to do the access control from STF side or by modifying the STF service APK?

We just want users to install his own APK and could only testing the APP he installed without getting all other information about the Android device. 
Thanks
  Hi,

I connected a Samsung Galaxy Grand I9082 to my setup. And while I'm able to control the device remotely, the screen shown on my laptop is blank and just shows black. I'm getting the following logs:

```

I'm not able to understand the exact issue and it seems that minicap doesnt support this device.

Wanted to check if:
1. you had tested this device ever?
2. can guide me how should I solve this problem.

Regards
 @sorccu Hello! I have same issue with Samsung I9152. Did you solve the problem?
  The guide "If you want to access STF from other machines, you can add the --public-ip option for quick testing."  But if the STF server is working behind a firewall, maybe the service ports also have been mapped to new ports, so what can do more beside add the --public-ip option?
 vbanthia,First Thanks.

then, i have to say sorry. i have not describe my problems clearly. Actually, my network environment as follow:
            proxy machine(with public ip machine)             STF Server machine(with local ip machine)
user            ---- public-ip:portA                          ----                        Local-IP:portB
the protA is not same as portB, in this case what can i do if user want to access our STF server?
 @vbanthia 
 Hi , I tried to visit the stf service from public ip, so I use the following command to test it:

```
stf local --public-ip x.x.x.x --poorxy-port 80 --websocket-port 81
```

I managed to set this up successfully and I'm able to connect to my Android phone via PC browser as well as controlling the the Android phone with no problem. The only thing that's odd is that there is no displaying in my PC's browser, all I got is a dark grey image instead of what's supposed to be the synchronized displaying of my Android phone's launcher. The image looks like this:

Do you have any idea of what's wrong? Thanks for any possible solutions.
 @sorccu It's quite likely a firewall issue, but isn't it much easier for us to just open those ports that stf needed for transferring device screens? So the problem now becomes what those ports are, do you have any idea what are they? 
 I am also gating the same issue on My macbook. I have also try to off my firewall but issue is still exit . 
  I am using stf on the local server and want to map that Ip with some domain(www.something.org) locally. Is it possible that when I hit that domain locally it won't redirect to and change URL in the browser to local Ip on which it is running. What changes to make in websocket index file and cli index file to make it work.

thanks in advance.  ```

 In your project dir, input "npm install jpeg-turbo", maybe you need "--registry=https:// ???", try it and generally you are not successful at first time, try it again.
 I ran into this earlier. Turns out jpeg-turbo was failing to build due to lack of [yasm](http://yasm.tortall.net). I'd suggest using your favorite package manager to install yasm, then re-building openstf.
  npm install goes well
npm link goes well

  Add openid support which used in my company.
 This usage is some like

```
stf local --auth-type openid --auth-options '["--identifier=https://login.mycompany.com/openid/"]'
```
 Thanks very much for so detailed comment.
 Code has beed updated. The lib `passport-openid` seems less of documented, so I not decided use `openid` lib still.
 @vbanthia How about this?
 @vbanthia The question is that there is no document about how to define identifier in `passport-openid`, It seems that there is more api in `openid` rather than in `passport-openid`, I have tried with `passport-openid`, but finally give up.
 And there is also hard code in `passport-openid`

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3281689/12316854/3d3e4b4e-bac6-11e5-9e55-0220a05b0ec2.png)

If you ask me again, I will still not use that lib for now.
 @vbanthia  Is  #247 (comment) means `passport-openid` ?

  Hi guys:

I met a problem when I use stop using selected device:
1. I selected one ZTE device.
2. Install an app.
3. Stop using and reuse it.
4. I found the installed app cleaned up by stf device plugins. Other devices like XiaoMi, Huawei, Nexus don't have this problem

Please give some guidance.

Thanks
Luis
 Reset the device, this problem fixed. But it still welcome some reasons from your side.
 @vbanthia , thanks for your explanation.
But it seems current stf in my side doesn't do clean up package for most devices. Just attached log after I stop using one device:

IMP/device:plugins:group 16737 [ZTEG719C] No longer owned by "test@.com"
INF/device:plugins:group 16737 [ZTEG719C] Unsubscribing from group channel "+8mzY+tCS9eTFOeIyyuXOA=="
 Thanks for your advice.
 Hi, is it possible to disable this feature? Since testing work here in my place requires the application to run for quite a long time and we are taking parts managing them, stop using will cause the application to stop running, which is not an expected result.

Thanks!
  Someone said the Nexus 6P cannot be supported. I cannot get the real phone to test at this time or check the log.

Is anyone using Nexus 6P with STF? Thanks

Nexus 6x with Android 6.0.1 + USB Type-C works fine
  HI,

I have been trying to connect stf through its ldap Module. I am passing all the req. parametres but still not able to connect.
Below is the command 

stf local --public-ip 10.11.215.37 --auth-type ldap --auth-options '["--ldap-url","10.11.200.201","--port","3268","--ldap-search-dn"," CN=Users,DC=ibtechnology,DC=com","--ldap-bind-dn","DC=ibtechnology,DC=com","--app-url","Mail.incedoinc.com"]'

and after firing this I'm getting  follwoing error...

 HI

Can you help me what things i need to pass in search field and search scope
 Hi @sorccu 
I am getting below error while authenticating via ldap server (**got STF ldap UI**).

ERR/auth-ldap 4170 [::ffff:127.0.0.1] Unexpected error AssertionError: options.attribute (string) is required

    at /usr/local/lib/node_modules/stf/lib/util/ldaputil.js:108:12
 Hi @sorccu ,

I am running below command,

stf local --public-ip <stf_server_ip_address> --auth-type ldap --auth-options '["--ldap-url","<ldap_server_ip>","--port","ldap_port","--ldap-search-dn","CN=Users,DC=organization,DC=com","--ldap-bind-dn","DC=organization,DC=com","--app-url","organization.com"]'
 Thanks so much @sorccu. Your suggestions work for me :+1: 

stf local --auth-type ldap --auth-options '["--ldap-url","ldap://ip:port","--ldap-search-dn","OU=inner_ou,OU=inner_ou,DC=inner_dc,DC=inner_dc,DC=com","--ldap-bind-dn","CN=username,OU=inner_ou,OU=inner_ou,DC=inner_dc,DC=inner_dc,DC=com","--ldap-bind-credentials","username_actual_credential","--ldap-search-field","sAMAccountName"]'
  I get the error message:

`missing requirere argument '--secret'`

When I just add '--secret' it starts with no errors but I cant reach stf.
I used @tadesushilgithub example.
And I'am not sure what I need in  --ldap-search-field. 
Any Ideas?
 @xell66 use "--ldap-search-field","sAMAccountName" as it is if your LDAP uses Microsoft server Active Directory. If you uses master branch code base it won't ask you for --secret. Send me your command and mentioned the step how you running it?
 I tried Version 2.0.0 and also get the --secret failure. 
I'am running on Ubuntu so I gues I need to change "sAMAccountName"?  
I`am not very familiar with ldap. So I used this command:

stf local --public-ip 172.18.92.157 --auth-type ldap --auth-options '["--ldap-url","ldap://127.0.0.1:389","--ldap-search-dn","CN=iue,DC=selen","ldap-bind-dn","DC=selen","--ldap-search-field","sAMAccountName"]'

I'am also not sure about the port. I configured ldap via phpldapadmin.
@tadesushilgithub 
 Hello,
tried to run stf local with LDAP, but our ldap connecting is https
so i run connect with: 

["--ldap-url","ldaps://ip:port","--ldap-search-dn","OU=inner_ou,OU=inner_ou,DC=inner_dc,DC=inner_dc,DC=com","--ldap-bind-dn","CN=user,OU=inner_ou,OU=inner_ou,DC=inner_dc,DC=inner_dc,DC=com","--ldap-bind-credentials","password","--ldap-search-field","sAMAccountName"]

but after connecting attempt in LDAP UI i got this error:
events.js:141
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^

any help what is wrong?
 found a solution for that, my ldaps can talk with nginx by hhtps and to stf by http.
but after the Authentication, i;m rederected to work on http, and secound attempt to go to https page, results in error:

Is there a way to run all stf over https, to skip this problem?
 So has anyone an idea about the `--secret` error?  How is this argument suposed to use?
 I think for `openldap` you need to use `uid` instead of `sAMAccountName`.
At least with this config I get an incorrect login message in the gui when I use a incorrect login, but when I use a correct login I just get an empty page in the browser (about:blank) and the stf server says: 
`INF/auth-ldap 6671 [::ffff:127.0.0.1] Authenticated "undefined"`
 I figured out that the problem with the empty page resulted from the fact that my IP changed. So I used the command `stf local --public-ip 172.18.92.157 --auth-type ldap --auth-options '["--ldap-url","ldap://127.0.0.1:389","--ldap-search-dn","OU=ou1,OU=ou2,DC=dc1,DC=dc2","--ldap-bind-dn","CN=admin,DC=dc1,DC=dc2","--ldap-bind-credentials","PASSWORD","--ldap-search-field","uid"]'`
I still can reach STF despite the fact that I used a wrong IP. But I needed to use the url `PCNAME:7100/aut/ldap/`

Anyways I still have the problem that I get this error when I "successfully" login.

```
INF/auth-ldap 11940 [::ffff:127.0.0.1] Authenticated "undefined"

Is maybe something wrong with my LDAP structure?
 Has no one an idea what could be wrong? I tried a lot of configurations with my LDAP Server but nothing worked.
 Your suggestion worked. Thank you!
The User Object has to have the ObjectClass `inetOrgPerson`, then it is possible to add an email adress.
 Hi guys, 
I have one simply question: before using STF‘s ldap module, should I deploy the ldap service?  I am writing the client script to control the minitouch, so I need a sample, thanks. 
 Could you show me a single nodejs file which can control the minitouch, I am not familiar with the nodejs coding. The index.js is too complicated for me.
  Thank you for your excellent system first.
We need to test on more than 100 handsets and can we upload and install apk in one time?Can we test on all device connected by operating on one device and others are doing the same operation?
 Hi @sorccu , Is there any solution in stf 2.0.0 to install apk for all devices in one time?
 Thanks @vbanthia , I will try.
  I have found that the stf doesn't support the windows system, yet I want to make sure this question again, thanks.
 openSTF has a docker solution. You can install DockerToolbox in windows and use their docker image to run openSTF. Just a workaround I could think of.
 I guess I've almost managed to get this running. There is just one small issue I am facing as pointed out here https://github.com/sorccu/node-jpeg-turbo/issues/8 I would love to send an update to the documentation pointing out installation instructions for windows once the issue with `jpeg-turbo` is resolved. That is the only issue i've been facing.

 It's possible to install stf on Windows 10 using "Windows Subsystem for Linux", It's not exactly what you want but it's a quick and dirty solution.

Screenshot:
![screen shot 2017-07-01 at 9 48 01 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/588431/27759460-815af694-5e42-11e7-8ffa-f78dc057b256.png)
 I'm going to see if I can use the install script from the devs and the subsystem. If it works I'll be beyond over the moon, since the docker "solution" requires Windows 10 PRO...Home edition doesn't have Hyper V.

[edit]
NVM on the script, it needs docker (I didn't read it through). Guess I'll have to do it manually.  I hava written a python script to call minitouch socket server, but i came with the problem below, it seems like the heads of the request is wrong.

  Is there a any way to open a URL in a particular browser on multiple devices, without doing this once for each device — either programatically or via the UI?

For example, I'd like to be able to open a page on all devices in Chrome, then switch all devices to open the same page in Firefox.

(BTW — thanks for STF! Very useful and easy to set up.)
 Thanks for the `cc` suggestion.

Always happy to help out with WebRTC questions :)! Email me at dutton@google.com or raise an issue here. 
 Hey @sorccu — meant to ask: could you give some more detail about how you're using WebRTC for STF?
  I have a issues with your  branch, i am testing your rest api is working fine but at same time i get a problem wiht the gui from stf, the user interface don't start  give errors missing modules or can't locate some of them.
 @vbanthia 

Hey I tried to build my own version of stf (cloned this repo) with the API enabled. However when I try to access the API I get a 302 response redirecting me to /auth/mock and I can't access the API... Since the tool is behind an internal VPN it's fine to not have to authenticate and use the mock version. But I can't access the API, what can I do?
The server is running with `stf -local`
Below you'll find the logs from the request I made through curl. Hope you can help me.

 @vbanthia 

I ran stf -V and it returned 2.0.0 so I guess I am running from the correct branch.
 @vbanthia @dhartwich1991 

I hit the same problem @dhartwich1991 did.  The problem was that I had not looked at the changes to the deployment guide, so I didn't have nginx set up, or the api service running.

Is it possible that when running "stf local" that it isn't starting the api service, and nginx isn't configured correctly?

Also, I've found some issues with the deployment document.   The same stf-api@.service appears to tells you to run "stf app", instead of "stf api".   However, once you change it to "stf api" (and set your secret), the "stf api" command complains that there isn't a "--connect-sub" or "--connect-push" parameter provided.

I'm not sure which socket "stf api" wants to connect to, but when I try either 7170 or 7270 for the "--connect-push" and then attempt to query the devices endpoint, the docker for "stf api" terminates with no log messages.   (I may need to crank up the logging level, that is the next thing I am going to look in to.)

So, the deployment doc probably needs to be updated a little bit to account for these issues.  (Unless I am doing everything wrong, which is entirely possible!)

BTW - @vbanthia Thanks for doing this!  It'll make my integration with Jenkins a _LOT_ easier!  (I am planning on looking in to what is involved in building a Jenkins plugin to work with these patches.)
 @vbanthia 
I tried port 7270 for the push, and 7250 for the sub, and managed to query the devices endpoint!   (So, anyone else struggling with this should use those ports to get everything working.)
 @vbanthia - I've been working on a small Jenkins plugin, but hit an issue with the API.  When I try to add a device to a user, I keep getting back a 504 response with the JSON '{"success":false,"description":"Device is not responding"}'.

From looking at the logs for the API docker, I don't see any error messages when I run the query.  So, it is unclear what the problem might be.

FWIW - This happens with both curl and my Java code.   The command I am using is  : 

curl -v -X POST --header "Content-Type:application/json" --data '{"serial":"HT254W302991"}' -H "Authorization: Bearer ea06b6215c844409bdee5cfb970dcee8a702e72c67e1461492576b84c4749114" http://192.168.64.56/api/v1/user/devices

(And, yes, I am really running it over http, not https.  I know there are some issues with that, but I have not had a chance to rebuild my test environment yet.  I'll probably start on that today, in case it helps with this issue.)

FWIW - I'll post this over on the Google group as well, just in case this discussion isn't monitored.
 Hi @vbanthia -

Per your suggestion, I moved my development from my own home-grown interface to the API to the swagger generated Java class.   Seems like it will be easier to maintain in the long run.

I moved my setup over to using HTTPS to try to rule that out as a problem.   However, the issue still remains.   If I use the web interface I am able to claim a device and even control it as expected.  So, I either have something messed up in my setup (wouldn't be the first time), or there is a bug in the API.

I'm going to spend an hour or two trying to dig in to the API code and see if I can figure out what is going on, but if you have any thoughts on things I can check, I would appreciate it.

If I manage to figure out what is going on, I'll post a follow-up here.

Thanks again for your work!  It is appreciated!
 Hi @vbanthia -

I am completely at a loss as to what is going on.  I set up a local OpenSTF on my development machine, and was able to access the device over the API even though I couldn't actually use it through the UI.   But, on the set up that I have where I can use devices through the UI, I can't access the devices.

On the set up that times out trying to take control of a device, I tried changing the time out in the code you linked to.  I set it to 30 seconds, figuring that should be more than enough for a response, even if everything is running really slowly.   The end result is still the same.   (Except now I have to wait 30 seconds for it to happen.)

When I access devices through the UI, there isn't any noticeable lag, so it doesn't seem that lag is the issue.   It seems more like the response that the API is waiting for isn't getting where it is supposed to go.  

Since I was just guessing as to how the API hooked in to everything else, is it possible that I got something hooked up wrong?  (i.e. Are the ports not 7270 and 7250?)

The only other thing I can think of that could be a problem is that the devices are connected to one machine, and the rest of the OpenSTF processes run on another machine.  (The machine with the devices has the adb and provider service running.)   But, that seems like a dead end too since the UI is working.

Is there any kind of verbose debugging that I can turn on to try to track down what is failing?   Or is there anything else you can think of that might be a problem?

Thanks!
 @fbatogo @vbanthia 
Somehow I don't really get if I am doing everything right in order to start up the API service, on what port it is running etc. could you be so kind to give me a short list on how to start up the service correctly keeping the stf local etc.

Currently we do: 
`~/stf/bin/stf local --public-ip 172.31.10.33`

and:

`rethinkdb` 

what else needs to be called in order to get access to the API, please help me out since I never worked with Docker / node before and I don't know how to get started :(
 @vbanthia - No worries.  I've done a fair bit of open source in the past, so I don't expect you guys to work on the weekends or do anything too wildly special for me.   Which is why I am mostly asking for enough help to hopefully figure out the issue and post back here what it was.  Knowing how to enable more verbose logging would be REALLY helpful, as I have found it kinda hard to debug issues with OpenSTF.  (Which may well be a comment on me not understanding the technology as anything. ;)

@dhartwich1991 -

I'm not sure that the order you start the various services matters much.   However, I do always try to start up rethinkdb before starting anything else since it seems to be the core of everything.

If you are trying to start OpenSTF using the "local" command, you don't really need to know anything about docker.  (That said, when I started with OpenSTF I was a total docker n00b.  I spent a little bit of time trying to understand docker a bit more, and was surprised at how handy it is.   One thing that messed me up was a belief that docker was something akin to a VM.  In reality, it is more akin to a chroot environment.   Once I understood that, things started to make a fair bit more sense!)

I suspect the problem you are running in to has to do with following the instructions on Github to get OpenSTF running.   This will work just fine, but you will end up with an OpenSTF instance that doesn't contain the API functionality.   You can verify that pretty easily using two different methods.  One is to run "stf -V" and make sure it outputs "2.0.0".   The other is to run "stf --help" and look in the output to see if there is a line that says "api [options]             start api" in the help output.   If the version isn't 2.0.0, and the "api" module isn't listed in the help output, then you aren't running the branch that has the API functionality.

I would bet that there is a better way to do this, but I basically downloaded the 2.0.0 branch to a directory and then copied it over the files that were downloaded using the instructions from the GitHub instruction page.  (For me, the downloaded version of OpenSTF ended up in the /usr/local/lib/node_modules/stf directory.)   You will probably want to make a backup of that directory before you overwrite the files.   Also note that when I did this, I was able to get the API working, but I had some issues with the devices being accessible through the UI.   For my needs at the time, this wasn't an issue, but it may be for you.   That said, I suspect that the bulk of my problem with the UI came from the fact that I had some development processes on my machine that were also using adb to talk to the device.   So, you may not have any problems, but YMMV.
 After MUCH mucking around, I finally figured out that the problem I was running in to is that I actually had the ports wrong.  (Seems odd that it half way works when the ports are wrong.  And that there doesn't seem to be any error messages when they are wrong either.)

For the --connect-push, I had to use 7170.  For the --connect-sub, I had to use 7150.   So, my stf-api@.service file ends up looking like this : 

[Unit]
Description=STF api
After=rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service
BindsTo=rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/etc/environment
TimeoutStartSec=0
Restart=always
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/docker pull openstf/stf:v2.0.0-beta

ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm \
  --name %p-%i \
  --link rethinkdb-proxy-28015:rethinkdb \
  -e "SECRET=<your secret>" \
  -p %i:3000 \
  stfapi/chris \
  stf api --port 3000 \
  --connect-push tcp://<your server ip>:7170 \
  --connect-sub tcp://<your server ip>:7150
ExecStop=-/usr/bin/docker stop -t 10 %p-%i

Hopefully this helps someone else!
 How to use this API? Can I use API with having default authentication with local STF? When I do curl I will get request is redirect to mock URL. Please help on this.
 You mean that, I need to install STF 2.0.0. Is this STF new release? I went through same link.

 @tadesushilgithub 

I don't believe the 2.0.0 branch is a full release yet.   So, you do have to do things a little different to get it up and running.  However, if you look at my comments above, and use the documentation included in the new branch, it isn't too hard to get going.

And, yes, it should work fine with a local STF.  I debugged my Jenkins plug-in using a local STF.

If you need a stable release, you'll probably want to wait for the official release.
 I am getting error while running command  **npm install stf@2.0.0-beta**

> npm ERR! Error: version not found: stf@2.0.0-beta
 @tadesushilgithub 
version 2.0.0-beta is not present in npm, you have to remove the "-beta".
Just try `npm install stf@2.0.0` 
This should work

  Hi

I m trying to figure out the auth module which is mock by default. now i want to change it to ldap and connect it to my ldap server. So could you  please help in finding the file in which i need to perform changes.
 Thanks For your quick reply. Let me try with oAuth & with Ldap.
  We are considering allow user to do factory reset and after that keep the device online without human interface.
Could the devices just run a script after reboot to open the USB debug mode?  
Thanks. 
 Yeah, that is so important. Do you have an any idea @sorccu ? Here is the script I use to do that:
https://gist.github.com/phhusson/3d1e8833309dc34ee5502a409b80e292
You need to give it a blank userdata.img, or the userdata.img provided by your OEM,
This has been tested on various devices, ranging from 5.1 to 7.1, either AOSP-based, or MTK based.
For Spreadtrum-based, some firmwares won't allow this to work. (I have some modifications to work-around that, but they break other things) Yup this requires oem unlocked device obviously, but there is no check of a signature or anything for userdata partition.
There is some encryption (which would do the signature actually), but if the partition is not encrypted, the device will just encrypt it on first boot. (That's why the partsize leaves 200MB left, some place is needed to leave encryption information), so it is fine in this case.

It is possible it won't work for FBE devices, but I don't have a FBE-by-default device to check   That's a good idea. The Wugfresh tool kit is great for rooting Nexus devices. However the tool kit is only for windows at the moment. The link says Linux users can use an app called Wine to run the root software on linux. It would also be cool if you could send the rooting commands through the STF

  Hi,

I'm trying to setup dev environment with STF and after following all the installation steps, start of the DB with "sudo rethinkdb", "sudo adb start-server" and then "sudo stf local" I still receive this error in the console:

I would like to ask does STF support Nexus 5 and arm ABI? How could I fix that?
 Thanks, now it works fine.
  my Setup was relatively effordless with instructions from here:
https://gist.github.com/pvsune/a2122369f91d2a518271

everything worked fine in my Virtual Box with Ubuntu 14.04.3-desktop-amd64 to the point of installing stf itself.

i do 'npm install -g stf'
-> works nicely
i go into stf in npm-modules 
i do 'npm install'
=> stf is vanished from modules and i can't do the last part with bower and npm link
Please help me. I would love to show stf to my QA team.

greetings Markus
 Host OS is Windows 7 64bit, I'll try again from scratch.
 is there a gist i can use?
 or would you provide a working virtualbox image for testing purposes?
 tyring to install the whole thing for two days now, always errors. rethinkdb works fine, but stf doesn't start
 I'll do as you recommended before, start from scratch and put the whole error output here. Will be some time till I'm there. Maybe tomorrow. Thx in advance.
 Started from scratch with instructions:https://gist.github.com/pvsune/a2122369f91d2a518271
just used sudo npm install -g stf
then started rethinkdb (which works fine)
the started stf with "stf local" command

Anybody who know the possible reason ?
 @sorccu Can you help me ?
 Yes, sorry for that.
1. I use `adb connect` remote debug phone
2. yes, on the same machine, and when i run `adb connect`, the STF seems find the phone but report `due to heartbeat timeout` soon
3. yes, when i run `adb devices`, i see `offline`
 I am not sure if this Attachment describes your scenario (LiufxLucky365). But I am seeing offline on Web UI (localhost) when I still have device connected and File Transfer mode on device.

Any feedback is good : 
If you know why am i seeing this and How do i resolve this?  I've been experiencing the same kind of issue, BUT, only with Motorola phones. Most of them is running on Android 6.0.*. At the same nodes I'm having no issues with phones from other brands (Samsung, LG, ...). The device has its status changed to "Preparing" and after a few seconds, it goes offline again.  good
 good job!
 I am trying to access the API but is redirecting always to http://localhost:7100/auth/mock/
I started stf in 2.0.0 branch and im running it locally. The authorization token is in the request.
I have tried the following endpoints:
http://localhost:7100/app/api/v1/devices
http://localhost:7100/api/v1/devices
http://localhost:7100/api/v1/swagger.json
But I always get the redirection.
 Is this part of some known issue?
 Its working! I wasnt using v2.0.0 after all. I am testing the api with calabash and a ruby script.
 Hi All,

I am very poor at coding. I am working on appium with Pom in Java . I want to run appium test cases parallel on stf. Please provide me the step by step setup of appium on stf parallel.
  I can not install apk and the console shows following error:

Thanks.
 Thank you for the answer. I have tried many different apk packages and all have the same error. I also tried the released old version of STF. Still the same problem. Do you think does it relate to my local file system or the npm dependency of the APKreader? Thanks.

  I just want to close the connect between stf and phone from web page or api. what should i do?
 i dont want to stop using, what i want is to close the connect and free 5555 port. how can i do that :(
  Hi,

at first, I'am writing my master thesis about remote controlling a smartphone for a german automotive company and we're amazed how capable your solution is compared to the other solutions there are considering they all cost a lot of money.
Especially your capabilities for manual testing! They are miles better then every solution I looked into. Maybe we are missing one or two features but the rest ist amazing. It could happen that we will try to develop them in house and we are willing to share them with you. Right now I'am evaluating this scenario and calculating the possible costs for one or two small features and a big feature like Appium integration or iOS support. I wil discuss my results with my higher ups and can give you a feedback if you want to.

Right now we're testing your solution with serveral employees who are doing manuel application test for one of our costumers. We got a very postive feedback. 

But there is one big issue. I don't know if it's a problem with our hubs (the plugable hubs are ordered) or if it's a bug:

Every time we want to take a screenshot with "right click" on the screen and "Save Screenshot" the screen freezes and we must refresh the page to control the smartphone again. Is it a known bug or is it a problem on our configuration. 

We're running STF on a ubuntu server on a ESXi host with stf version 1.0.10.
I can't see any errors in the server logs.

Oh and I actually talked to the CTO of Testobject and he mentioned he was/is in touch with you guys. For more information we may write a personal message.

Thank you for your amazing work and your help!

Kind regards

 Hi,

thank you for your quick responses.

We will definitly integrate your solution into our test infrastructure.
Just to give you a short idea what we're doing:
We're a automotive engineering company working for nearly every big car manufactor worldwide. We have several departments which are specialized on testing only the car infotainment systems (contains the navigationssystem, radio, multimedia, connectivity of the vehicle, whole speedometer unit etc.). We also developing mobile applications which are interacting with the car infotainment systems. Also there is a lot of work for us to do with interfaces like Android Auto, Apple Car Play, Mirrorlink, VW Appconnect .... With these interfaces the smartphone will be deeply integrated in the electronics of the car. That means a immense testing effort. Furthermore we have a lot of interoperability (IOP) tests between smartphones and the infotainmentsystems. Not only for bluetooth, also for WLAN, USB-Connection, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and so on. Therefor we often need 100+ different devices per test.

The main unit of the infotainment system (mainly it is the big screen where the sat nav sits) is running a operating system pretty similar to a normal computer. That means there are different software releases, updates and versions which are depending on which system you selected buying you car and which car you got. Some of them are highly modular and you get the same system from different manufacturer without even noticing :).

Ideally we would like to have a second way to connect the smartphone to your STF solution. Not USB, we're looking for someting like ADB Wireless. For some test cases (Android Auto, Mirrorlilnk) we need to connect the phones via USB to the infotainment system. 

We have 5 features we're missing right now:
1.) iOS support
2.) direct access to the file system of an Android Phone (For some test cases we need to put some dummy data into some folders. It would be nice if we could do that remotly)
3.) Video capturing a test run
4.) Appium support (test automation)
5.) A second way to connect a Smartphone to STF (maybe ADB Wireless will work)

Goal of my thesis was to get a remote control into our company network. Therefor I looked into many different solutions (f.e. TestObject, Experitest, Keynote .....). And for manual testing you got by far the best solution for us an we will start using your software in the future. Right now we're testing it with only a small team. But we're looking forward to work with you.

Right now we're in the process of checking if we could share the features we may develop in the future. But it's looking good.
We're planning to develop features in house through bachelor and or master theses and we definitly want to cooperate and share with you.

It would be nice if we could talk about our cooperation via mail. 
Please feel free to contact me:  felix.hahn@iav.de

Right now we're doing some manual testing for different android application on STF and we must take screeshots from every HMI error we detect. The best practice for us is to use this screenshot feature. Unfortunaly the Screenshot task in your dashboard forgets all the saved screenshots when switching into another task. Maybe I should also report this as a bug.

I did read all these issues and like the ideas which are behind these approaches.

Kind regards

  If I change the source code. Can I just create my own docker image by running 'docker build -t myname/stf:dev .' based on your Dockfile? 

Thanks. 
  When I using "adb connect“ to a Visual Studio Emulator for Android,the micap,minitouch can be installed and run, and when I slide,the emulator slide normal, but the screen on the dashborad is always black.
Can you tell me the reason?If I use Genymotion,will it work?
Thx.
  I used IntelliJ to connect to the phone which is plugging in other computer which is running STF locally with public IP. 
All debugging processes are slow including loading frames, loading variables and loading the Threads. Every step into or  step over hit will take about 5-6 seconds to load data.
Do you have any clue about which part limit the speed of remote debugging? It is very smooth to debug APP locally with real phone.
Thanks. 
 Same with Eclipse debugging
  Hi, i find the [id].[hash].chunk.js file is very large, about 4M, are there any options in stf to make it smaller?
 I'll take a look are there any solution or improvement about this issue ? have you solved the file size problem so far ?  Such like adding a shake button on control panel. When click the button, it will trigger out the acceleration transducer to achieve shake function on the real phone.

We can also add tilt left and tilt right buttons.

Do you have some clues about how to do this? Thanks.
  The STF is running locally by --public-ip xxx
When my other PC connect to it if I am using proxy, the control panel is grey all the time and the log shows "Device database does not have a match for device xxx"
And this situation also happened when I connect STF from other area network's PC. (Of course they are in the same LAN because I can connect to STF, but the Control panel failed)
I think it could be the rethinkdb connection problem under proxy because the STF service works fine. 
Can I get rethinkdb work when I using proxy?
Thanks.  
 @vbanthia 
Thanks for your reply. Do you mean the ports on PC which running the stf local? I think both my server PC and client PC have those ports open because it works fine when I close my proxy setting. Does it relate to the proxy server's ports?

I will check the WebSocket connections. Thanks.
  Hi guys,

I connected to a device and see "10.xx.xx.xx:7409" in remote debug tab, and I run "adb connect 10.xx.xx.xx:7409". It says "connected to 10.xx.xx.xx:7409", but I run "adb devices" I can't see this device. I also can't find it in my android studio? 

Please give some help, thanks.

B.R.
Luis
 STF local running in one machine. 
One user login from another machine to connect this device and do the remote debug. Then he stop using this machine.(ADB key not removed?)
Another user login from third machine to connect this device  and want to debug, but after he run "adb connect 10.xx.xx.xx:7409", key can't pops up and can't find this device.
But I return to the first user and remove the key, use second user to login again and run "adb connect 10.xx.xx.xx:7409", key pops up and it works.

Can you help and fix this issue? Once user stop using this machine and remove the adb key?
 Second user don't have key, no add keys dialog pops up after he run "adb connect 10.xx.xx.xx:7409".
 @sorccu 
You said , Is stf local running on the same machine as Android Studio?
stf local and Android Studio run on the same machine will cause error ?

  I have installed docker and pulled the image from the docker hub. 
Now i am confused what to do next?
Do i need to install all the requirements explicitly on my ubuntu machine including rethinkdb ?
I have also tried to ref. to the solution given by you but you have mentioned there to see the deployment file, which makes me confused to understand difference between stf local and actual deployment.

Can you please help me.
 HI 

Thanks for your reply.

Yes i am reading coreos in the meanwhile i have installed docker on ubuntu 14.04 lts and trying to get the things done.

I have also tried the "Mitesh Shah" method , by that i am able to create the tables in the db but i am getting an error of  stf device. Can you help me in this

 Hi,

Thanks the system is up on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS single machine and now I'm exploring it.
But yes the best thing would be to setup the production environment using core os.
  my device sometimes does not work and the server gives the following message, util i restart stf . anybody can give me a hand?

  Hi , i am mad on remote debug recently 
i find that eclipse "run as" runs very well but eclipse "debug as" just a little slow. but i think the data for debuging is smaller than the screen data from minicap , so how can "debug as" be so slow ?
  When i press screenshot button press disconnect stf server connection.

  my adb server and STF is in different host, can i use this option to set the adb server ? 

``` shell
stf local -R  --adb-host 172.18.146.123 
```

and on my 172.18.146.123 host, i run

``` shell
adb kill-server && adb start-server
```

but STF report

``` shell
Unhandled rejection Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 172.18.146.123:5037
    at Object.exports._errnoException (util.js:874:11)
    at exports._exceptionWithHostPort (util.js:897:20)
    at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (net.js:1063:14)
```

anybody who knows where am i wrong ? Thanks
 This is because stf is not able to connect adb host server. By default adb server listen only on localhost. In order to make it a remote host you must have to make it listen on all network interfaces.

Start adb server with below command

```
adb kill-server      # Just to make sure
adb -a -P 5037 fork-server server&
```

And restart stf using the same command, `stf local -R  --adb-host 172.18.146.123`. It should work.
  I want to update the STF UI Theme, hide some button or some useless module for me. But when i change some jade file, and restart STF, i found it doesn't work. 

What's more, does STF use some build tool? i see the build directory, how to rebuild STF?

Thanks
 I haven't used this two tools before, i install gulp through `npm install gulp` and in the stf derctory run common `gulp clean`, it reports this error

``` shell
[10:03:25] No gulpfile found
```

this is my directory

i install stf through `npm install stf`, why i miss the file gulpfile ?
 yes, your answer is helpful for me, thank you.

But when i run `gulp clean`, report many module miss error, now i just `npm install` them one by one. I think there must be some auto install scripts?

I read the stf document again, and found what i need, thank you, i think my bad english is now my big problem .....

 @hemant4524 anyupdate on issue but nothing display in browser (http://localhost:7100/auth/mock/)
 I solve this problem following the commands
1.brew install zeromq
it will solve can not find libzmq problem when just run npm install zmq
2.npm install zmq
  indexWait does not report actual availability of index form query so we need to use actual query to verify an index is actually ready.

We need to process simple indexes (index with no indexFunction option) first before processing the complex indexes (which may be dependent to simple indexes).

I installed all module and run ./stf local in mac os X give me above error.
 Can you provide me for installation video tutorial for mac os?
  Hi,

We would like to know how to setup a development environment.
We searched in your documentations and didn't find how to run STF from the source code.
How can we modify the source code and deploy the changes?

Thanks.
 Thanks, we had an error during the npm install and we missed it.
  I am running STF locally on my Windows 7 and linked to remote rethinkdb on other Linux VM. Everything works fine except no English word shown in Chrome. But when I set it to Japanese or Russian, it shows properly. Could you please give me some hints about solving this problem? I am thinking if it relates to Jade. Thanks.
 Does anyone try to connect STF from Chrome on Win 7? I got no English Support only Japanese and Russian. And also I got nothing shown from IE on Win 7. Local Linux Firefox could work. I start STF by using: stf local --public-ip xxx on my Linux and try to connect it from other Win 7. Thanks. 
 Thank you for your reply.

My environment is Windows 7 (Version 6.1.7601) with  Chrome 43.0.2357.132

By the way the system is running on a virtual machine, I think it relates to the problem since my PC with Windows works fine also. 

I am sorry for the inconvenient that I cannot upload screenshot since I am in company network. The browser just cannot show all the English words, but other pictures and functions just works fine.

Thanks. 
 @vbanthia Thank for your help. But it still can not fix the bug.
@gunta I have tried to disabled all extensions but still not work. Thanks anyway. The Firefox works fine in my environment. It should be caused by some setting problems of my Chrome.
 I finally figured it out. Deleted the Lato from font-family worked for me. Thanks all.
 @gunta Yes. Sorry for the delay reply

env:    ubuntu 16,04   (vmware)  Hi, i am really amazing about the remote debug feature and i wonder how it works?
the data transferred from websocket or tcp socket?
can you just give me some explanations? thank you very much!
 if i want to use this feature through nginx, do i need to set tcp proxy?
 For remote debugging you can read the google official docs first, especially the port [forwarding section](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging)

And what do you mean by "use this feature through nginx"...Do you mean you want to deploy stf on real server (not run locally), and the web container you use is nginx? Then you will need a lot of public ip for this.

By the way...

> Hi, i am really amazing about the remote debug feature 

Generally you should not say you are amazing...it is the feature that is amazing.
  Hi. I met a bug. I had used latest version of openstf/stf in dockerfiles.
When I updated `openstf/stf:latest`, our journalctl shows below.

```
systemd[1]: Started STF dev triproxy.
docker[21135]: INF/triproxy 1 [dev] PUB socket bound on tcp://*:7250
docker[21135]: INF/triproxy 1 [dev] DEALER socket bound on tcp://*:7260
docker[21135]: INF/triproxy 1 [dev] PULL socket bound on tcp://*:7270
docker[21135]: Invalid argument (tcp.cpp:121)
systemd[1]: stf-triproxy-dev.service: main process exited, code=exited, status=139/n/a
```

And I checked `docker ps`, then stf-triproxy-dev rescheduled many times.
I found an issue and Pull Request related to the error.
https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/109 https://github.com/openstf/stf/commit/b248e96dc2582f0176b3a75468fa18ab0036c3e1
Also, I assume that these codes are something bad for my environment.
https://github.com/JustinTulloss/zeromq.node/blob/master/lib/index.js#L324

My environment is Ubuntu 15.04, and zeromq libraries are

```
ii  libzmq1:amd64                       2.2.0+dfsg-6                        amd64        lightweight messaging kernel (shared library)
rc  libzmq3:amd64                       4.0.5+dfsg-2+deb8u1build0.15.04.1   amd64        lightweight messaging kernel (shared library)
ii  libzmq5:amd64                       4.1.2-1                             amd64        lightweight messaging kernel (shared library)

```

Now I have changed from `openstf/stf:latest` to `openstf/stf:1.0.10` in all dockerfiles related to openstf, instead.

Thanks.
 >  It's included in the docker image.

Thanks. I use docker with service files in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

I checked #104 yesterday before I post this. Also, I have removed all docker images yesterday, and pulled newest docker images. Of course I also killed all systemd processes (services) about this system.
 #104 made 13 days ago from now, but something odd to me because I made my STF environment yesterday. That's why I posted this Issue.

Thankfully, now I can see both you guys are checking this issue, and zeromq.
I will report after fixing bug with `openstf/stf:latest`.
  lib/units/provider/index.js
function spawn(){
var allocatedPorts = ports.splice(0, 2)
          , proc = options.fork(device, allocatedPorts)
          , resolver = Promise.defer()
...
}
after options.fork(...), allocatedPorts become empty, so that the allocated ports can not be returned.
to fix it, we should pass value of allocatedPorts, not its reference.
 proc = options.fork(device, allocatedPorts.slice())
 another issue:
some times the .finally() block in spawn() function is not executed.
I  moved the .finally() block after .catch() block, the .finally() block "finally" executed. 
I am not sure this is a bug in bluebird.
 Still have the same problem especially for Android 6.0 devices. 
I have 8 devices connected and four Android 6.0 devices met this problem after about 1 day. I can only restart the service to fix this error. Any idea to fix this? Thanks
 Thank you for your reply.
I am using ODROID-XU4 with Odroid([Ubuntu 15.04](http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:xu3_ubuntu_release_note_20150710))
The power adapter is 5V 4A
DIPO USB HUB 2.0 12V 5A adapter. 2A X 10 2.0 ports
The uname -a information is blow:
Linux odroid 3.10.82-39 #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Jul 10 17:12:32 BRT 2015 armv7l armv7l armv7l GNU/Linux
So you think maybe USB  connection caused this problem?
 I also have an other XU4 with the same system and connected 9 devices with the same USB Hub.
All the Android devices seem work fine for about a week and the only different is the XU4 don't have Android 6.0 connected. So I am not sure this is the kernel problem. Hope you could find this is kernel problem or not. 
Right now restarting service cannot solve the problem and there are two devices always show 
error missing required argument --screen-port
Since I am not at the same place with phones I cannot re plug it. And the adb devices show normally
 And also all the devices have flashed new ROM and rooted. They are using unofficial cables.
 Thank you for your advice. 

I have tracked devices and it seems not adb problem. I found the --screen-port error always shown on journalctl -u mystf.service, even I stop the service, so that I reboot all the servers and restart STF services. 

It is turned out the same error as #108 and #95. I am using the latest master code and tried three Android 6.0 devices, two of them have the error, the other one is fine. And also one Android 5.0 system has the same issue,too. I just checked all your commits relate to get compatibility for Android 6.0 and found issues under openstf minicap that some devices have error with the minicap. I am not sure why those error devices were successful the first time and got error after one day.  

Is this reason caused the problem and could you give me some debug hint about get compatibility for those "special" devices?

Sorry for bothering you again. Very appreciate.
 @sorccu 
This problem caused by unstable USB cable... Thank you for your help.
  I check the code and i need to set my own JWT token, but i don't know where to get the STF's secret or set my own secret.

the code is here
https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/app/middleware/auth.js#L10
 thanks, i use wrong option before
  # Overview

This feature provide optional storage type using Amazon S3.
# How to use

Add storage type option to launch arguments.

```
stf local --storage-type s3 --storage-options '["--bucket", "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME", "--endpoint", "ENDPOINT", "--profile", "YOUR_PROFILENAME"]'
```

Replace YOUR_BUCKET_NAME with your bucket name. Bucket name is required parameter. And replace ENDPOINT with S3 endpoint.  It wil use Tokyo region endpoint by default.  Replace YOUR_PROFILENAME with your credential profile name. It will refer 'stf-storage' by default. 
## Details and examples

Please refer wiki page.
[[https://github.com/hogehoge-banana/stf/wiki/%5Bja%5DUse-AmazonS3]]

Thanks.
 Hi sorccu

Thanks for check my PR. I'll fix them and another PR. There are some related comments.

Thanks.
Best
 Ah yes. My mean, Your comment is related to "booking" PR.
 Hi, sorccu

I fixed for comments. Please check them again.

Thanks.
Best
 It still works. Great! Thanks.
  Dear all

I have my own user database, how can i access STF with my own information ? 
 I find i don't describe right what i really want.

What i want to realize is not sign in from STF with mock-auth or ldap-auth, but let users be login state with my user database.

so users of my platform can access to the STF control page directly and the STF also know the device is used by whom.

I just don't want that when i redirect my logined users to the STF control page they have to sign in again.

@sorccu Please help me when you have time, thank you.
 ok, I finally get what you mean, i use JWT realize what i want, thank you all the same!
  Dear all:

I try to use STF in my platform, I want to read the devices' state from rethinkdb real time, and parse the device's serial, then jump to the phone control page directly.

The state i want to get is :
1. when the device is disconnected
2. when the device is connected, but preparing STF service
3. when the device is connected, but being used
4. when the device is connected, and is free

But i don't know which field ?

 I have another platform, and I want to display the devices' state which are connected to STF in my platform, and users can choose the device which can be used, and jump to the STF's control page directly.

But, the problem is, when i read the device from rethinkdb the STF use, I find i can't know which device is connected and which can be used.

Thanks. I have no choice, but using a remote device, perhaps the device number is about 400.
 That code run in server ? I insert some debug code like:

``` javascript
function sync(data) {
      console.log('+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++');
      // usable IF device is physically present AND device is online AND
      // preparations are ready AND the device has no owner or we are the
      // owner
      data.usable = data.present && data.status === 3 && data.ready &&
        (!data.owner || data.using)

      // Make sure we don't mistakenly think we still have the device
      if (!data.usable || !data.owner) {
        data.using = false
      }

      EnhanceDeviceService.enhance(data)
    }
```

but i have not seen any output in my server console.

when do the function sync run ?

Thanks again.
 i find what i need from the console output:

I can see the new device's life cycle. So i think i can insert hook code in the nodejs's server side, write these in a DB, so i can share the devices' state with my platform. Do you think this plan can be realized ?

Do you have another better ? 

sorry for disturb you so much....
 Can you describe more detail ? I just try some ways, but i don't know when and where the function sync execute.

I have not used nodejs before, please forgive my stupid question. 
 The JSON i posted ? i think your mean is that i insert some code into the function sync, so when the client side sync the device state to the server, it also sync the state to my own platform. is it right ?

can you tell me when the function sync execute ?
 Yes ! Perfect, this is what i really want. I understand what you mean. Thank you so much !

owner   : 'not null' if device has been used;
ready    : false if device is preparing ( may installing STF);
present : i see it always true...is it right ?
status   : i see it always 3

do i describe right ?
 Thanks, you are a so nice man. Thanks for your help, thanks.
  I want to run STF as a daemon in my server, but i don't see any right option in the help.
  Device List has a "Notes" column. I don't know what was the real intention behind this feature, but I can say it will be good to write notes or remarks for a device. 

Currently, it is only ReadOnly and there is no way to update this from STF UI. Only way is to update DB directly.

Can you tell me what was the real intention behind this column? And is there any plan to make it editable?
 Hi. I use this column as the place where I put the device in real.
I wrote how to update using RQL and you can use it if you needed.

Go to your Rethinkdb Admin Tool -> Data Explorer -> Run below RQL.
Change your own model and notes as you like!
if you have same model, change the filter.

```
r.do(
  r.db("stf").table("devices").filter({model: "SC-02C"}).update({"notes": "A1"}),
  r.db("stf").table("devices").filter({model: "SC-05G"}).update({"notes": "A2"}),
  r.db("stf").table("devices").filter({model: "SC-06D"}).update({"notes": "A3"}),
  r.db("stf").table("devices").filter({model: "Nexus 7"}).update({"notes": "B1"})
)
```
 In my case, I don't want to give users direct DB access thats why I was looking for some way to edit it from STF UI itself.

BTW, instead of using filters, you should use primaryKey to get a device which is device serial for "devices" table (https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/db/tables.js#L29). 

```
r.db("stf").table("devices").get('DEVICE_SERIAL').update({notes: "A1"})
```
 ah, i could understand well. thank you for your nice filter. :+1: 
 Pull request regarding this feature - https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/147
  This was very helpful!  I try to let my STF server connect to a remote rethinkdb, but I have not found the right option. Everybody who knows that ? 

Thanks.
 Yes, thanks. I just find that. 

Another small question, if i change the nodejs code under '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/stf/', and restart the STF, do the change code work ?

Thanks.
 Thanks for your help.

and i start stf like this:

``` shell
    export RETHINKDB_PORT_28015_TCP='tcp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:9901'
    stf local --allow-remote

    FTL/db 2690 [*] Could not connect to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:9901, operation timed out.
```

but it seems that stf doesn't connect successfully. Have you ever try this feature ?
 That should be what you say. I change my port to 8999, and local can connect successfully. 

Thanks for your help.
  Hi, I have tried other Android based mobile systems like EMUI 3.0 and MIUI 6, but failed to connect. Have you considered support other Android based systems before? Could you please give me some hints about how to support them? Thanks. 
 Hi, thank you for your reply. I have figured it out that on my EMUI device, I need to accept a service manually on my phone and it worked. But I don't have to do it on my Galaxy.  Maybe it caused by the EMUI security configuration. Anyway, thanks. 
  Currently, shift-click does not work if click event is made on device icon. This fix will allow to start device remote control on standalone mode even click is made on device icon.
  I can see

But really can't connect with vnc viewer. It seems the port 7042 is not listening.
 Hi,

We're looking for a way to create a VNC server and interact with Android devices.

I see in this project that quite some work is already done to make this work.
Is there a possibility for us to support/donate to finish this feature?

Thanks!

 @codeskyblue @sorccu the VNC feature is similar to this https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/352 , I did comment on that ticket that you can share devices with multiple users at the same time if the users use the same login details. 
  I consistently getting this when running `stf local`

```
FTL/reaper 7584 [reaper001] Unable to load initial state { [ReqlOpFailedError: Index `present` was not found on table `stf.devices` in:
r.table("devices").getAll(true, {index: "present"})
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^]
  name: 'ReqlOpFailedError',

  frames: [],
  message: 'Index `present` was not found on table `stf.devices` in:\nr.table("devices").getAll(true, {index: "present"})\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' }
```

Manually adding the index to the table fixed the problem.

Apparently `migrate` cli already exit before the index was fully created.
 It's SDD on OSX.

I tried this, but no luck yet (pardon my lack of nodejs-fu):

```
return rTable.indexCreate.apply(rTable, args).run(conn)
      .then(function() {
          //log.info('options for table %s index %s', table, index)
          if (!options) {
            log.info('Waiting for table %s index %s', table, index)
            return Promise.resolve(rTable.indexWait(args[0]).run(conn).then(function () {
              log.info('Index "%s"."%s" finally created', table, index)
            }))
          } else {
            log.info('Index "%s"."%s" created', table, index)
          }
      })
      .catch(alreadyExistsError, function() {
        log.info('Index "%s"."%s" already exists', table, index)
        return Promise.resolve()
      })
      .catch(noMasterAvailableError, function() {
        return Promise.delay(1000).then(function() {
          return createIndex(table, index, options)
        })
      })
  }
```

The way we write `table.js` might also requires reordering to make sure we are not creating index that depends on another index before it's dependencies got resolved.

Not sure this is more into rethinkdb API issue. Since indexWait said index was ready when it's not -- fail when we start accessing the index in question. indexStatus also return the same state. So the appropriate check should be an actual query. I tried this on my local but I messed up my promises and it never resolve :crying_cat_face: 
  Just a question not so related with STF itself, we would like to know where to buy such cabinet to place all the mobile devices
 thanks for the reply.
could it be possible to send me the picture of the shelf and if better the production shelf so that I can send it to my boss to make the decision?
  At first, my English is so bad. :)

Thanks for STF, it is really useful for us. But I have a problem that I cannot use 7100 in my company's server, so I must change 7100 to another, but I don't find how to do that. 

Who can tell me ? Thanks very much.
 ```
stf local --poorxy-port xxxx
```
 Yes ! That works ! Thanks so much !!!

BTW, where do get the option information ? I don't see that in the help
 For specific command options, you need to check command help

eg. `stf local --help`
 Thank you. 
  i pull the newest code from master, and run npm install successfully
but when i run stf, i find the error below
how can i fix it?

  Hello :wave:

This is the first automated pull requests to help reach the goal of up to date and stable software.
It updates all of the dependencies in the `package.json` at one go, but from now on you’ll receive **pull requests** for each dependency update **in isolation and in real time**.

For updates that satisfy the existing version range you’ll get pull-requests only if it breaks your build.

Example:

``` diff
-  "underscore": "^1.6.0"
+  "underscore": "^1.7.0"
```

When an update does not satisfy the existing range you’ll get the pull request right away.

Example:

``` diff
-  "lodash": "^3.0.0"
+  "lodash": "^4.0.0"
```

Happy fixing and merging :palm_tree:

  Hi, android 6.0 comes , is there any schedule to support android 6.0 ?
i think maybe to build an android 6.0 minicap.so will work?
  Issue - https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/100
 True. Will change it.
 done.
 Thanks for the review, and yeah please check this in your environment too. Its working okay on mac.
 Sorry, I could not test this PR in CoreOS. I need to make a CoreOS dev environment.

The reason, I added ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE option is that default KEEP_IDLE (_Amount of time, in milliseconds, that the (TCP) connection must be idle before sending keepalive probes_) option value for mac or some linux OS such as CentOS is 2hrs. Which means TCP_KEEP_ALIVE will start probing after 2hrs. And in my case connection was dying after 20mins, so I set it to 5mins.

And thanks for making these param optional.
 ZeroMQ documentation looks a bit weird. Because in source code it is setting SO_KEEPIDLE option on ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE 

https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/blob/master/src/tcp.cpp#L131-L135

```
#ifdef ZMQ_HAVE_TCP_KEEPIDLE
        if (keepalive_idle_ != -1) {
            int rc = setsockopt (s_, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_KEEPIDLE, &keepalive_idle_, sizeof (int));
            errno_assert (rc == 0);
        }
```

I installed GraphicsMagick by Macports at first,  it dosn't work.

It must use Homebrew.
  I have 2 Linux machine and each has more than 10 devices. 
Could I start one instance  on SFT and have access to all devices? 

Like selenium grid
  # Overview

This is Device booking feature. You can book device schedule on device-list. then, device scheduler unit  set you to "owner" on the time. And reject other user if the device is busy. device scheduler will check device schedule per a minute.

 wow
 :+1:  (for the feature, haven't read the code yet)
 Thanks for your reply. Because my English is no good Maybe some method name or some variable name is fishy. And actually, it need more test for actual business. I continue test and I'll fix if I found any problem.
 ![](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png)
Great work, I was looking at implementing this myself!!
 Thanks for check. I'll research it.
 :+1: nice feature!
 Thanks for check. I'll follow them. It's similar to one of my other ideas.
 > 1. In there, start listening for a ReserveUpdateMessage, and send a ReserveUpdateRequestMessage when the device worker loads (just a sample name)
> 2. processor receives it, loads the full schedule for that device from the database, and a ReserveUpdateMessage back to the device with the details

You mean, I can "not" access to rethinkdb from  `device/plugins/reserve.js`  right?
 my idea is as follow images.

It can make completely separate this feature.
 How can I see this feature in installed STF? or Do I need to add this plugin separately? 
 It's not ready yet. Sorry.
 Hi hogehoge-banana, 
Thanks very much for this nice feature.
I added your code and start STF but could not see the screen 'Book Device'. 
Would you please let me know if I missed something or how we can activate this feature?
 Hi, Thanks for check my code. While I'll research it, It will take time. Because Actually I left this project. Now, I just play "stf" on my private time.
 Hey @hogehoge-banana , 

This is amazing feature for STF , is this ready yet ?
please let me know.

Thanks
SK @skumar1122
Not ready yet. Sorry.
 @hogehoge-banana 
No worries !  I have a working setup of STF in production.Currently, I am having a problem which is bugging me for couple of days and want to know if somebody else is having same.

The problem is, if I keep my device idle for 20 or 30 minutes, then I get totally blank screen after click the use button on device. Below are the screen shots.

STF Device list view, as it can be seen device are usable
![screen shot 2015-10-07 at 13 25 59](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7875161/10329270/edac688c-6cf9-11e5-99cc-66746517460f.png)

This is the view I get when I click use button for some (expired) device.
![screen shot 2015-10-07 at 13 46 30](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7875161/10329267/e74c88e6-6cf9-11e5-9b6d-d94498fc7d30.png)

I did troubleshooting for this and found out that device subscriber is not receiving message if it is kept idle for some minutes. So basically "group.invite" or GroupMessage from app side is not being received by device unit.

I confirmed this by writing a simple zeromq subscriber and subscribed it with dev-side publisher. Script looks like this

``` nodejs
var zmq = require('zmq');
var util = require('util')

var sub = zmq.socket('sub');

// subscribing to device channel
sub.subscribe("QsoRFrXSROZTpgwiqmTxlpDoelg=")

sub.on("message", function(channel, data) {
  console.log('got message on channel ' + channel + " data is : " + data.toString() + "\n")
})

sub.connect("tcp://DEVSIDE_IP:7250")
```

If I press the "Use" button now, then I can see subscriber in the script is receiving messages. Then I kept (expired) device idle for around 30 minutes and not surprisingly subscriber in the script also stopped receiving messages. So basically, subscriber is dying if kept idle.

I did research about zeromq's subscriber dying problem and found that it may because of various reason such as TCP timeout or network problem between machines. I checked TCP timeout in my provider machine, it is 2hrs so most probably this is not the problem.

One more additional thing, I am using mac-os for my provider instead of linux machine. I know STF does not support mac-osx for production but currently I am using my available resources. All the other units are running in CentOS 7.0

I want to know, if somebody has faced subscriber dying problem or can suggest me reason why it is dying or not receiving messages? I will be glad if someone can also suggest work around for this problem, currently I am thinking of sending heartbeats to all the device subscriber to keep them alive.

Thanks,
 Currently experiencing the same, with both my providers. A Raspbian (raspberry pi) provider and a Ubuntu 15 server. If left idle, the devices are still visible as usable, but no data is received if you try to use them, and they are not marked as in use (no "stop using" button visible, it's like I never tried to connect). 
So far my workaround has been to periodically restart the stf-provider service.
 Well, I did some experiment by creating different publisher and subscriber on different machines, current results are as follow:
1. If publisher and subscriber on same host (same machine), subscriber will continue receiving message (as in case of stf local).
2. If publisher and subscriber are on different host, subscriber discontinue receiving messages if kept idle.

Still trying to figure out cause behind the problem. And its frustrating since I have to wait 30minutes to reproduce the behaviour.

Related Issues: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28252054/zmq-socket-not-working-after-a-period-of-time
 I think, I figured it out. 

As mentioned in ZeroMQ guide, http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Shrugging-It-Off

> If we use a TCP connection that stays silent for a long while, it will, in some networks, just die. Sending something (technically, a "keep-alive" more than a heartbeat), will keep the network alive.

Indeed the problem was in TCP connection. By default, ZeroMQ uses OS settings for TCP_KEEPALIVE option http://api.zeromq.org/3-2:zmq-setsockopt

> Override SO_KEEPALIVE socket option(where supported by OS). The default value of -1 means to skip any overrides and leave it to OS default.

And for OS X or most of the linux, the default is false. So, turning it on worked for me.

``` bash
sudo -w sysctl net.inet.tcp.always_keepalive=1
```

In addtion, the default wait time for sending pings is 2hrs, so it is also need to be lowered. I made it 10mins.

``` bash
sudo -w sysctl net.inet.tcp.keepidle=600000
```

This fixed my problem, but I still feel that it is not a good solution. It will be good if we can handle it from application itself. ZeroMQ provides options where we can set these option while creating zmq sockets. So, good solution will be to set these options on all the subscribers and dealers of stf, some thing like below

``` js
sub.setsockopt(zmq.ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE, 1)
sub.setsockopt(zmq.ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE, 600000)
```

@MichaelMadsen 
Can you check if this solution works for you. I don't have a linux provider.
 Yeah sure, I will write PR for this. Reason I did not do it before is that I did not test this on linux provider.

For people who are interested in why TCP connection dies on some network, this will help.

> The other useful goal of keepalive is to prevent inactivity from disconnecting the channel. It's a very common issue, when you are behind a NAT proxy or a firewall, to be disconnected without a reason. This behavior is caused by the connection tracking procedures implemented in proxies and firewalls, which keep track of all connections that pass through them. Because of the physical limits of these machines, they can only keep a finite number of connections in their memory. The most common and logical policy is to keep newest connections and to discard old and inactive connections first.

 Hi @vbanthia ,
Great work !

I started using STF now and it's very useful for me and I am loving it.
If you could help me in answering for couple of questions please,
**I am using Mac 10.12.4** 

1)If publisher and subscriber are on different host, subscriber discontinue receiving messages if kept idle.
Say I forgot to click on stop using device before session time , Will that device will be busy for others until I click stop using or session time-out ?
So as u said is there only one chance that we can reduce/set session timeout(By TCP) time for device if its idle or not used for a time.

2)How do I re-name my devices in STF ?

ATM we cannot get device name , instead its getting model name. Is there any ADB command to get device name.

  Hi,
I am currently experiencing problems trying to get LDAP user authentication working. Are you able to provide me with an example of an stf-auth@.service so i can use this to help get this implemented correctly.

Thanks in advance,

Ben
  Can we add devices that are connected to ADB over tcpip, not connected with USB? When I try this way, cannot see device on sft application. 
  Hello, I am facing some problem in installing apk files in production setup. Since, it is working perfectly with `stf local` , so most probably the problem is some where in my setup. I tried debugging it but could not figure out. Hope someone can help me out.

So, the problem starts with nginx responding with 502(Bad gateway) on uploading apk file. Below is the screenshot.

![stf-error-screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7875161/10214662/56a25594-6855-11e5-83b5-70ff2a9bb3d3.png)

This is my stf-storage-temp@3500 same as Deployment.md

```
[Unit]
Description=STF temp storage
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/etc/environment

  openstf/stf:latest \
  stf storage-temp --port 3000 \
    --save-dir /data
ExecStop=-/usr/bin/docker stop -t 10 %p-%i
```

I tried checking into containers /data folder but there was nothing inside. apk file was inside /tmp folder inside

``` bash
[stf@enigma ~]$ docker exec -it stf-storage-temp-3500 /bin/bash
stf@af7372510bb1:/app$ ls /data
stf@af7372510bb1:/app$ ls /tmp/
upload_53e55f6c6b2b1b5f6ae57356df2807be
```

I tried to explore code but could not find where this --save-dir option is being used. [storage-temp unit](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/storage/temp.js) is not using it

I can provide more information and logs. Please have a look!
 I checked my backend servers, they are running fine.

This is nginx error log for that 502 response

```
*469 upstream prematurely closed connection while reading response header from upstream, client: 172.23.57.87, server: stf.example.org, request: "GET /s/apk/04a9f9cb-1bc1-41c7-aac3-8b0068337a74/service-release-20150916113424690.apk/manifest HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://10.33.85.12:3300/s/apk/04a9f9cb-1bc1-41c7-aac3-8b0068337a74/service-release-20150916113424690.apk/manifest", host: "stf.example.org", referrer: "http://stf.example.org/"
```

In case, backend server are down, nginx will raise connection refused error

```
connect() failed (111: Connection refused) while connecting to upstream,
```

and this is the log from stf-storage-plugin-apk server

```
[stf@enigma ~]$ docker logs stf-storage-plugin-apk-3300
INF/storage:plugins:apk 1 [*] Listening on port 3000
```

BTW, `/data (--save-dir)` directory of stf-storage-temp container is empty. And also host's `/mnt/storage` directory is also empty. I am trying to find out which part of code responsible for copying uploaded files from `/tmp` directory to `/data (--save-dir)` directory. Can you help me with that?
 Sorry to mention this before, my storage url is okay, I just changed the log in order to hide private domain.

Same thought for uploading, because I can see the uploaded apk file inside tmp folder of container. I also think problem is with `/s/apk/:id/:name/manifest` endpoint. I tried hitting plugin-apk server directly this is what I got.

```
 wget http://stf.mydomain.org:3300/s/apk/da5f9fb2-7552-457b-8fd8-6a72aa3ca647/service-release-20150916113424690.apk

```

Can you tell me one thing, while getting apk or image files from storage server. From which location storage server get these files? `/data` or `/tmp`
 The problem was with --storage-url. stf-storage-plugin-apk container was not able to resolve the domain for storage-url thats why server was crashing. And systemd was restarting it again. 

Using `-e DEBUG=express:*` helped in debugging.
  Hi,  
I try to connect Nexus 5 Android 6 Dev Prev 3 device to stf but getting some errors repeatedly. How can I fix this problem.

Thanks.

 Good catch as well :) . I'll give it a closer look and reopen it.

By the way, how can I try frontend changes without running `npm link` each time?
 Exactly. If I change something then reloading the page doesn't seem to load the changes... Is that the expected behavior? Should I run stf in some specific way?
 Perfect, thanks!
  Hi, sorry to bother you again!
I have 4 devices on my pc and i just want to provide two to stf.
i tried to run provider serial1 serial2 , provider [serial1 serial2], provider serial1, serial2 and so on , but none works
is there a way to do this or i have to run two provider like , provider serial1 , provider serial2.
i just want to run one provider and provide two devices
thank you
  A very simple one. Can list and download.

```
 I already gave that a try. No dice.
 I experienced same problem as @JordanMarshall.
Didn't try node 4.0 yet.
 With the commits on October 21st it now lists all the devices, but they are perpetually stuck 'preparing'
 I wiped, performed a clean install, update to node 4.2.1 (previously using 4.2.0), and now everything seems to work!
    I'm having some trouble connecting to the device video feed, having moved the provider to a separate VM (remote control works, getting blank video feed and the adb connection string is unable to connect as well). It's definitely because I am configuring wrong, and some clarification of the different IPs would be helpful for me.

So as far as I know, the files that must be configured to add a new provider are stf-provider@.service on the provider machine, and nginx.conf on the webserver.
I have taken the ips of the example configuration files and added in my interpretation/questions.

stf-provider@newprovider.service (running on machine with only adbd.service and a connected android device):

```
[Unit]
Description=STF provider
After=adbd.service
BindsTo=adbd.service

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/etc/environment
TimeoutStartSec=0
Restart=always
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/docker pull openstf/stf:latest
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill %p-%i
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm %p-%i
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm \
  --name %p-%i \
  --net host \
  openstf/stf:latest \
  stf provider \
    --name "%H/%i" \
    --connect-sub tcp://IP_OF_DEV_TRIPROXY:7250 \
    --connect-push tcp://IP_OF_DEV_TRIPROXY:7270 \
    --storage-url https://IP_OF_STF_STORAGE_TEMP? or maybe    IP_OF_DATABASE?/ \
    --public-ip PUBLIC_IP_OF_THIS_MACHINE \
    --min-port=15000 \
    --max-port=25000 \
    --heartbeat-interval 10000 \
    --screen-ws-url-pattern "wss://IP_OF_WEBSERVER?/d/%i/<%= serial %>/<%= publicPort %>/"
ExecStop=-/usr/bin/docker stop -t 10 %p-%i
```

Nginx.conf:

```
# Handle stf-provider@newprovider.service
    location ~ "^/d/newprovider/([^/]+)/(?<port>[0-9]{5})/$" {
      proxy_pass http://PUBLIC_IP_OF_PROVIDER:$port/;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
```

So in my case I have 3 machines, 
192.168.99.**106**: app side, running all services and webserver
192.168.99.**107**: rethinkdb, running rethinkdb
192.168.99.**108**: provider, running adbd.service and stf-provider

And I'm a bit unsure where the different IPs would go. At least I haven't hit a combination that works for the video feed yet. And maybe the problem is somewhere else altogether, I'm just pressuming it must be my configuration. Websocket is getting a 504:
<img width="1222" alt="screen shot 2015-09-17 at 15 09 13" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/657289/9935379/300fcc98-5d4e-11e5-8504-594238bf913f.png">

If anybody could point me in the right direction it would be appreciated.
 Oh yeah, the newprovider name was just made up for this post, in all of my files it's called remotehost.

```
sudo ufw disable
```

did the trick

I can't believe it was just the default firewall settings, I hadn't even considered it since all remote control and screenshots were working. But I guess that's all handled through the open connection from provider to app side, doesn't mean anything is allowed in.

Thanks for the help.
  Hi ,

Can you give some instruction about what happens when user click "stop using" on one specified device?

I can't see any request in the network.  I tried to update the owner to null in device table, and UI seems to that device was released. But when I chose to use this device again, it can't show any device UI in control tab. I only need disconnect and reconnect this device again, it can work well again. 

So it need your instruction about what happens when user click "stop using" on one specified device? 
I want to release this device after use logout.

Thanks
Luis
 Thanks for your rich answer. So if I want to logout with releasing the occupied devices, I need simulate above process? Can you share some stf code snippet which were used for 'stop using' action.
 Thats a great life cycle explanation, Simo. I think, it would be great if you can write a document explaining STF architecture to speed up contribution from others.
 @luisxiaomai 

I tried to put the whole event cycle in diagram. If you read Simo's explanation with this image, It will be easy to understand.

![stf-architecture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7875161/9933823/b55123e0-5d88-11e5-8746-ae91fe90bc8c.png)
 @vbanthia good job. BTW, you lost stf device. stf-device should inside stf-provider.
 Really great diagram, gives a good overview of how the services interact.
I'd be very interested as well in an explanation of how to claim/release devices, as well as getting the adb connection string without having a browser involved.
 @sorccu, @gunta @vbanthia @codeskyblue  I read the front end code. When user clicks the "stop using" on one using device, browser sends the websocket message which is triggered by pure front end code, I want to know how I can simulate this in backend because I want to release all current user using devices when user session timeout or user logout.
 so this question has already been resolved? I meet the same problem now  @sorccu, @gunta @vbanthia @codeskyblue

my user always close the browser directly, so the other user must wait for the device to be timeout
 open a new ? but my problem is the same with luisxiaomai , when my user logout, the other users cannot use that device until timeout.

BTW, #152 can you cost some time to answer me ?  Thanks
 @gunta Thanks for your help, that's helpful.

I think if i can supply some big 'logout' button, they would like to click it. But like luisxiaomai, how I can simulate this in backend. Now what i do is that when user logout, update the device owner as 'null', then wait the device to timeout.  Is there another better way to release the device ?

BTW, where can i set the timeout option ? 

Thanks
 provider unit has timeout option, by default it is 15mins. So device will be released automatically after 15mins if kept idle. If you are running stf local then you can set it using --group-timeout options

`stf local --group-timeout 60`

If you are running using docker then you will have to set this option in provider unit.

>  Is there another better way to release the device ?

I don't think there is any better way but there is an easter egg. Just press Konami code when you are on device list { up up down down left right left right enter }. You will see a dialogue which will make you "admin" and then you can steal anyone's device. But do remember _with great power comes great responsibility_. So use it wisely.
 @LiufxLucky365 @gunta @vbanthia , my question is not to provide a logout function. My question is how I can simulate "release devices" in backend, whatever I want to do this when I logout or my trial time is over. I want to implement this similar features.
 I have a similar need. The primary need of my stakeholders is to get adb connection strings as easily as possible. So getting a list of devices (and whether they are claimed or not), claiming devices and releasing devices should ideally be done purely through API. 
Trying to get some node knowledge in order to dive in and figure it out myself, but any pointers would be appreciated.
 @luisxiaomai  Have you implemented that features now ?
 There is a similar issue, https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/38

I started implementing RESTful `devices/:serial/reserve` & `devices/:serial/release` endpoints. But found its too complex because STF uses websocket for most of the client-server communication (which is good because it makes it real time app). And also, it checks xcrf token in each request which makes it kind of more difficult to create stateless apis. So I kind of gave up in between.

If anyone wants to give it a try, I can write what approach I was using but I will suggest to get it reviewed from STF developers before any implementation.

## Authorisation
- Every request to stf-app unit (api provider) goes through [auth middleware](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/app/middleware/auth.js) which checks for valid session-id. If your request does not have a session id, it will redirect it to auth server to create a new session. So you need to modify this auth middleware such that it can forward request even it has only [jwt token](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/app/middleware/auth.js#L8)
- Next step will be to develop a feature which can provide users their jwt token. Best way would be to create a section in "Setting" tab and show users their jwt token like github.
- Next, you need to get rid of csrf checking for RESTful apis. One way to do is check csrf after RESTful api section.

After this you will be able to access all STF apis from any http client library using command line.

## Implement reserve/release endpoints
- You will be going to implements these new endpoints in [stf-app unit](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/app/index.js)
- For this just mimic the [websocket unit](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/websocket/index.js) and do the same things what websocket unit does when it gets [reserve](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/websocket/index.js#L614-L631) and [release](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/websocket/index.js#L632-L643) messages. 
- You need to add app side push sockets and push group.join and group.kick messages to processor and inform all the websocket subscriber about the event so that people who are using web browser can also be updated.
- For remote debugging you need to send `connect.start` message to server and get remote debug url.

## Implement client

Last part being implement a good stf command line client which can use these endpoints easily.

I hope this will help.
  Hi, my stf works very well with two devices connected
but when i add more devices ( now i have 6 devices connected )
i find some devices hard to be ready and when they are ready , i connect them, the screen is white
i really do not know why
does anyone have ideas about this?
 Your USB controllers are probably aren't supplying enough power to all your devices. Consider getting a powered USB hub (see the FAQ section for more details about this).
 thank you for your answer
i find the device record in rethinkdb , the ready is false , does this means that the device is unable to use?
when i plug it off and plug in again , sometimes it is ok
so it is wierd
   Is this a good pr?
 If no reply on this pr until tomorror, I'll close it.
 Really poor English, shame ...-_-!!
 I still not thinking well about it and the UI is not well enough. I'm waiting for other people who can change it better.

Thanks for your help guys ;-)
 Unfortunately, I met the same problem with you. Has now been fixed. I suggest you install the latest 'jpeg-turbo' package. And make sure other packages are up to date. I wish good luck

 I spent last 2 days trying to run "npm install opencv" but it was working because my used node version was the 4.0.0. 
But thank to you guys, I came back to use node 0.12.7 and now , the command succeeded to install opencv. 

thanks a lot!!!

To test it I try running the stf-migrate.service

Now, from the client, I can do wget 192.168.99.107:28015 and receive the index.html explaining "this is a rethinkdb port, you are connecting wrong". So I know that the address is open and accessible, so the ambassador is working its part.

However, trying to launch stf-migrate (or any other service connecting to the rethinkdb-proxy), this happens:

```
Sep 09 10:34:08 ubuntu docker[17758]: INF/db 1 [*] Connecting to 172.17.7.85:28015
Sep 09 10:34:08 ubuntu docker[17758]: INF/db 1 [*] Unable to connect to 172.17.7.85:28015
Sep 09 10:34:08 ubuntu docker[17758]: FTL/db 1 [*] No hosts left to try
Sep 09 10:34:08 ubuntu docker[17758]: FTL/util:lifecycle 1 [*] Shutting down due to fatal error
Sep 09 10:34:09 ubuntu systemd[1]: stf-migrate.service: main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE
```

So stf-migrate tries to connect to the rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service docker container, and fails. The problem seems to be entirely local on the second machine, since the ambassador seems to work perfectly. The services cannot connect to the proxy properly, but I cannot figure out where the problem comes from.
 I was just trying different things in desperation, trying to get it to work. Found your rethinkdb docker container via your docker account, presumed it was the one you were using. I've changed it to the official one now.

The problem turned out to be the auth key. Now I can connect to the database server. Thanks a lot!

Now all the services seem to be running and communicating with each other.
Only problem left is accessing the webpage. Trying to connect to the ip gives a 502 Bad Gateway, and the log for nginx.service shows, I think, that it doesn't get a response from the stf-app@3100.service:

```

Connecting manually to 192.168.99.106:3100 (app address), gives ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED in a browser. My nginx.conf is identical to the verison in DEPLOYMENT.md, except I changed all the IPs to my local one, 192.168.99.106, where all the services run. Kept the ports the same as the examples in DEPLOYMENT.md:

 I had the same problem, I fixed it by

Removing 127.0.0.1 from publish port of all the services which starts nodejs server. For example

this will

You need to do this for all the below services
- stf-app@.service
- stf-auth@.service
- stf-storage-plugin-apk@.service
- stf-storage-plugin-image@.service
- stf-storage-temp@.service
- stf-websocket@.service

After you finish this and restart your units, you will be able to see the login page. But wont be able to login, because there is a small problem in sample nginx.conf file.

You will need to change

```
    location /auth/mock/ {
      proxy_pass http://stf_auth/auth/mock/;
    }
```

to

```
    location /auth/ {
      proxy_pass http://stf_auth/auth/;
    }
```

in your nginx.conf file.

After this, I think you will be ready to enjoy STF in production.

Would like to add one last point here, In my case I am not running nginx using docker, I am running nginx directly on the host server.
 Well truth is I did not research much for the root cause, When I started my units with publish port `127.0.0.1:...`. I was able to get valid response from  `wget 127.0.0.1:3100` but  `wget $IP:3100` was resulting into connection refused error. 

After removing 127.0.0.1 from publish port, I was getting valid response from `wget $IP:3100`.
 Removing 127.0.0.1 and changing the nginx.config fixed it. Everything now works, except I can't see the screen of the device - controlling it works, but the field is just blank grey.
 I did a bit research and found that after removing 127.0.0.1, docker will publish or bind it to 0.0.0.0 which means it is binding container port to all the host interface which is not very good or secure. My current best approach will be to bind docker port to IP address itself. eg `-p $HOST_STATIC_IP:%i:$PORT`. This will bind only to eth0 interface.

I am still trying to understand why it is working in case of Simo. I can think about two cases.
1. nginx is proxying to localhost instead of raising connection refused.
2. docker container is also binding port to $HOST_IP

@sorccu 
Can you try accessing stf-app server directly using `wget $HOST_IP:3100`
 I can now take screenshots without problems - my self-signed ssh certificate was ruining the screenshot feature:

```

Turned off ssh and running on normal http, screenshots work.

Still can't see the feed of the device screen, though. Tested on 4 devices that work in stf -local.
What service is responsible for providing the video feed? Where can I check the logs?
 provider is responsible for fetching device screen. You should check provider unit logs.
 I have submitted a pull request regarding a problem in sample nginx.conf file, you should also consider this, since most of the people going to use same sample nginx.conf for first time.

https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/75
 Yeah, seems like it's not connecting to the websocket.
<img width="1279" alt="screen shot 2015-09-09 at 16 11 03" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/657289/9765744/b0533b84-570d-11e5-88ef-d746664682df.png">

And this is what the only part of the provider log that mentions the websocket:

```
Sep 09 15:53:48 ubuntu docker[1586]: INF/device:plugins:screen:stream 10 [aa0d987a] Starting WebSocket server on port 15000
```

and this is how it's formated in the service file:

```
--screen-ws-url-pattern "wss://192.168.99.106/d/%i/<%= serial %>/<%= publicPort %>/"
```
 I think since you are not using ssl, you should use "ws" URL Scheme for url pattern instead of wss.
 You're probably right. Changing that one line doesn't seem to be enough, though. Now it just leads to a 404.
<img width="1280" alt="screen shot 2015-09-09 at 16 42 15" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/657289/9766650/ed237f70-5711-11e5-9d8c-cdf527a70d31.png">

I might just try setting ssl up again with the NODE_TLS_REJECT flag instead, in order to stay closer to the example configuration.
 Literally just pasted from 443 over to 80 instead, minus the ssl part:

```
 your provider name is "cabinet1" while in your nginx config file you have written "cupboard1". 

change `location ~ "^/d/cupboard1/([^/]+)/(?<port>[0-9]{5})/$" {` -> `location ~ "^/d/cabinet1/([^/]+)/(?<port>[0-9]{5})/$" {`
 Well that was a really stupid mistake on my part, well spotted.

Videofeed and everything else works now, thank you guys for all the help!

I am not able to figure out what is the problem here, please guide. Thanks in advance If we are running all services on a single machine rather than running on distributed cluster do we still need rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service. Or we can simply connect other services to rethinkdb.service instead of rethinkdb-proxy-28015. 

Thanks in advance  With current sample nginx.conf, endpoint such as [/auth/api/v1/mock](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/auth/mock.js#L60) or [/auth/api/v1/ldap](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/auth/ldap.js#L61) will be proxied to stf-app instead of stf-auth server which will cause status 302 with /undefined endpoint.

This is a small fix for above problem.
  ```
$ netstat -anp | grep 7100
$ tcp6       0      0 :::7100                 :::*                    LISTEN      19521/node
```

How can I run stf on localhost? I would like the following output "127.0.0.1:7100". But it's not. (I see and try deployment paper)
 Yes you are right, i am accessing it. But i want to forward on nginx(proxy_pass option). They conflicts(nginx and stf -> 0.0.0.0:7100). How to fix it?

when i enter http://localhost:7100 on browser it only show blank page i try using --public-ip i got no website available on browser 
 ok ill try to reinstall adb and try again.
 I run the prompt on this machine, unable to enter the STF client, what happened?
Can not access this site

localhost rejected our connection request.
Please try the following:
Check the network connection
Check the proxy server and firewall
ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED  Hi there
Again, hope I'm not missing something obvious, but it turned out to be a good idea to write here when I couldn't get adbd.service working.

When I start rethinkdb-proxy-28015 I get an error that I have tried to troubleshoot all day.
Using the same rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service as DEPLOYMENT.md, changed the authkey to 1234 and the ip to the ip of this same machine (running everything on one machine)
RethinkDB is running with --bind all, and I can access the web interface from my browser on the same ip, port 8080.

Here is what happens when I try to start the service:

Tried running the docker run command directly, both on this machine and on a fresh install and it does the same. I am unsure where I should look to find the error, feel like I've been through everything.

Thanks for your time, I appreciate the help
 Hi,

I am experiencing the same problem. 

Can anyone help?

Thanks!

 Thanks for the reply,

I have pulled the previous version and the only difference between that and the latest is the addition of a line:

Any further guidance/advice would be appreciated.

Thanks.
 Well just to add, I just deployed STF today with latest ambassador image and it worked for me. 
 Impossible launche stf-app.service with rethinkdb-proxy-28015 .... When launch rethinkdb and rethinkdb-proxy-28015 works fine, but when launche stf-app.service the load average and cpu is high. socat use high cpu...

https://imgur.com/a/54Niw I solved change the ip 172.17.0.2 from docker to ip from host physical and works well...

I don't understand ...but works now  Would it be possible to get a little more guidance on how to deploy the Docker container for STF provided on Docker Hub? Is it as simple as entering the container and running `npm install -g stf` followed by all the usual commands for installing/building STF in a manual installation, or is there more to it?

Also, is it recommended that RethinkDB is run in a linked Docker container?
  remove redundant "keeps"
  stf is really a great repo.

It's is very hard for us to contribute translation in http://transifex.com because of `GFW`.
My colleague @Hepper99 translated the Chinese part. 
 @gunta OK, I'll have a try. Thanks for your work, really.
 May I ask how to compile `stf.zh.po` to stf.zh.json
 Closed for now, I'll create a new pr.
  I am trying to deploy stf to a single Ubuntu Server 15 VM for testing purposes, and I am having trouble launching the adbd.service.

Looking at journalctl -u adbd.service, this is what happens (on repeat) when it tries to launch:

My adbd.service file is an exact copy of the one in DEPLOYMENT.md:

I tried to do it on a completely empty "boot to docker" image, and it gives the same error.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
I am new both to systemd and docker, so please forgive me if this is an obvious problem or a rookie mistake.
  Thanks for the great sharing. I have tried to deploy it on real servers for several days,but now I meet a question, I can not take it work when I input the URL in my browser,there will nothing(Unable to connect) I think there is something wrong in the file of 'nginx.conf'.
1. I create the the file of '/srv/nginx/nginx.conf' by myself,and I have pulled the docker image of nginx:1.7.10
2. I have started all of the units active(running), I used my host's IP (10.240.154.173:7100)instead of https://stf.example.org/ in all of the units and the file 'nginx.conf'. 
3. I don't know how to create certs,so I can't use the https , I have commented some codes in the '/srv/nginx/nginx.conf' about https.
4. I have changed the code like ' server 192.168.255.100:3100 max_fails=0;'to ' server 10.240.154.173:3100 max_fails=0;'
5. It will be change to 10.240.154.173:7100 if I input 10.240.154.173:80 in  browser,it can shows the nginx.conf have worked.But why there is nothing in 10.240.154.173:7100?
6. The rest of the file '/srv/nginx/nginx.conf'is like doc/DEPLOYMENT.md .Then the nginx.service delete the code like
   ConditionPathExists=/srv/ssl/stf.example.org.crt
   ConditionPathExists=/srv/ssl/stf.example.org.key
   ConditionPathExists=/srv/ssl/dhparam.pem
   and
   -v /srv/ssl/stf.example.org.crt:/etc/nginx/ssl/cert.pem:ro \
   -v /srv/ssl/stf.example.org.key:/etc/nginx/ssl/cert.key:ro \
   -v /srv/ssl/dhparam.pem:/etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem:ro \
7. Now I can see the change of RethinkDB from 'localhost:8080' if I link devices to host.

Who can tell me how to do it? Thanks.
  I want to do deployment. Which ports do I need to turn out? There are only 7100 open. I can see device list now, but I can not control remote devices. The device comes in a gray screen instead.
 Hi,unverb. I'm trying to deploy  STF to actual servers,but there is some questions when i start .service units, especially the unit configuration of nginx.service,i have pulled the docker image of nginx:1.7.10,should i have to install nginx separately?can you give me some consultation or steps? how to deploy the separate unit for RethinkDB? My email is yuan890811@163.com  Thanks.
 @sorccu Does this have an impact on the performance of the port range? How can I improve the performance? I completed the setup. But it is running slow by remote access.
 I am accessing public network. This is very slow. How to fix it? Change capture frame rate or ..?  @sorccu 
  Hi there,

Is there any way or clues on how to continue to manage devices once USB removed ?
## 

Regis A. Despres
 Hey,

Thanks for the prompt answer. I'm looking for a way to configure adb into stf in order to join device wirelessly =)

## 

Regis A. Despres
 @kawl STF recognizes devices via adb (e.g. `adb devices`) so you can try something like [adb over wifi](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2604727/how-can-i-connect-to-android-with-adb-over-tcp) to setup your device, and then `adb connect [ip_address]` with your local device IP. 

I'm personally using [WiFi ADB - Debug Over Air](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.wifiadb&hl=en).
 Thanks for the tip.

I finally get my device to be recognized.
  I start rethinkdb as default configure in new terminal with command "rethinkdb",then start the unit "rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service".

Then I start the unit "stf-app@3100.service",it can running at first,but it will  failed after a while, I have tried it like the following method.How can I deal with it?
# docker run openstf/stf:latest stf app --port 3000 --secret 123456 --auth-url 10.240.154.173:7100 --websocket-url 10.240.154.173:7100

FTL/db 1 [_] No hosts left to try
FTL/util:lifecycle 1 [_] Shutting down due to fatal error
 It will also failed if I start the stf-app@3100.service with the command "systemctl start stf-app@3100.service ". The question maybe the docker's IP can not link the expose port of rethinkdb if add the --link option (172.17.0.179:28015--->127.0.0.1:28015),I don't know how to deal with it. (if i don't use --link option,it will connecting to 127.0.0.1.:28015)

Then I try to start Like following:

# docker run --link rethinkdb-proxy-28015:rethinkdb -e "SECRET=123456" -p 127.0.0.1:3100:3000 openstf/stf:latest stf app --port 3000 --secret 123456 --auth-url 10.240.154.173:7100 --websocket-url 10.240.154.173:7100

FTL/db 1 [_] No hosts left to try
FTL/util:lifecycle 1 [_] Shutting down due to fatal error
 Try this. Start rethinkdb using --bind all

```
rethinkdb --bind all
```
 Thanks,I have tried it,but it doesn't work. Now i want to ask another question,should i have to install nginx separately in my host? I have pulled the docker image of nginx:1.7.10,Should i have to create the file of nginx.conf by myself and deploy it like https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md? how to create the file like cert.pem cert.key dhparam.pem?
 Oh,i see,thanks.
It's means that i must deploy the platform of STF by myself if i want to run it on real servers,the file https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md just a reference. There are a lot of things I should to change or create in my way.It will not work if i deploy it just like the description of DEPLOYMENT .

thanks again, I will learn it by my best.
 thanks a lot,I'm trying ! sorry to trouble you !
  Awesome, inspiring stuff.  
# TLDR; is iOS support on your roadmap?

I've been tinkering around with a solution that works on iOS devices (or simulators).  The approach streams snapshots over websockets to a canvas and forwards user-generated mouse/keyboard events to Appium which replays them against a device.  For a stand alone solution, with a single device, it works. 

next up on the roadmap:   
- improve performance of image capture
- support multicasting of a device
- support streaming multiple concurrent devices (i.e. one per browser tab)
- polish the code (env variables and such)
- approval w/ stakeholders to release as open source

---

I understand its hard to comment on a solution you haven't seen.  Before I get too much further down this proof-of-concept, I wanted to solicit feedback **Are there any plans to support iOS in STF?**   Have you already been down this path and abandoned it?  
### proof of concept approach
#### image capture

To capture images, I've evaluated: 
-  using `libimobiledevice` which uses devloper disk image to capture on the device to achieve 5-10 fps.  Unfortunatly these are large files (3MB TIFFs), that are begging to be pre-processed into a PNG.
-  using QuickTime's screen mirroring; and screenshoting that (on the host) which allows ~25 fps, but won't scale beyond the first device.
-  forking [xrecord](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/xrecord) to implement a QT mirroing solution that output jpegs (and would allow multiple devices) 
#### devices

Testing against a physical device is desirable however without jailbreaking the device there are some limitations (lockscreen, home button).

The iOS simulator was able to produce highest framerates, and the closest experience to what STF provides for Android, but there is a nagging feeling it's not going to scale or meet the requirements (e.g. managed in MDM, recgnoize an internal cert chain)
#### Shortcomings
-  Appium is limited to the underlying device automation implementation.  On iOS  it is [UIATarget](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Reference/UIATargetClassReference/)
  -  UIATarget has an api to send the application to the background for a duration. Appium wants to launch an application on startup.  On a physical device this means there's no interacting with Home Screen, system properties without jailbreaking the device and getting creative.  For simulators, there may be a way to mimic, but would need to figure out how to support concurrent simulators.
  - perceptable lag (~1-2 seconds) on keyboard events propagating back to the device. A short (100ms) buffer for keyboard events may help, but special keys like Delete make it interesting
-  Duplication of inventory in Selenium Grid and STF.   We've got a node module that watches USB for new device connections, starts an Appium server and registeres it with a Selenium grid, but we need to federate that back into STF for discovery 
 I'm still working on this.  The code's in much better shape, and the stakeholders are listening.

Thanks for the tip on TIFF to JPG.  It shaved 100ms off the image processing.
 The effort stalled.  Stakeholders haven't said no, but they've shifted priorities.  

I'm able to sample stills from a video stream, but it's drinking from a firehose.  I was refactoring the image acquisition code to send the results back over a WebSocket (rather than diskIO), when I bumped into a hard limit of one device at a time  https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/xrecord/issues/1
 Thanks for such amazing work ;) 
 Hi ,

Can you please share your solution?
We want to test it out for iOS devices?
 If anyone has a SD solution available please share the same. We are in dire need of getting this on iOS.
 Ooppsss!... I meant iOS.. Not SD
 Dear Sorccu, you mentioned to me that you would give me the exact quote for developing the iOS Support. Can you please give me as soon as possible?

Regards

 @sorccu @kwv it might be worth checking this out https://github.com/phonegap/ios-deploy and https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim for building and deploying iOS apps to device and simulators. I know STF does not currently support iOS but it would be nice to deploy apps via the web browser. The tool also supports lldb which is useful for out putting console logs.  
 Curious to the original proposed solution that got stalled, as well as any other potential solutions. How far can you scale device support (or even simulator support)?

From what I encountered, unless I'm mistaken, just toying with Appium and physical iOS devices, there seemed to be a single device limitation per instance of XCode on Mac OS. Therefore, to reliably scale to more iOS devices (to work in parallel), one has to deploy 2 virtual machines (the max licensed amount allowed by Apple, on the physical Mac host) running Mac OS with the same XCode and Appium setup, etc. In that setup, assign a specific iOS device per VM via USB port/device allocation in the VM software, and the remaining (last) device to the physical Mac. Each instance (physical Mac, VMs) have their own XCode and Appium to control the device. So there's a max device limit of 3 iOS devices per Mac machine (using the VMs). This doesn't scale as well compared to Android, as more Mac machines would be needed to scale higher.
 this might be useful for video recording https://github.com/isonic1/flick
 @Ashraf-Ali-aa This tools about iOS recording is using capture pictures and combine them to video file. maybe not fitted for stf.
 Since stf got minicap, combine the image stream into video is a better way in my view.
 @gunta I have a question, how to know ios orientation from command line.
 facebook have implemented an extension of xcuitest that allows remote interactions with ios devices and appium has adopted the code. 

https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent
https://github.com/appium/appium-xcuitest-driver

related links:
https://github.com/facebook/FBSimulatorControl
https://github.com/rsms/peertalk
 @daluu I never made it past the scaling limitation.   

I started down the path of spinning up VMs for each tethered device, but I started to recognize the difference between being a trailblazer and stumbling around in the woods.  Defining a repeatable approach was going to be challenging, let alone coming up with a solution that would fit back into STF. 

@Ashraf-Ali-aa Capturing video and sending the stream back to a browser was a problem.  @codeskyblue is right, it is easier to use images over a websocket to fake a stream.  Munging the QT frames into a websocket was next, but that required stronger opinions on the architecture.  (Does the app collecting the screen pipe directly to the browser or through a middle agent? If its direct, what supports discovery, or starts the app?)  I wanted to leverage a lot of STF's architecture decisions for this, but the approach had already diverged.

I wonder how the commercial products work, if they use an app installed on the device which functions similar to minicap.   Rather than pulling from the host machine (like the approach outlined above), push from the device itself (using private APIs?).    In the near term FBSimulatorControl looks very interesting. 

If nothing else, it just re-enforces that @sorccu and @gunta are doing amazing work.
 Hello guys! Like @kwv  i'm trying find a way to screencast the ios screen, i am currently try apply this code from @isonic1, this one https://github.com/isonic1/flick, to make a minicap for IOS. if you guys have some advise to me please tell me.
 @NareshJain91 I am dividing the problem, first i want identify the device and set it visible in stf, next i want make the screencast from ios devices! that is my main work, for now, but we want keep going until get full functionality presented in the android.
So far i am fighting to detect iphone and make screencast.Now with flick i am capable  to detect the udid for all devices and take screenshots in all ios devices. I will try this path to make a solution.
 @HelderVSousa Sure, if you need my assistance anywhere please let me know. Till now i am able to capture ScreenShots and video from iOS Devices, also i can get how many devices are connected and their UDID. But major problem i am stuck is how to give command from browser/System to iPhone, if it resolves i will be able to implement rest things, for that i have also raised the question to Developer apple forum, but most of have replied that apple do not allow it.

If you find something to give commend from mac to iOS, let me know.
Thanks
 @HelderVSousa you can use https://github.com/phonegap/ios-deploy to detect connected iOS devices
 @Ashraf-Ali-aa thanks for the tip, for now my work is fully focused on detect and  screen capture ios, my recent research and tests show me the flick can be the tool i am looking for,  i will create minicapIOS based on approach in minicap. But in future i will check it to see if i can use to control the ios.
 @HelderVSousa I came across this tool https://github.com/sanekgusev/SGASScreenRecorder but it seems it does not work for iOS 9. 

https://github.com/gabriel/CaptureRecord

https://github.com/JaviSoto/iOS10-Runtime-Headers/blob/master/Frameworks/MediaToolbox.framework/FigScreenCaptureController.h
 @HelderVSousa check this out https://www.macstories.net/ios/vidyo-a-screen-recorder-for-ios/

 Hello people i have made some progress however this is not working like i want, now i am using libimobiledivice api to take screenshots and pass that screenshots over socket's to browser, but unfortunately i only can get 4 a 5 frames a second, that is not perfect but is a start, if someone know a lib that take screenshots faster than libimobiledevice, pls share to see what i can make improvements.
 @HelderVSousa with https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/xrecord higher FPS is possible, but it's using QuickTime as a bridge.     
 @HelderVSousa I found out that use idevicescreenshot(tools from libimobiledevice) take 0.7s, how did you make 4,5 fps.

Actually 4,5 fps is enough for the remote control. Touch swipe... basic operations can use https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent (this is so far I know.)
 So, its possible get this WebDriverAgent and integrate with STF?
 Should we use libimobiledivice api or WebDriverAgent to take screenshots and pass it to browser?
or do we have another better solution, please share.
 Thanks very much for quick respond. 
If so, we should use QuickTime ("https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/xrecord") or libimobiledivice api (HelderVSousa's comment, 4 a 5 frames a second), right ? 
I'm still seeking a best solution for iOS. If you have any idea, please share.
 AirPlay is another way. very quickly, just do not known how to do it.
 I want to share a working prototype https://github.com/nwlunatic/ios-minicap.
Any futher ideas/issues/pull requests are welcome.
 looks like the only missing stuff is ios-minitouch
 Well, I hope someone also will come up with some server/client solution for macOS to solve remote usb connection problem. Like [usbip](http://usbip.sourceforge.net/), or any [other solutions for remote accesing usb](http://www.eltima.com/products/usb-over-network-mac/). Or i've missed something? ) This will probably require to write some kind of virtual usb device and kext. And solve a lot of other possible usb problems )
 does this work with more then one device per host?
 I tested multiple devices, it seems not working. It just kept showing usage text whenever I plug 2 iOS devices. One device is good so far. I see that we use CoreMediaIO to enable DAL. That may not work with multiple devices.
 For ios-minitouch, Is it possible with IOKit framework?
 or should we use UIKit.framework ? 
refer to "https://github.com/johnno1962/Remote/blob/master/Classes/RemoteCapture.h"
--> (void)processEvents
 We need to send touch events from Mac OS to USB connected iOS devices.
"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35339953/send-touch-events-from-mac-osx-application-to-usb-connected-iphone" confirmed that they implemented this feature in their VNC Server but can't share the source code :)
 On iOS6 & 7, can use IOHIDEvents (IOKit.Framework) to send touches/swipes/buttons from MAC OS to iOS devices. Not sure if IOHIDEvents (IOKit.Framework) is still supported on iOS 10.
 Could we not use appium/WebDriverAgent to send the touch events commands to the device since it was designed to run automation tests 
 @sorccu I am not sure if that is true these days, especially with the release of this library from Facebook: https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent We also use it internally, but have found it to be quite snappy and stable. Are you pushing events over Wifi or USB?  I suffered the same problem. Can't wait to see that WDA was improved. @tk8817 Please notice that it's about the touch and key. For the rest, WDA works well to me. Hi. You're doing great job guys! Now for iOS, besides screen capturing there are other problems to solve, like **app deployment (install/uninstall)** on the device, right? Do anyone of you guys have a solution for that? 

With Android the OpenSTF is so convenient with the instant drag and drop feature, how would this look like in case of iOS? Since xcode isn't really an option for device farms, I've tried libraries like **libimobiledevice, fastlane, cfgutil, SSH+ipainstaller** etc, with partial success only. In the other hand, Cydia Impactor's drag-n-drop interface is quite comfy, takes care of resigning and all, it cannot be automatized for larger-scale usage. Do any of you guys have experience on this? I'm happy to contribute in this btw. @apprayadmin check out https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim and https://github.com/phonegap/ios-deploy this would be useful for ios minicap https://github.com/andrealufino/Luminous It looks like someone has figured out how to do it the STF way with ios devices ... https://kobiton.com/ @sorccu any updates on this ? Sorry for these douchebags, we love to use openstf at my workplace and we really respect your work.

https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/14/why-9-41-am-is-the-always-the-time-displayed-on-iphones-and-ipad/ I spend some time looking at how you could implement minitouch in recent iOS versions. The gist of it is: you can't, but I think you can get close.

VNC servers on iOS 5 and below use IOHIDEvents but that route is now closed for iOS apps.

The only way that I know of to inject touch events in an iOS device is via Xcode UI Test, the same framework the Facebook WebDriverAgent and Appium build upon.

Any XCUITest application interacts with a service call `testmanagerd` which does use IOHIDEvents to synthesize touches.

The communication between the XCUITest and `testmanagerd` (and eventualy IOHIDEvents) runs via the [`XCTestManager_ManagerInterface `](https://bootstraponline.github.io/xcuitest/Xcode_7.2_(7C68)/private_docs/html/Protocols/XCTestManager_ManagerInterface.html) interface.

You can send touch events via the `_XCT_performTouchGesture` method.

There are limitations, though. You are required to send the _entire_ gesture (from touch down to touch up) before it is performed. That means you can't implement a real-time touch mirroring protocol on top of it. For example, for a long touch or a swipe operation, you would first need to let the user perform the swipe before you can replay the swipe. Some UI clients solve this problem by "drawing" the gesture on the screen before it is replayed; but there will always be a lag.

That said, `_XCT_performTouchGesture` executes nearly instantly; there are definitive no second-long delays. I think the delays @sorccu has seen in WDA stem from the fact that WDA contains a lot of synchronisation points where WDA will wait for, for example, transitions and animations to stop before executing any operation.

Long story short, if you can get creative and can account for the fact that you can only replay a gesture on the device after the user has performed the entire gesture, you can use WDA to build a fairly decent remote control solution on top of it. Hello everyone! Any news about iOS support? iOS 11 introduced screenshare option. Maybe this'll help. @sorccu nobody including your team? I suppose this has least priority than ability to connect emulated devices to stf. That's bad. I can't find any solutions to create own iOS-device farm. @sorccu I'm just asking, no offence. You already made very powerful tool, no doubt. I know that I'm in no position to demand something from opensource project. About funding - I thought that you have some sponsorship from Headspin. 
 About priorities - It was a question about feature roadmap. @glolsh if you scroll up a few messages you'll see someone recommended http://kobiton.com - I've heard they provide on-prem android and ios device farm options as well, it's not free though. Wish I could figure out how they did fluent screen capturing with iPhones... :)   @sorccu hi, if you come up with business model, plans and roadmap, i'm pretty sure you'll have more contribution than just a few bug ticket posters. Many of open source software succeeded that way, and your tool is awesome, why not making it even better? :)  @apprayadmin thank you! Also I agree with you about "plans". If I (and other people too, I think) would be sure that this functionality is going to be implemented, I would donate some money.
upd: these guys in kobition allow only testing and autotesting, no way to develop there. Agree with glolsh. I think this certainly deserve funding. I will talk to my organization about this. Team, 
I just want to give one heads up here. Currently I am using Macaca App inspector for object identification in IOS. The XCTestWD agent installed in the device can emulate real device screen, right now atleast we can give an option in OpenSTF to show the connected device screen. But the problem is we cannot control the device, if we have that device control option it will be great for us to continue in IOS also in Open STF. Just check through, and it may be helpful for us.

Regarding Funding,
Will talk to my Company also. Lets rock this.  @rdhandapani88 this method has been talked before metioned as WDA here is an interesting project https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/ScreenRecorder Looks like it can be used for showing display, not for controlling it. https://github.com/manishPatwari/WebDriverAgent We have tried to improve upon the WebDriverAgent provided by Facebook.

**Enhancements:**
- We have created a node server which would be able to connect to several web and device clients through web sockets.
- Web sockets in mobile clients have introduced two way communication and improved the speed significantly
- The screenshots of the devices are being casted in the background thread from mobile clients for optimisation towards unblocking of the actions
- Added the functionality of supporting multiple devices (both simulator and real ones) with a lock enabled when a device is being used

_NOTE_: This is a POC from our side and still requires more work. You would be more than welcome to contribute towards making this even better.

Special thanks to @shubhankaryash for contributing in this @manishPatwari 

Great work! Very impressive the performance improvements that you made upon the Facebook's WebDriverAgent.  can u provide some gif videos? recommended using LiceCap @codeskyblue We have recorded the video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGJAKXdfrgM  @manishPatwari 
Just Awesome! Thank you so much! I was able to launch on some Simulator but not able on real ones.
I got no device connected with real ones even the build and test OK.

> If there is no devices, run the WebDriverAgentRunner testRunnerSocket
Could you possibly tell a little more about this?

I'm sorry for asking here because there is no place on the forked project to ask about that! @manishPatwari
The root cause (as I saw from the log) is the socket is not connected for the real ones but not sure which one triggered that... @manishPatwari allow Issue creation on your repo please. @TuHuynhVan You have to update the Socket path in this file : https://github.com/manishPatwari/WebDriverAgent/blob/master/WebDriverAgentLib/Routing/FBWebSocket.m  ,

Replace "localhost" with the ip address where Node server is running. @glolsh I have enabled issue creation and also created reference issue in my repo .
https://github.com/manishPatwari/WebDriverAgent/issues/1  @sorccu we were trying to do so:) Team,
Entire World is waiting for this precious solution for iOS with OpenSTF. STF team can consider manishPatwari's webdriver agent implementation of mirroring and accessing connected IOs devices. I know you guys are busy with other stuff's. But to make openSTF more power ful with IOs, we all should be united. Team need to tell, what they want actually ? what is blocking. Regards.  I installed requirements and STF (npm install -g stf). But I could not run properly. I created the folder as  says in error, but did not work.

i am puzzled
 @jc5055 This usually happens when there's a permissions issue with node and using the global flag. There are some other possibilities for it as well. See: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/132
 @sorccu @jonalmeida 
thank you
i got
the problem is a permissions issue with node,
to use "sudo npm install --unsafe-perm --verbose -g stf " instand of "sudo npm install -g stf" ,the problem is  solve

  some devices , the logcat is really fast , and it often cause the page to die when i open logcat and wait for a while , how to solve this problem
 the log in stf ui
I find the reason , it's because the logcat puts chinese encoded with utf8 , and the logcat module cannot parse chinese , but i do not know how to make it compatible with chinese .
do you have any suggestions?
 You don't need to do anything with the Chinese, it's not the reason that makes the UI die.
You will find out the binary.js in the adbkit-logCat which is in the node_modules, some parser codes have problems. If you have the android source code, you can see that a struct about logcat has changes when the target > 19(maybe 21, I forgot), the cursor is not on the correct index on the entry buffer when program want read the time, pid, tid... , so in the page, we can see a lot of strange contents  which make no sence.
In a word, when target<=19, the length of entry data is less than the same data when target>19, change the cursor, and maybe you need a "if-else", then everything will work.
 I also encountered this problem , if I open the logs, sometime later, the browser will die! 
Do you have any solutions about this problem? 
 Hi @l674964417 ,

I'm not sure that it will solve your problem but you can change:
       var maxEntriesBuffer = 3000
defined in : res/app/components/stf/logcat-table/logcat-table-directive.js
to some smaller value, lets say 500 even less(everything depends mostly from how much information is stored for each line of log produced by logcat). What is important. This is not perfect solution, as you will decrease number of information stored in logcat buffer. It should solve your problem, but this problem should be fixed in proper way. I'm working on some modifications under logcat section for STF. I have hope that I will find some time to finish it during this weekend and I will try ask somebody from STF team, to look at my changes.  @l674964417 @lukzeg It's indeed a problem that the web page of STF would hang when logcat output at a fast and furious rate. My solution is adding rate limiter both in websocket and device components:

```javascript
    var RateLimiter = require('limiter').RateLimiter
    var logcatRateLimiter = new RateLimiter(10, 'second') // allow 10 msg to be sent every 1 second
    ... ...
    .on(wire.DeviceLogcatEntryMessage, function (channel, message) {
        if (logcatRateLimiter != null) {
             logcatRateLimiter.removeTokens(1, function () {
               if (logcatRateLimiter != null) {
                 socket.emit('logcat.entry', message)
               }
             })
       }
```

@sorccu It might be a performance problem in Browser, any suggestion to resolve this kind of problem?  When doing:

```
adb connect HOST:PORT
adb install app.apk
```

I'm seeing transfer speeds of about 100 KB/s

When I instead forward the main adb port:

```
killall adb
ssh -L 5037:localhost:5037 HOST &
adb install app.apk
```

I see a speed of: 3424 KB/s
 Confirmed it's fast when running over localhost:

```
adb -s localhost:7403 push file /sdcard/delme
4892 KB/s (543576 bytes in 0.108s)
```

Over ssh tunnel to myself:

```
ssh -N -L 6000:localhost:7403 localhost &
adb connect localhost:6000
adb -s localhost:6000 push file /sdcard/delme
1578 KB/s (543576 bytes in 0.336s)
```

And over the network, it's always at around 100 KB/s

Dug through the code but see no obvious place where things are awry :(
 Nice! I've still been using stf (just with manual ssh adb forwarding). So I'll be happy to verify whether it's fixed with that once it's landed / there's an easy way to check.
 Updated to v1.1.1, but sadly the speed was a whopping 32kb/s 
 The stf update required me to update my version of rethinkdb, so def. did get updated.
 Sadly, that won't be allowable :(. I'm fine to live with it since forwarding 5307 is a reasonable work-around. I am curious to see if anyone else hits the problem though.
 hello,
Yes, I have also this problem on "ADB connect" issue, it is a real one while accesssing a remote device located very far of you as from France to China for example.

Moreover, the work around using the SSH tunnel has some drawbacks:
- the ADB client version and the ADB server version must be compatible, otherwise it does not work, for example a ADB client 1.0.39 is not compatible with a ADB server 1.0.36

- the client has SSH credentials to connect to the server, so it is not very secure

- no ADB server has to run accidentally on the client which requires a special system configuration

- all server devices are seen as locally attached on the client side, so the client totally bypasses the controlling of devices by other third party software (i.e. STF), which may lead to inconsistent situations

In synthesis, this work around is very useful for test platforms but not for production ones, so it will be great to fix the "ADB connect" issue.

Thanks  Can I use STF to debug an app running in android emulator?
  Thanks for your great sharing and reply! I have got STF running via stf local and now I want to try deploying STF to actual servers.But I have some questions need your help.(I want to deploy the platform on two hosts,each host connected to several devices for testing,the OS of hosts is Ubuntu 15.04 )
1.Whether I need to deploy the local Requirements at every host at first (like Node.js >= 0.12,ADB properly set up ,GraphicsMagick ,RethinkDB >= 2.0.0,ZeroMQ ,Protocol Buffers,and pkg-config as stf local) before deploying STF to actual servers like DEPLOYMENT.md?
2.If I don't use Authorization method when I testing the platform,neither OAuth2.0 nor LDAP,How can  I set up the "SECRET=YOUR_SESSION_SECRET_HERE" in stf-app@.service,stf-auth@.service,stf-websocket@.service? How to deal with "AUTHKEY=YOUR_RETHINKDB_AUTH_KEY_HERE_IF_ANY" in rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service.
Thanks!
 Hi sorccu,thanks for your replay.I'll have a try,maybe I‘ll need to ask you for further help!
 Hi sorccu,when i use the command "sudo docker pull openstf/base:v1.0.1" it will show "Error while pulling image:Get https://index.docker.io/v1/repositories/openstf/base/images: net/http: TLS handshke time".

when i  create the docker image in the current directory of Dockerfile with the command "sudo docker build .",it will show "Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v1/repositories/openstf/base/tags/v1.0.1:dial tcp 54.152.161.54.443: i/o timeout".

How can i resolve the question?
 Thanks a lot! I‘m interested in this platform!But I haven't used systemd and docker before,
Now,I have create the units(rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service,adbd.service,stf-provider@.service and other files of '.service' ) under the  directory of "/etc/systemd/system",Can you describe the other implementation steps in detail?

This is the new question with docker build -t openstf/base:v1.0.1 .

 Hi,sorccu,I'm sorry to bother you again.

I have created the docker image(openstf/base:v1.0.1) by the method like below：
1.$docker search openstf/base
2.$docker pull openstf/base:v1.0.1
3.$docker images,then i can see

I have create the units in the path of /etc/systemd/system
    adbd.service
    stf-provider@.service
    rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service
    stf-app@.service

    stf-triproxy-app.service
    stf-triproxy-dev.service
    stf-websocket@.service  and ngnix.service

Then I change the configuration of nginx like DEPLOYMENT.md,
In addition to the above comes,I have installed RethinkDB separetely.

But, I don't know how to get the platform running,I tested it by the following method:
1.open a new terminal,input the command "rethinkdb" (like stf local)

2.open a new terminal,input the command "sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 openstf/base:v1.0.1",the result is "yuancc@STF:~$ sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 openstf/base:v1.0.1
e3392b09e421056c2fa7df3be715c439b858003c51783c28337b506ebff8a266
yuancc@STF:~$ "

3.input the URL(https://stf.example.org/) in my browser,it will be show"Server not found"
Maybe it's wrong,or I missed something?I want to run it on my PC at first,and then i will try deploy it on several hosts.

Can you tell me the correct and detailed steps to take the platform running? 

Looking forward to your reply!
Thanks!
 Hi,sorccu!I have learned the basic knowledge about docker and systemd.
But I don't know the meaning of commands like "ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill %p,docker rm %p",when I start the units(like rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service),I can check the status with the command of "$systemctl status rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service ",it will show

"root@OMTL-STF:/home/yuancc# systemctl status rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service -l

I can't start the unit stf-migrate.service, the status is

this kind of question will be emerge where have the command like "docker kill %p".how can i deal with it?

others:
I can find 5 images in my the list of images when i run the command "$docker images".

and i start rethinkdb in a new terminal:"$rethinkdb"like "stf local",then i start rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service "$systemctl start rethinkdb-proxy-28015.service",then start the migrate unit "$systemctl start stf-migrate.service"but it failed!

Sorry to trouble you again.
  I find the device object has a channel and device's owner has a channel and device's provider has a channel, i don't really know what do these channels used for? can anybody have a explanation?

Any help will be appreciated, thanks for making this project!
 It is a Senter PDA (custom chinese phone), here is the output: https://gist.github.com/mitoyarzun/4fccf90b448b34ff8bb9
 Exactly like that ;)

The screen is resistive and it has a custom Android 4.1 ROM.
 run ```getevent -ilp``` on my device,  print out

  Hi,
I have a problem, here's my scenario:
- i have run 'rethinkdb' and 'stf local --public-ip x.x.x.x'
- open browser and access x.x.x.x:7100
- i can see list of my devices connected. But the screen is grey and i can't get any information about the device.

It's normal if i access locally. Am i missed something?
 My firewall is already off. I even cannot save ADB Key from other machine.
Is there other setting to do? Or only run stf local --public-ip ?
  As we have dozens of mobile devices we have to connect devices to different servers, then how to setup a central server to access all the devices?
 get it, thanks a lot.
we may be back to you when we got some troubles. :)
  Hi, thank you for your great app. I want to use node --debug to have a better understand of how it works. I tried node -- debug cli local, but it failed, both in node version 0.10 and 0.12. I googled and learned that this is a clustered app and all the workers attempted to listen on the same debug port. So how do you debug in your development? Can I set breakpoint on it? Can I debug it or part of it separately?
 Can anyone help on this? 
@YuxinZhou, do you have any progress?
 https://strongloop.com/strongblog/whats-new-nodejs-v0-12-debugging-clusters/
 Thx, sorccu sen. Just try to debug stf modules by node-inspector separately. As you mentioned, the node debugger is a little annoying.. 
  Hi 

Firstly, thanks for you great project.
I have a question about how to expand device pool to 100+? Suppose one PC has 4 motherboard's USB ports, and each one connects to a usb hub with 7 ports. It can only connect to 28 devices, how we can expand to 100+? 
  Hi,

I know STF provides authentication units for OAuth 2.0, LDAP, mock. When we run stf with this command "stf local", it will use mock implementation which only asks for a name and an email address.

But I want to use true user authentication by LDAP, suppose that we have a LDAP server like xxxx.xxxx.xxx:222,  but how I run STF and use which command?  Please  help give some guidance, thanks a lot.
 Thanks for you quick answer, I know this command but not so familiar with the options which stf auth-ldap provided. Hope you can paste a complete command sample for LDAP.
 ok, thank for you answer and I will try.
 @sorccu 

I want to authenticate users in stf against an existing LDAP server, I tried to use this command to lauch stf: 

##### stf local --auth-type ldap --auth-options '["--ldap-url","ldap://myldapserver"]'

But it display below error after I click the login button in ldap login page.

 I've been trying to enable LDAP authentication with the auth module service file. I am getting what is probably a mix of syntax and comprehension errors. I do have people I can go to for figuring out what parameters I need for LDAP, but I'll need to make sure I get the syntax right before I waste peoples time. Is this the right way to add the variables to the run command in a service file?

  Hi,May I ask a question? When I click Screenshots, I can see a picture in the window of Screenshots , but I can't open the image when I click it,The new window will be prompted“The image http://localhost:7100/s/image/75eaef9a-0504-4a2c-8ffa-0d17ab1c3963/0e8bc602.jpg cannot be displayed because it contains errors”.
I have been troubled by the problem for several days,Looking forward to your answer,Thanks
 yuancc, hi, I had similar problem, so maybe my experience will help.
The problem was with GraphicsMagick indeed.
I installed it from source, following instructions on GraphicsMagick official site, and I faced exactly the same problem you are describing.
After I removed it and installed from my ubuntu repository, screenshots repaired.
https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/20
 hi,sorccu and rseek,thanks for your reply! My problem has been solved by the method of rseek !
But now, I want to ask another question! How to set the rights of login?,everyone can login the platform of STF if he/she know my URL via his/her name and E-mail. In this case, there is a big security risk, where can I change it? Only through change from the source code ?

  Hello,
I'm trying to run STF with Docker, but I got an error

Do you have an idea about the issue?
 ok, then it would be easier to install all Requirements by hand without Docker, no?
 @sorccu regarding OS X + Docker support, if I configure Virtualbox to forward USB ports to guest boot2docker machine would it work? Or using something like https://bitbucket.org/chabernac/adbportforward/wiki/Home ? The last one sounds a bit like a jerry rig.
  i run on my android tv box and gets this error 
minicap error: "ERROR: (external/MY_minicap/src/minicap_17.cpp:123: errno: Invalid argument) Unable to lock next buffer BAD_VALUE (-22)"
is it something wrong with my android device or can i do something to fix it?

Can you help?

 Hi,
stf -V
1.0.7
 No, I built it.
I went and installed with your command, and it now works.
Go figure. ;-)
Thanks.
 Well, I did it on an Ubuntu while using the root user I'm afraid.
sudo -E npm install -g
sudo -E bower --allow-root install
  What about adding a section **Folders** (like Dashboard, Screenshots, Automation, Advanced & Info)  and use `adb shell ls` to list all of them and each folder, for ex. `adb shell ls sdcard`. 
And then on each file(that the user can access) use `adb pull` ?
 I got the same in mind. Is anybody already implementing this or can I take the lead ? 
 Yeah, I meant as contribution @gunta . I'll create a fork and a branch called "FileExplorer" and let you know when I got something implemented for you guys to test. 
 @vrunoa Any progress on this issue?
 hey @codeskyblue , tonight i'll commit some implementations I made. 
 @vrunoa good. currently I only finished download file from a specific path. but list and file explorer not done any yet.
 File Explorer added in https://github.com/openstf/stf/pull/89 and it is very useful;
Though it supports only downloading files.
Looking forward to seeing Uploading files (not only .apk), cuz it would be very useful feature too.
 Should this issue closed, because there is FileExplorer now.
 My pleasure. Great work for the STF team.
  Hello guys,

Thanks for this awesome tool. I had fun in setting up this locally and its quite useful for debugging my apps.

The kind of feature I wish from STF is running UI Test Suites (Appium, Robotium, monkey runner etc) **parallel** on **multiple devices** similar to services such as [testdroid](http://testdroid.com/), [AWS Device Farm](http://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/) etc.

For this, they provide a feature for creating custom device pool where user can create a device group of their target devices. Then you upload your apk file and test suites then they will run your test and provide test results. They also provide apis for these features which makes CI integration easier.

I think it will be really helpful to have this kind of facility On-premises. It will give better control.

I want to know if this feature or something similar to this, is in your roadmap? If it is, please share how you want to implement this. I will be glad to contribute :)

Thanks,
 Thanks for reply,

> At first we're just planning on just creating a fairly simple API to reserve devices with the desired features, with the possibility to enumerate the devices in the response and adb connect to them yourself.

This can be a good start. 

One limitation with this model which I can see now is, client(using "adb connect" api) will be running the test suites instead of STF. Client will be storing test results. It will be difficult to manage test history on STF in this model. Moreover, this limitation is only when if we want to support test history or project management on STF. User can always use CI tools such as Jenkins to manage project and test history by running test on Jenkins slaves machine using STF apis.

I will start digging up STF source code and try to come up with system requirements and possible designs related to test automation.
 Hi @sorccu ,

The kind of automation which I currently want to do is as follow:
- Run android monkey test and Appium test on multiple devices parallel from script.

From current STF, I can do this by doing:
1.) Connect all the required devices from STF web app
2.) Get Remote Debug Command string corresponding to each device
3.) Run remote debug command locally and get all devices connected
4.) Run monkey or appium test
5.) Disconnect devices from STF web app

In order to automate this fully, person will require apis which can lock and unlock desired device for him. And he will also need "Remote Debug Command String" which he can run locally to connect remote device.

I checked STF code and found that you have implemented some minimal apis [here](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/app/index.js#L127-L202). By using these apis, person can get list of all devices and device info/status. But there is no api for locking a device.

I am proposing to implement two more end points which are as follow:
1.) `/app/api/v1/devices/:serial/lock`
2.) `/app/api/v1/devices/:serial/unlock`

The "lock" endpoint will do the same thing when user click "Use" button for a device and in response it will return device information (`/app/api/v1/devices/:serial`) + remote debug command string. 

The "unlock" endpoint will release the device from user same when a user click "Stop Using" button.

If you like this idea, then I will start designing apis and implementing code. If you have other suggestions please share.

Thanks,
 Hi, @vbanthia, @sorccu, 
I just wanted to vote for approach offered by @vbanthia, and I think providing API to lock/unlock (maybe lock/unlock are not best words cuz it causes mess with screen locking) - is more or less simple but very useful step in this path to automation, because it makes stf easy-integrable in existing automated testing environments
 @rseek 

lock/unlock can be changed with reserve/release. But lets wait for @sorccu  opinion, what he suggests.
 Thanks for the opinions. I will start working on it soon :).
 +1 . If someone is already working on this I'd be glad to help.
 :+1: 
 Well, I stopped in between. Writing my research and one of the approaches to implement this feature.

## Authentication
- Every request to stf-app unit (api provider) goes through [auth middleware](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/app/middleware/auth.js) which checks for valid session-id. If your request does not have a session id, it will redirect it to auth server to create a new session. So you need to modify this auth middleware such that it can forward request even it has only [jwt token](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/app/middleware/auth.js#L8)
- Next step will be to develop a feature which can provide users their jwt token. Best way would be to create a section in "Setting" tab and show users their jwt token like github.
- Next, you need to get rid of csrf checking for RESTful apis. One way to do is check csrf after RESTful api section.

After this you will be able to access all STF apis from any http client library using command line.

## Implement reserve/release endpoints
- You will be going to implements these new endpoints in [stf-app unit](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/app/index.js)
- For this just mimic the [websocket unit](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/websocket/index.js) and do the same things what websocket unit does when it gets [reserve](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/websocket/index.js#L614-L631) and [release](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/lib/units/websocket/index.js#L632-L643) messages. 
- You need to add app side push sockets and push group.join and group.kick messages to processor and inform all the websocket subscriber about the event so that people who are using web browser can also be updated.
- For remote debugging you need to send `connect.start` message to server and get remote debug url.

## Implement client

Last part being implement a good stf command line client which can use these endpoints easily.

I hope this will help.
 I recently found out about [Square's Spoon](http://square.github.io/spoon/) tool, which would be a nice add-on for STF. I also saw that @sorccu made some of contribs there, so he's aware of the project at least. I don't think we should re-invent the wheel and use what's already available, any thoughts?
 > you can use the preliminary UI for the access tokens in res/app/settings/keys/access-tokens

That's great. One less task to do.
 Good conversation. I had to read this issue first.
I'm making similar requirements on "booking" PR. Actually The feature aimed to combinate other Test Automation tool.
This is deferent approach. Very interesting.
 Hi @vbanthia i wanted to run Espresso test test are you planning to do that soon as well ?
And Are you planning to use spoon as well?
Thanks and Regards,
 Yashasvi.
 Thanks @vbanthia  :) for replying so soon,
i will try running Espresso test. I wanted to edit code and add few UI and Functionality to run test.
Basic Idea:
1) Select Devices to run tests ,
2) Upload test Apk and ,
3) run test through a UI Button in web interface,
4) And display the execution of the devices selected 

Also,
I am new to this can you please tell me how to run the code after editing.

Thanks,
Yashasvi.
 Using Jenkins , I was able to set up a fully functional Test Automation structure and running it successfully now .
Here is how I am doing this : 
1. Run jenkins in a docker container. Here is the link to docker file. 
https://github.com/PrabhatPandey/Jenkins-docker
2.Run STF in a docker container. 
3.Occupy all the devices for automation in jenkins container through STF-apis ie. remote connect.
4. Use Spoon runner in Jenkins to create the reports of the automation results. 
"java -jar spoon-runner-1.3.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    --apk ExampleApp-debug.apk \
    --test-apk ExampleApp-debug-androidTest-unaligned.apk --grant-all"












 @PrabhatPandey thank you for you solution  I would like to ask how fast are you able to execute tests  on real devices ? With Appium it Took me around 1 minute to init() real device. My boss expects around 15 seconds. I cant try it I am out of space on this linux machine :dancing_men:  @trix0 I allocate the devices using open-stf apis. Allocation happens instantly. After allocation is done ie 'adb devices' shows you the list of devices then it's pretty straightforward from there.   i don't want the auth module , and i tried to disable it , but i don't have req.user in js
is it possible to disable auth module?
  I'm trying to use STF with a tablet Asus Nexus 7 with Android 4.2.2.
The device is controllable but the preview is grey and always grey.

The same in the Node Terminal that launch "stf local".
 @sorccu This is the same issue that I'm seeing that I mentioned in #31 .

 @sorccu Here is the output: https://gist.github.com/jonalmeida/38ea576eeba5dedc4c43

It includes the the shutdown logging as well right after startup.
 Here are logs with some interaction that shows up on the device, but I still can't see anything here. (This is via `stf local` only though): https://gist.github.com/jonalmeida/278f7b8eef52913886e2

  Hello guys,

I'm investigating STF and I'm facing a limitation:
On the real device, i've a "system" button that display all the currently running application. On this "task manager" view, I can kill some process. On the control screen of STF, there are 3 buttons: "Menu", "Home" and "Back". On my real device, there are 3 buttons: "System", "Home" and "Back".

How to simulate a click on this "System" button ?
How to replace the "Menu" button by a "System" button ?
Does exist a way to display the "task manager" view with STF ?
What is the Shell command to kill an Android process ?

Thanks for your answers.
 You can do this from a shell, by first doing:
1. `adb connect [ip_given_in_STF]`.
2. You can grep through to find the pid of your app: `ps | grep 'com.example'`
3. Kill the app using the pid you find from there: `kill [pid_goes_here]`

Side note: If you wanted to uninstall your app, you can do that from adb as well: `adb uninstall com.example`
  Hello,
I would like to repport a bug i'm facing with the Sony Xperia S on Android 4.0.4:
I control the Smartphone without any problem. This real device has a material camera button. A long press on it launch the camera application.

On the Advanced Tab of STF, a clic on the Camera button has no effect. A Long clic neither.

In addition, if on the device I launch the camera, the screen is black (but all controls are okay). See this attachment:

  hi, my computer doesn't has systemd and it uses init , can stf deploy on my computer?
and my computer only has one port for public net and the port is 80, how can i deploy stf on my computer and visit it from the public net?
thank you for this wonderful project , it helps me a lot
  Android 4.4+ have a built-in support for screen recording:

```
shell@mako:/ $ screenrecord --help                                             
Usage: screenrecord [options] <filename>

Android screenrecord v1.2.  Records the device's display to a .mp4 file.

Options:
--size WIDTHxHEIGHT
    Set the video size, e.g. "1280x720".  Default is the device's main
    display resolution (if supported), 1280x720 if not.  For best results,
    use a size supported by the AVC encoder.
--bit-rate RATE
    Set the video bit rate, in bits per second.  Value may be specified as
    bits or megabits, e.g. '4000000' is equivalent to '4M'.  Default 4Mbps.
--bugreport
    Add additional information, such as a timestamp overlay, that is helpful
    in videos captured to illustrate bugs.
--time-limit TIME
    Set the maximum recording time, in seconds.  Default / maximum is 180.
--verbose
    Display interesting information on stdout.
--help
    Show this message.

Recording continues until Ctrl-C is hit or the time limit is reached.
```
 I usually record some app behaviour with this command. I am looking for something like the screenshots feature but for taking screencasts. 
 ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3281689/9869020/f14f56d8-5bb1-11e5-9af3-f09ab224d5ee.png)

I make a continous screenshot button. I call it screen capture. If you feel that useful, I will make a pr or just ignore me.
 Pull requested.
 it would be nice to record it to a video format or a gif
 Any update on this feature ? I feel it would really help exchange between developer <-> QA.
 Today, I think use `ffmpeg` to convert images to video is a better way.
  I have a Galaxy Nexus connected to an Ubuntu machine which doesn't seem to show the screen sharing at all (all I see is grey). Everything else about the device connect to OpenSTF, i.e. I can interact with the device with my mouse on the grey screen and I see it on my phone, adb connect, etc.

I realize this isn't much details to work on, but please let know what other details I can provide to help debug this.

Yes, I forgot to mention that this happens with only two devices I've tried (Galaxy Nexus and Asus Transformer TF-101) I don't have the details on the Transformer on me at the moment; will update later.

With a Nexus 5 & Nexus 9, up-to-date on Lollipop, there are no issues as well as an Asus Transformer Prime.
 Referencing the comments in #36 , I wonder if there is a dependency on my setup that's missing..

I'll try using the docker container and see how that fairs, but I'm expecting the same results.
 > Can I ask what specs you have on your computer (both the STF app server and your local client if different)?

Right now, I'm testing this all locally on the same server machine which is a fresh install of Ubuntu 15.04.

Graphics: GeForce GTS 240 (default nouveau drivers)

There is some network i/o going on (comparing it to a working Nexus 5), but there isn't any change when interacting with the device while I can see the interactions taking place irl.

Here are the HAR logs with and without interaction with the device: https://www.dropbox.com/s/36zrssykcckvgn3/HAR%20logs.zip?dl=0

I'd be happy to help via screen sharing, if we can't figure out the issue otherwise!
 is there any relation with Serial Number of the phone? Because i have same problem and I found something weird about Serial Number, it's 0123456789ABCDEF
 @gunta no, my another devices has different unique serial number. I don't know, is serial number is an unique id for android device? Oh ya for this issue, i found this on log:

INF/device:plugins:touch 12533 [0123456789ABCDEF] Launching screen service

is there any relation about this issue?
 @swarawan I don't think there's any relation, but this might be a separate issue entirely. The serial for my device where I see this issue is correctly identified.
 @sorccu my team found that websocket is still direct to localhost even access from different ip (using --public-ip). what should i do then?

![11pasted_image_at_2015_08_07_01_02_pm copy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/998286/9129738/c560579a-3d05-11e5-9faf-c3a3ac16e43a.png)
 following doc, first install the requirements and its dependencies
`brew install rethinkdb graphicsmagick zeromq protobuf pkg-config`
then setting up ADB. Launch STF:
Start rethinkdb using `rethinkdb`
Start STF using `stf local --public-ip 172.17.2.130` and for local `stf local`

is there something i missed?
 oh ya, i forgot to write on my last comment, i'd installed with `npm install -g stf` . it shown version 1.0.9
 v0.12.7
is there nothing i should to edit somewhere?
 @sorccu were you able to look into this issue? I'd be happy to skype with you to help solve this.
 @swarawan ，
Our problems are the same，can you solve it ?
 @jonalmeida ,
Our problems are the same，can you solve it ?
 Hi everyone!

I've been having the same issue but only in Google Chrome (Version 50.0.2661.75 m, which is the latest as of now) and in Opera. Whereas in Firefox the app is working just alright! I suspect there is a bug going on with this latest version of Chrome. Some colleagues with v. 49 could access STF successfully.

Here's a screenshot of the console output just to share with you all:
![chrome console errors](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14092665/14676617/a2d3fe30-06e4-11e6-93a3-3bd0f8bf5b66.PNG)

I'll be taking a further look on this issue, to see if I can come up with something. Please, let me know if you have encountered the same issue.

Cheers!
 Seems that the following line did the trick :) could also work for other people with similar issues:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`

Thanks for the ideas and support.
  Would that be possible? Currently running raspbian, but I get hit with a lot of installation and configuration. 

Do you have any guides or tips? 
 Awesome! This might come in handy:
- https://iojs.org/en/index.html
- http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/ubuntu/
 I have successfully running on RPi 2 (archlinux) also with RethinkDB. And it works, but only tested with 6 devices.
Note that RethinkDB have an [experimental support on ARM platforms](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/) and you may need to compile on your own.

Thanks for this great project! :wink: 
 Didn't try with docker, but it would be great if it works!
 @arcxyz could you give me a short guide on how you set up the install?
 Taking a [clean Archlinux install](http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/broadcom/raspberry-pi-2#qt-platform_tabs-ui-tabs2) as a starting point, run these commands (extracted from our Pi history):

```
# System Upgrade
pacman -Syu
# STF deps:
pacman -S android-tools nodejs npm graphicsmagick zeromq pkg-config 
# RethinkDB build dependencies
pacman -S base-devel # Select ALL
pacman -S libsodium libpgm protobuf protobuf-c libboost boost boost-libs python2 gperftools python2-pip
# Download rethinkDB sources
curl -O http://download.rethinkdb.com/dist/rethinkdb-2.0.4.tgz
tar zxvf rethinkdb-2.0.4.tgz
 # Change default python version 
ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python
# Configure and build! (it may take hours on Pi)
cd rethinkdb-2.0.4
./configure --with-system-malloc --allow-fetch
make
make install
# finally install stf
npm install -g stf
```

Let me know if you get errors compiling rethinkDB
 Anyone managed to get openstf working on raspbian?
 I have some websocket connection issues. The video stream for devices is blank gray, but I'm pretty sure it's a problem in my network, still investigating. Apart from that, my pi running raspbian is working. Screenshots, remote control (again, without visible video), uploading apps, everything seems good. 

I manually installed raspbian versions of adb and docker, and used the openstf/arm7hf-stf image. Since I am still working on network issues, I haven't stress or stability tested yet.

Important note: The pi is only running the stf-provider service file described in the deployment section, meaning that all the heavy lifting is being done on a beefy server in the cloud. I have no idea if it could handle running everything on its own.
 My raspberry Pi 2 lost device and reconnected every 2 or 3 mins. Does anyone use raspberry could last long time? I am wandering if all the Raspberry pi have the same problem. Thanks.
 Hi sorccu,
Thank you for your advice. I am considering using ODROID-XU4 instead of Raspberry Pi. 
 @sorccu 
One more shot question, which USB hub are you using with ODROID-XU4? Is this one Plugable's USB 2.0 7 Port Hub with 60W Power Adapter?
Thanks. 
 @sorccu 
Thank you for your advice :)
 Running on Raspberry PI 2 with Raspbian, STF not showing any devices. 

I'm running everything on it. Got docker, ADB , rethinkdb all working on host.  Tried docker image. Stf loads and can access web page. But when it loads, I see following message while loading

 @sorccu 
I am using the Odroid XU4 for about a week. The stability of USB port is still not very good. It often reconnect about 5 to 6 hour with 3 devices connecting. Have you tested ODroid already? Could you give me some advice about enhance the stability. Thanks. 
 Thank you for your help. I have tried this method but not work for my ODroid. I have many Odroid all have the same problem. Finally we choose USB HUB 2.0 to enhance the stability.
 I have Open STF running on Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi 3. Still polishing the install and run process. Looking forward to helping contribute any results from my own farm to STF.
 Hi Will (capricornuscipher),
May you publish your installation procedure of STF on Raspbian/PI3 ?
Thanks.
 @capricornuscipher hiho :) Any progress?
 @sorccu adb for arm can be download from here https://github.com/NetEaseGame/AutomatorX/releases/tag/1.0.12
 @denis99999 @pwicherski I am working on some guides and will start publishing soon. I have it working on my RPi3. I've ran it both over Ethernet and WiFi. For now I'm have the RethinkDB for it running on it. I'm also currently attempting to create a WiFi hotspot from the Raspberry Pi for the smartphones. I'm also using python to control the phones over the IP address adb, but for now it's manually set up. I'm considering adding a python API to openSTF. Any suggestions are welcome. Hi @pwicherski<https://github.com/pwicherski>, thank you very much for your answer, since my original request I also progress a lot in this domain and I see we are working exactly on the same issues. From my side I develop a CLI to control in an automatic way devices either in WIFI or usb.

After 8 hours of reading Im understanding docker and stf a little better .... 

I re-flashed my xu4 and started over with docker - I will post something on my own thread when I get absolutely stuck.

Thanks

  So, when navigating to STF, you get redirected to your localhost.

However, if you would want to connect from you iPhone that won't work, because it will just keep looking for the localhost of the phone, not from the other computer running STF. Also, when using a proxy, this won't work.

By just removing the redirect, this issue would be fixed (I guess?). 
 Awesome, thanks for the quick reply! It indeed fixes the issue.

This also enables us to run STF from a rasbperry pi somewhere else in the office, awesome job!
  Really great software! Thanks very much! :+1: 

There is a bit crazy idea - if it is ever possible - to redirect sound input/output to browser?
Might be useful for testing.

What do you think?

Also then one can finally leave phone at home and make calls from browser :-)
 Hello, is there any update for this issue?
Actually I need to check the sound condition for music streaming.
 Hi, do you have an update on this feature since last then? I am more than happy to pay for this feature if it is available. Thanks We have a prototype for that but it requires an extra cable in the
headphone jack (or root)

Could you give me some detail information about the cable, and how it works? @sorccu,  would you please provide some details about that analog audio --> USB converter ? would you kindly share a link to a similar device that I can acquire? Many thanks. The phone connected the PC with a 3mm audio cable, and the service running on the PC received the PCM data from the usb handle, then you can transform the PCM data to web format.

   @likezjuisee  Do you have a GitHub project that sets out relatively complete solutions and ideas?
（有建立GitHub 项目，阐述相对完整的解决思路和方案吗？）  <img width="894" alt="screen shot 2015-07-22 at 11 50 50 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1861729/8833487/8c7b78d2-30cc-11e5-88f8-2f5ecb49e01e.png">
  pkg -config is already installed and its version is pkg-config-0.28
 When I am running the "which -a pkg-config" its not returning anything.

Can you throw some light on how to set the path for this "pkg-config". As my understanding when i am installing through brew it should set the path also.
 Following is the content of $PATH

/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin
 Can you suggest me which is the minimal version of the node i need to install? Currently I have 0.10.33. My other project is dependent on this node version.
 I checked in ReadMe its specified >=0.12. I will upgrade my node and ry out this and update you. 

@sorccu Thanks for your support. 
  Hello!
Thank you for awesome software!

Unfortunately I faced some problem with taking screenshots, I hope you can help me.
When I try to take a screenshot, I see an icon which shows screenshot image is not available:
![torn_minicap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12827469/8823163/26704b46-3084-11e5-93b0-372b8676a4a5.png)
When I try to click this image, I see following error message in a new browser tab:
`The image "http://<my-ip>:7100/s/image/5aac3806-8ba7-4f29-bc49-1bcc1f28dede/<deviceName>.jpg" cannot be displayed because it contains errors.`

I tried to download image by url, and noticed image is just empty file(0 bytes size).

Stf is launched in "local" mode on my ubuntu 14.04 desktop like this:
`stf local --public-ip <my-ip>`
[there is no X server running on desktop, if it is important]
I am trying to take screenshot from my laptop

So, in console log I noticed following messages:
`INF/device:plugins:screen:capture 25422 [<deviceName>] Capturing screenshot
INF/storage:temp 25341 [*] Uploaded "<deviceName>.jpg" to "/tmp/upload_04db85c0a0bff470298192dcaffd7049"
INF/device:support:storage 25422 [<deviceName>] Uploaded to "/s/image/5aac3806-8ba7-4f29-bc49-1bcc1f28dede/<deviceName>.jpg"
`

I checked the file `/tmp/upload_04db85c0a0bff470298192dcaffd7049` and found my screenshot. 
 Thank you for your answer, the problem really was with GraphicsMagick.

Originally I downloaded it from their official site and built from source with `make; make install`.
(Cause in your doc there is a link to their site ;))

But now I installed it from ubuntu repository and uninstalled version from official site and now everything work fine.

Thank you again, and sorry for dumb questions :)
  I can take screenshots and see them.
They are being saved in /var/folders/...
But when I change tabs from screenshot to any other tab and come back to screenshot they are gone from screenshots tab(but they are still saved on disk at /var/folders/...).
 @sorccu 
Have you guys implemented this feature and it is not working? Or you have just skipped the feature?
Can you point me in the direction where have you written the code for the same?
 @sorccu Thanks found it. By state persistence I assume you are talking about client side tab's state. But shouldn't we save the screenshots for a device in db itself so that in the next session user can see his/her screenshots?
 Lost my js chops a few years back. Don't wanna pollute your code. Anyways, I will discuss with my js friends who might pick this if time allows.
Thanks :)

  I had to install pkg-config to get it to work:
$ brew install pkg-config
Perhaps update your documentation.  You can close this as non-issue of course.

 Thanks.  And bada$$ software BTW
  First STF working Great if we connect device via USB.

I was trying to connect device to adb with wifi

```
 adb tcpip 5555
adb connect mobile-ip:5555
```

But now adb show wifi connected device on `adb devices` command but stf display that device as disconnected.
 Figure it out have to pass --allow-remote :)
 hello. my goal is to connect openstf with remote phones via ssh tunnel.

i was trying to get openstf to connect to my android phones via ssh port-forward. basically my phone is connected to a wifi, adb over wifi is enabled, and i just forward the port 5555 to the machine running openstf. i can do "adb connect localhost:5555" and even use "adb shell" and do all the goodies. its not even that slow over ssh, its ok. 

i have been trying to make this work for the last 3 days now, with ubuntu 14 and 16, on a VM, on a physical machine, but no luck. i keep getting the same error.

the error:
when i open localhost:7100 in the browser (chrome, firefox), i see the device, its model number, but as soon as i click on it, it will open the UI and a bit later a dialog pops up "Disconnected. Error. Try to reconnect"

i have tried really everything now. 2 different phones. 2 different Ubuntu (14 and 16), also tried to forward 5037 adb server port instead of the phones 5555 port, but i keep getting the same results.

also tried adb v1.0.32 and v1.0.31

on the machine where openstf is installed, i forwarded 7100 to my laptop, such that i can use Chrome with localhost:7100 - is there any other ports i need to forward? openstf opens a ton of ports.

i dont know whats the problem. i can use "adb shell" just fine on the machine where openstf runs, but openstf just doesnt get booted, here are some logs:

```
stf local --allow-remote localhost:5555

thank you!
 I got the same issue, any resolution yet?
 I got the same issue, any resolution?  What about a view only mode? So if you have automated testing you can view what is going on w/o control the device.
 There is already a feature in which you can see see device screen without other controls. 

Shift + click on device name which you want to use
 relatedly, the feature behind shift-click is amazing and I think it might deserve an icon for discoverability.

but afaict, @tonatiuhromero is asking for blocking input to the viewed device to make sure any accidental hovers wont actually be sent to the device and interfere with the automation.
 Great! that also will allow to see some logs per device?
 @gunta "a screen showing multiple devices at the same time in realtime." seems a very great idea, it will help user easily to monitor devices, how about the progress now?
or can you have some idea for how to implement this.

thanks
  It's crazy good. seriously. Kicks the pants off Chrome devtools screencasting. :)

That said there appears to be something blocking a solid 60fps.

Here's what i'm seeing after profiling the full STF app using `about:tracing`
### one frame of work

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39191/8643213/c664bf52-28e5-11e5-80c2-239c8d04b414.png)

the real thing here is that we're in the resourcefetcher for the blob for a long ass time. that's really what's slowing down this process. 

Here's the start: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/fetch/ResourceFetcher.cpp&q=%22%20TRACE_EVENT_ASYNC_BEGIN2(%22blink.net%22,%20%22Resource%22%22&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&l=901
Here's the end: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/fetch/ResourceFetcher.cpp&q=%22TRACE_EVENT_ASYNC_END0(%22blink.net%22,%20%22Resource%22%22&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&l=797

what's interesting to me is that if i poke inside of the browser process... it reports finishing loading the blob at about halfway: 
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39191/8643444/c35e7304-28e8-11e5-8a74-3b2cb511331c.png)
(the actual "requestcomplete" on the browserthread is offscreen in the screenshot)

it's possible whatever is handling the blob URL is unimplemented, but right now it appears to be taking longer than I'd expect. might be a chrome bug.
### sometimes I see a missed frame

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39191/8643223/f3087d96-28e5-11e5-8c32-efa8b936bb7b.png)

In these cases we do two image decodes and throw one of them away immediately. 
Not sure yet why this is happening.

<hr>

Last thing, I'd consider trying out requestAnimationFrame, only because it provides the scheduler with a lot more information on when you're ready to paint a frame. It has a low-latency mode so you can call rAF immediately once the image has loaded and you should get an instant paint.

<hr>

Here's the trace file i'm looking at: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39519/temp/trace_stf-screencapture.json.gz
 yeah no worries and no rush. i was just curious. nice to see you now can generate frames fast enough that the browser has to catch up. a good problem to have!
 cc @dmurph as this appears to be a decent real-world stresstest  for blob performance in Chrome.
  Not sure if this is related yet.... (and will fork to separate issue if neccessary).

I'd love to see a better **integration with Remote Debugging**. 

The ideal might be something like this:
- For the attached device, you have a listing of the open tabs under the input field to launch a new one.
- You have an inspect button for them, clicking them opens devtools, probably embedded into STF instead of a separate window. So I still get the minicap + interaction of stf but with the full devtools over debugger protocol

about:inspect isn't very hackable however @auchenberg knows of some work that can access the same data. 
(edit: ah he's using adbkit in [adb-devtools-devices](https://github.com/auchenberg/adb-devtools-devices)  :) 

And I think it may be possible to them do a iframe pointing to `chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html?ws=localhost:2015`
 > might make it browser-dependent 

Aye, I think it'd work where there's support. I'm not totally clear on the remote debugging story for Chromium forks, but one would imagine it'd be similar. :)  

> Does this kind of interaction would be possible without requiring the security permissions of a Chrome extension?

It doesn't sound impossible to me yet, but let me confirm these ideas with some engineers on my team first. :) We'll find out how far my ideal is from reality.
 Pitching in here: I've written a little node module that findes devtools targets on a given device via ADB, and setups for the port forwarding, and lists the available remote debuggable tabs. It's early days, but you can see the flow here https://github.com/auchenberg/adb-devtools-devices

It's basically what `chrome://inspect`does for Android devices.
  It was only added to play store a few months ago so no big deal.

APK is `com.chrome.dev`
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.dev

(btw Googlers have access to com.chrome.canary too, but it's not public yet)

  I had two devices up and running. Tried to do adb connect on one of them. It seemed to work but then I had a failure.
Looks like it came from minicap but STF disconnected as a result.

Feel free to close, but figured you'd appreciate the report.

Cheers guys. (This project is blowing my mind)

 I gotcha. Yeah definitely using 1.0.3
In my case I'm running it all on my macbookair. I'll have a moto x and nexus 5 connected by default, maybe more. But then if i `adb connect` for one of these devices, both connections end up failing.  

I see the LOCALHOST entry in chrome:inspect briefly but about 3 seconds later STF dumps it and the `connect` instance is gone from both chrome:inspect and "Disconnected" on the STF device list.  

> I'm currently thinking about perhaps disabling localhost sources from being set up automatically without some command line option

ah no!  that would make it super hard for me.  plus these days the chrome remote debug doesnt need an ADB lock on the devices. so it can share with STF.

I would recommend that for a localhost device, in the Remote Debug block you leave out the `adb connect` field and just say: "hey go to chrome://inspect".  That'd work for me.

>   built-in support for adb connect in Chrome. 

can you point me to the ticket?  

(speaking of performance, the perf of minicap is amazing.)
 Cool. Thanks for working this out with me. I gotta run but will give this a shot tomorrow.

Cheers!
  A couple of typos in the excellent deployment docs. It may be worth bumping the embedded version number to 1.0.3 or a generic tag such as latest or stable? Using the mock auth provider I'm not able to log in, get 302'd to /undefined. Thanks!
 I didn't run a dev environment on my machine, jumped straight to trying to run v1.0.0 on coreos with systemd and docker. The setup was fun, just need to point nginx to an instance of app that's more accessible than the one running in the container. Once I'm there if I'm still stuck I'll open up an issue. Thanks Simo!

 Hi Sorccu,

i used the docker images openstf/stf to run as below,

docker run -t -i --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb -u root -p 7100:7100 openstf/stf /bin/bash

then i installed the rethinkdb/adb then run rethinkdb/stf local.  after that using firefox to open localhost:7100.

then i can see a disconnecting issue but i am not sure why?

Liang
 Hi Sorccu,

it works well on a Mac environemnt (no docker), thanks so much for open source it. 

Liang
 met same problem when I login to stf page  Thank you for a great app! Immediately, we are using.

When you start with "$stf local" command, you can use in the http://localhost:7100, for example, start at IP address, such as 192.168.1.100, and we would like to access from other PC.

The start-up command was some experience, but the connection to the DB is becomes to "127.0.0.1:28015", it can not be started.
*"rethinkdb" is, "- bind all" you have to start it with the option.

In order to use to share the STF is allowed to access from other PC, but I want to start with IP address, Could you tell me how?
 Thanks for the quick reply!
A result, I were able to use without problems.
Thank you!
  The documentation in your `README` for relevant hardware is excellent! You might consider adding another section, with advice on the physical setup of the device farm.

For example: what exactly is shown in the photo at the top of the `README`, with the aluminum(?) slats holding the devices? My initial reaction was a rackmount system, but I would think that we would see holes in the vertical supports, and such holes do not appear in the photo.
 Tks for your help

Can you send to me more pics from your shelf?
I want to build a similar , but with the photos who are on your site is complicated to see the details of it.
How is that cell phones are stuck in the support?

Regards
