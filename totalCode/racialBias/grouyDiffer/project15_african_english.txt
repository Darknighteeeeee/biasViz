@karim @chrisjlocke Would either of you have the time/interest to make something suitable? :smile: "Its wacky and its weird and unlike any other feature you've used."  😉  https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Resizing-Columns Awesome @chrisjlocke.  Just added a link to it from the front page too. :smile: Oh yeah, forgot about that.... doh.  🦀  Probably close it for now.  We're swamped with issues as is, so cutting down on the non-major ones for a while is probably not a bad idea. :smile:
I'm wondering if it's a side effect from b7cd1c7dbd0606d12f6b2ab31451760b39cac82f somehow. :smile: I'll have a go tomorrow... certainly ones from early May were OK.  Yes, nightlies from 18 May and 19 May worked fine.  The nightly from 20 May exhibits the above crash.
I guess the button labels are slightly misleading...

@ulascanerturk In this case just delete ```/usr/local/bin/sqlitebrowser```. That's the only (important) application file that was installed.  ### Details for the issue
- [x] DB4S is a bit weird
@MKleusberg ?
@ankushbbbr As a thought, since you're using a really old version of our program, would you be ok trying one of our latest nightly builds and let us know if the problem still seems the same?
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32/ This is somewhat related to #1005 and might be solved with just the same fix. @ankushbbbr No worries at all. :smile:  In email conversation with @h4yn0nnym0u5e, one somewhat frustrating thing that can crop up when using DB4S (manually, in the "Execute SQL" tab) is getting a join wrong, and the result set tries to return a huge number of rows.  eg 1.6 mill rows
We may need to define something custom for binary/BLOB importing anyway, just so it can be done in the (rare?) cases it's needed.  eg for importing DBHub.io CSV exports that have binary/BLOB data in them If a value of 33 is detected, do you class that as an integer or a real?  ;)
@MKleusberg ?
Just thinking that might be helpful for debugging. :smile: Yep, definitely interested, that would really help. :smile: I've just prepared a test database containing two long lorem ipsum views. ```xx``` is one long line, ```yy``` are many lines. Not sure if they are long enough though. For both views it's struggling (```xx``` prints one long empty line as a tooltip, ```yy``` fills the entire screen with its tooltip) but I never get the weird output from your screenshot.
From memory though, those instructions might be a bit out of date.  I think (without trying it recently), the command to run is "qmake" not "cmake".  You might need to experiment a bit... :wink: I've added an item related to this for my ToDo list for this week.  For that I'll update our Linux compile instructions, and also figure out the environment variables (or whatever else) is needed for using a custom installation of SQLite or SQLCipher: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/dbhub.io/issues/32 No worries. 😄
qmake
cmake ..
What's ADB?
That being said, it's sounding like there's a bad interaction with DB4S + WAL + ADB.  We might be the culprit, or we might not (no idea).  At least there's a workaround for now though. 😁   Hi @kyliostricor, when you say "flipped" that's a bit unclear.  Are you ok to take a screenshot? As a thought, is there any chance you've clicked on a column header in the Browse Data tab?
@treddy73 When you've got it worked out, are you ok to close this issue?  (am just trying to keep the open issue count not completely out-of-control :wink:)  Thanks @NF1198, that's good info.  Foreign key stuff is directly of interest for @MKleusberg, so he'll likely dig into it in the next few days. :smile: Out of curiosity, is the data set which triggers the crash public?
First, what's "RIT"?
@ofelius ping?
I'll add the sqlb_uk_UA.ts file in the next few days.  Did you base the translation upon our latest development code (eg our "master" branch), or upon something else? I'm attempting to get this working in a branch here:

***Note*** - This next dialog is for exporting to JSON.  There was a bug with the code, so the window title said "CSV" instead of JSON.  Fixed earlier today. :wink: ace89f124d143fb7e594f16b399a35df8059f436

- [x] Various other dialogs
https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/tree/ukrainian_version2
Try one of the nightlies here:
Does pressing Tab change the focus?  I've not got a Mac to test this on. It's probably not a bad idea to include some shortcuts for switching between tables via keystroke. :smile: @rodrigozanatta It's unlikely to happen in the next fortnight.  Our main developer for DB4S is on holiday for a few weeks, and I'm working on server side stuff in a different language completely. :wink: Still on holiday, so just a quick note from my side: I think we already have exactly what you're asking for, @rodrigozanatta :smiley: When you're using a recent nightly build you should be able to switch tables using the ```Ctrl + PageDown``` and ```Ctrl + PageUp``` shortcuts. Awesome.  Thanks @MKleusberg. :smile:  That's strange.  DB4S asks for a password when it can't recognise the file as a database, so it assumes it's an encrypted one.  Thus the "what's the password?" dialog. :wink:
I would, but my headspace is a long way from Qt/C++ at the moment. 👼  Looks good :smile: Thanks a lot for this, @dridk :+1:   Interesting.  Sounds like our transaction control bits are/were interfering with setting pragmas.
@zhanghedr Interesting.  That's the first time a problem like this has been mentioned.
So I'm wondering what sort of logic I could implement to support your case (maybe even ignoring collisions) but also to not screw it up for non-random default values :smiley:  Are you sure Android is looking at the right place?  sqlite is a bit 'weird' in that if it can't find the file, it tends to create a blank file.  The file structure in Android is also quite 'involved' with quite nested 'directories'.
@awi1369 Was that with version 3.9.1?  If so, do you have time to try our latest nightly build?  The behaviour may be different in that. :smile:
2) And what do you get when you open this file? [test2.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/735963/test2.txt) It's the same file but with a Unicode BOM added.
Hmmm, that's weird.
I'll give it a go now. For the SQLCipher build it's implementation gets used for both encrypted and non-encrypted databases.  So yep, you're probably right.  Lets experiment a bit with the build script now and figure out what does and doesn't work. :smile: @pmoorelegistek @aludee Do you have time to try these out?
I can only apply little fix that prevents crash right now. Cool, sounds like progress in the right direction. :smile: Yeah, I don't there is much more that we can do right now. In order to support the foreign key tooltip + shortcut for queries in the Execute SQL tab we'd have to parse and understand SELECT statements and those can become quite complex. We'd need a mechanism to track which column in the results table comes from which column of which table in the database. It's the same effort that's needed to implement editing in the results view (see #393, and #141 as well). @MKleusberg Should this be closed then?

Note - This is a cheating approach, but it works 😁
@karim Can you test tomorrow's nightly build to see if it's working for you? :smiley: @chrisjlocke Any interest in updating the Filters page on the wiki with this new operator? :smile: Just updating the wiki, but ... well, its not working for me....
Changing it to integer works as required.  (`*flushes head down toilet*`) No worries, it took me some time to figure this out, too :smiley: And it wasn't even the first time this confused me :wink:  Thanks for reporting this.  I'm pretty sure someone else has mentioned this happening to them a few months ago too, but I'm not finding the bug report about it just yet.
Yeah, we kind of do already.  We first try to detect if it's a database file, and if it's not recognisable then we assume it's an encrypted file instead.  So, we then pop open a dialog asking for a password (etc).
Is there any chance of a copy of the database causing issues? If it is just the schema, then the data can be removed from the database. @iseldonz This sounds very much like a problem with our SQL parser. As @chrisjlocke said, it'd be best to have a look at your table schema. It's sufficient to just have the schema, no data is required. What you can do is to open the database file in DB4S, click the text in the schema column for a not working table, hit Ctrl+C and paste it here in Github. Should be easy for us to fix it then :smiley:
@zayass Would you be ok to try both of our latest nightly builds, and check if either of those work without crashing?
Personally, I think the one without encryption is most likely to work.  It could be the encryption library in the other one is behaving badly on your system for some (as yet unknown) reason. But the crash happens in our code (see the first line in the call stack):
In that function (DbStructureModel::rowCount) some pointer casting magic happens, so maybe the crash happens because of that. Ahhh.  Completely didn't see that. (!) @zayass, Could you share the database with us if it's not private? I can't reproduce it with a ~1 week old nightly.  Well, that's different. :wink:
I'm kind of thinking it's likely a bug in VirtualBox that's being triggered by some weird edge case.
Random things to try, that might start to show the shape of the problem:
On a different tangent, are you ok with compiling things from source code?  It'd be interesting to see if using a version compiled locally in the VM itself has the same problem.  Just in case it's caused by some weird mismatch in (for example) the Qt libraries on your VM vs the system it was compiled on.
I guess it comes down to... how much effort are you willing to spend to investigate? 😀  @innermous Yeah, it's more likely a Qt issue related to some weird virtualbox bug.  It doesn't mean we should ignore it though, as it *is* obviously affecting DB4S. @jlmcgraw Definitely try compiling DB4S (our abbreviation for sqlitebrowser) on the VM.  I'm *hoping* :smile: it's a weird interaction between VirtualBox and the Qt libraries of the system it was compiled on.  If that's the case, then using a version built on the VM has a reasonable chance of working. @jlmcgraw It's very late in my TZ, so I'm hitting the sack in the next few minutes.  I'll take a look at this issue again tomorrow and see if you've made any progress.
Is there any chance you can whip up a small dummy database which also crashes, so we can see if it crashes for us too? Hmmm, when you say "standard password protection built into SQLite", that confuses me. :smile:
Maybe it's a new thing, just recently added? > Hmmm, when you say "standard password protection built into SQLite", that confuses me.
https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-ado/ Thanks @chrisjlocke. :smile:
I'll have a play with it.  Not a huge issue (as fields should be unique
prefixed. I'm waffling, but sometimes its a pain.
I've started playing around with this a couple of days ago, too, and it looks like this is a bit more difficult. In the grammar file you'll need to add the VIRTUAL and the USING keyword, but also add some branch for parsing the slightly different syntax of those virtual tables. In our grammar code (in src/sqlitetypes.cpp) there's more work to be done, though, to actually interpret and store the new information. I have added basic support for virtual tables to the grammar parser. It's still a long way to go from here because browsing and editing those tables still doesn't work as expected. But at least the ```Sqlite parse error``` is gone. You can check out the latest version in master and test yourself. And there's still a lot of work to do for better support of virtual tables, so I still want to encourage you to look into this :smiley: If you need any help just post here, write me an email, or post on Gitter. I've just added some code that should make it possible to browse virtual tables. Depending on the virtual table function it should also be possible to add and remove rows and edit cell values. The only thing that doesn't really work at all is editing the table schema of virtual tables, but I guess that's fine for now. Are you interested in giving tomorrow's nightly build a test, @ghellquist? I guess if it works for you we can close the issue :smiley: Same for you of course, @bagage! :smiley: You can check out the latest version from master and compile that again. The warning should disappear and the application should work much better with virtual tables in general.  Does this help?  https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/395#issuecomment-269245184 Guessing you've also tried the basic things like looking for different (eg newer or older) ATI graphics drivers? k, I'd be suspecting something is weird with the graphics card drivers themselves, so that'd be the first thing I'd try changing around if you haven't already.
Out of curiosity, which SQL variant are you used to which includes them? :smile: Looked into this a bit more.  It turns out [we include a regexp() operator with DB4S](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/6d1a874f8077b859bee2dd9d4031f242cfa1e807) (I'd forgotten), which should do similar to what you're after. https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/215#issuecomment-77548926
One caveat - if it turns out we need to do tricky development stuff just to keep XP support working, that's also a case we might need to just drop it. Ahhh, it might be a moot issue then.  There's some stuff in Qt 5.8 which I'm hoping fixes an OSX network communication issue (not sure yet though).  If it doesn't, then no worries we can stick with Qt 5.6. :wink: @urmommaz - DB4S is open Source, so if its such an easy task to support XP, you're more than welcome to code away and give us pull requests.  We can then merge those into the product.
With the CoreData error you mention, what's the situation where it happens?  (just trying to understand the perspective you're coming from better) :smile: Hmm, that's not difficult to add but I wonder why it would be needed. In the Execute SQL tab you can type in whatever SQL statement you'd like. So I assume you don't mean that part of the program. And in the Create Table window, why would you want the ```IF NOT EXISTS``` bit? The statement wouldn't fail anymore but nothing would happen and you wouldn't even get an error message. I just imagine working on a table definition and, by accident, typing in the wrong table name, clicking OK, and all the work is lost :wink: Or maybe I'm missing something :smiley: Can you explain a little more, @Qlogic? Well, if cut-n-pasting the output of some sqldump type of backup commands, they often generate `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` style output.  So this would be useful for handling that without needing people to manually edit the SQL.
Bizarre it hasn't been picked up before now!
As a thought, it seems like it'd be pretty strange to have Ctrl+s do things differently on the Execute SQL window.  It's not unusual to run SQL which changes the database (eg update statements), so wanting to "Write changes to disk" (Ctrl+s) after that is fairly normal.
The max number of lines is now set to 30. This should improve the usability quite a bit, I hope :) Can you test one of the next nightly builds to check if it's working for you, @UweKeim? :smiley: @MKleusberg Should we make it configurable? Nah, it's probably not worth it. I don't think many people would edit that option anyway if we had one. If somebody does complain we can still add it easily :smiley:  No worries at all. :smile: I downloaded the 04/01/2017 nightly and for me, the dropdown goes fullscreen, even bigger than the window (which I like). Does that 30 limit have effect only on Windows? @revolter No, that should work on all platforms. I've tested this on Linux and it worked, too. :smiley:
@UweKeim Thanks for the quick reply! I'm glad I could help :smiley: Closing this issue then. @MKleusberg, So, then, isn't it a bug that it's showing more than 30 tables for me? @revolter Sorry, you're right! That value applies for Windows and some Linux configurations but not for OS X. On OS X it seems to be impossible to manually set the number of max visible items in an easy way. See [here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcombobox.html#maxVisibleItems-prop):
Can you try tomorrow's nightly build, @AndreasMartin72? I've just changed the error handling code a bit but I'm not entirely sure it affects your problem. Still, it's worth a try :smiley: @abbasshah17 Hard to say what's the problem there. We have no chance of finding out what exactly is wrong when failing to open an encrypted database. What sort of Android app are you using? Maybe we can find out what encryption settings they are using. @OmgImAlexis Interesting.  Does it still happen with our recent nightly builds? Oops, I should have included it. :smile:
They're ordered by date.  There's a build that includes encryption, and one without.  If your database isn't encrypted, then either will be suitable for trying out. Excellent @OmgImAlexis. :smile: @AndreasMartin72 Ping, did you have time to try out a recent nightly build? 😄  @abbasshah17 Did you ever get this fixed? Closing this due to lack of response. No worries. :smile:
@pirelaurent Would you have time to try our latest nightly 32 + 64 bit builds, and let us know if they still have this crash problem?
@dmscheck Hmm, that's definitely weird.

@dsimcg Good news.  The nightly builds on Windows - both with and without encryption - now include the FTS3, FTS4, FTS5, and JSON1 extensions.

@ergovia-mobile Interesting.  Was that just now?

Maybe there's a C++11 setting not being picked up?
What kind of sleazy bullshit from the Qt team is that? ☹️
I liked Qt Creator right up until this point.  No longer a fan. ☹️  @ergovia-mobile If you download [Qt 5.7.1 from qt.io](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.7/5.7.1/qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.7.1.run), then compile through Qt Creator (open the sqlitebrowser.pro file with it), things compile fine.
Adding `-DFORCE_INTERNAL_QSCINTILLA=ON` (as per Martin above) to the CMake line works:

http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser.exe.zip
Kind of thinking that might be a useful workaround for now.
@agarny Thoughts?  Does the latest qscintilla release solve the problem properly? :smile: @MKleusberg Ugh... it seems like QScintilla have switched their codebase to be GPLv3 ***only*** with no prior warning (?): https://github.com/opencor/opencor/issues/1301

We'll probably need to raise the priority of it then, as Sierra is now in use by people.

@whamsy That's a little bit unclear.  Are you meaning for DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S), or for a different application? :smile:
To change the font size for the Browse Data tab, go to `Preferences` → `Data Browser` → `Font` → `Font size`:
Ironically... I didn't know/remember about the <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> key combination. :wink:
@afbpinheiro- irregardless of the number of rows, have you fields containing a large amount of text? (> 30,000 characters)
@afbpinheiro Just to check... does it speed up if you choose a smaller number in `Preferences` → `Data Browser` → `Content` → `Symbol limit in cell`?
@mafagafogigante Manually did it, using a really old version of [Snag It](https://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html). :smile:
- Row 2 = red
- Row 3 = magenta
@revolter Sounds workable to me.  Want to get it done? :smile:
Should this be a #hacktoberfest thing?
@struck89 The speed stuff gets done at can be fairly arbitrary.  If something looks interesting to muck around with, the chances of it getting done sooner are much higher than stuff that seems super boring. 😉
@revolter Maybe look for an algorithm which determines "colour distance"?  eg how much difference there is between two given colours
The "downloads" link there has a list with 165 palettes.  If desired, we could get pretty fancy with things. 😀   ### Details for the issue
Asking because <key>alt</key> + <key>backspace</key> behaviour isn't one I'm familiar with.  Kind of wondering if maybe it's zsh specific or something? :smile:
As an initial thought, I'm kind of suspecting it might be related to QScintilla.  Other key binding stuff seems weird when on the Execute SQL tab, so this might be related.
Awesome!  You're welcome @mrexodia. 😀
Could be, but the title doesn't say 100% what the problem is, so we need a reply from @kokoar to know for sure.

Thanks @firateski, merged. 😁
As a thought, what happens if you try qmake instead of cmake? eg:
For us, CMake seems mostly useful on Windows, with qmake more useful everywhere else.  And I have a bad habit of introducing Windows-isms to the CMake config. 😦
Awesome, thanks @lulol. :smile:
@MKleusberg is this of interest to you?
Excellent @progh2, thank you. :smile:
Spaseebo!
Thanks. Spaseebo indeed then. :smile:
Fantastic @lulol, thank you very much. 😀
Well, that definitely sounds like a bug. :smile:
However, none of these are related to CSV. The one mentioned by Iulian was the only one that was happening during the actual import. But it happened only once - after creating the new table - and didn't leak enough memory to be noticeable at first. Other than these, there are no memory leaks reported by Valgrind (well, except for a smaller one in QHexEdit). So this might just be caused the behaviour of the memory manager of the operating system but I'm not sure.
@gjijon Which pragmas do you mean? All of them, including e.g. the ```user version``` pragma? Or just some of them, e.g. the ```foreign keys``` pragma?
The reason I'm asking is that some pragmas aren't stored in the database file at all by SQLite, they are only saved for the current connection. So closing and opening the database again will reset them. Foreign keys are one example. In this case that's just the way SQLite works. Others are stored permanently in the database file, for example the user version. If these aren't saved either, then it's definitely a bug in our code :smiley: Closing due to lack of response. ☹️   Ahhh, that's interesting.  We did make some changes to the cut-n-paste code, so this is definitely useful feedback.
tab = Tabs::PragmaTab;
It's nonsense, you are doing something wrong.
tab = Tabs::PragmaTab;
???
@innermous Hmmm, is there any way that the load of a database could remove the capture of keystrokes?  eg breaking the keybinding, or changing the object behind it or something
Some people like having their picture on things they do.  It's a different form of giving recognition.
Heh Heh Heh
Is there anything strange or unusual with your table structure?  Are you able to share the database, or it's structure with us, so we can try to replicate the problem?
"shaddup."
Yeah, we do see a number of unusual messages like this on the output.  Some seem to be generated by DB4S, and others generated by Qt itself.
That does seem odd.
No worries at all.  And yeah, that sounds like a weird one. :wink:
Yeah.  Sorry about this @aludee
The exact code I used is here:
Heh Heh Heh 😈
So if it's a C++ issue and not related to Xcode 8, why does it build in Linux?
@ilovezfs Thank you heaps. 😀
@revolter Sounds good. :smile:
@ilovezfs, btw, ilovebrew! I really do ❤️
@ilovezfs No worries at all. :smile:
@revolter You up for it, or should I?
@revolter No worries, I'll get it done. :smile:
Initial communication to upstream QScintilla in progress:
@agarny Sounds like yours is the way to go then. :smile:
@elyorm Thanks for reporting it, we will need more info though so we can investigate. :smile:
@elyorm ping?
@elyorm Is it happening every time you click `Open Database`?
I've set it to weird paths, wrong paths and even 'cannot access' paths.  It'll default to the program directory if it can't.  A 'cannot access' path correctly comes up with a warning.
@elyorm We need more info in order to reproduce this.
@elyorm @drescherjm Would you have time to try our latest nightly 32 + 64 bit builds, and let us know if they still have this crash problem?
I wonder how people find these bugs... I thought I am the special one.
@mafagafogigante Martin has just added a fix for this to the master branch in git.
Awesome @mafagafogigante!
Awesome @mafagafogigante, thank you. :smile:
Excellent, merged. Thanks for keeping on top of this @mafagafogigante. :smile:
Ahhh.  I was asking a different thing. :wink:
When you say "on blur", what do you mean? :smile:
Note in case it's useful, the above is a mash up of these two:

You're welcome @pbtura. :smile:
Switching to the 'Browse Data' tab creates 5 SQL queries (2 of which are possibly superfluous, but may not be) or possibly more, if the connection has closed ... is this a point of delay for you?
@abhilash1in Just to check, which version are you using, and which OS is it running on?
@abhilash1in As a thought, do you have the "Edit Database Cell" panel open?  If so, see if turning that off makes a difference.  If it doesn't something else to investigate is this:
Will try with BLOBS, as that seems to be the performance 'issue'.
Obviously, if you're storing 300 KB pictures in a database (as per @abhilash1in) this would explain the even longer delays.
@abhilash1in can you send me a copy(or just a part) of database? That's needed to localize the trouble.
@abhilash1in alright, thanks.
What's surprising me - paging is not helping much.
@abhilash1in 173 is memory taken by rows displayed on your screen.
@abhilash1in just adding limit. Partly solves the problem, since table still needs lots of performance improvement (not mentioning filtering and sorting, those will just hang the app when using such a big data).
@abhilash1in did it work for you?
> @chrisjlocke the memory usage is a bit strange! Was it with the bloat1, bloat1b or with the original one I shared?
It was mine, but I was playing with various tabs in the 'Execute SQL' tab, so each tab was using another 300 MB of memory.  Task Manager showed the .exe was only using about 200 MB, so Windows was using it elsewhere...
@abhilash1in Did you have a chance to try out the latest Windows nightly build?  (if it helps, the download locations are listed on our front page)
@MKleusberg because I set minimum to 1k :)
Thank @jungle-boogie.  It's likely the result from changing CMake config in `master` branch yesterday.
@MKleusberg As a side note... noticed something strange when testing with the old maximum (typo) value of "8092".  On Win64, encrypting a database with a page size of "8092" (not 8192) seems like it goes ok.  However, when re-opening the encrypted database (using 8092 page size), DB4S crashes.

@MKleusberg ahaha :smile:  I was just saying.
@karim is `font` value empty in your .conf file, after you click OK? It's just `font=` right?
@karim I am not a windows user...
@karim Try this one out: :smile:
@karim We can probably get this properly fixed (eg with the Execute SQL one too) in the next day or so.
@karim If you have a few minutes, would you be ok to try this build out?
Thanks for pointing this out @geoffblack, that does look like a bug related to #744. :smile:
@geoffblack Interestingly, this does seem to be already fixed in our latest development code. :smile:
Heh Heh Heh
Is the database you're doing this on private or sensitive?  Asking because I'm wondering if you could maybe email it to me?  That way tomorrow I'll try and get the problem to happen for me, so we can fix it. :smile:
The corruption you describe, is (I think) what would happen if the newline characters are completely missing.  When them missing, the Import dialog just sees everything as one big line and doesn't know where they each end.
It'll just take some experimentation to find out exactly what's wrong, and fix it.
@goozak Would you have a few minutes to try out this build?
@goozak There doesn't seem to be any good way to have the uninstaller abort if the files are in use, or even mark them for removal with the next system restart. 😦
I'll bear them in mind later, when I next need to dig into the installer again. (unfortunately, it's not standard NSIS, we use a combination of CMake/CPack to drive NSIS.  Turns out that's painful for adding things onto 😦 )
Here's a task for all who want to contribute but don't feel ready to start C++-coding.
This only seems a recent 'breakage'...

@Disactive Looking at the website, it seems like an alternative approach to opening SQLite files.
What does the "protected with RS" bit mean in your request? :smile:
Protective Master Boot Record (MBR :: verified   CRC32 $252B40D3
Judging by Sierra's flat out inaccuracy above... it might be best to wait for a few more betas... :wink:
Thanks, @MarqueIV. :smile:
@MarqueIV Ouch.  Yeah, that doesn't look great.
As an alternative thought @MarqueIV, would you be interested in building DB4S to investigate?
Ah @revolter was faster ^^
@MKleusberg That Null thought is interesting.  Maybe we should adjust our code to detect that, and if it's Null then return the default value instead?
For Windows and El Cap, it doesn't hurt to check.  Personally, I'm not expecting those to have the issue, but heck since you're offering to try them out "why not?". 😃
@MarqueIV, @highPlainsSailor, @compengi, @brozikcz - That might be of interest to you as well. :smile:
@nkahnfr Would you be ok to try one of our recent nightly builds and see if that makes a difference? (download location is listed on the front page of this project, if that helps) But maybe there is a bug that caused `@Variant(` to be saved instead of an actual color. Thanks all. :smile:

With the other translations, it's been either one or the other, so the mix is a bit strange.  If that's the best way however, it's fine here. :smile:

This is a strange behaviour I haven't seen before.  Hopefully it's just a minor string problem or something, rather than a problem in our code.  I'll take a look later today, to see if I can figure it out.

Awesome @mafagafogigante.  I'll double check shortly, then take a look at the missing menu option.
The cause of the missing menu item for `Set Encryption` seems strange.
&amp;Set Encryption
15:50 <@peppe> because the default is doing that kind of weird heuristic, which is backfiring in your case
`peppe` on IRC was correct.  Setting the "Menu Role" to `NoRole` for the the "Set Encryption" string (but translated) works fine.
@mafagafogigante Should I merge this into our code? :smile:
Thanks heaps @mafagafogigante. :smile:
There are a few strings I'm not sure of though:

With the  _"Ficheros de"_ problem (and the others in the same dialog), it sounds like it could be a problem in Qt4 then.
@lulol why would you do that?
Heh Heh Heh
@innermous Hey look... squashed commit! 😋
@lulol No worries at all about the Translators team thing.  Some people care about it, some don't.  And it doesn't hurt the project to give people the option. 😁
@lulol Sorry, I didn't get around to investigating this stuff today.  Instead, I learned how to sign our builds on OSX, then updating our nightly build system scripting to do it automatically.
@lulol Looking at this now.
@lulol What do you think, is it best done for 3.9.0?
@lulol Thanks. :smile:
Fantastic @lulol, thank you. :smile:
@lulol Yeah, it's one of those tasks that sounds big enough to be literally worrying.
No worries @lulol.  Thank you for taking the time to investigate this deeply. :smile:

Yes, that's not supposed to happen. 😦
The concept of a foreign key with "0 index" is confusing me.

@eeinfalt ping?
Four strings on the main window seem untranslated:
I can put them back (the "&amp;amp;") if that was an incorrect thing to do?

Thanks @SafaAlfulaij, that's perfect! 😁  👍
@SafaAlfulaij The newest commit has added two new lines of text, both of which could be seen fairly often by users.  Would you be ok to translate them to Arabic?
@bakercp 👍
Yeah, it's weird.  However... this seems to work.
@revolter Are you ok to test this on your retina display when you get back in front of it?
@SafaAlfulaij, Looks like the `QHeaderView`'s height is equal to the filter widgets' heights. Did you try just removing the `5` and `2` additions? It should work too.
And there are now double borders.
Hmmm, looking at this again on non-retina OSX, the filter heading (using the code for this PR), does seem a bit too short after all.  For example, the third field is DonegallQuay  The "g" and "y" have their lower pieces cut off.
Ouch.  Yeah, that definitely looks _wrong_.
There's a weird grey line showing up here:
@thiagosantos As a side question... would you have time to try out our latest nightly build?
However, unlike other changes this one won't be in the next nightly build as our nightly builds are still based on Qt4 which doesn't support JSON... If you use Windows, @thiagosantos, then @justinclift might be able to build a once-off for testing purposes. If you are a Mac user, I think you actually can use the normal nightlies :smiley:
Tried with 3 different tables, actually.
@innermous You ok to review this? :smile:
Good job, @SafaAlfulaij .
@glawrence, What do you mean? Was the badge image missing for you?
I normally use DB4S to create my databases, and when you create a new table, DB4S uses grave accents around each identifier.
However, the 'create table' window at the bottom of the 'Modify Table' dialog still uses grave accents.
So the schema column looks great,  Modify the table, and the 'create table' textbox in the dialog is using solely grave accents.  Save the table, and the schema is a mix again.
@revolter Cool.  Hadn't come across qpm.io.  Looks useful. :smile:
- Translation of strings would probably be less complicated (eg #643)
@SafaAlfulaij Well, that probably explains a few things. :wink:
@SafaAlfulaij Thanks. :smile:
@innermous That's a bit confusing.  When you say "shortcuts that _can_ be changed", are you meaning some shortcuts can't be?
Heh Heh Heh
@innermous, Where did I say that?
@revolter
Just because 'Ctrl' isn't in the right case, it throws a wobbly.
@thiagosantos I'll go and add it to the script for the nightly builds on OSX now. :smile:
Oops.  Just realised that the "3.9.0 beta1" build released today for OSX didn't include the JSON1 extension.
Heh Heh Heh
Cool, that sounds easily doable then. :smile: @bhj @thiagosantos @slidertom @DjPasco Good news.  The nightly builds on Windows - both with and without encryption -now include the FTS3, FTS4, FTS5, and JSON1 extensions.

Heh Heh Heh
Wow.  Yeah, that's a new one on me to.
Something doesn't seem right. 😦
Out of curiousity (as works fine here) @MYeager1967- if you bring up the SQL log (Ctrl L) when you click the refresh button, does the log window populate?  (lines numbers on the left should increase)
@jtara, I didn't understand your last part. I am using DB4S for SQLite databases inside iOS apps running in simulator too. But I don't need to mount anything. The app's Documents folder is just a regular folder at a weird path.
@jtara, I know, I'm using simPholders too, but not simPhuse though. And, indeed is strange that it didn't work.
This definitely sounds like one of the stranger bugs. :wink:
If you can get the problem to occur again (eg try trying on simPhuse with it), it'll be helpful for tracking down the cause then figuring out a more proper fix. :smile:
Which extra extensions do you reckon would be useful? :smile:
:confounded:
Apparently this happens for languages other than Arabic (eg [French](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/642#issuecomment-231838973)), which makes it sound like a problem in our code.  Hopefully it's just a setting or something needing to be applied to the strings in the .ui file or similar.
With this particular issue, I kind of wondered if maybe the punctuation symbols in some strings were doing weird things for the translations.
Heh Heh Heh
Should the main caption be translated too?  I presume so.... ?
Hmmm, the main caption probably should be translated.  I'm not 100% sure though. 😀
## Arabic
- foo
- bar
- baz
- foo
- bar
- baz
I assume (in the above example) the bottom 'message' relates to a tooltip, and the line numbers should match.  Slightly confused, as tooltips (translated) seem to be appearing, so didn't want to blindly change line numbers if that didn't matter...
Having gone through the Arabic and Chinese, and seeing the languages still to go, I'm going to attack this in two 'sweeps'.  First off I'll correct the obvious issues, so its at least presentable, ie, the &amp; mismatches stopping the translations appearing.  This will get the files ready for the planned release.  I'll then go back and thoroughly tidy up.  I've written a quick VB prog to check the .ui and .ts files for mismatches and help locate 'bugs', so they shouldn't be is such a mess as @innermous pointed out.
Misplaced?
Progress being made!
Heh Heh Heh
Hmm.  Some weird things keep occurring.  Going throuhg the German file for instance, and the captions for the dialogs are appearing in Arabic.
Oh wow, yeah that's unexpected.
@SafaAlfulaij Yeah, would be optimal. 😃
Importantly, people's skill level improves as they gain experience through practise and new challenges.
- [x] sqlb_ar.ts - Arabic
- CipherDialog.ui
- EditDialog.ui
- PreferencesDialog.ui
- VacuumDialog.ui
So, each of the UI's need to be checked for each language.
## Arabic

- [ ] VacuumDialog.ui
- [ ] CipherDialog.ui
- [ ] VacuumDialog.ui
- [ ] CipherDialog.ui
- [ ] VacuumDialog.ui

I'll commit later what I've got - I've gone through about 6 languages completely, not just fixing the dialogs.  Green ticks all round in Qt Linguist.

Guessing you'll keep adding more translated strings to this issue?  If that's the case, just let us know when you're happy with things, and we'll merge it. :smile:
@justinclift just imo, but in this special case it would be better than a pyle of commits with similar commit messages. Especially if you brought force push immediately before anyone ever fetched changes.
Well, that definitely sounds like a bug. :wink:
@revolter Looks like we still have the problem then. 😦
@innermous Is this related to #645 ?
@karim If you try the latest nightly build (download locations are listed on the front page), does it happen with that too?
According to Stack Overflow...
Gah yeah... that's exactly the problem.  I remember thinking "Lets build this in Debug mode, the extra info might be useful for any crashes".  Without realising we'd need a debug version of other libraries too.
Sorry for the troubles.  Our foreign key handing (and constraints in general) needs a lot of work.  So, it's completely possible that you're doing things fine... and the application is just not where it needs to be.
@uguraba ping?
Hmmm, that's interesting.  The ANTLR2 stuff is part of our source code.  We bundle it with the rest of our source here, and it's **supposed** to be found automatically by cmake.
Just as a curiosity thing, what happens if you run qmake instead of cmake?
With cmake, it kind of has a macro like language, so the  "if(NOT ANTLR2 ..." clause you're talking about [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L35-L38) shouldn't trigger, because it's coming after this line [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L29):
find_package(Antlr2)
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/cmake/FindAntlr2.cmake
Yeah, that does sound kind of weird. 😦
@PSE-AG How did this go?
@PSE-AG Any luck with this? :smile:
With the `ANTLR2` warnings, there seem to be two distinct paths that can go down:
With the focus problem, that's interesting.  It's not something I remember anyone mentioning before.  It's probably an unexpected interaction from something... but figuring out what exactly is the next challenge. :smile:
@shaoran Thanks. :smile:
Sounds like the focus problem is the same as in #934. But the bi-sected commits mentioned there are from a later date. Maybe it's a connection of multiple things causing this behaviour, I don't know. Either way, if anybody feels like bi-secting this (earlier) problem, *please* do so :smiley:  Interesting.  We use SQLCipher for the encryption.  Is that what Navicat uses? (there are a few different SQL encryption options around)
@venetasoft ping?
Gah, wrong button. 😇
Interesting.  If you commit that code into a branch in your own fork, that would let others compile it pretty easily.  @jungle-boogie may be ok to try it on Linux, and I can also generate a once off OSX build for people to test, if that sounds useful. :smile:
Thanks @DelphiGit, that's awesome. 😀
That's weird, I just tried it here (using latest nightly build), and it's working for me.  To minimise the application, what are you doing?  Clicking the orange icon in the top left of the window bar? (that's what I just tried)
@SafaAlfulaij Cool, that's useful info. 😁
@innermous Any idea if there's a difference between Qt4 and Qt5 for the resizing glitches?
@justinclift don't know what are you talking about, honestly.
@innermous Sorry.  Was typing on a tablet before without really understanding. :smile:
This should really be fixed I think :smiley: @lvbeck Can you test the latest version (3.9.1 or the nightly builds, whatever you prefer)? I'm pretty sure we quote all names using the ``` ` ``` quotes. Oh no I'm sorry, I was wrong. For the SQL dump we take the CREATE statement as is. This means it's quoted in the SQL export just like it's quoted in the original database. But I can fix that :smiley: @lvbeck Sorry for the confusion :smiley: If you're still interested in this, can you test tomorrow's nightly build and see if it's improving the situation for you? For triggers and views we don't have a chance to do this (yet) but tables and indices should be much better now. No worries :smiley: Just test it whenever you have the time for it. Thank you for your effort! :smiley: @lvbeck ping? @lvbeck Excellent, thanks for checking and letting us know. :smile: @MKleusberg just another tiny feature request, could you please add:
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `Tablename`;
- It's a lot easier to implement for us, e.g. enforcing foreign key constraints: currently we can just send a new cell value to SQLite; sure, maybe it fails but we can handle this error. On the other hand, doing the check by ourselves would involve making queries do the referenced table as well as checking if foreign keys are enabled for this database. Because of this I don't think we can gain any performance here. Because of all the special cases like multi-column keys or the like our code would probably also be more complex than it is now. So in short: more code and no better performance here.
Thanks @tonypdmtr, that's an interesting catch. :smile:
Thanks for reporting it @AO-StreetArt. :smile:
@innermous Awesome! 😁
@AO-StreetArt Would you be ok to try the latest nightly build (download locations are on the front page of our project) and let us know if it's working properly for you now? :smile:
@AO-StreetArt Ping?
Awesome, thanks heaps for testing it and getting back to us @AO-StreetArt. :smile:
WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
In the meantime, code wise it looks ok to me.  But I don't have much Qt/C++ experience yet.  Emailed @MKleusberg to review it, but haven't heard back yet.
Created a brand new test database here "Untitled2.db", set the password to "abc123" with a page size of 2048.  Added a few rows of dummy data.
Sorry to be a pain and I know security is not always enjoyed but if we do this right and get it right, then we will get respect.
- When prompting the user for a password using the CipherDialog, it'd be nice to have a checkbox in there and - when the checkbox is set - save the password and page size automatically, without having to use the preferences dialog.
@MKleusberg, are these ok? I didn't want to put the buttons on the right side as on the `Extensions` tab because the table would have been too narrow, even if I had icons instead of text.
@MKleusberg, Currently, when pressing "Add password", the file dialog opens and inserts the file name (including the extension) in the appropriate column.
@revolter I believe we should make it clear to users that passwords are stored in plain text on their local hard drive, or maybe state the location. That way we are being open and honest and the user knows what is going on, with no surprises
- Filename
- Password
Also, with this idea, when a user opens a crypted database, will he be required to enter that master password? If yes, that would be the exact opposite of what I tried to achieve using this PR.
- FileZilla stores passwords as Base64 encoded, this has been criticised by a lot of people, hence my concern about storing in plain text
Yeah, this is the classic security-vs-convenience dilemma.
@virusmiha Hmmm, accidental Pull Request? :wink:
This is pretty clearly an accidental PR, so closing it.

@innermous Is this something you'd be ok looking into?
$ git add foo bar baz
@DelphiGit You up for doing more stuff? :smile:
In my opinion, this would look odd:
Ahhh, that's not good.
Not sure if there's a better way.
There are some nice to have features in the newer versions of C++. Most of them we will probably never use, especially since we're relying very much on Qt, but still there are plenty of helpful additions to the language. This could make our code cleaner and more efficient.
The downside is the compiler support. While pretty much every compiler should support C++11 to a large extend _by now_ there are still many old compiler versions out there which will have trouble with certain C++11 features. Furthermore, most compilers require the user to explicitly activate C++11 support. This makes the project files and the build processes slightly more complicated.
Questions:
- How about building on WIndows? I have no idea how well C++11 is supported on MSVC nor how to activate it.
Questions:
Sorry @innermous you did, I forgot that
Ahhh, that's interesting stuff.
Expected in: /usr/local/lib/libJPEG.dylib
Hmmm, this is interesting in a non-good way:
@innermous If you're ok with investigating some of the harder pieces, do you want to look into this?
This issue is really gamebreaking and nuts, it makes the work with complex constraints impossible. Maybe we can come together to solution.
@jungle-boogie Received an email from @rp- this morning saying the Windows nightly build box should now be auto-updating its packages.
People generally don't seem to be demanding the newest things from SQLite anyway, so adding encryption as an option for everyone seems like a decent win.
Hi @justinclift, @revolter,
Interesting idea.  If someone (eg not me) knows out to implement that in a practical way, then ok, it's possible.
@jungle-boogie Would you have the time/interest to try out the new Qt5 based Windows nightly builds?
Excellent @jungle-boogie, thank you. :smile:
Hmmm that's a bit difficult to parse. :wink:
@innermous Sorry Vlad.  I have only recently started learning C++ & Qt, so I don't have the experience to understand this properly and give it a pass/fail.  Instead, I rely on @MKleusberg, who does have the experience.
@jungle-boogie Would you be ok to compile the latest master code, and verify the fix on Linux?
@jungle-boogie Would you have time to try compiling and using the latest code again?
Awesome @jungle-boogie!
@eitijupaenoithoowohd With the version you're using, is that the standard package on Ubuntu, or did you compile it yourself?  If it's one you've compiled, then @MKleusberg just (today) added a patch which might help.  So, compiling it again would be worth testing. :wink:
@MKleusberg Maybe we should add some way to trigger output of useful diagnostics / progress / etc? Maybe a command line argument?
@eitijupaenoithoowohd Thanks, that's useful info. :smile:
@MKleusberg Thoughts?
@nickberry17, Did you manage to propose the fix to `QScintilla`?
For the weird bug behaviour, @MKleusberg returned from holidays yesterday, so he's probably the right person to review bits. (there is a large queue for him through 😵 )
@jungle-boogie Sorry, didn't notice you've pushed a fix.  Just tested it quickly here, and it looks (mostly) good. :smile:
Yep, that looks good now.  Thanks @jungle-boogie. :smile:
Oh wow, that's exceptionally slow.

Yeah, foreign key constraints definitely need some work at the moment.  You're not alone in finding bugs with that part of things. :wink:

So both foreign keys appear and aren't mixed.

Thanks heaps @revolter. 😁
Just one slight query.  Executing the current line / SQL enables and then disables the 'Write Changes' and 'Revert Changes' buttons.  Is this correct?  Seems unnecessary and slightly confusing... @chrisjlocke You're right :confused: Just tried two workarounds and neither of them helped. What wonders me most is that everything's so slow that you can actually easily see it.  Wish I could help.  I don't have Windows 10 (and won't ever be running it), so this isn't something I can personally try and find a solution to.
@rithvikmundra If you have a few minutes, would you be ok to try the "3.9.0 beta1" release we did last weekend?
Maybe a "Special copy" command, letting the user choose its behaviour?
Oops, you're completely correct.  "Special paste". :innocent:
@tchaloupka Are you still around and have the time to test the next build? :smiley:
@tchaloupka Thanks a lot for your fast reply :+1: That's good news :smiley:
When you say "onto the app", are you meaning a running instance of the app, or are you meaning the app icon in (say) /Applications? :smile:
Definitely.  PR's are very welcome here. :smile:
That's very difficult to understand. :frowning:
Guessing you are using Google Translate or something? :smile:
I've obviously got a good knowledge of VB, so just have to bend my thinking to a new slant!
Yeah, trying variations now.
Ouch, that's not good.
@samir-aguiar has been super busy with his work though, so doesn't have time for this in the short/medium-term.
@fmeneuhe Did that help at all?
@fmeneuhe There's now. @justinclift made a Windows executable with SQLCipher support which you can find here http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/sqlitebrowser-win64-with_sqlcipher-201605041823.exe

Ahhh, as a data point, the domain name for the nightlies might be giving the wrong impression with this one:
Hmmm, well that's just weird. :wink:

Why does open big tables is causing delay?

Is there any improvement if you use different fonts?  (they can be changed in Preferences)
Interesting, thanks for reporting it.
@skifans No worries. :smile:
Nah, should be ok for now.  Neither @glawrence nor I are C++ developers for this project, we just help out with other bits.  We're volunteer based, and the main developers are taking a bit of time off it seems after the holidays... so there's no debugging going to be done urgently right now. :angel:
@skifans did you have a previous version installed?
@skifans You mean it crashed while the open file dialog is opened? Might be difficult to debug then. Do you get any other information in an error message?
@skifans If you have a few minutes, would you be ok to try the "3.9.0 beta1" release we did last weekend?
We've fixed a weird crash bug a few weeks ago which kept showing up in strange places.  There's a decent chance that's the one which was affecting you. :smile:
Thanks @skifans. :smile:
Thanks for checking and letting us know @skifans. :smile:
Heh Heh Heh
If you press the refresh button (just above the "Apellido" heading in your screenshot), does it apply then?
Also, I'm going to close this issue because the filter delay seems to work fine :smiley: Wow, I always thought it takes a little because the table is large, didn't know there was a delay there. A big thanks from me, too, @MKleusberg! Thanks :smile_cat:   This is a bit confusing... you mention there is no concurrency problem, but also mention using AndroidStudio and DB4S at the same time.  I'm not sure if AndroidStudio changes things or not. :frowning:
This may be the problem:
Hmmmm, this seems unusual.  What is it for? :smile:
Maybe specify a regex format for the databases with that password? Something along the lines of:
Or are you suggesting a new, improved behaviour? :smile:
Nice work @huy-cong that's great news. I have been working on something similar with a view to documenting the steps on our Wiki but I am behind you in terms of progress! Would you have time to write up your steps and anything else you noted along the way? Please. If you just sketch something out roughly in a reply here I can then pick this up and format for the wiki, adding my own experience. We can then also update other documentation, however I wanted to make your contribution easy for you! Thanks.
Thanks @huy-cong that's helpful and appreciated. I will close this issue down now as I believe we are all done.
@huy-cong Do you still have your CMakeLists.txt file around?
@kiwina Heh Heh Heh, that's a bit light on details. :wink:
Thus new nightlies.  Dynamic build though.
Note - It looks more complicated than it is, as it runs through twice.  Once for Win32, and once for Win64. @tonypdmtr Reading through your original report for this... I think we might have been misunderstanding it.
No idea how long it will take to get resolved... we're volunteer based.  It might take a few weeks. :angel:
Indeed.  Its 'out of sync'.  Flipping cells (left and right) obviously fixes it, so ... well..... so its not as bad as it was! :wink:
I think that maybe that's the real crash.
@pikeas, Are you saying that if you enable file contents preview and try to open a database, the app crashes?
@pikeas If this still happens though and you care about it, please feel welcome to re-open this issue and we'll get around to investigating at some point. 😁   Oh, that's interesting.  Thanks for the bug report @muhammad-naderi. :smile:
Thank you @progh2. :smile:
Thanks @subdriven, that's Awesome! :grin:
Interesting.  As a thought, do you have Homebrew installed?
@lphooge @pbtura Out of curiosity, does the nighty build work for either of you?
Ping?
@pbtura @lphooge Do either of you have time to test the new 3.8.0 OSX release build, prior to it being officially published?
Thanks @lphooge, that's a good start. :smile:
k.  Are you using a HiDPI monitor?  Kind of wondering if we might need to try detecting for that, and choose different defaults in that situation or something. :smile:
Thanks for putting up with my questions @pbtura. :grin:
Thanks a lot for your fast response, @MilosSubotic :smile:
@PKEv Ping? :smile:
When you say "shortcuts", what are you meaning? :smile:
@MKleusberg Ping. :wink:
@MilosSubotic Thank you very much for contributing :smile: This looks very promising! I'll do some more testing later but I think we can merge this soon :smile: For now there are two more things:
@MilosSubotic Great timing too.  Our next release will probably be tomorrow, so this code will have a decent amount of real world users pretty soon. :grin:

@MrScorp We released a new version (3.8.0) about a week ago.  Would you be ok to try that and let us know if the crash still happens for you?
Reading over this, this bit confuses me:
sounds like there is some conflict with shell extensions
@staz1000 @michalfita As a thought, we've made a new release since this was reported.  That **might** fix the problem.  If not, then trying the latest nightly build may work instead, as that uses a different (static) build process.
@staz1000 @michalfita Ping?  There's a decent chance this is fixed now in our latest release. :smile:
@peteristhegreat Ping? :smile:
@peteristhegreat Is this issue still of use?
@revolter Sure, when we flip the "Qt5 only" switch for our project, version specific code like that is probably not useful.
Oh, that's not good.  @MKleusberg ?
@PKEv Ping? :smile:
@dannguyen Ping?
Hmmm, that's unexpected.  If you're on windows, do you have "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013" installed, available [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784)?
@Aermec Did you have time to try the nightly build? Wildcard escaping is added in there :smile:
@Aermec Ping. :smile:
@Aermec Ping 2?
@raananb Hmmm, that's not good.  It's supposed to display all of the records.
@raananb With the problem displaying accented characters, do you have time to try our latest released version (3.8.0)?  It would be useful for us to know if that problem is still happening. :smile:
Thanks Raanan. :smile:
@bobatwhidbey Do you have the time/interest to try the latest nightly build, and see if that's better for you? :smile:
SQLCipher is used for encryption support.  At the moment, someone could open your database in something like Notepad and view the data.  It wouldn't be totally human-readable, but it would be 'enough'.  Certainly not good enough if you were storing usernames and passwords, and everyone had access to the database.  For small application use (the main use of SQLite?) or if encryption isn't important, you can ignore the SQLCipher option.  :) @bobatwhidbey As an update, the backward/forward slash inconsistency is fixed in nightly builds from just over a week ago.  We haven't added the row height option (yet) though, but will probably get around to it "at some point". :wink:  Yeah, it's a "known" problem, I just haven't gotten around to investigating it yet.
Oh, that's weird.  That means the folder you're in when running the command is read-only.
Hmmm, that's a SIGSEV fault.  Weird.
@ping?
Hmmm, is there a typo in your original post there?  It's saying **myDB**.myTable in the first bit, then **main**.myTable for the delete statement.
Gah, wrong button.  Sorry! :angel:
@chetan Ouch, that doesn't sound good.  As a thought, you **might** be able to reset it's behaviour by moving or deleting the preferences file for DB4S.  On OSX it should be located somewhere like:
Thanks @logocomune, that's awesome! :smile:
Oh, that's strange.  I'll have to try it out later on a Windows system to see if I hit the same problem.
Thanks @GeorgijK!
Still, it's going to be guesswork for me, too, cause I don't have a Windows machine here...
???
@Bluscream Does that help enough? :smile:
Ahhhh interesting.  I haven't tried OSX 10.10 at all yet.
@pamtbaau Is this one working well for you now too? :smile:
Hmmm, this issue seems like it's fully done now.  Are we ok to close it from your point of view @pamtbaau? :smile:
@finjulhich Ping...
Thanks @finjulhich. :smile:
@MKleusberg could this be done for export too?
Interesting.  So, it would be better to have this be changeable per column, instead of a default for everything?  I'm thinking that when you open a database for the first time + go to the Browse Data tab, you might need to do something like right click and choose a "Display in Hexadecimal" or something.  And we should store that column preference in the project file for a database too.
| Binary | [unsure] |
| Octal | "%o" |
| Hex | "%#x" |
| My Custom String | "Hi there %s" |
Have you added the code for saving/loading the custom format to/from the project file?
Ahhh.  That sounds like meta information that should be saved into a project file.  @MKleusberg, are you ok to add that? :smile:
Thanks @Sharpeee, looks good.
Thanks for this @Sharpeee. :smile:
@jungle-boogie Ouch, you're completely correct.  That should be editable. 😦
Thanks @amoghe, that's a good idea. :smile:
With Android's custom SQLite collation functions, I wonder if the source code is available and also if the license would let us use it?  Instead of creating our own that is.
@schdub If it's not adding too many code lines, just go ahead. If there should be lower-level changes (which I doubt), some major programming effort, or new depedencies implied we should maybe think about this a bit more. The reason is that we're just talking about two custom collations of thousands out there and I'm not sure where to draw the line... But on the other hand, being able to open Android databases with full functionality out of the box is a major plus :smiley:
Interesting, that doesn't sound good at all.  Which version of DB4S is this happening with?
@faacsousa, please send me (jsbot@ya.ru) the file database, which reproduces this problem.
@faacsousa Would you be ok to download our latest nightly build, and confirm that the fix for this added by @schdub works well for you? :smile:
We might be able to change the warning message to be less scary, and more informative.  @rp- Thoughts?
I agree that the text of the warning needs to be changed, but I also think that the mechanism of substituting COLLATION can be improved by:
@MKleusberg is this good to merge?
@MKleusberg ping?
Interesting.  We added the ability to change the SQL font in a recent version (might have been 3.7.0, I don't remember).  I just tried setting the font to Andale Mono:
Yeah, this is definitely a bug of some sort.  I think @MKleusberg will be interested in this. :smile:
This seems to be a bug in Scintilla or the QScintilla wrapper around it. I've just compiled the QScintilla example application (after enabling UTF-8 and SQL syntax highlighting in there) and the error still ocurrs. On the other hand, if I change the used lexer from SQL to C++ it seems to work - so the problem is probably somewhere in their SQL lexer and not in the general code, though I'm not entirely sure about that.

Indeed @Sanpasqual123 it is either a CentOS thing or possibly a GNOME/KDE issue. I have just tried on an openSUSE VM and don't see the same issue. With CentOS I have GNOME and with openSUSE I have KDE, so I wonder if the issue is in GNOME compatibility somewhere

@ant-on-io thank you for reporting. This is definitely bug.
Yeah.  There was a bug in our Unicode handling with 3.6.0.  If you grab the latest nightly build though, it's fixed. :smile:
@abshuhuhuhu Have you had a chance to grab the latest nightly build, and use that instead?
There was a bug in the 3.6.0 and 3.6.1 to do with Unicode handling, but it's fixed in our latest nightly builds.  I'm guessing that's the bug you're hitting. :wink:
@Z4us That's a bit unclear to me... what do you mean? :smile:
Interesting.  Would you be ok to try our latest nightly build?  There was a bug in our Unicode handling for the Execute SQL tab, which is fixed in that.  I'm kind of thinking that might solve the problem for you too. :smile:
@meNESS This has finally been fixed. 😁
Hmmm, it sounds like a dependency is missing or something.

It's odd, because I just checked and everything works.
@jimmyp2 ping?
@hamidmalek Try using our latest "nightly build".  The download location is on the front page of our repo.
@justinclift Just tried it with the latest build and it works. So I assume using the nightly build it'll work for @hamidmalek , too. If not it might be necessary to set another font in the Preferences Dialog. The only thing I noticed is that especially selecting text is a bit erratic because of the mix of LTR SQL text and RTL Farsi text but that doesn't seem to be much better in other applications...
@MKleusberg Hmmm, there's further unicode handing badness mentioned in @jimmyp2's comment above: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/311#issuecomment-102628344.  eg the loading from a sql file.  Should that be reported as a separate issue or ?
Thanks @palmiche.
@lifedomy I did receive the file, but was tired and then went to sleep and forgot about it.
As a thought, have you tried version 3.6.0 of our program?  We changed some of our Unicode handling in that... and there is a chance it has already fixed the problem. :smile:
@opeth771, SQLite data types not compatible with MySQL data types. You need to rewrite create statements (such as create table) with column types supported by MySQL.

@samir-aguiar ping?
Hmmm, looks kind of dodgy really.  Some bits which jump out at me:
- Requires sending a copy of ID documentation to a third party in Poland I've not personally heard of before (unizeto.pl).  ←  Maybe it's just my lack of knowledge in this space, but this is concerning to me.
Good point.  If the need for the CREATE TABLE statement is an edge case though, we could probably make it a right click context menu item.  eg. Right click → "Show CREATE TABLE statement", which might free up that widget for being redone... :grinning:
I'm not entirely sure if I understand you correctly but you can set a foreign key, including a On Delete action, in the Edit Table dialog like this:
![foreignkey](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/8273293/70984122-1867-11e5-93f7-a671dd7eefff.png)
This is super-weird because on my system it's just working fine :question:
Oh, that doesn't sound good.  @samir-aguiar this sounds like your kind of thing to look at?
@cnromaine Would you have time to check the icons on the [3.9.0-beta1 release](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.0-beta1), from your point of view?
Gah, that's not good.
@cnromaine Yeah, this is our first Windows release using a new build process (to enable 64 bit Windows builds).  Looks like there are a few kinks to still be worked out. :wink:
Yeah, that's really weird. :frowning:
Interesting.  This does kind of sound bug-ish, as we're trying to keep pretty close to the behaviour of SQLite3.
So, even if someone has (say) a column marked as REAL, if someone decides to try and insert "FOOBAR! WAS! HERE!" (a string) into a field in it... SQLite3 will accept that string and store it fine (as a string).  It will "just work".  In some ways this could be considered a good thing, in some ways it could be considered a bad thing.  Very much "depends how you look at it". :wink:
Hmmm, as a thought, is the extension a .dll file?  If so, copying it into the same directory as the sqlitebrowser.exe file might let it be found.
However, I can't guarantee that it's working for databases created with that Unity plugin because I couldn't find much information about the encryption used in that plugin. If they don't rely on SQLCipher internally my fix won't work. But as I said, it's definitely worth a try! I've just emailed the contact point (orangetree@) for the Unity plugin developers, pointing them at this issue + asking if they're using SQLCipher for the encryption layer.
These features are new:
Weird, the snippet you pasted really looks odd to me because in the first line it looks like it's trying to link it all together to an application but in the two following lines it looks like it's still compiling the QScintilla library. The error message which must be thrown by the first line says that the library can't be found (yet). Not sure why it doesn't wait for it to be built... Can you maybe try again and post the entire log?
Will do.  I was using -j9, which is probably responsible for the weird log.  Gimme a few minutes though, as I'm doing something else atm. :wink:
Regex?
what does REGEXP have todo with this?
- Settings (colours, fonts, ...)
rm -f libqscintilla2.a
ranlib -s libqscintilla2.a
On my system -j9 seems to reliably trigger the failure.  -j5 and -j7 don't.  Weird.
Yeah, I'm not sure how to solve this.  A dodgy workaround :wink: is to have "end transaction;" before your statement.  This closes our implicit transaction, then executes the statement after.
and other.
added strings.

@DongilKim Do you have time to try out the next nightly build, and see if it's working properly for you now? :smile:
Looking back over this... @jungle-boogie how did you rearrange the column order during import? @justinclift,
@galmok Our very latest code has a new export dialog for changing options with the output CSV file.  One of those options is to explicitly state the column name in the output.
@MKleusberg ?
@fu-hsi Do you have time to test the next nightly build, and let us know if it works ok now?
@fu-hsi:
At least the thing with the crash when adding a UNIQUE constraint in that special case seems to be a bug in SQLite itself. The same happens when executing this code using the command line utility:
@fu-hsi Do you? :wink:
Closing it for now.  @fu-hsi Do you have a few minutes to test our latest nightly build, and let us know if it's not working after all?

Dodgy workaround though. :wink:
The "off-by-one" thing could be kind of annoying though. 😕
On my system when I resize the window, the row number at the bottom changes when about half of the row is visible. I have no idea why it does this because it's not in our code and it didn't use to be like this. Might be a Qt thing or a Qt platform specific thing. Also, I get an extra +1 on the number of the last visible row. So e.g. in your last screenshot I'd see 44793. So no matter how I resize the window it's always wrong :frowning:  Wow, that's weird.  Sounds like we need to intercept the event handler on Linux that changes the row counter, and stop the +1 behaviour. But we'd need to know when exactly it's happening. The problem seems to be that our ```ExtendedTableWidget::numVisibleRows()``` method returns the wrong value which probably means that Qt's ```rowAt()``` returns a wrong value. But as this only happens on some platforms and with some Qt versions it's going to be hard to fix it... Gah. ☹️   I'll check this out tonight too. :smile:
Awesome @samir-aguiar. :grin:
and the opposite direction:
@harrisrap ping? :smile:
Something incorrect in the way the filters are constructed?
The problem here was that the spelling of the columns used in the foreign key clauses are different from those actually used in the table definition. See here for example 'customerID' vs 'customerId' (note the final letter 'd'):
FOREIGN KEY(customerId) REFERENCES customer(id)

That's from @samir-aguiar, who left an initial 32-bit compile running overnight.  We're hoping it works, but not 100% sure. :wink:

Non-empty strings between separators? (just saying... I really have no clue if that's appropriate) :grin:

@mafagafogigante, which version do you use?
@mafagafogigante, it's already fixed
@samir-aguiar Awesome. :grinning:
For OSX, it should always be under the Application menu.  For at least Russian and French it's turning up in a different menu ("Vue" for the French).
- Compiling with this patch applied &rarr; Preferences entry is in the Application menu (checked all of Chinese, French, German, and Russian).
For 3.6.0, how about "Dragon Emperor Chu"?
Ahhhh, that's an interesting idea.
@samir-aguiar Famous historical battles &larr; Meh.. naming a release after the death of lots of people... doesn't sound optimal. :anguished:
k, on that note how about "Zoidberg has landed".  That's a fictional character (Futurama), and sounds somewhat interesting.  Now, we just need someone with illustration skillz... :grinning:

On a side note, when testing in French the "Preferences" menu item doesn't show up under the main application menu in the correct spot.  It starts up under the "Vue" menu.  No idea why. :wink:
Hmmmm, you might want to cheat.  When Homebrew downloads source code, it caches the tarball on the filesystem (for me on an OSX 10.9.5 system, it's under /Library/Caches/Homebrew).

Just thinking of this from the point of view of.... "what happens if it starts up in a language I can't read?"  (eg mandarin, japanese, etc).  It would be very tricky to navigate to the preferences dialog in that situation, let alone finding the correct tab/options/'OK'-button.  A language choosing element on the main UI though would let me solve the problem without getting stuck.
++    QString trans_dir = "%%DATADIR%%/translations";
++    QDir translationsDir("%%DATADIR%%/translations",
+                          "sqlb_*.qm");
I can confirm this issue and could track its source down to the combination of a complex check constraint expression (containing an 'or') and using string literals inside it (comparing the column against a number would work). Anyways, the problem is fixed now, so tomorrow's nightly build will hopefully work better for you! :)
@samir-aguiar Sorry for the late reply but I'd be happy to include this fix in our code. cmake might be the preferred build system but we still try to support qmake as well as we can, so this is definitely welcome! Do you want to open a pull request for this, so you're the author of this fix? If not I can make the commit, too :)
@Z4us Do you have a few minutes to try out the fix in the next nightly build (from tomorrow onwards)? :smile:
@bonerfart Sound workable to you?
@Blackkatt As additional info, which version of DB Browser for SQLite are you using, and on which OS? :smile:
Thanks for your bug report, @Blackkatt :smiley:
@Blackkatt Would you be ok to try the next nightly build (after tonight), and confirm back whether it's now working properly or not?  (download locations for the nightly builds are on the front page of this repo) :smile:
@Blackkatt For Windows you can find them [here](http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/). Just download the sqlitebrowser.exe.xz file and uncompress it with 7-Zip or some similar program.

Ah sorry, I was expecting a red column. So yes the change is in there.
@Chuongv Trying with different background colour shadings to show NULL sounds like a decent idea.  Human brain seems to recognise colour a little bit faster than words, so some people may find it helpful.
This turned out easier than I thought. So here are the various options. We could turn the Null to a red color.
Edit: This is a fake database which can be found here http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com
For me, I kind of like the extreme red NULL (first version) on white background.  Yeah, I'm weird. :wink:
@77tb What are your thoughts on this too? :smile:
But this is really some kind of user preference, but for a consistent UI (BLOB indication) I would write the string "NULL"
If that's workable, @Chuongv, are you up for that challenge?  I'm guessing it'll be a good learning thing, and you'll figure it out.  Plus we're here to give pointers if you have questions and/or run into trouble. :grinning: (And yeah, I'm specifically encouraging you to keep doing stuff on DB Browser for SQLite.

Interesting thoughts. :smile:
This one is a bit confusing to me:
Are you doing it like in my dodgy picture above? :grinning:
@MKleusberg What do you reckon? :smile:
I would make this a bit more advanced and remember the path depending on the taken action/category.
you are using the ancient 2.0 version.
Why are you trying with ancient versions (over 8 years old)?
Interesting.  That sounds like a worthwhile request.  Unsure if it would be straightforward, but it could be done.
First thing to do is try opening up the exported table file using WordPad.  If the Korean characters look ok in the file, then the problem is likely in Excel.  However, if the Korean characters aren't correct in the file-opened-with-WordPad, then our table exporting code could be needing work. :flushed:
Ahhhh.  The problem seems to be Excel not understanding how to import unicode characters properly, and is trying to import them as text.
So either the file is encrypted or the database is corrupt
(likely in database format too then)

So, it's not guaranteed ArcheAge does things that way... but there's a decent chance.

Interestingly, there is progress on the C++ port for ANTLR 4:

Closing this as it's almost been a year without updates. Chances are that the copy-paste situation improved when we moved to Qt5 but either way: there isn't much we can do about it on our side. Adding an edit option to the right side of the hex editor turns out to be difficult, too. We would have improve the QHexEdit widget but that's an external project by different people. The "caf.." problem isn't actually a bug but correct this way: the "é" is encoded using two separate bytes and none of them represents the "é" on its own, thus the two dots. And finally, you can now set the font for the edit dialog, choosing one which doesn't omit NULL bytes but prints a box or something instead. This way "testtest" should become ~~ "test[]test". It's been almost three years, so this is probably just for the records, but: Good news! I've just updated the QHexEdit library in our repository and editing the ASCII code on the right side of the hex editor is now finally supported :wink: @MKleusberg That's awesome. :smile:  Hi!

The way this feature worked initially and still does with this multiple selection variation is that it fetches the list of names first (that a user can then cherry pick from) then opens a stream, parses and performs actions after in a sequential order over the selected files. The open dialog filters what formats are allowed and the internal parser will warn/skip/err on bad files (invalid csvs). I had a folder with ~7k files with thousands of rows and including decoding and inserting took a little over half hour on a Dell XPS 15 running x64 Win 10.

1. EditBinPack.rar
I am not sure whether during compilations data in the PE header is always written into exactly the same addresses, as yet I have no experience in this at all. But I think with basis given by the screenshot next time it would be easier to spot the location of wanted data (at least I would have an idea about what am I looking for). To the 'Hex' method I actually came from executing 'EditBin' method, and then replicated changes performed by editbin.exe manually in my hex editor. So I agree with you that 'EditBin' method looks more reliable and sounds like the correct one. As I've read further, it looks that there are differences in link.exe files and that newer generations of that file won't let editbin.exe to set a version prior to what was limited in its code by Microsoft, instead saying something like "LINK : warning LNK4241: invalid subsystem version 5.01". Again, I might be wrong. Anyways, the link to the three files I gave in method 2, do allow to write a program's OS compatibility to subsystem 5.01. The correspondent option would be:

I can't turn on the lines, because it does not respect the order I asked (order by t):
The first color it appeared when making this mock example was YELLOW!!
@revolter It kind of makes sense that somewhere in the code there is a line that says, order the rows by X.

Why BSD-specific? I am not running BSD here. Also, master works (built from scratch). Rebuilding v3.9.x now to get a better idea, but I am not tracking the project as closely as you are and I may not know what caused the issue. I may, if I have the time, bisect it from v3.9.x. If you need that, tell me.

@justinclift Mind giving this patch to qscintilla2 a try?
@justinclift yes that sounds like a good idea. For instance, Xcode 8 supports more of the c++11 standard.
@ilovezfs @justinclift
@agarny do you mind reviewing joshua-meng's patch (https://github.com/joshua-meng/Lunar/commit/751e3f015ecbefe7fcb90f02092574711b6cec3d) vs. yours?
@ilovezfs
@ilovezfs, @joshua-meng said it all.
@joshua-meng's patch requires C++11, which might be a problem for Phil Thompson (the person behind `QScintilla`), I don't know.

Note that changing "Navegador de dados" to "Navegador" works too, but is clearly worse.

No no, it is not important at all. I was just wondering, that's all. Cause I changed the font like I normally do in "Data Browser" and it was changed, but then I switched to "Execute SQL" and it was the same, so I thought something was wrong. I didn't notice it has its own font settings in "SQL" tab, sorry.

If i try to open a encrypted database with your browser, i get an error. Becase this dll encrypt files using RSA (not RS, like i write in the first post, was a keyboard error)
That will be awesome, but i dont know C++ language, so... i can't give you a big help.
When running SQLiteBrowser (now renamed to DB Browser for SQLite) on macOS Sierra beta, because the app is unsigned, it can not find its preferences file and as such, the colors in the data browser tab are all black, meaning black text on black background.  Even if you change them, while they will work for that session, closing and reopening the app resets all of your settings.
Trying to determine if it was a 'color prefs' thing or a 'prefs in general' thing, this time I nuked the prefs file, confirmed the colors were at their defaults, then opened up 'Preferences' and toggled 'Remove Line Breaks in Schema View' (i.e. a pref _not_ related to color). I closed and restarted and sure enough, the colors went wonky again back to black-on-black.  Ironically, the 'Remove breaks' setting _did_ stick.
So... that's how to get to see what I was seeing.  Apparently the prefs for the colors are either being written, or read incorrectly even though the other prefs seem to be persisting and being read just fine.

Also, Configurar seems a better choice. I think you are going to fix the bug anyway, so it could be kept that way.

Also in that same dialog the _"New Folder"_ and _"Cancel"_ buttons are not translated but _"Abrir"_ is, but can't find the source _"New Folder"_ text either.

@revolter yeah, with a local copy is fine, but I was using the github webgui that apparently doesn't support it and the known way is generating a "reverse" pull request, that even if it works and gets the code in sync it makes a mess with the timelines for future pull requests.
@revolter well, not sure of that, literal translations of short terms lacking the proper context can be very confusing and become even annoying.

Other strange symptom is that if I do a query using ExecuteSQL, it will say, e.g. 4 records found, but they aren't shown.
Perhaps a complication is that I am using it to look at databases in an iOS simulator. (I use simPholders to conveniently find the directory, and it mounts the directory using OSXFuse...)
@revolter, I think I just solved it. I disabled simPholder's use of simPhuse, and now it seems to be working fine.
It's strange it worked until today.
So, A quick "scan" throught the Arabic file showed me that there is a huge number of logical mistakes, I'm referring to This: `<translation>تصدير(&amp;)</translation>` especially.

No, it's just another way of translating buttons (To action not noun), and some other Arabic specific rules.
Added Arabic translation.
@innermous Nice catch, it's truer to be 'ar_SA' instead of 'ar_EG'.
@justinclift `sqlb_ar.ts` is done. You can merge it.
@justinclift Most welcome. No, they should be translated in `sqlb_ar.ts`. Same thing happening with French translation ( and maybe others ), example: `Revert Changes` should be translated ( [here ](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/translations/sqlb_fr.ts#L1069)), but it isn't translated in the GUI either.
You can see the last one was ordering 'DESC'.
@karim, have you tried using a different database? Can you share the DB?

however, in the exported sql, the create statement contains backtick (`) as well as double quote (") and single quote (') , which seems to be a random behavior.
And it's also unpredictable in the CREATE INDEX statements:

Am I doing something wrong or is it another bug? Or I introduced it? As far as I understood, the problem with the invalid popup was when trying to open an encrypted database, right? Could you email your test database just to make sure it works with it as well after solving the problem?
One more thing, why was the travis change needed? Why didn't it fail for everybody else?

Perhaps you have reasons to make this request so strange.
I see there's PNG and BMP, both huge files especially if you store stuff in DB (=you have many rows), what's the reason for no JPEG yet?
Note: I was really surprised when the portable app showed up as an installer...

@inksword - please be more specific. "Opens a Finder" makes no sense, because Finder is an app that always runs. Do you mean "opens a Finder window"? And where do you drag the sqlite file, exactly? Onto the Dock icon, or onto the application icon inside a Finder window (in the first msg you mentioned the app, but I like to double check with you).
I guess @inksword is happy that he's found a work-around, so it's not an issue for him any more, and politely closed it. :smile:

Weird.. OK I was using Ubuntu when I ran the build, must be a Mac vs Ubuntu
difference. It's no big deal, I would say to keep (cmake ..) Because the
Ubuntu guys will just figure out that it needs one to make it work.
Strange differences...
Chrome (latest, Mac OSX 10.10) has a History file that is in SQLite format. But opening it with sqlitebrowser 3.7.0 gives the "Invalid file format" error.

But this char is also a wildcard so I'm not able to exclude unwanted items.
How can I escape wildcard in the filter textboxes?
Already tried with no luck. Doubling the char doesn't work.
Under Wndows, on a HD screen, the scrolled list of tables in the 'Browse data' tab is streched horizontally across the screen and becomes uncomfortably wide. It would be nice if its size could be adjusted to the size of the largest table name.

However, there is one issue with this always-on use of % that may be a problem.  It fails to handle the case where a string is also found as a sub-string of another string.  For example, the names: John and Johnson
So the result it that when we use a program, liker yours great app, the letters øæå is displayed wrong.

When function is called save(...) and instead of saving it releases savepoint - it seems a lit bit strange for me, so I have renamed some functions and fixed couple of logical errors (well, at least from my POV :D ).
Due to misleading name - I am not sure what was meant in particular points: either "I want to save" or "I want to release savepoint" :)
2.1 add to the name of the column special character "`"
However, there are some more issues with at least this particular special symbol.

I tried changing all the colors in preferences and none seemed to work
I dont have much idea how themes work tho, so no idea whose fault it is :)
For me, I prefer to display it in Browse Data tab.  For example, in the attached picture, I prefer the item "diag_msg_def_id" to be displayed in hex format because the item are defined in hex format in my software application.
If I change from default to hex, I get the proper conversion in the text box: `printf('0x%x',`Value`)`, I press ok and see the values. I then right click on the cell and choose `edit display format` and see the drop down now shows custom. I'm not able to actually type in the box, though. Is this expected?
But the message is still scary...
Sometimes I use YYYYMMDD format as the user_version in a database to know when it was last modified. It is stored and displayed correctly when using the SQLite3 command line:
I compared it with old (before Scintilla) appearance:

no uft-8 char is support
I have an existing database with utf-8 strings inside (tested with Eastern-European characters like čšťžýúä any others). Everything works OK, but when I try to import an .sql file (in "Execute SQL" tab, both "Open SQL file" or copy-paste the whole SQL file contents), the characters are replaced with ?.

Also, thanks to MKleusberg.
I am not sure why, but I have tried exporting my database to SQL using dbviewer. Then, I go to my website and use phpmyadmin to import the SQL file, and I keep having errors. It does not seem to understand the begin transaction statement. I have tried removing it, but it keeps saying that "integer" is not a valid SQL statement either.
The small patch series improves the handling/testing of unicode (non-ASCII) data in the `TestImport` test.
Non-latin1 characters become question marks (`?`) if I try to type them.
select unicode('α');
select unicode('?');
Someone might want to look into the windows version

Push it out the door!
A few hours after sending that message I found that my test of SQLlite behavior was flawed.  I’m not sure the bit data type really behaves differently in the two contexts.  Now I’ve eliminated that data type from my DB so I can no longer test for it.
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/SpatiaLite-on-Windows I think this issue can be closed because it's definitely not an issue with DB4S. I don't believe there's anything to be done other than making a more location-independent build of `mod_spatialite`.  The FileOpenDialog show all files in all formats. The SQLite formats are: *.db, *.sqlite, *.sqlite3, *.db3. Is it possible to add the filter?
@justinclift you're right, that was confusing. :smile:
Then encrypt with cipher embedded in DB4S
Really nice enhancement @MKleusberg!
The PortableApps Format is ugly portable specification, need much settings, A single zip with all contents are more useful. Note: I'm colombian, my english is bad.
This could be useful when incrementally building complex queries and subqueries.
Forgive me is any of this is already in place or has already been discounted as crazy. I have not looked through the code.
sqlitebrowser consistently crashes upon opening a database with a large blob in it (close to 1GB blob, but not over due to the SQLite max size)... the database(s) work fine in the program that utilizes them, but the browser can't handle it. I get a visual c++ error stating that "This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way."
I am commenting Using my mobile, so apologies for mis-formatting. Or any other mistakes. :smile:

That's weird, I've done some tests but couldn't reproduce. Here it immediately changes.
That's really strange, I followed the steps and it just works.
@samir-aguiar I'm not sure how to upload the file in this discussion but you can download "handle.csv" from here: http://web.mit.edu/aizhan/www/twitter_api_workshop/docs/
@samir-aguiar thanks! that did fix it, but why would the sqlitebrowser code not work with CR endings? because they are "old" and no one uses them? I guess there would be some people who would view their csv files using excel, and if they save it, the file will be saved with CR endings.
@samir-aguiar this might be off-topic re sqlitebrowser issue: I used both options of checking the line endings you suggested and terminal does say that I have CR endings, but when I opened the file in Sublime Text2, and viewed the file's line endings, the tick was on Mac OS9 and not on Windows. Would that imply that sublime text is not recognizing the correct line endings?
@atoregozh It doesn't work probably because they are not common and are not accepted by the RFC, but I don't know for sure, I've only recently joined the project :smile:
@samir-aguiar great you already added support for CR? Does that mean that I should reinstall sqlitebrowser? Again off-topic: I actually have Mac OS X, why would sublime show that I have Mac OS 9 and thus I have CR endings?
@samir-aguiar Thank you so much for helping!
As a non-native English speaker I don't understand "a real to have" as if 'rea;' is a noun as well?
The INI thing was just me nitpicking after realizing that the checkversion flag was in the registry. It's always helpful if user preferences are easy to migrate to another system; registry keys/hierarchy are usually not published by developers. Sqlitebrowser is very light on user preferences, but it's a burden with some Windows programs. I didn't realize that Qt libs are handling configuration persistence, so I understand now that it's not worth the hassle. Thanks for looking into it.

It would be great if the UI itself also had a dropdown of some of the rows when entering foreign key data. phpMyAdmin and MS Access are two examples (with the latter being awful) of GUI tools that do this, but I don't think there's a single SQLite example!

@Z4us sorry, but I didn't understand. What do you mean by separate file? I meant an option in the Preferences pane to select between the .qm translation files.
@https://github.com/samir-aguiar I mean it may be possible that developers make a kind of template for translators to easily translate the relevant data in the source to be translated to their language.

- On Mac perhaps it's better to integrate Sparkle into the project and let it do the job. It's widely used and probably has less bugs than the alternatives.

OffTopic: What is actually the difference between 'LibreOffice' and 'Open Office' ?
I'm trying to input some rare UTF symbols, like acute accent (U0301), for example. But looks like edits fields in the UI do not support them.
Basically seems like lots of software has problems inputting acute accent. Like Windows Notepad, for example. It's a tough symbol because it should combine with the previous symbol by the font itself.

Weird, memory is around 60% (sqlitebrowser using  400MB), CPU is around 25% and I see the Not Responding status every now and then in the task manager. I will be able to test it on another PC next week.

There is a small typo, the package is called build-essential without an 's' at the end.
anyone able to assist or successful with ubuntu trusty
Caused by wrong type specifier. rhs is size_t (unsigned long int), but '%u' is (unsigned int)
May be it should be changed to '%lu' ?
The actual database wasn't created by me so it might very well be in some weird format but I would like some kind of error message or log telling me that before I give up :)
It still crashes so i´m guessing the file is weird in some way.
When i insert new table from .csv file all my characters that are unicode like č,š,đ,ć,ž,ü,ö,ä, convert in ��

Thank you very much for mentioning the weird characters!

The sqlb- is annoying here, is it Ok to remove it?

@rp- I don't think this would be the case. As far as I know the file pointer is not moved line-wise. Even if there is only one line, it should return false as the pointer is at the begining of the line. Do-While seems to be risky, as an empty file might cause the loop-block to execute once before the condition detects it.

I can't seem to figure out how to open an encrypted sqlite database?  If this is not currently possible, I think it would be an appropriate enhancement.
Yes, please add support for SQLCipher.
"Coolissimo", Justin, will make the upcoming version "awesomer" than it already would be without this free and open encryption {isn't this kind of a "contradictio in terminis" ?-)} Can't wait :-)

I'm a technical writer (not a developer). I'm not sure what I am doing. I backed up my website and I have this file called kamanjao_kaman.sql that I'd like to view to make sure my pages are there.
I will try to do my best...nothing is possible :-) rone
