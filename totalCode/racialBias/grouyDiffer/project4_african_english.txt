(This is really cool btw.)
Perhaps something involving a bird in an engine room?
How about some sort of fast bird (or a more cuddly animal), perhaps mechanized, with a big helmet on? We want to emphasize: fast, safe.
You can take a peak at the current set of designs:
Been lost the last thirty minutes looking at steampunk birds, this one is amazing:

`f` is what exhibits the exception.
Re: reproducing the edge case -- to trigger the issue requires a specific ordering of events which is probably difficult to do synthetically.
## todo
Thanks @roanta for bearing with me as I muddled through the finagle-mysql code, and providing guidance.
## changes in api

No longer marked private[twitter].
Reopening. Missed that this was in the `gh-pages` branch.

I think I was referring to the POM :-)

Note the double `%%`
``` scala
``` scala
name := "finagle-stream"
-  ).dependsOn(finagleCore, finagleKestrel)
``` scala
+      Future.exception(new TooManyConcurrentRequestsException)
-        Future.exception(new ServiceNotAvailableException)
Yikes, this is an ugly bit of Synchronized\* in Scala-- might consider a more explicit approach, too.
Is this still an issue?
> You're encountering a problem due to the asymmetry of the String codec — which is really just a toy codec used as a minimal example for codec construction: it expects requests to be terminated with a newline, but the server codec strips the delimiter. So if you modify your proxy service a little, adding a newline to the request:
"com.twitter" % "finagle-core_2.9.1" % "1.9.12"
please make the change in the internal (birdcage) repo.
it's interesting that you're canceling the Futures.
LGTM!

Yes. I'm developing Xitrum (https://github.com/ngocdaothanh/xitrum), which is based on Netty too. I'm seeing warnings like below when updating Xitrum:

Maybe something playful about "smuggling" packets?
What about making the twitter bird a cog, surrounded by three gears that mesh with it?
Take the twitter logo imposed on a radial plane.  Then re-project it to a flat projection, find the inverse, map back to radial and you get a gear that fits the bird.
Combining ideas a bit: A bird whose nest is a coffee filter, maybe with some plumbing visible in/around the nest.

I like the idea about a mechanized bird.

What about a 2-second Finagle jingle (audio clip) that plays every time you start a Finagle service? (+ of course every time you read the online documentation)
How about a bird that wears steampunk goggles? https://www.google.no/search?q=steampunk+goggles&tbm=isch
Service filteredService = new LoggingFilter().andThen(myService); but that errors because it's abstract.
So you disagree that I handled exceptions should always be logged at a high
principle of least surprise...
confusingly also named LoggingFilter (for historical reasons) :)
That's some crazy work just to log unhandled exceptions.

@roanta has a local branch where he improved the client.
Hey Moses,
# tomcat-native-1.22 is now on archive.apache.org
Speaking of the devil! :+1:
Strange... what happens if you make Travis build it with maven instead of sbt? If that's relevant?
How does this compare and contrast with Akka?
We need the possibility to change the delimiter used when creating names for Ostrich stats
implement BITCOUNT, BITOP, PSETEX

It seems that finagle-exception hardcodes a dependency on jerkson_2.8.1 in the 2.9.1 repo, which cannot be resolved.
could you share your hackery? ;) I'd really need it. Thanks!

I've updated the request with a04aecb ; so that the SSLEngine is created each time; from the SSLContext passed to the ClientBuilder.
Marius,
but none of them has the elegance of the Finagle framework, so we
can apply to create a reasonably good Protobuf based protocol.

From there on... even afer ones adds the correct resolvers and dependencies in the build.sbt file - I am lost as to how to get it to compile against SBT 0.11.0 and Scala 2.8.1
It would be nice to have the ability to use that boilerplate Service/Client structure and be able to compile our code on SBT 0.11.0 and Scala 2.8.1...

Either there is a bad behavior here on Finagle's part or I've messed up something non-obvious in the code...
Not sure if this is finagle, netty or user error.
if(nearResponse.../*accepatble*/){
but that seems more complicated than necessary. Or we can simply pass a flag
