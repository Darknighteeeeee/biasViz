* Special configuration: tor = always
## Problems / Questions:
### Avoid leaking local peer ips to peer exchange
- Skip local ip ranges on pex
- Moved to simple UDP broadcasting with custom protocol due [zeroconf problems](#issuecomment-361974868)
I'm not sure if zeroconf/mdns/bonjour has other benefits over udp broadcasting that we can use/need
> broadcast: {"cmd":"discoverRequest", "params": {"zeronet": {"port": 15441, "sites_changed": 1517415166, "rev": 3222, "peer_id": "-ZN0061-AnJx5Pamk0U0"}}}

**Questions**
@mkg20001 It's very abstract, missing lots of details, but we will see once it's launched.  Actually you don't have to change anything in content.json, here is the steps:
- Generate address using vanitygen
"zeroid.bit": ["1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz"]
"cert_pattern": "^1ZeroiD"
It would allow any certificate provider that's Bitcoin address starts with "1ZeroiD".
## Problems
**Possible solution:** Display only the first few letter of the unique part, eg.: user@JnkH...

Do you have Tor enabled?

Then developers will find the reason why clients don't download files hard, so add a notification to tell the reason is a simple way.  Some people in China needs access blocked sites via a proxy. But if you set a system proxy, ZeroNet will connect to other peers via proxy. Some proxy's bandwidth is limited and can't open a FileServer port, so we need a argument to disable proxy. What application are you using to set the system proxy address?  Is it possible to install ZeroNet to a remote machine?

If the url starts with `#` it won't add `?` anymore, but I recommend you to use `?` instead of `#` (eg. `page.cmd("wrapperReplaceState", [null, "", "?abc"]);`) as hashtags are originally for jumping to anchors on one page and using replace/pushState should not reload the page.  Unfortunately Nacl is not compatible with the crypto we use, pyopenssl does not have functions we need (eg aes encryption). Cryptography probably could work, but has binary dependencies and requires compilation to every platform/openssl version, which could reduce the portability.

- It does not works for every string, eg if you have somthing like this: `if (mode == "Page") $("#mode").text("Page")` and you want to translate "Page" then it will also translate the one in condition so it will never matches. As for solution for this you have to write: `if (mode == "Page") $("#mode").text(_("Page"))` and if put `"_(Page)": "Oldal"` to the translate json, it will only translate `_("Page")`

there is a multiuser plugin, but if you care about your privacy you should run two separate installation in tor always mode (start the second one eg. with `--fileserver_port 15442 --ui_port 43111`)
you can use `--multiuser_local` to disable that restriction
Lots of VPS (most?) providers makes your account suspended for running Tor, so I think we should not start it by default.

If you use tor always, then it does not matter, your port will be close every time.
@DaniellMesquito You don't need to upgrade ZeroNet, the change is only in ZeroHello site's source code which should happen automatically.

Is it possible to add to the ZeroNet network, the concept of AlternativeTo ?
http://alternativeto.net/software/alternativeto/
Easiest way to to this is install Tor browser bundle, start it then start zeronet using `zeronet.py --tor_proxy 9150 --tor_controller 9151 --tor always`
are you sure are you running in tor only mode? it should display "Successfully started Tor onion hidden services." message then (https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/blob/master/src/Ui/UiWebsocket.py#L68) then.
you are probably doing something wrong: out of limits/invalid files/etc.
There is multiple possibility to solve this:

There is many problems with webrtc:
- Tor connection not possible (Around 50% of ZeroNet clients using Tor)
#### Cons:
- Db corruptions
i think custom trigger should work if you put it as index
I have created mirrors:
Distributing on torrent probably would cause other problems,since it's blocked on many networks even outside of China
@TheNain38 it's not related to this problem, hmac would not help on that
- Much larger messages
I know, this is a more complicated solution, but it was chosen because of the reasons i written in my prev comment.
it goes against "uncensorable" goal, so not a good idea
It can be done two ways:
Questions:
Eg if you create a `plugins/DarkSkin/all.css` file on all.css request it would also append this file's content to the end. (same for js)

@drjmedulla
@drjmedulla Can you check if ZeroNet is not running twice? (eg via taskmanager, search for python.exe)
cd "$(dirname "$0")/../ZeroNet"
It would be nice to see whats different please try the -vv option
Yes, include tor if you want to use it. Docker philosophy: one service = one container
You need to add
zeronet sites runs in sandboxed iframe for security reasons, in this enviroment not every javascript functions are available.

@jamesalexanderdickerson Do you have any special character in the directory path where you have extracted ZeroNet?
I dont understad, the sites.json contains the site's bitcoin address (eg. 1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT), which is case-sensitive

# Idea1: Hotpatch
If required (will try to translate zerohello and zerotalk and it will turns out), then we could add allow partial and regex matches by `js/all.js:re` and `js/all.js:partial`

ZeroNet protocol is totally different from bittorrent and does not use any torrent liblary, so it's not an issue here.
`zeronet.py siteSign 1Apr5ba6u9Nz6eFASmFrefGvyBKkM76QgE --inner_path data/users/content.json --publish` should help (or you should pass the `--inner_path data/users/content.json` also for sitePublish)

@62gs8ha: Merger site (and zeronet) is mainly for data-based sites, but you can define optional files that only downloaded when the user's browser requests it.
The Tor controll protocol (port 9051) only accept connections from 127.0.0.1, but if multiple user has access to your computer then it's recommended to enable CookieAuthentication.

It was related to gevent 1.0.2, fixed in 44a68104fb867f193433aea2be0c791475ff3913
Problems:
For experimentation I tried javascript based encrypt/decrypt solution (bitcore), but it's around 80x times slower, so it's not really an option.
After doing some research encrypting using only the ecc public key ([bitmessage method](https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage/blob/master/src/highlevelcrypto.py#L23)) is not secure eg.: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ntpvh/bitcrypt_encryption_with_bitcoin_addresses/cmhmny9
(similar to [electrum's encryption](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/ae425764237d89a5e16db4f984406509f08f2601/lib/bitcoin.py#L541), but without hmac)
It would be nice if someone with more experience in this field give some advice if its a good way to encrypt messages like this.
Added my ideas and questions here: https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/3t6vnm/need_guidelines_for_ecc_based_messaging/
Cons:
- It's more complicated and harder to implement
- Add message_id -> aeskey
- Encrypt again
- Decrypt messages using ECIES

While the JavaScript has some advantage (eg. more people know it), but I think Python is more advanced language, so we don't have plans to switch to node.js. Although the alternative implementations are welcomed.

Hm, i think the problem is with the openssl.
``` python
except Exception, err:
To enable password for webui:
Cons:
Cons:
Required modifications:
- nofish: username, has to be unique per site
.bit domains can be problematic that way: a domain could have clearnet ip address and also zeronet address representation.
So it looks harder than I first throught...
probably it would be smart to change the .bit to something zeronet related to prevent mixing with real namecoin .bit mappings, ideas that came up:
Cons:
So I'm not sure if thats the problem.
Cons:
Cons:
- Display warning to user: You are in Tor-only mode, you should also configure your browser to use Tor network. (maybe restrict external resources using Content Security Policy)
- DHT: Its not easy to write a good DHT implementation and Tor doesnt support UDP, so we need custom DHT (it requires reliable servers for bootstrapping and not sure if its going to work fine with current small number of nodes) or proxies that converts DHT traffic to tcp.
- Ability to black/whitelist sites
- It should work using on Tor (TCP only, maybe UDP on clearnet)
- It should work using on Tor (TCP only, maybe UDP on clearnet)
- [x] Add Disqus to allow comments/questions
Faq:
``` python
``` python
``` python
- The currently used bitcoin crypto libs doesn't support it, so they need to be modified
In full Tor mode we create a new .onion address for every site you seeding to improve privacy by make it harder to find out what other sites you using. So if someone has 100 sites in his/her client then on the startup we need to create 100 i2p address on startup.

another alternative:

yeah you probably right a custom prefix could be better solution, but i think we can have both: z/ prefix for .zero d/ prefix for .bit.
If he owns the private key he could have access to bitcoins too. (havent tried yet)
I have tried the BitTorrent Maelstorm about 1 month ago (found on a russian forum :) ) and I was not impressed. Its basically a torrent client embedded into a browser.
Cons:
f(*args, **kwargs)
``` python
- Stop zeronet
- Use siteSign
Something with built-in rate limiting and maybe client priority will be nice, but I don't know anything like this for python :(
Torrent like file splitting and distributing
- Most of the peers using Tor network to connect ZeroNet, that is not suitable to transfer big files
BitTorrent support is planned in the next 6 months, which will provide solution for big files

Cons:
- Has to be authenticated separately
- Cookie/CORS problems?
- [x] Experimental piecemap hasher
Cons:
Cons:
- Can't display separate leech/seed number

3) Cloned ZeroTalk fork in
* Tor status: not available
* Tor status: Default setting
SyntaxError: unqualified exec is not allowed in function 'bench' it is a nested function (UiRequest.py, line 645)
And it worked fine. Is it due to an older python version? I'll have to look into updating. My ZeroNet on Windows is running off of Python 2.7.9(pure coincidence) and didn't encounter this. So it probably is related to that old bug I mentioned. @April93 Weird, that `exec init in globals(), locals()` is Python3-style. [Here's the stackoverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4484872/why-doesnt-exec-work-in-a-function-with-a-subfunction) I read on how to 'fix' the problem. No idea what's going on tbh. PR: #1253. I tried updating to python 2.7.14 and it works fine without the fix. Yeah, looks like this was a bug in Python <=2.7.8, which was fixed in 2.7.9.
But i have suspection if this issue is caused by TorBrowser, because in Firefox, sites are loading!
Update: after a few minutes i closed some zites in TorBrowser which i tried to open and then i see all is loading in TorBrowser. Thank you！！！
import urllib2

I will get Error:
Thx help me. That's incorrect use of `ZeroNet-win-dist`. Instead of:
@elliekeli
In clearnet you have a login, a password and sometimes a nick. In ZeroNet, your nick would be `elliekeli`, your login would be `1AoDYdMxwA55FTp2FNBrMaMv9r1ZzC6jSu`, and password would be a private key (which is stored in `core/data/users.json`). ZeroNet shows that login in sidebar.
ZeroNet is decentralized, so there can be options when nickname isn't unique (e.g. KaffieID). But login is auto-generated and guaranteed to be unique. Password is also auto-generated, so there is no chance you would be hacked (if someone doesn't steal your `users.json`, of course).

The cause is a computer virus. @kofzhanganguo where did you download ZeroNet from?  ### Step 1: Please describe your environment
* Tor status: disabled
Ranged requests like `0-100000` when file size is `100` only never end. Moreover, after a couple of such requests even normal requests fail.
```javascript
function ajax(size) {
1. Send `ajax(50)`
2. Send `ajax(1000)` a couple of times (about 5 is enough for me)
3. Send `ajax(50)`
Looks like the `src/Test/TestRateLimit.py::TestRateLimit::testCall FAILED                [ 49%]` test failed. Is this important? @krixano lemme check. That check is about how much time some op takes. So that's not important in this case as I didn't edit that part of code. Using the same dropdown code as ZeroHello might be a good idea, and look cleaner. It does use a ⋮ instead of an arrow but that could work as well. @anoadragon453 I tried to find other buttons which look the same way, but didn't manage to do that. So maybe a dropdown would be better, right. Though I am not sure what would be better. @HelloZeroNet, do you allow me to bring yet-another-library to Sidebar plugin? @HelloZeroNet Did you get a letter from `saketjoshiiit [at] gmail [dot] com`? Kinda spam? @HelloZeroNet I'll use that library then. @HelloZeroNet

During this GUI doesn't respond. @HelloZeroNet Please?  @shortcutme, I understand that SQL is difficult, but using regular expressions to parse SQL... Here are some more hacks:
Separately, it just doesn’t make sense to fork Namecoin for a private network. Who’s going to mine it and why would they do that? This is a rhetorical question (it’s out of scope it seems to me, so the answer likely doesn’t matter). Not quite, it was actually discussed as a use case in documentation.  As note above the plug-in already is implemented for a bootstrapped build. A majority of altcoins are forks of other crypto-currencies, so the logic behind this would be to perhaps implement a blockchain agnostic feature to perhaps support any coin with name value stores (ie. Emercoin) in order to further decentralized DNS and identity management.  I reloaded zeronet， and restored user.json.

If i am not wrong i am connected to zites: 561
I am "connected to" (visited and not deleted) roughly 600 zites.
it seems like You solved it, because for last around 7 hours i seen no "[Connection with UiServer Websocket was lost](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1249)" and have no issue browsing zeronet which is great. Thank you Just now i found zites are not loading in TorBrowser, it resulted in default browser error: The connection was reset.

I believe this is a bug on the zeronet daemon After sometime the zeronet daemon spits out this message from `sudo systemctl status zeronet`
nginx conf (part of)
access_log /var/log/nginx/zeronet/default.log;
error_log /var/log/nginx/zeronet/error.log;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

zeronet conf
and What is 'VerifyError: sites too large' and 'Ui UiServer : No user found'?

One file contains capture for Tor only mode and another for default zeronet start without any parameters.

Please, do `sudo systemctl start tor` and `sudo systemctl status tor` @grez911 No output to `'PROTOCOLINFO' | nc 127.0.0.1 9051 `and `sudo netstat -anp | grep tor`. Tor **is** running:

Looks like something wrong with the tor in your case. @Akito13 Are you still having this problem? @imachug Zeronet works, but it doesn't run with Tor.   It sends me to Sites.ZeroNetwork.bit
Give a `<input>` to set any language (for example: `JP`) Have we considered setting up a transifex? its pretty good for tracking translation completion  https://travis-ci.org/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/builds/259342067#L655-L664 https://github.com/vbuterin/pybitcointools/issues/175  @HelloZeroNet is this the right way to resolve the undefined name errors at https://travis-ci.org/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/builds/259342067#L665-L673 @cclauss, what do you think about #1016?  @shortcutme Is this the right way to fix these two undefined name errors?  I have this list:

@yurivict @HelloZeroNet All third-party libraries are in src/lib, isn't it? > if the built-in, raw socket based tor communication way does not works for you.
py-stem is required for alternative way to access Tor through the optional plugin StemPort that only works when native access method fails.
You should delete socket-based code in favor of the Tor-supplied py-stem module. py-stem always works, and is externally supported. If it breaks, you can always have Tor people fix it. It's easier this way, no need to maintain separate code that does the same without any benefit.
And add py-stem to the list of dependencies.

Usually the response includes the crypto both clients support (as seen in live traffic).
At least afaik. But I have seen that behavior in live traffic too. ...and it completely leaves out the fact about tls wrapping the socket afterwards and that the handshake is optional (afaik the client responds to requests even if no handshake was sent, if that is a feature)
When I open ZeroNet, a ZeroHello page opens.

1. Create new zite
2. Change `optional` entry to `^abc def$`
`optional_files` entry in `content.json` contains `abc def` file. i have a similar bug. I can limit file extensions. ok. fine. but I want to limit zite size by keeping larger content (jpegs. gifs) which otherwise load and exclude by filename or folder. This doesnt seem to be working. also, we need to deal with spaces in filenames. Its a utf issue but---lfn has been around for awhile now. > exclude by filename or folder
I would like to customise a bit the startup of ZeroNet, mainly by passing Tor to the Browser ports and setting it to open on Tor, etc.

In the actionDbQuery function in UiWebsocket.py, the variable s which is keeping track of execution time is only defined when the debug flag is specified but is used with the verbose flag and thus has not been initialized.  I recently install the new Linux cinnamon 18.1 and I downloaded your ZeroNet bundle but I seem to be having problems with it. After I downloaded the bundle I clicked on ZeroNet.sh to set up ZeroNet and it loaded the ZeroNet site for the first time like it was supposed to. Well the next day I clicked on zeronet.py to get it running like I did when I had the old version of Linux but for some reason it wont load ZeroNet site. I only get a screen that says unable to connect. I noticed the only way I can get ZeroNet to load now is to always click on ZeronNet.sh every time instead of the zeronet.py like I used to do. I also have my port open. I typed in run zeronet.py in the command terminal and got this

In Whonix, ZeroNet runs on the workstation and Tor on the gateway. These are two different VMs connected by internal network. All outgoing connections are forced through Tor.
ZeroNet continues to function, it fails to notice broken Tor hidden services connection. Do you consider this a bug?
## Problems:
Im not shure if this means /assets/xyz
The previous implementation is racy: after sending a command it would
OpenSSL version 0100020AF
<meta name="referrer" content="origin-when-crossorigin">
```bash
1. Is the content securely and smartly (e.g. ZeroNet measures statistics about network congestion, considers constraints set up by the administrator - e.g. maximum size of the storage, maximum bandwidth used for up/down, etc.) cached to minimize overall pressure and to increase availability and stability? Or is it just a naive implementation of the torrent protocol (i.e. opening of thousands of connections one by one, and thus effectively DDoSing small SOHO devices with NATs, which count up to the vast majority of all leaf nodes of the internet network infrastructure)?
1. In many legislations, there are e.g. black lists of web sites with censored content or any other identifiers technically describing the censored content (so to answer your question - the "who" is the state). Should there be any trial, all the data will be either easily accessed (because of saved passwords) or decrypted (because of weak ciphering, some mistake or just because of access to enormous or breakthrough computing resources) or because of torture or whatever, it's way better to not have these data persisted at all. These countries include Germany (huge audio and video prohibition - just try any German VPN on youtube), Czech republic (online hazard games), USA (various...), Australia, China, Turkey, Sveden, ...
1. Ok, in case Tor is blocked (e.g. Syria, Turkey, etc.), is there any other way how to "hide" yourself? Ok, now it's clear to me what is the direction of ZeroNet. I must admit I'm a bit disappointed, but on the other hand I know very well how difficult it is to build a well-behaving P2P network serving for universal purposes.
**However, the exe version works fine till now.**

Most fonts are not optimized for differentiating these homographs, so we want ZeroNet to display them in puny coded form.

How is ZeroNet supposed to make Tor work differently? Try to append "--tor disable" to the start command as long as Zeronet is not blocked thanks to both of you. Both suggestion fixed my problem.  Every time I start my ZeroNet 0.5.1 on my Unbuntu 12.04, I can see this error message repeated in the console after running ZeroNet for a few minutes.   coffee script not friendly of i18n, like that:

Yes, it is difficult attacks to defend from. Have any ideas on how to defend in the future?
Can we add "peer you already asked for that piece stop asking/Ill stopping serving you".

Strange it's present on my system :o but the bell is not correctly formated
Also, as I know Python isn't very fast. And network connection and browser loading are slower. So I think it's uncenessary to benchmark.

Probably something that should be fixed in Brave anyway.
While testing with Tails (see #610) ZeroNet stops or gets stuck while attempting to make a connection.
[GCC 4.9.2], Gevent: 1.0.1
1. It seems Tails has restrictive Tor SOCKS proxy rules so that apps that don't work properly don't use it.
3. When ZeroNet is started without Tor and Tor proxy, it also cannot connect (running as amnesia, with or without sudo).
I double checked the Tor Socks port (tried --tor-proxy as well).

You can easily get the revision number with Regex e.g `"(?<=self.rev = )\d+"` (so no external libraries are needed) however there would probably be a better way of doing it.
For my ZeroNet(Werkzeug)-based project I'll use **Angular2** routing instead of **CoffeeScript**, for example http://127.0.0.1:5000/detail/11 but I'll see this error:
``` python
> When creating a SPA there are routes that are only known to the browser. For example, /customer/21 may be a client side route for an Angular app. If this route is entered manually or linked to directly as the entry point of the Angular app (aka a deep link) the static server will receive the request, because Angular is not loaded yet. The server will not find a match for the route and thus return a 404. The desired behavior in this case is to return the index.html (or whatever starting page of the app we have defined).

I hit F12 and it brings up Developer Tools but I don't know what I'm looking for, I've never used that because I'm not a developer or coder.
It seems that the problem has compounded as the zite (antilibrary.bit) got bigger.

I opened cmd and ran ZeroNet.cmd from inside it and got an error pointing to C:\python... (apparently I already had Python installed and I _think_ it was trying to use this version which lead to the error).
I removed the PATH entry for Python from my Environment Variables, ran ZeroNet.cmd again and it worked fine.
I _think_ it was actually PYTHONPATH that I deleted
why does this happen & how could this be prevented?

@martinvahi Is this problem still present? What is your OS? I can't reproduce it on Ubuntu.  After upgrading my zerobundle to vertion 0.4.1, I've got an error:

Would zeronet benefit from this?

@weakish
On my machine, this site is the clause: `http://127.0.0.1:43110/1ARCHYFfke9k3Jbj9uVXmbeDV9XueK3hLA`.
@weakish, I see now the log and had the same error. Thanks for help. I never hear talk about "date" folder, but "data" is where the sites are placed. You don't know the diff between "date" and "data", how can you see a debug log better than me and say have knowledge to say my site is the problem? 1ARCHYFfke9k3Jbj9uVXmbeDV9XueK3hLA is my site, why?! I'm sure you seen my site in another issue and going here to talk that the cause of problem is my side, but I'm not the reason of the problem!

@DaniellMesquito
`this site is the clause` is not accurate. I'm in a hurry.
It a preconception commet, like the machism. My brazillian Internet connection have 10MB diary limit, after it my connection works at 3KB per second. And ZeroNet works very well in this extremely-poor connection! I don't think what you say is a point to disconsider saving the data plans of your users. I don't see the point of download unecessary bytes if it can download only what user needs. This uses BitTorrent-like, Tor, Bitcoin, Namecoin and a bunch of things, why not use GIT too?!

@HelloZeroNet Why didn't you make a tagged github release? Many OSes normally take only tagged releases.

I don't understand what is causing it does it have the wrong URL to reach the tor network?

Homebrew? Now I am confused, what is Homebrew? It looks like Alice is falling down the rabbit hole. I am looking for an idiot proof method of installation as I am not as knowledgeable as many techs. Thanks for the replies!!!

I guess if you use both Tor and ZeroNet you should be safe?

Port being open vs. closed is a security matter, and ZN should handle the situation carefully and accurately.
I cannot start Zeronet with Tor on Arch Linux.
I receive the following error when I start zeronet:
For some reason Hello Zeronet shows very different peer counts:
The separate counts of onion peers are also all very different.
This is confusing, shouldn't they be all the same or very close?
Is ZN supposed to succeed seeing site hosted on tor-only peer from another tor-only peer? I think this should work, but it doesn't work for me.
I tested ZN inside the Tor-connected VM and it works fine.

Onions can be generated using Shallot (https://github.com/katmagic/Shallot):
shallot a | grep -v '^\-*$' | sed -e 's/.*tries: //'
Actually, this mode can't work outside of the VM, because it needs DNS resolution hooked up to Tor and IP routed through Tor, which I never saw to be done outside of the VM.
- Whonix VM
- Qubes VM
One probably could make a whole network hooked to Tor, but this isn't a practical setup.
I am not sure, but I don't think this is supposed to happen a lot.

ZN should move the files that browser requests to the top of the download queue so that the client will more likely see some version of the site instead of just waiting for something that he maybe doesn't even need at the time.
Something isn't working, but I can't tell what.

Thank you. Also after enabling the "This is my site" option I am presented with a javascript alert() that states:
├── lib
└── ZeroChat.coffee
/* ---- /1A6J3fhJvUc7eTfonTU24a4n8GTM46YBxq/js/ZeroChat.coffee ---- */
This may or may not be a related - not sure.
In general it is more flexible to have self-setuid option.
control_auth_cookie is a deliberately quite restricted file. Regardless of zeronet, Tor best practice are effectively to add the debian-tor group to tor allowed users AND set CookieAuthFileGroupReadable to 1 .
That's how they manage who can use Tor on the machine. IMO Setting suid on zeronet side seem like a dirty workaround to me.

On ZeroMail I've got: stats icon (upper left), ZeroMail icon (upper right), 'New message', 'inbox', 'sent' (right), don't have contacts (I had one before) and 'Inbox: no message' and 'No message selected'
EDIT: error messae appear while editing:
@Jzarecta why are you making off-topic topic comments in unrelated issues?
I think this should be reconsidered because it would further reduce the entry barrier for accessing decentralized websites from "download, extract, execute" to "click on this link".
Most browser support [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/IndexedDB) which can be used to store multiple gigabytes of data (up to some % of the available disk storage in chrome AFAIR)
> Tor connection not possible (Around 50% of ZeroNet clients using Tor)
I just found ZeroNet, so I'm sorry if I misunderstood something about how it works.
> Tor connection not possible
Are you running a local ZN or going over a proxy ?
If local ZN: can you check what your debug.log says ?
i meet this problem but i am going over a proxy ,can help me ? @Erkan-Yilmaz  Problem is probably from your proxy @yulele17 .

zeronet error like this:

the error is following:
You can try to fix the problem of your network if you can, otherwise Tor is your main option to circumvent the imposed limitations.    UiWebsocket.py:440
i said clicking from 1HeLLo
is a obvious flaw / bug then
@icf20 In ZeroMail he sets the `"domain": "Mail.ZeroNetwork.bit"` in `content.json`, which is what is causing ZeroHello to point to the .bit domain, and not to the address directly

@icf20 Btw, if you want to contact me, you can send me a ZeroMail at `thekill38`
When i try to enable Tor for every connection, i got this error

the seceond solution seems unsafe, or you need to set a passwd for the server i guess
in my opinion this is a huge privacy risk because GPS
> Can you explain what you mean by GPS being a privacy risk?
on that topic is a bit more complex, for example google play services ask for gps, cell data(tower cell), wifi data, general location every 40-60 seconds

The easiest way to fix this is to add a MAC. I would recommend HMAC-SHA256 as that is already used in ZeroNet. The key for the mac could either be provided separately, or both the aes key and the mac key could be derived from a single key using HKDF or another secure algorithm.
msg = 'abcdefghijklmno'
- "Bob" successfuly decrypted a mail from "Eve" with the same content as the mail from "Alice"
@TheNain38 It is definitely a problem that you were able to do that, and I wasn't aware that was possible. Adding an HMAC will in itself not be sufficient, to fix that. Some more changes will be required.
@mirrorwish If you use a nonce and an HMAC, it should be good to prevent this attack, right?
@TheNain38 Assuming that the nonce is placed under the HMAC, and that the recipient checks that this nonce was not previously received, then I believe it would be.
@TheNain38  You can contact me at
Bitmessage: BM-87ZQse4Ta4MLM9EKmfVUFA4jJUms1Fwnxws
ZeroMail: ichigo (I haven't really used this so I'm not sure if it works)
@mirrorwish
ZeroMail: thekill38
You seem a bit cautios about adding a MAC, and I don't really understand why, as I see no downsides.
PK: Public Key
To encrypt a mail:
@HelloZeroNet It's a **shared secret**, look at this image:
> Much larger messages
@basxto I assume you are mainly referring to PastePr.
I don't know yet if your usage of 'aesEncrypt/Decrypt' in PastePr is secure, but I will look into it, and give my judgment.
@icf20 The problem with that is not many people have Bitcoin. Zeronet is very noob friendly so you should not expect many people using it to have Bitcoin or even know how to get it. Also a spammer could have a Bitcoin balance and once it has been detected as spamming they could just launder their Bitcoins and spam again.
@AceLewis it's not a problem for anyone except for people who do not have Bitcoin. They can get bitcoin if they want.
Also it requires energy to run a gpu. So it's more like mining bitcoin just with a negative roi. Scammers will buy GPU if it pay off. It all depend on the ROI of the phishing campain.

It looks like CRIME depends on observing multiple ciphertexts.
In basically any ZeroNet design I can think of, there is only going to be one ciphertext per patch - I can't see a mechanism for an attacker to force the site owner to inject his extra content and repeatedly patch the site?

I wonder if we have the same issue as early Bitcoin-core days where people steal the wallet.dat because of plain text.
Should ZN have an encryption mechanism of the user.json and sites.json?
@almet
@almet @5hanth @ratijas Maybe the encrypted users.json feature can be implemented as a plugin, similar to the web ui password plugin.   I'm following the [site tutorial](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post:43:ZeroNet+site+development+tutorial+1), and I'm getting the above error at the last stage (before publishing).

Cons:
- For SSL + Python, does anything prevents us to pin the versions (like what you're currently doing) in the `setup.py`?
As much as we all appreciate restatements of the self-obvious, the "Are we children? Or are we men?" hypothetical was a tongue-in-cheek reference to [Devo](https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/devo)'s 1978 synthpop classic [**"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!"**](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/devo/q__are_we_not_men__a__we_are_devo_)
👍 🤐 👍
May the genderless penguin be with you, fellow packagers. 🐧  please first stop to bully. Secondly, if you think that zeronet is a nightmare so fork it and make your own. > It's not simply the lack of a setup.py script, PyPI wheel, or eponymous top-level package. It's also […]
And I couldn't find what makes this condition.I'll report as soon as I know.
How would this be different from adding new features in like this `css/plugins/DarkSkin/all.css` ?

It's fast solution using nonstandard attribute for Chrome only. This issue awaiting full cross-browser solution: catch window opening from parent frame. Something like this:
@TheNain38 I am developing service for authorization via social networks and need normal `window.open` or any alias (it's not a problem to write `@cmd "openWindow"` instead of `window.open`).
Update: ZeroNet also fails on PyPy 5.0. However the benchmarks on PyPy 5.0 (providing Python 2.7.10) compared with those from vanilla Python 2.7.11 on the same machine are interesting:

By the way, I am connected to internet via an OpenVPN server. Sorry I forgot mentioning earlier.
It looks like this error happens when I am connected to VPN. Without VPN I can connect.
The Errors also looks like a network problem to me, Having it working without the VPN is telling us that the problem is more on the VPN side then Zeronet.   is there any official PPA ? stable /testing PPA ?
See: http://askubuntu.com/questions/71510/how-do-i-create-a-ppa

@alxbob It is a question for me? It's not my site. I just learned how it (and zeroID) works. Any authorization service (including zeroID) is only associating username with public key. On "Nanasi text board" you sign the certificate yourself, so anybody can choose any username (one username may be associated with two or more public keys). It is quite useless service because you can work directly with public keys (without usernames) without any authorization service.
Can something like that apply to zeronet id?

When we want to always use Tor, there is no need to check for an open port. Let alone opening a port. That should be avoided.
But you cannot - and do not try to open a port at the Tor exit, right?

can you even fix the tor thing.
The way to implement this is wrapping the 'executable' (python code) in a Windows service. I'm sure it's quite easy to implement (I've wrapped exes as services before, but not python scripts).

Thanks again for returning control to the edge, peer to peer, autonomous networks, so cool.
Hamish.
That is a poor excuse.
You might also like to consider how squatted NMC names are, opening up the full Unicode space may well defeat that.
To complain about phishing and unicode while exploiting torrent and bitcoin protocols and their attendant criminality is lame.
Given the much easier and effective phishing attacks, taking a position of protection against this kind of esoteric quirk is patronising.  I'm not saying it can't be done, but attempting to guard against such attacks by denying choice isn't worth the effort.
Then the problem is small. I assumed the browser-like implementaion (most Unicode names are shown in address bar). Thats why they have blacklists and [complex display algorithm](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IDN_Display_Algorithm) that determine which to display, Unicode name or raw punycode.

now i get the ConnServer Error. I am assuming the tor is working fine with zeronet?!
@ASBaumgarten Thanks!  Just got it installed and ran it along side.  Unfortunately I got the Big Red X with "Sorry. You are not using Tor.", but I'm new to all this so I'll keep poking around.  Might you be able to point me in the direction of a correctly configured .torrc file?
@ASBaumgarten **Touchdown!**  Thank you for your help.  Below is my current state and the steps I performed to get here (in case anyone else is interested).
- Used homebrew to install Tor (`brew install tor`), which installed v0.2.7.6
- Started Tor in a terminal window
- git clone https://github.com/gyulaweber/ZeroNet

The UI is suggesting that there is a problem with Tor connecting.
As I said, I configured Tor as suggested in the FAQ. I'm a member of the group, etc.
echo 'PROTOCOLINFO' | nc 127.0.0.1 9051
250-PROTOCOLINFO 1
Also, I tried to connect to the control port with TorCtl for python and it worked fine as long as the "data" directory was at the proper permissions BUT zeronet still spits out that same error.
I'm using ubuntu 15.10.

What does this mean? With the same zero id I'm not the sender on both devices? And, clicking on the trash of a message isn't deleting, but hiding it?
I don't think `pkill python` is the most efficient, is there another way?

Bittorrent over Tor isn't a good idea
- http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/47/15/56/PDF/TorBT.pdf
Are you sure, that zeronet's usage of torrent does not suffer from the same issue?
What in case only Tor proxy settings without Tor ControlPort - hence without Tor hidden services?
@adrelanos from what I understand ZeroNet relies on BitTorrent Trackers for peer discovery, which means the ips, ports and hashes being advertised by ZeroNet clients can be leaked from any of the Trackers (due to the tracker scrape API)
Is there a special way I must connect to see changes locally on refresh? Or is using http://127.0.0.1:43110/{Public_site_key} proper?
Seems like every time I edit a coffeescript file and click 'update' on the site, it says "x File update failed" where x is a number (which makes me think I'm not going to the proper place to see it locally since it shouldn't need to 'update').
This is weird, I went back to check my code and it's the old code (but I see the new changes)
Odd then, because I sign it and look at all.js and my changes aren't in the file. If I delete all.js and hard refresh the page it acts like all.js still exists.
Now it just generated it... Odd

Is it a bug? or... What am I doing wrong?
That doesn't seem right. In lieu of something easier like NPM, I'm looking for a static C/C++ library i can import into something like QT which is embeddable, and doesn't involve an installation of Python or the dependencies (e.g. Msgpack).
@azcoppen  have you managed to produce something ?
In this case, it's highly likely that peers would be incriminated as _publishers_ of material (more severely punishable and increasingly risky), - rather than just viewers - , if identified by IP. The Tiananmen problem given above is provocative enough that even a static JPG could put a peer at risk of a criminal offence in that jurisdiction, and the recording of the IP on the network would be incriminating.
...is the AES provision within G-Wan:
http://gwan.com/api#crypto
As silly as a question as this might sound, how do i have control over what i'm seeding? And how do i explain the same thing to someone who is less technical? One of the stated design goals of Zeronet is a simple and attractive UI, but i can't see how to do that at all.
I understand the issue, but I don't think it's in zeronet design to provide such level of security.
If you have your state actors in your threat modeling, best is to use some amnesiacOS.

Zerome or myzero
ZeroMe and MeetZero are the most appealing choices from the list.
I also have a less serious name suggestion taken from the Star Trek universe: "[Unimatrix Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimatrix_Zero)," which is the name of a censorship-free decentralized social network of rogue Borg. Perhaps it's silly, but I had to mention it given the obvious parallels.

Regarding the note about including I2P addresses, it would be a good idea to read I2P's BitTorrent docs (linked in #45) to check how I2P's slight torrent protocol differences would affect ZeroNet. I don't think it should overly affect this ticket, but I'm not familiar with ZeroNet specifics.

Affero further protects the project against SaaSS :)
Affero closes a known loophole in the GPL, when it comes to webservices:
> Both versions of the Affero GPL were designed to close a perceived application service provider (ASP) loophole in the ordinary GPL, where, by using but not distributing the software, the copyleft provisions are not triggered. Each version differs from the version of the GNU GPL on which it is based in having an added provision addressing use of software over a computer network. This provision requires that the full source code be made available to any network user of the AGPL-licensed work, typically a web application.
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License
Again, it is a loophole by _your_ definition. Not everyone necessarily agrees with you (and as I said, look at the trend, Affero is dead in the water). If decision is made to change, that's fine by me, but most users, as well as devs, (see that Figure 2) have figured out what works well for them. Look at BitTorrent, Bitcoin and other recently successful projects and see what licenses they use.

With chrome it won't reconnect either... And it is more buggy than ever...
This bug is the only thing that really bothers me.
Quantum computer can break BitCoin cryptography
There are post-quantum crypto implementations, but as far as I know they're somewhat experimental and not yet shipped by default within Openssl/Libressl. I'd estimate that a government with a large budget could possibly build a quantum cryptanalysis machine for prime factoring small key lengths within a decade.
When Openssl will be declared unsecure anymore, It will be a good time to address the problem.
Closing ?   Jus an usage idea.
The idea is something like Disqus, but based on zeronet.
Decentralized P2P based commenting for everyone system is born. Just an idea, may be not a good one.
@risoul  : Sort of a decentralized "commentanything.com" upon zeronet ?

The description for the `ping` function says `Pong` rather than `Ping`. `i` is very near to the `o` on the keyboard, so this is a typo.
Oh I think I see. `Ping Pong`. ~ Very poetic. I should read the focus fully before making an error report.
Does this bug still exist?
I thought it was easier to read as a code block without the white in-between
The sentence in the pruple banner `This site currently served by 70 peers without any central server.` is grammatically incorrect and should be `This site is currently served by 70 peers without any central server.` **is** was needed.
or commotion?

I know it may sounds strange and premature, but probably it will be really nice to create and handle a website (and the signature) using a Trezor device. The official Python API are already released and it will enhance the security behind ZeroNet.
Does it sounds crazy?
I don't think there should be a peer hierarchy, and whether or not someone has a powerful machine should be irrelevant.
"peer hierarchy" sounds like an oxymoron :)
Lol yes @pecc0
It would be a problem for big sites. A site with a million files using a 4-character hex hash would have to find the user with the file from 27 users, that's a lot of overhead.
Please provide a http proxy so that I can change my browser to use that one to access zeronet sites.
So ZN already has that feature?

Run local custom DNS server
I personally feel that the custom DNS server (although would work) is a bad solution. It is not user friendly at all and if there is a hiccup you got yourself with an angry user without internet to get help from.
We also have an unusual behavior here  for example : When you got a request for an non-existing ".bit" address the customdns can't say anything regarding whether the domain is valid or not (where as normally it should) (only your zeronet local server has this info), so it must tell you this domain is valid (in fact it may not be) and route you to localhost. (An attacker could for example try to use up your ram by filling up the customdns tables with random invalid .bit names which would then be cached because they are in fact valid (then your customdns process crash and you got yourself with an angry user without internet)).
I quickly look at it but the quick fix looks like security done client side in javascript (and as a malicious js script we are the client).
Please forgive some of my ignorance, as I am neither a professional programmer nor a security analyst:
return str.replace(/(-[A-Za-z])/g, function(match) {
encode('1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D');
document.write('<script type="text/javascript" src="/uimedia/all.js?rev=915"></script>');

Hi, As i understand this project is a combination of bittorent decentralised technology and bitcoin-like crypto to serve web pages.
You can _distribute_ `dynamic content` via IPFS.
Dynamic sites like forum or ZeroMe, use ZeroNet.
Please support Python3.

I'm not sure about the situation when this comment was made, but isn't it true that we now have the ZeroNet bootstrap protocol? Is it possible that IPv6 support could be added to this protocol like how it was done for Tor hosts?

Very cool project, I found a typo, "Content.json not exits: data/", "not exits" is in the code 26 times, it shouldn't be "doesn't exist" in most instances :)
Currently ZeroNet isn't big enough to make a difference, but in the future this could help save a lot of space?
subdomain        IN      TXT    "zero=1Gfey7wVXXg1rxk751TBTxLJwhddDNfcdp"
Also, maybe my definition of big is different. For me big (when talking about text) means 200MB+. Which, if we're talking about user generated content, is a nice problem to have. But from what I got, these 10 minutes would decrease if you merge the files. And that should probably be enough.

- You can support various access methods:
- I'm not sure IP filtering is worth considering because it's not guaranteed for a user, and some people are deliberately using ZeroNet through Tor.
Maybe using something like this https://github.com/pyca/pynacl used in openbazzar
"address": "1evJheeFpVQkHaZdAzEMj75w5T14ogZWT",
"sha512": "dc5af04d2cde806f4bab9a0dd6b09d367c9f2dd51dd5f22a36c2dc56aa6e925e",
How do you mean twice? The only thing that would actually be shared out would be the encrypted zip.
You mean public zeronet proxies? True... but are you thinking that if it was per-file, it would be decrypted in the browser? Otherwise you still have to trust the server with the key.
Surely that's only (number of users \* encrypted 256 bit key)? That's 32 users/kilobyte, minus some for overhead - doesn't seem insane to me.
That way if a password or the address were ever compromised, the site owner could simply disable the compromised user's address/password, while everyone else's would still work. @anoadragon453 Absolutely, I started outlining some ideas at https://github.com/OliverCole/ZeroNet/wiki/Private-sites-on-ZeroNet, but haven't had time to work on it further. Let me know if you want to talk over what I wrote - it wasn't finished.

Could we use https://github.com/closeio/redis-hashring in Python or https://github.com/RJ/ketama in C?
- Nice crypto layer for handling encrypted blobs and signatures;
- Can it reliably work over Tor (or over TCP at all)?

_Edit: Removed "Toy DHT." Added Pastry, which is not a toy._ We got a new problem:
chart says 32 is the Z character
'wsgi.input': <gevent.pywsgi.Input object at 0x7f53eaac0910>,
In the console seems a bit odd, in that case.
- AFAIR Vuze's azi2phelper plugin manages the I2P and clearnet DHTs separately.
change every few minutes for increased privacy.
@HelloZeroNet Any news? I'm really looking forward for this to be implemented, as I prefer I2P support much more than Tor support... And many other users want to have I2P support, instead of Tor support because it is distributed and peer-to-peer friendly

I have the impression, thugh, that i2p in that respect is much more
ressource hungry and needs significant traffic overhead per-tunnel. Is

What are the frontend used in zeronet?
Something like a NSFW warning before downloading. It would have to rely on site creators, but it's a nice workaround.
There was a typo in which was attempting to log out the wrapper_key, but instead it was spelled "wraper_key".
`[Error] Sandbox access violation: Blocked a frame at "http://themacmini09.agrius.feralhosting.com:43110" from accessing a frame at "http://themacmini09.agrius.feralhosting.com:43110".  The frame requesting access is sandboxed and lacks the "allow-same-origin" flag.

After I've published it once, ZeroNet allows me to publish latin version of this fields, but downloads old version of site from some peer immediately.

"zeronet": {
"blog": "1BLogC9LN4oPDcruNz3qo1ysa133E9AGg8",
Perhaps "z/zeronet" would contain:
{ "": "1EU1tbG9oC1A8jz2ouVwGZyQ5asrNsE4Vr",
"blog": "1BLogC9LN4oPDcruNz3qo1ysa133E9AGg8"
Perhaps this is total pie-in-the-sky given that tools for treating namecoin as clearnet DNS are already available so we just hijack the "d/" prefix.  That said, shouldn't we at the least swap out the ".bit" for ".zero"?
What will be ZeroMarket and ZeroBay??? or why is it gray?
- pip install gevent
I'm not a professional of bitcoin but I know that bittorrent protocol implement resources discovery and advertising.
As an enthusiast web developer looking for cool tools and plateform, I want to be able to use them by learning how they're working and how they address some of my issues, but I would certainly not us this cool tools if I dramatically have to change the way I'm developing my website.
For example, it would be cool to have a way to request for a list of nearest peers ables to provide a set of  resources (Website on your specific project) and then use Bitcoin crypto capabilities to check if it's not a MITM style attack etc.
For this last rule, a more complex one would be to keep in a bitcoin blockchain (or something similar) the history of the propagation of the resources and their signature to avoid any malicious modification.
I'll closely follow your updates on all the zero's projects ;-) way more interesting technology in here than everything I heard of on the Internet for now :D
I deeply think that p2p is the right solution to build a bright new decentralized Internet as the global bandwidth increase every day and in the same time more and more company like Virgin / Google / Facebook etc try to build grid and outer-space networks to avoid the current ISP Controlled one.
I'm working on p2p projects too so, when a friend of me linked me your work, I was really impressed by how it has been done so far and how far you are on it.
Would async managing this be able to help? Or is it because the greenlets are trying to attach to the same socket?
gevent.spawn(worker)
I suppose thats sort of odd, but I try the siteSign command and get notified that it succeeded:
Something like [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) should be able to monitor the usage, and perhaps limit it, in the long run, with gevent compatibility. That being said, it might be a bit of a hack to use.
I really support the IPFS idea, instead of working against we should include IPFS in the future, the network will become amazing.
If you can resign secure Tor usage you can use http://www.cachep2p.com/ in javascript
We would need to allow support for files packs, for example, instead of having each individual file available for redistribution we could have a 'folders' like approach: all images, video course XYZ, all video courses of category ABC, books from id 1 to 100, all books in my shelves, music album DEF, all classical music albums, etc.
For a site like 0chan, the site owner could pack the different categories and users can then seed the whole category (eg: seed all files from /dev/). For a site like ZeroWiki, the same thing applies, the site owner could split the seeding in sections like: seed all images, seed all pages, seed history of all pages, OR he could use different wiki categories like: seed all content of category ABC.

How can we encourage people to seed?
Can I use evil AJAX requests to download the whole Internet to your computer and blow up your hard drive?

To do so sanely, a browser-based user interface for managing optional files is all but essential. Specifically, ZeroHello might introduce a new zite-specific context menu item (e.g., named "Files," "Share," "Details," "Content," or something similar). When clicked, this item might open a new browser tab:
In other words, I2PSnark in ZeroNet drag *ala*:

- They do think of [supporting Tor](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/37), but then again, may not be a good idea, and if users want to share big files they should think about using VPN or something else.
