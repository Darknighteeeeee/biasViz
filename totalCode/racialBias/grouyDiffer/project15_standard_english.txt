@chrisjlocke @karim Any ideas? :smile:
I just tried installing the latest nightly version and everything is working fine. I'm on windows 7 though.
The only difference I see between the official version and the nightly builds is that the nightly builds are not digitally signed. Also, since they are *downloaded from the internet* they might be flagged as unsafe. Could it be Windows 10 blocking the installer somehow?
@allender Does the official version (v3.9.1) work without a problem? Did you try right-clicking the installer and *Run as administrator*?
When you right-click the executable and select *Properties* do you see something like this?

@justinclift Can you sign one of the latest nightly versions and send to him to test? I run this quite happily on Windows 10, although it does come up with the 'Hey, this is a new program, are you sure you want to run this?'
What anti-virus have you got?  Anything in the event viewer?
Edit: When I run the installer, I get this 'error', but clicking 'More Info' gives me a link to run it anyway.

You're welcome @allender, glad the problem didn't turn out to be something more serious. :smile:  As a thought, does it happen with our recently nightly builds too?  We changed the pagination code for the Browse Data tab on May 8th to jump by however many rows are currently being displayed. v3.9.1 is quite old now*.  Try one of the latest nightlies from here:
https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest
*By that I mean we've put a lot of time and effort in fixing issues, but haven't yet made a full release, so our nightlies are more up to date than the version available for main download.  Good thinking.  That's a very good reason to have a "Set as NULL" button or something similar in the main Browse Data window, not just inside the cell editing window. As a thought, for a workaround approach for now it'd be possible to set all values to NULL using SQL.  eg something like `UPDATE sometable SET column = NULL`.  Doing it like that without a WHERE clause will apply it to all rows. :smile: This is sort of linked to the other issue raised recently of changing multiple cell values at once. The is a keyboard shortcut to null a cell contents, so it could be carried across all selected columns/rows... assuming the Qt control plays nicely... No worries. :smile: There's a keyboard shortcut for this (but no button) :smile: You can press Alt + Delete or Alt + Backspace to set the current field to NULL. Here's a list of all non-obvious keyboard shortcuts: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Keyboard-shortcuts#browse-data-tab
But yeah, for now it works only for single fields. I'll try to fix that over the next couple of days, if time permits :wink:  Interesting thought.  Yep, it does sound like it would be useful. :smile: A possible 'temporary workaround' is that columns can be resized down to quite a small size.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/26530240/29b23e36-43c9-11e7-8b9c-ae522a1904f3.png)
These can also be saved if the database is saved as a 'project', which is handy...
So not perfect, but 'workable'.... ;)
Maybe if the minimum size could be removed or made smaller? Yep, that'd probably work too. :smile:  SQLCipher 3.4.1 was released a while ago.  Our Windows nightlies use an older version though, as it's based on a modified version (changed to compile easier on Windows).
It would be useful to update my SQLCipher repo to version 3.4.1, so that our Windows nightlies use that. Will be happy to test if you need a 'tester'. 😸
Can't remember if you have a Win VM to test. Thanks @chrisjlocke. 😄
I do have one, but it's stored on machine I rarely turn on and is a bit of a pain to get happening.
Probably won't get to this any time real soon though.  It's more of a reminder/placeholder issue for myself so I don't forget. :wink:  Interesting.  Which version is this happening with, and on which operating system? :smile: Thanks @matuszuborupc.  That's a very old version.  Would you be ok to try our latest release?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.1
I'm pretty sure diacritics work in that. :smile: Awesome. :smile:  It's definitely a reasonable idea.  I suspect this is something people have asked about before, but we've just not gotten around to implementing yet.
Um... don't suppose you're any good with C++ and Qt programming? :smile: No worries. :smile: if you select multiple columns (they have to be adjacent - you can't select just specific columns) and double click the spacer, then all those columns will have the same width.  So if you select all columns (by clicking the top left square) and double clicking the column spacer to the right of the largest column, all columns will be super long.  So not perfect, but quicker than clicking each column... A sounds like that'd make for a useful FAQ item or similar kind of thing on the wiki.
That's me trying to be practical though...  Interesting thought.  When reading that, the concept I'm getting is that if someone selects multiple cells then types (say) the number 5, all of the selected cells would get that value.
Is that the kind of thing you're meaning? :smile: Cool. :smile: Haha!  I was thinking something similar the other day as I had to update a number of cells in a database. Would be a nice feature.  ☕️  @iKlsR From memory, the current behaviour (done in #709) is an improvement over what it was before.
The advantage of having skill with C++ and Qt, is that you can shape it to be better. 😁
Would improving it further be of your kind of thing? 😉  > The advantage of having skill with C++ and Qt, is that you can shape it to be better.
The underlying control (or widget...?) should have this 'basic' functionality, then its down to the program to acknowledge/respect that, rather than the other way around?  Maybe the control does though - haven't played with Qt in any real depth. From memory of the issue, as it turned out to be fairly complex, we went with "single selection only" because that was the most practical approach for the time we had available.
The widget itself definitely can be told to allow multiple selections.  It does need corresponding code for handling that though.  Pasting a multiple-cell selection from one table to another has weird edge cases, and we also need it to work ok for cut-n-pasting onto the OS's clipboard when people want to paste into (say) Google Docs.
...so we went with single selection for now because it was getting too hairy otherwise. :wink: No worries at all, it all helps. 😁   Oh that's different.  We'll definitely need to look into that.
Thanks for pointing it out @jjxtra. :smile:  Interesting bug, thanks for reporting it. :smile:  ### Details for the issue

Have been using an older nightly fine (7 May or so) but downloaded a recent nightly (24 May) and now if I browse a recently browsed table, DB4S crashes.
http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cbhZ2HXkz2
Windows doesn't really provide useful info *where* its crashing, so not sure what helpful info I can provide.
I haven't tried the obvious yet of rebooting and retrying.  The problem is fairly reproducable.  Haven't tried another database either.
Worthy of note that the database is on a server (with plenty of disk space) but haven't had issues before.
Ignore the 'semi crash' when the program is restarted - it only does that when Avast 'sandboxes' it, so its something to do with DB4S checking for a version update and getting 'nothing' back, or something...
Edit: Just tried a different database on a different machine (so still via a network, but not the same above server) and the same issue - browse a table fine, but browse a previous table and 'BANG'.

Interesting.  Does the nightly from before 19th May work?  eg the 18th or similar.
The culprit has been found. Awesome @chrisjlocke. :smile: Thanks for tracking this down, @chrisjlocke! In this case I believe that this is indeed caused by 7ad80352616df1b185ab87f989cb7c2fd6c784c5. I'm just not sure why yet and it will be tricky to debug because it doesn't crash for me. But I'll try :smile:  @MKleusberg If it's useful, I can kick off the windows build script and point it at a branch of your repo or something, to make some one off build(s) for Chris to test with. Oh... one other thing springs to mind.  I recently updated the Windows build box to use SQLite 3.19.0.  I wonder if that's the cause? Ahhh.  sqlite.org now lists 3.19.2 as the latest.  I've just updated the Win build box with that and kicked off a modified version of the nightlies build script.  We should have new binaries for today in ~1/2 hour. Yeah, makes sense to use the latest SQLite version. But it's probably not the source of the problem here (I guess).
Can you make a build from [this branch](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/tree/issue1019)? This prints some rudimentary debug output to the console. Yep, will do.  Gimme a bit. :smile: k, it's building now.  In theory it they should pop up in the *-onceoffs dirs in ~1/2 hour:
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32-onceoffs/
... and have "issue1019v1" in their name. Cool, thanks :smile:
@chrisjlocke Can you test again using those build? It should still crash but - when you start the new build from cmd.exe - print some debug information that hopefully provides at least some clue on where to start looking for the bug :wink:  Oh wow.  Animated gif showing the new behaviour in the PR.
Now **that's** got to be a gold standard for PR things-to-do. 😁  Impressive! 😄
Few questions:
- How did you add the files? (Did you associate .csv files with DB4S? If so, is there any limit, by the OS, on how many files to open like this?)
- What if the user add a file using `File > Import > CSV`? (Can he add more once this dialog is open?)
Not questioning your work, it looks very nice. But we need to document this behavior.
Thanks for your hard work 👍  @karim This PR updates `File` → `Import` → `CSV` to allow selecting multiple files. :wink: Ahhh. Good to know. Thanks @justinclift 😄  > If so, is there any limit, by the OS, on how many files to open like this?
Depends on the OS and version.  Some older versions of Windows have a hard coded limit of 200 files.  Just to check, which version is this happening on?  Asking because we've changed the code for the *Execute SQL* pane a lot since the 3.9.1 release.  I'm pretty sure the behaviour will have changed since then.
If the above is happening with our recent nightly releases though (found [here](https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest/)), we should definitely look into it. :smile: Thanks, that's useful.  Would you be ok to try the latest nightly build and see if it's happening there as well?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest/
In theory (!), it shouldn't be a problem any more. 😁  Damn, I could have sworn we fixed this a while back.  We'll need to look into it again before the next release.
Thanks for pointing it out @fatscally. :smile: Thanks. :smile:
Yeah, everything has bugs, but at least we're somewhat more approachable. :wink: Just a thought (haven't fully tested it, but wanted to confirm...) you mention "but highlight just the first row".  Theoretically, no highlighting is necessary, and it might be that thats giving the 'false information'...
I know this was working semi-recently, as it was me that highlighted the previous quirks with it.   OK, so 'Execute SQL' (or F5) will execute the sql statements in the window, while 'Execute current line' is technically more 'Execute current *statement*'.  A subtle, but obvious difference.
The highlighting is important in that if some SQL is highlighted (ie, part of a statement) and 'Execute SQL' (or F5) is pressed, then only that SQL is executed.  Highlighting has no effect on the 'Execute current line' button.
The SQL window can hold multiple statements, eg:
```
select * from invoices
where invoiceNumber=100;
select * from invoices;
```
So the 'Execute Current Line' (if the cursor was on the 'where invoiceNumber=100' line) would only execute the top SQL *statement*, not the bottom one.
Personally, I've found it more beneficial to use -- comments, so if I didn't want the 'where' statement, its easier (and clearer) to set the SQL as
```
select * from invoices
--where invoiceNumber=100;
```
...but that doesn't negate the fact that the buttons aren't accurately describing what they do.... > If I put this code in, it will fail
Technically, its not valid SQL.  DB4S will 'merge' all lines (as an SQL statement can be split over multiple lines, eg:
```
select *
where
Id <= 2
```
So DB4S is squishing your statements together and forming this:
```
select * from Tags where Id <= 2 select * from Tags where Id >= 3
```
Slap a semi colon on the end of each statement, and DB4S will know where one statement ends, and another begins.  Other database programs might be more 'forgiving', but Db4S is quite strict! ;)
2. Again, if you add the semi colon, Shift+F5 will work.  Honest.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/26400159/99eab110-4077-11e7-9bd6-9186b762fa59.png)
I pressed Shift+F5 on the middle statement, as it showed 12 rows.  If I'd have pressed F5, it would have shown 1 row. Some programs 'detect' where the semi colon should go, others don't.  I use SQL Studio and that gets confused if I don't add semi colons.  You can't 'assume' that lines beginning with 'select' is a new statement, as you can have multiple 'select' statements in a select statement.  The semi colon just explicitly defines where you want the ending to be.

Welcome fellow .Net-er.  I program mainly in VB, but use both SQLite and SQL Server.  👋
> Right now I want to use C# + Xamarin to create a mobile app across the 3 platforms
Ditto.  Well, I'd love to create some Android apps.  I work in a manufacturing business, so to create a small app where someone could interact with a database 'somewhere' would be useful.
99.99% of my coding is for Windows applications (WinForms, rather than WPF).  I use SQLite for most of the databases (seems to work OK in a multi-user environment on a server, even though they say 'don't do that!'...) and SQL Server for bigger projects.
I code in SharpDevelop, as thats a 40 MB download, compared to Visual Studio, which is just nuts - someone said 50 GB offline download, but I guess thats with 'everything'.
Think we've gone off topic now! ;)  hehe!  Anyway - welcome to the DB4S group! 😸  Custom keys can't be set yet, and changing the keys may not be possible, as Ctrl+E currently shows/hides the 'Edit Database Cell' tab. Yeah, we do have an outstanding item for adding some kind of key binding change.  But, it's not a small piece of work and it's probably not something we'll get done in the near future. 😇   @eevleevs As a thought, there is an option in the Preferences dialog for adjusting this.
Saying that because over the years we've had people with distinctly different needs for the "default location to open" open issues here, so we made it configurable.
Are you ok to look through there and see if the current options suit? :smile: Sure, that sounds reasonable. :smile:  ### Details for the issue
currently if I export some database tables, the output sql file always contain indexes of all tables in the database, which means my selection of tables is ignored.

Ahhh, yeah... I can see how that'd be un-wanted. :smile:
@MKleusberg This sounds like exactly your kind of thing to look at. 😬   While trying things out in the new Edit Index dialog, something strange happened.
Double clicking on an "expression column" row in the right hand side (eg expecting to be able to edit the text) instead removed the row.
I've created a screencast, which I'll attach in a few minutes.
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/issue_uploads/DB4S%20Issue%201012.mp4 At a guess, without looking at the code, it's probably related to the double click action normally swapping the row between the left and right window panes.
Expression column rows seem to get deleted instead of being transferred to the left hand side.  eg clicking the left arrow button on an expression column also nukes the row. Thinking about what an optimal behaviour instead would be... maybe transferring the "expression column" row to the left side (so it can be toggled between left and right), but when on the left side the text for it is in red italics or similar instead?
And if the user clicks the `OK` button when it's still on the left side, the "expression column" row is just forgotten about as we have no real place to store it. Yeah, this isn't optimal. You can edit the expression column by clicking it (to select it) and then clicking again (to start editing) but if you do it to fast it counts as a double click and the column is removed entirely. That's probably a little too frustrating even if you know about the two separate clicks :wink: I'll probably disable the double click action for expression columns, so that you'll have to use the button for that. Also I could add an 'Are you sure?' message box when trying to remove an expression column. Then it wouldn't be necessary to move it to the left table view which I would find confusing as well because it doesn't really make sense for an expression column to the in the 'Table columns' list and, if you've decided to remove an expression column (and didn't do so by mistake), you'll probably not want to restore it only seconds later. Sound reasonable? :smiley:  Hmmm, would it be feasible to have the double click action for expression columns trigger the "edit text" mode?  Same as the two slow clicks you describe above. Yep, should be doable :smiley:  If I could hug you, I would.  Some valuable information there.  I looked into manipulating the .exe file and various PE editors, but none really explained what to change.
I couldn't see your photo/screenshot though - your link just takes me to a page which says, "Only logged in users can see this profile".  You can copy and paste the image here, or if you email it to me (db4s [at] chrisjlocke.co.uk) I can host it / paste it here.
Thanks again for posting a solution - useful for making the nightlies XP compatible - they are better versions than the v3.9.1 version (as a lot has changed since that release) So is that always in the same place, or does it depend on how its been compiled?
The 'editbin' method you posted seems the easiest.  I'll try on last nights nightly.  I've an XP VM, so will try in that.
Thanks for posting the screenshot. 😸  Didn't work for me.

As an alternative idea for our nightly builds, this is (a copy of) the batch file we use for building the Windows ones:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://gist.github.com/justinclift/11cc926f214e882c8162f97c53929c07
If someone can suggest a change to it which would add XP support, that'd be completely welcome. 😁  After changing '06 00 00' to '05 00 01' in the guts of the program, it threw up another error.

Oh, I took it from your instructions.  Oops.  😕

Doh.  Good point.  Oops.  🔫  Either way, I changed the .exe, and got the 'blah blah kernet32.dll' error.  I believe this is because from the 3.9.1 release, we've changed to Qt5 instead of Qt4, or it could be how the nightlies are built, and these have different dependencies from the 'official' DB4S releases ... @justinclift  could possibly confirm on that, as he's a whizz and guru on anything to do with building, compiling and general head-scratching... 🙉
I can build a copy of DB4S from the source ... need to do that anyway to confirm the instructions are still correct.  @justinclift Can you change [L255](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L225) in CMakeLists.txt to
set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} /subsystem:windows,5.01")
and try building it. @karim Yep, I can give that a shot.  Gimme an hour or so, as I'm finishing off some other stuff.  If it builds ok, then I'll upload it to the nightlies server and paste a link here for people to test. :smile: @karim Hopefully this is correct: https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/commit/fd07c1435681de053279e0a4944831a7925235b8
I'll try a build with that shortly. @justinclift Yes.. I think. 😄  Thanks. :smile:
Is anyone up for trying these out and seeing how they go?
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-2017-05-11-win32-xp_v2.exe
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-sqlcipher-2017-05-11-win32-xp_v2.exe I don't have XP but after installing this and checking the exe, it is still using `6.00` (Vista) subsystem. Damn. 😦  If you are building the exe using Visual Studio 2012 (or higher), you need to change the default [toolset](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2012/10/08/windows-xp-targeting-with-c-in-visual-studio-2012/) also, and things will start to get complicated. 😄
I guess patching the exe right after building it will be better/easier. The file need to be patched right after it is compiled and before it is included in the installer. Just copy the exe, with a different name (e.g. add `-xp`), and use `editbin` to patch it.  I haven't built DB4S before, so I don't know when that happen.
k, that might be workable.
If it helps, this is the log for the build which just ran (manually cut-n-pasted, thus the weird wrapped lines):
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32-onceoffs/xp_v2_build_log.txt
Maybe something in there indicates the problem?
If not, then yeah, we can probably run `editbin` after the build.  I just need someone to give me the exact command to run. :smile: It is already in the old [issue](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/893#issuecomment-274370095) and [this one](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/1010#issue-227910739) too.
32-bit version:
`editbin file.exe /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.01`
64-bit version:
`editbin file-x64.exe /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.02`
More info [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4cc7ya5b.aspx). Ahhh well, that's pretty simple then. Ahhh, hang on.  Is there an alternative source instead of "http://ru.dll-overhaul.com"?
At first glance that site looks extremely dodgy. It is already included in Visual Studio. Should be in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin\`. Thanks @karim.  I'm hitting the sack now, but will pick this up tomorrow. :smile: Okay, good night mate. 😄  This is turning out to be a bit more complicated than expected.  Our Windows nightly build box uses Qt 5.8, as Qt versions earlier than 5.7 have some weird (minor) bugs.
... and it seems like Qt 5.7 and above don't support XP.
However, I do have an ancient laptop not doing anything important downstairs other than being a music player, which might be up for the task instead.  Gimme a bit and I'll see if things install ok on that. So if I followed your Windows build instructions and installed Qt 5.6, that
would work?  I've a VM I could install it all on.
(...weird Qt bugs aside... ;) ) @chrisjlocke In theory, yep. :smile: OK, I'll have a go. 👨‍🎤  Well, it's a fail here from my attempt.  After spending **way** too much time trying to get Windows on the old laptop... it turns out the reason it point blank refuses to load is that all my Windows ISO's are 64-bit.  And this ancient laptop needs 32-bit.
So... @chrisjlocke it's up to you. :wink: I made a huge mistake. 😄
Changing [L225](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L225) in CMakeLists.txt will not be applied since the build system was changed from MinGW to MSVC. The changes are correct but were ignored/skipped since they are inside `if ( MINGW )`. The correct line should be [L335](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L335).
To test this I built DB4S (finally!) on my PC and made the changes. The generated project (`.vcxproj`) now includes the linker switch and the generated exe is using `5.02` subsystem (for 64-build) instead of the default one `6.00`. I haven't tested it on a 32-bit Windows though, since I don't have one.
@justinclift Can you check this: https://github.com/karim/sqlitebrowser/commit/51f3d6f5e46839b74a6f9d719c509fa98873444b Ahhhh, yeah I can give that a go.  Give me a bit of time, as I'm doing some other stuff atm. > To test this I built DB4S (finally!) on my PC
Using the latest source?  And you didn't get a kernel32 error?

@karim Looks reasonable to me (but I have to admit I haven't read all the comments on this issue). The version numbers are the same as the minimum numbers in the table [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/en-en/library/fcc1zstk.aspx) and the ```CMAKE_CL_64``` switch looks reasonable, too. So feel free to open a PR for your commit and I can just merge it proactively :smiley: At least it doesn't seem like it will hurt :wink: Hmmm, not just yet.  The Windows nightly build box is running it now, so we might as well wait and see if that finishes ok. :wink: Sure :smiley:  @chrisjlocke Yes. Using the latest source.
My build system:
- CMake 3.8.1
- Visual Studio Community 2015 Edition Update 3
- Nullsoft Scriptable Install System 3.01
- OpenSSL 1.1.0e
- Qt 5.7.1
- SQLite 3.18.0
- Github Desktop 3.3.4.0
Using the 64-bit of everything, on Windows 7 64-bit. Ahhh, MSVC 2015 works too then.  Good to know. :smile: Btw, the build finished and the uploaded files are here:
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-2017-05-12-win32-xp_v3.exe
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-sqlcipher-2017-05-12-win32-xp_v3.exe
Anyone able to verify them? @justinclift Yes. I did everything exactly like in the wiki (very nice with a lot of screenshots). 😄
I just changed this `cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" -Wno-dev` to that `cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -Wno-dev` @justinclift I installed it (on Windows 7) and the exe is correctly using `5.01` subsystem instead of `6.00`, so it should work. But someone with Windows XP should test it just to sure. Thanks, that's awesome. :smile:
@andisys @h1618 @iRybin In theory, these should work on WinXP 32-bit:
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-2017-05-12-win32-xp_v3.exe
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-sqlcipher-2017-05-12-win32-xp_v3.exe
Would any of you have the time and interest to try them out?
@chrisjlocke Since you mentioned having an XP VM around too, same as last comment. :smile: Thanks @h1618, that completely makes sense.  So, we need a build to run in a VM that has Qt 5.6, just for XP compatiblity.
That's probably achievable... :smile: Yup, I can try that... if people can wait until Monday... ;)
I've a VM or three I can use.  💻
Tried the .exe you built, and on my XP it just moaned about the getUserPreferencesUI thing as above... @chrisjlocke With the VM's you mention, would any of them be suitable for a nightly builder for XP?  eg something that's fairly reliable and will spit out the appropriate binaries each night?
If you're unsure, it's not a stress as I already have other computers running 24/7 so chucking an extra VM on one of those won't hurt anything. :smile: Actually, I got this.  I'm making a linked clone of the original nightly builder VM, and will run it in parallel on the same box.  It'll have Qt5.6 though, and upload files with some kind of obvious "WinXP" in their name. Yes, that must be because of the Qt version.  I'll try building DB4S with Qt 5.6. Hopefully DB4S will compile OK with that version.  Thats the plan, anyway.  @justinclift will probably beat me to it though! ;) 🌳  Ok, next one to test.  This is with Qt 5.6 installed instead:
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-2017-05-12-win32-xp_v4.exe
The 32-bit SQLCipher build failed, but I haven't checked the log to find out why yet.  Hopefully just a typo on my part or something similar.
If anyone has 64-bit WinXP around, these would be useful to test as well:
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-2017-05-12-win64-xp_v4.exe
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-sqlcipher-2017-05-12-win64-xp_v4.exe @justinclift I think you can use Qt 5.7 too for the XP support.
Issue #893 shows that patching the latest official version of DB4S (3.9.1) made it work without problems even though it was built with Qt 5.7. I guess Qt 5.7 is still using the same APIs (needed for DB4S) as in Qt 5.6, so it can be used to build XP. Qt 5.8 however, started using newer Windows (Vista) APIs, and that's why it is failing on Win XP.
Awesome, sounds like we're well on the way to having a good ongoing solution.
I'll redo the build using Qt 5.7 too, just so we can know for sure if it does or doesn't work. @andisys Excellent. :smile:
I'm still trying different variations of things out, so we can add "official" support for WinXP to our nightly builds.  Making good progress, but it's not completely in place yet. :wink: Ok, these are built with Qt 5.7:
**32-bit Win XP**
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-2017-05-12-win32-xp_v5.exe
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-sqlcipher-2017-05-12-win32-xp_v5.exe
**64-bit Win XP**
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-2017-05-12-win64-xp_v5.exe
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-sqlcipher-2017-05-12-win64-xp_v5.exe
If someone can test them (at least the 32-bit ones) and verify if Qt 5.7 works or not, that would really help. :smile: Awesome @andisys, thanks for testing and confirming.  Yep @karim was right, Qt 5.7 does seem ok with WinXP.
So the next questions are:
* Should we add a WinXP download to the existing 3.9.1 release page? (pretty easy to do)
* Which of the nightly build options would be useful for WinXP users?  I'm happy to add whatever, I just need to know which things would be useful. :smile:
* 32-bit (no SQLCipher) ?
* 32-bit + SQLCipher ?
* 64-bit (no SQLCipher) ?
* 64-bit + SQLCipher ?
- Sounds like a good idea. Yes, you should add WinXP version with the rest of the downloads, so new users can download it instead of the other one (and report it as not working on their Windows XP).
- I think you can skip the 64-bit version of WinXP. I don't know if this version is even being used by anyone, and the 32-bit version will work fine on it too.
Also please note that, WinXP build is almost the same as the other Windows build. Only difference is Qt version, which was changed (about 10 days ago) from 5.7 to 5.8. If 5.8 version is need (e.g. it solves something, fix a bug) then we need a separate build for WinXP. If not, then we can downgrade to 5.7 and have only one Windows build that will work on *all Windows* versions. That all makes sense.
With the Qt versions and possibly having one download each (SQLCipher, and non-SQLCipher) that works for everything... let me think about it a bit.  I can see the appeal of that, on the other hand though that'll mean we'd be stuck on Qt 5.7 for potentially ages.
I'm actually hoping for some new stuff in Qt 5.9/5.10 that would be useful (TLS cert verification), butI suppose we could stick with Qt 5.7 until those bits are available... :smile: On a related-to-XP note, this seems important:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/05/12/customer-guidance-for-wannacrypt-attacks/ Yep, that's the thought.  We do currently build completely ok on Qt 5.5 and above, with Qt 5.7 being the minimum required to avoid some non-critical weirdness seen on Ubuntu.
If we drop the Qt version on the nightly windows build server from Qt 5.8 back to Qt 5.7 (easy to do), that'd mean our binaries work on XP too.
Thinking it over, it's probably not a bad idea to make happen.  When later Qt 5.x is released with features we want though, we shouldn't hold off on it for XP's sake.  When it does happen, we can adjust the build server to either stop building XP stuff at all, or just skip the newer-Qt-needing features.  We probably won't know up front which way to go until we get there though. :wink:
I'll update the build server probably either tomorrow or Monday.  Today I'm mostly trying to ignore DB4S stuff and have an actual day off. 😁  > Personally I am increasingly astounded that people still use XP
Indeed.  I'm not sure why people still have this as their 'development' machine.  I can understand (eg, the self service tills in Tesco) still having XP embedded*, and thus, might be using SQLite somewhere (using this as an example) but why would someone still need to edit a database on XP?  Just use a Windows 7 or 8 box, run DB4S on there to edit the database, and move the database back to XP.
*The sooner XP dies though, the better.
What I'm getting at, is that SQLite can run on anything, and thus SQLite databases can run on anything, but why should the *development* machines be on XP?  *scratches head* 🙀  Thanks @h1618. :smile:
@chrisjlocke Well, some people seem to be using a "Media Center Edition", which I can understand.  Looking at @andisys's screenshot there as an example.
But... connecting such a system to the internet and using it on potentially malicous content (eg flash, email, anything-with-advertisements)... that's not something I'd be doing personally. :wink: > I suggest, if you wouldn't mind, that you only make official releases being compatible with Windows XP
Bear in mind (again, which triggered this topic) is that v3.9.1 is 'relatively' old now, and many bugs and improvements have been made to the software since its release.  For some users, v3.9.1 has a couple of 'unusable' bugs, which means they'll have to use the nightlies.
I agree that newer versions of software/hardware aren't as good as their replacements.  Take .Net as a prime example.  Using VB6, I could create a 26 KB application that didn't need runtimes - the core DLLs were already part of Windows.  VB6 was about a 60 MB install, and could even be portable.  Now, .Net 4.6 has to be downloaded, and don't get me started on how big Visual Studio is to download just to code something.  I had to fight like a pig to install it on one machine, as it wanted this update, that update, this fix, that fix, etc.  Argh.
Anyway.  Progress has to be made though.  We can't stick with XP, and Windows 7 is broken already.  Install from scratch, and the 'Windows Update' will blow up as there are just too many updates for it.  I've created a virtual Win 7 and its taken over two weeks for it to download and install updates.  Unusable.  More and more software will 'leave' XP behind (the newest Chrome/Firefox don't support XP) which will leave XP/Windows 7 more open to exploits.  Some interesting YouTube vids on how easy it is to break into an XP box on a network - you just need to know its IP address.
Oops.  Well... the nightly build server has just been changed to Qt 5.7, with the nightly build script started again just a few minutes ago to regenerate today's ones.
So, the nightlies will support XP at least for a while more.
Once that build finishes, I'll look at making a 3.9.1 compatible version of XP and add that to the 3.9.1 Release downloads. Good thinking.  Hmmm... we'll probably go with "3.9.1v2", and also add some description + announcements bits for the new XP support in relevant places:
* On the 3.9.1 release page.  Something near the top like "\***2017-May-14 update**\* - Due to popular request, a Windows XP download has been added: [filename here]"
* In a news item on the sqlitebrowser.org 1 page website.
* Via Twitter
I *think* that's all of the relevant places to put updates.  If I've forgotten something, feel free to point it out. :smile: Cool.  Do you have time to check this works ok?
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-sqlcipher-2017-05-14-win32.exe
That's one of the nightlies just created now using Qt 5.7.  I want to make sure it's actually working instead of just assuming I got it right. :wink: #### To support Windows XP we can do one of these:
1. One build (with Qt 5.7) that supports Windows XP and up. One nightly build also with Qt 5.7. Should make things easier for @justinclift. 😄
2. Two builds, one for XP (Qt 5.7) and another for Windows Vista/7 and up (latest Qt version). One nightly with latest Qt version, and **no** nightly for XP (just the official "as-is" version). Same as @andisys suggestion.
3. Same as 2 but if someone (on XP) reported a bug, we can build a custom version (e.g. DB4S-winxp-issue1010.exe) using the latest source and Qt 5.7. No new features however, only bug fixes till the next official version.
>don't get me started on how big Visual Studio is to download just to code something. I had to fight like a pig to install it on one machine, as it wanted this update, that update, this fix, that fix, etc. Argh.
@chrisjlocke Actually, I want to upgrade to Visual Studio 2017 but I can't since they don't offer an offline installer due to its size (50 GB). 😱 Yep, several possibilities exist.  Something interesting finally absorbed into my head yesterday... Qt seems designed to have multiple versions of itself installed in parallel at the same time.
So, it's super easy to have both 5.7 and 5.8 installed in the same VM, without conflicting with each other.  eg:
* C:\dev\Qt\5.7
* C:\dev\Qt\5.8
The way to choose which gets used is easy.  The path in the CMakeLists.txt just needs to point to the correct path:
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/a3709576f712e480cd48a45ea696a0ec37286ce4/CMakeLists.txt#L21
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/a3709576f712e480cd48a45ea696a0ec37286ce4/CMakeLists.txt#L34
So, it should be possible to build both an XP specific download (using Qt 5.7), and a more general download using newer Qt when that starts to be needed.
In the meantime though I'm just going to keep the building VM on Qt 5.7 and call it a day. :wink: Awesome, thanks for testing again @andisys.  I'll have a 3.9.1v2 binary ready for testing in a bit too, if that's ok. Ok, this should be a suitable 3.9.1v2 for WinXP:
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32-prerelease/DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.9.1v2-winXP.exe
If someone can confirm it's ok, I'll add that to the 3.9.1 Releases page then do the announcement update bits too. Thanks, I'll get that added to the right bits then.
And yeah, the "3.9.1" in the About dialog is correct.  I didn't want to muck around with strings inside the program itself. :wink: k, it's in the 3.9.1 release now, and on the sqlitebrowser.org website too.
I'll send a tweet about it later, as I'm not on a computer with our twitter credentials at the moment.
If anyone's interested in keeping an eye on the download count for this XP compatible download, the `download_count` field here is close to real-time:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://api.github.com/repos/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/assets/3870315 k, tweet done:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://twitter.com/sqlitebrowser/status/863771346056228864
Everything for this issue seem complete now (thanks everyone!), so going to close it.
If something else does turn up though, feel welcome to re-open it. :smile: @justinclift `download_count: 728` 😄  Heh Heh Heh
Yep, people are downloading it.  As a thought, it's probably a combination of two different things:
* People wanting a WinXP build
* People not sure what they need, and just clicking the first download on the sqlitebrowser.org website
It's probably a mix of both, but as for how many of each... no idea personally. :wink:
If you find this kind of stuff interesting, these are our latest stats (from a few minutes ago) in hourly snapshots:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://dev1.dbhub.io/justinclift/DB4S%20download%20stats.sqlite?sort=hour&dir=DESC
The webUI there is under development (eg there's no real front page to speak of yet :wink:), but the sort and paging keys work.  Or you can just download the database (SQLite format of course) by clicking the green button on the right and open it in DB4S for better mucking around with.
Looking at the numbers, it seems like the XP hourly download rate is roughly 1/2 that of the Win32 download rate.  So, not huge numbers, but still probably respectable.
And now that we've got it working, we might as well keep it working while practical. 😀  I'm more worried we have a link saying "Download 32-bit Win XP.exe" -
people are probably thinking its a fulll blown copy of XP! ;)    *
*No, I know they're not.  Honest.

Cool.  Everyone has write access to the wiki, so it's directly updatable if you've the time and inclination yourself.
If not, leave this here and we'll get around to it... er... sometime. 😁  Nah, I knew the directories needed changing... I just hadn't gotten around to it.  Personal prioritisation + laziness on my part at times. 😉  > the C:\dev\SQLite folder should apparently be named C:\dev\SQLite-Win64
Are you sure?  Does that depend whether you're building an x32 or x64 flavour of DB4S?  Can't remember what I did last time, but all seemed to work OK.  I'll go through the building steps again and have a play. @chrisjlocke Yeah, some paths needed updating in the CMakeLists.txt file after I wrote the initial guide:
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/0c8cb4ec1dc37f2d971d23cc68376de13a24e54c/CMakeLists.txt#L20-L30
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/0c8cb4ec1dc37f2d971d23cc68376de13a24e54c/CMakeLists.txt#L33-L43
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/0c8cb4ec1dc37f2d971d23cc68376de13a24e54c/CMakeLists.txt#L46 (the [instructions here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Win64-setup-—-Step-13-—-Install-DB4S-locally) need changing to match)
... and I kind of didn't update the screenshots afterwards... 👼  Excellent.  OK, leave it with me.  🐮  Corrected. 🥀  Awesome, thanks @chrisjlocke. :smile: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/26059282/1ffcb16e-3979-11e7-9104-55903a91cdc9.png)
What version of DB4S? Does this happen whenever you try to save a database? Or is the error limited to some databases or only some changes made to a db? > Version 3.9.99
That means its a nightly build.  What is the date of this version?  (ie, which nightly is it?) @ulascanerturk Looks like we link to two different PPAs for Ubuntu packages. One has a version from August 2016 and one has today's version. Can you post the output of the shell command to find out which one you're using?
```
grep sqlitebrowser /etc/apt/sources.list
```
The two different SQLite versions by the way shouldn't be the problem. We're only ever using the 3.x versions and ignore all other. Ok sorry, my bad. Can you try this one, too?
```
grep sqlitebrowser /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
``` Hmm... so you should have the latest version. I assume you have updated your system?
This seems to be the same issue as in #836 and maybe #878. What is still irritating me is that this is supposed to happen no matter what changes you make. Is it also happening when you're creating an entirely new database, add some test data to that, and save then? @ulascanerturk As thought, would you be ok to try compiling our program yourself?  Asking because this bug *really* should be fixed by some changes we did a while back. So I'm kind of suspecting that **somehow** the packages you've got don't include it.
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#ubuntu-linux
If you're ok to compile our program yourself, that would pretty much tell us if it's a problem in the packages or if it's a problem with our latest code still. :smile: @ulascanerturk Co-incidentally, I'm checking over our instructions for compiling on Debian and Ubuntu today, so I'll take a look at this problem while I'm at it.
I'll probably test out the version of "sqlitebrowser" that comes from the place you're getting it, and see if the same problem happens here.  If so, that should mean I can figure out a reasonable way forward. :smile: @ulascanerturk Thanks, that sounds like good progress.
With the `Sqlite parse error` that still happens, is it the same one in your message above?
```
Sqlite parse error:  "line 2:25: unexpected char: 'I'" ( "CREATE TABLE `list`
(\n\t`Field1`\tINTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n\t`Field2`\tINTEGER,
\n\t`Field3`\tINTEGER,\n\t`Field4`\tINTEGER\n)" )
``` Sounds like some problem with the PPA binaries then. I have no idea why that happens because it seems to work for most people, except for @ulascanerturk and @NicoDupont in issue #836.
By the way, I'm wondering: the version is 3.9.99 which means it's the nightly build, i.e. using the latest code. And it says Qt version 5.5.1 which makes sense because both @ulascanerturk and @NicoDupont are on Ubuntu 16.04. But from that other discussion I remember that our current code doesn't even compile with Qt 5.5. So how is that binary even compiled? If I had to make a wild guess I'd say that it probably isn't. The compilation really should fail any maybe, just maybe, the last working version is uploaded again and again to the PPA. At least that would explain everything :wink:
As for the parse error: I can't seem to reproduce this using the latest version either. The table definition looks super simple, too.
@ulascanerturk Can you send us the database that produces this error? It doesn't need to contain any data at all, just the empty ```list``` table that causes the problem :smiley: @ulascanerturk Can you update the sqlitebrowser package tomorrow (or any later date)? If my theory proves right there should be a new version in the PPA tomorrow which might fix the problem :smiley: If not, we'll investigate further. Thanks for testing, @NicoDupont :+1: I'm glad it works now :smiley: @ulascanerturk Did you get a chance to try the latest nightly build out?
Just asking as I'm trying to reduce the number of open issues we have (correctly though). :wink: Interesting.  Yeah,  I think you are correct.  It does seem like something wrong on your computer. ☹️
If you have someone good at Linux you can contact, they should be able to fix it for you. :smile: Probably, yeah. 😄
Welcome to GitHub by the way, hope it was a decent experience. 👯  @ulascanerturk Maybe this is because of the manual installation. Do you still have the compile directory? If so, you can try opening a terminal in the ```build``` directory and type
```
sudo make uninstall
```
If you need any assistance, feel free to ask :smiley: @MKleusberg Hmmmm, are you sure CMake includes a "make uninstall" target?  I could have sworn that was one of the things missing. @justinclift Oh wow you're right. How can they have an install but no uninstall target?!

When a table is selected in the 'Browse Data' tab, four queries are run:
`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT '_rowid_',* FROM 'table_name' ORDER BY '_rowid_' ASC);`
`SELECT '_rowid_',* FROM 'table_name' ORDER BY '_rowid_' ASC LIMIT 0, 10000;`
`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT '_rowid_',* FROM 'table_name' ORDER BY '_rowid_' DESC);`
`SELECT '_rowid_',* FROM 'table_name' ORDER BY '_rowid_' DESC LIMIT 0, 10000;`
Is there a reason why data is fetched twice?  On larger tables, this is quite a delay.
Selecting a count shouldn't need to order by either - again, isn't that forcing the database to do something unnecessarily - a table with a million rows - 'can you please sort this, as I need to know how many rows there are....'  ... 'oh, and can you do that again please, as I now need to display this data'.,,.*
(*Ignoring the fact that there are indexes, etc, etc.)

Not sure why you get 4 queries, two for ASC and two for DESC. Have you changed the sort order in between?
You're absolutely right about the sorting & counting thing. I have just done a quick test and this
```sql
explain select count(*) from (select rowid,* from table_name)
```
generates 9 rows for my test table (with PK), while this
```sql
explain select count(*) from (select rowid,* from table_name order by rowid desc)
```
generates 40 rows.
More instructions don't necessarily mean longer execution times but it probably does in this case.
We have to fetch the data twice (the count and separately the data) because of the scrolling. We need to know the number of rows to set the scrollbar maximum but SQLite can't tell us the number of rows before having sent the last one. So we do the count as a workaround. This is the same as in issue #409. As a thought, is the "ORDER BY" in the query added regardless, or is that just due to the approach @chrisjlocke was using for the cut-n-pasted example?? It depends. For the COUNT queries we just take the original SELECT statement as-is and insert it here:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (original_statement);
```
So, if the original statement contains an ORDER BY clause it'll be used in the count query, too. And if not, we won't insert one.
What we would need to do is remove the ORDER BY clause (if there is one) from the original statement. It's a bit tricky because we don't have a parser for select statements yet but can be done with a regex. > or is that just due to the approach @chrisjlocke was using for the cut-n-pasted example??
A table was simply selected from the drop-down box in the 'Browse Data' tab ....  > Have you changed the sort order in between?
No - a table was selected from the drop-down box in the 'Browse Data' tab,,, @chrisjlocke Got it! If I change the default sort order, switch the table, and then come back to the first table, I get 4 queries, too. That definitely need to be addressed, too. > If I change the default sort order, switch the table, and then come back to the first table...
Interesting, as on mine I haven't set a sort order, so simply switching tables... Hmm, to be honest I have no idea how that happens because the default sort order is ascending while your query sorts descending (well, in the second try, that is). I assume you have already tried restarting the application? Let me prepare a quick list of ToDo items for this:
- [x] Don't execute four queries where two are sufficient. No need to first query the data in the one sorting order and then again in the other order.
- [x] Remove the ORDER BY clause (if there is one) from the query when doing a count.
- [ ] Ideally, get rid of the count query altogether. But this might break the scrolling. Hmmm, if we need the count(), can we quietly add it into the original query so it all gets done as part of a single statement? @justinclift I don't think so. Or at least I don't know how the statement should look like. Do you have something in mind there?
@chrisjlocke Can you test again using the latest version from master? In theory, the first todo item should be implemented in that version :smiley: @MKleusberg Hmmm, upon thinking about it more... nah, the thought I had in mind was way too simplistic to work.  Doh. :wink: @justinclift No worries :laughing:
@chrisjlocke The descending sort order you get seems to be the same issue as #641. Any idea how to track that down? Does it happen for all databases/tables for you? I was going to say 'yes, across all databases and tables', but I'm not so sure.  By clicking across the tabs, it did create a rogue ASC query.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/25779528/61b11bf8-3312-11e7-8dda-c3096355d01a.png)
Also, after opening another database, its now just doing two queries, not four.
Will test further... Hmm.  After a bit of head scratching, it appears the *first* time you open a database, browsing a table is ASC.  After that, its DESC.
http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cbhiQLXZGE The video helps a lot. Thanks for that! But I still have no idea how that can happen :wink: Are you compiling DB4S by yourself or are you using the nightlies? I'm asking because we might be able to narrow down the source of the problem by adding some debug outputs here and there. Using the Windows nightlies.  💨   Unsure how other OS's handle this..... (sorry - just thinking aloud...) @ankushbbbr Good point, that's probably a decent idea we should implement. :smile:
If so, they're here (pick either the 32 or 64 bit one as needed):
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/
@MKleusberg @innermous @prutz1311 Any idea if there is some way we could catch that kind of thing - without needing a large amount of code change - and not let it go out of control? Just a thought, but might be worth throwing that out to the sqlite users mailing group, as they might suggest some hook you could use .... you're not going to know how many rows you're going to get back until sqlite has done its biz (and consumed 97 GB of memory...) but you might be able to abort it after ... say, 20 seconds? Ahhh, good thinking Chris.  You're already on that mailing list aren't you?
If so, would you be ok to ask? :smile: Surely can.  ✍️  No need to ask them :wink: [This](https://sqlite.org/c3ref/interrupt.html) does what we need. I'd suggest to not do anything automatically because some queries just take their time. See #409 for example. But what we can do is add a cancel button which just allows the user to stop the query at any time. Awesome. 😀  Yup, Dr. Richard Hipp just replied back with the same suggestion:
> Can you get the application to use the sqlite3_interrupt() (https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/interrupt.html) interface to stop the long-running query? Excellent, thanks Chris & D. Richard Hipp. :smile: For reference:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users@mailinglists.sqlite.org/msg103468.html  This should be fixed in the latest version.  v3.9.1 is quite old now (v3.10 is due soooon!)

Try downloading from one of the latest nightlies:
https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/ or https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32/ @h4yn0nnym0u5e Do you have the time & interest to try out the latest nightly build, and double check that it works properly for you? :smile:
If so, the nightly builds are here, as @chrisjlocke mentioned:
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32/
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/ >I've also found another case:
Yes, that appears to get executed as `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT ');` - everything right of the -- is deemed part of the comment.  Ooh. 😨  Awesome, so we're making progress in the right direction at least.  But, still a bit further to go. :smile:
@revolter Any interesting in following this up?  I'm kind of guessing this is related to your comment stripping regex bits from a while back? Yeah, we might need to brainstorm a bit and/or ask on the SQLite-users mailing list as well.  They're pretty friendly and obviously very clueful. :smile: Thanks @h4yn0nnym0u5e, that's awesome. :smile: @revolter This is @h4yn0nnym0u5e's commit pared back to just the changes, if you've time to look through it: https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/commit/5748daf66180d3afaf0cf8f0eebecf82575c72b1
:smile:
At present our CSV import dialog seems to use `TEXT` as the type for all columns.
It would be useful to do some form of detection on the data (after the last row is loaded?), then change the column types to match whatever is detected:
* `INTEGER` and `REAL` should both be fairly easy to detect and implement
* CSV has no defined way of handling BLOB/binary values in the official RFC, so probably no need to detect that
Has it any impact though - wouldn't the user map the CSV fields to the database fields (which SQLite doesn't even define the type of anyway)
So a CSV might have 3 fields, but the database has 20, so I'd want to map fields blah to blah. It actually does have an impact:
```sql
create table test(a int, b real);
insert into test values(1,1);
select a/2,b/2 from test;
```
But yeah, it might be best to add a way to define which CSV field should be mapped to which database field. We could also add a routine to guess decent default data types but it's never going to be perfect. That's because we can't really read the entire CSV file just to find out the best data type (and we need to know them before importing any data) - that's just too much overhead for larger files. Now let's say we read only the first 50 lines or so and one field is empty in all of them; what data type is it going to get? Probably ```TEXT``` but in line 51 there might be a number. Or maybe the first 50 lines just contain integers and line 51 contains the first string :wink: Not sure how to avoid errors here. > Or maybe the first 50 lines just contain integers and line 51 contains the first string 😉 Not sure how to avoid errors here.
I'd guess the types based on the first line, but give the user the ability to change them.  The user should know their schema (especially if they're importing CSV files - thats quite an advanced activity - my Mum could probably use DB4S is she wanted, but there is no way she'd dabble with CSV files!) and guessing INT instead of REAL isn't a huge issue. considering we're using TEXT at the moment! ;) Heh Heh Heh, I was actually thinking of a fairly simple approach, which - in my head so far - seems like it would be both accurate and fairly reasonable in cpu/IO overhead.
Potential data types:
1. `UNDECIDED`
2. `INTEGER`
3. `REAL`
4. `TEXT`
Concept for the process:
1. After the import options dialog closes, create a simple array of elements, one for each column, initialised to the `UNDECIDED` value
* eg for a table with 5 columns, that's means 5 elements
2) As each cell is read in, check the characters in the cell data and update the corresponding element for the column
* If they're [0-9], that's `INTEGER`
* If they're [0-9,\.\,] (eg numeric or comma or full stop) that's `REAL`.
* Note, this is a simplification as the separator character (often ",") needs to be taken into account, as does the meaning of "." vs "," as decimal point/thousands separator due to locale
* If it's anything else it's `TEXT`:
3) The order of the data types in the list above is important (`INTEGER` → `REAL` → `TEXT`), as once a data type is achieved (eg `REAL`) subsequent rows can't move the type backwards. eg `REAL` can't move backwards to `INTEGER`
Once all of the rows for a table are imported, the element list should contain an accurate representation of the data types per column.
Is there a hole in this approach I'm not seeing? :smile: [Here's an example](https://dev1.dbhub.io/justinclift/Bike%20Counts%20In%20Edinburgh.sqlite?table=38%20-%20Bruntsfield%20Place%20-%20North%20Side) of why the data type per column is important:
![screen shot 2017-05-03 at 16 42 52](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/25668837/b4879a32-301f-11e7-8571-47df3328575a.png)
The `channel_1` column there is correctly sorted because the data type is `INTEGER`.  When the data type was the default `TEXT` though, the ordering was by string order.  eg:
channel_1 ▲
-----------
0
1
1
109
11
114
12
13
2
2
21
22
3
4
7
9
String order definitely isn't correct for that column.  At present our dialog for importing CSV files only allows the selection of a single one.
This turns out to be a fair PITA when needing to import quite a few CSV files into a single database.  eg:
https://github.com/andreeaPascu/BikeCountsInEdinburgh/tree/master/outputFiles
The files there all use the same import options, so it would be useful to have the import
options dialog appear once with maybe a checkbox like "[ ] Use these import options
for the other CSV files selected too" to control the usage. Nope, I wish. :wink: I hadn't really thought it through much, but as a first concept I'm thinking that the initial dialog itself needs to allow multiple-file selection (currently single-file only).
Then the current user facing dialog which presents options should probably also display some kind of list with the selected file names, along with a checkbox next to each (and select/deselect all toggle button).
And some way to apply the set of options to all of the selected files.  eg "Import all".
When that runs, all of the checkboxed files would use those options.  For any not-checkboxed, the dialog should probably pop up again (with the remaining files listed), allowing different options to be chosen this time.
... and loop around doing that until all of the files are imported.
Er... is that somewhat clear enough?  Bearing in mind it's just an initial thought as to an approach.  If some better way turns up while you're hacking on it, then by all means go with a different approach. 😀  To add to what @justinclift said, maybe a *folder selection* too?
If the open file dialog is active and you click on **Open** button *without* selecting any file, it will open/select all the files for import from the current directory? One problem for this is that all .csv files must be in the same format to be imported properly.
Also, `Ctrl` + click while the open dialog is open to select files one by one. @iKlsR If you need any technical assistance while working on this, just comment on this issue or write me an email and I'll try to help. I won't be available the entire weekend but you can still give it a try :smile:  @iKlsR Read your initial compile report (tagged onto the end of #482), and yeah, I agree with much of it.
Sounds like you're up and running now? :smile: No worries.  Ironically I needed a break from the computer today, so have been keeping mostly offline.  Just reading up on git internals on my tablet instead, as we need to adjust the data model we're using for the dbhub.io project.
Tomorrow (eg Sunday) I'll be mostly online (still doing dbhub.io stuff), but should be checking email and Gitter more often if that's useful. :smile: Muaaa Haaaa Haaaa.  That's awesome. 7k files is definitely in the realm of "wouldn't want to do that by hand". 😁
For your PR, @MKleusberg is the right person to review it.  Hopefully he has time to over the next few days.
Oh, that's interesting.  Is the data set which you're using to trigger that, a public one?
@justinclift Do you still have an Ubuntu VM somewhere to test this? I've only tryed this on KDE. My test db is [here](https://dev1.dbhub.io/mkleusberg/issue1001.db). @Yep, I can test this.  My Ubuntu VM is really Kubuntu, but it's pretty easy to download standard Ubuntu 16.04.2 and whip up a new one.  I'll add this to my task list for this week. Aha, I ***knew*** this sounded familiar.  Pretty sure this bug is another occurance of #920, and the solution is to compile it against a newer Qt library.
That being said, I'm trying to compile DB4S on Ubuntu 16.04.2 right now, and it's failing due to a different (known) problem.  Looking into solutions for that next... :smile: @MKleusberg As a data point, just tried your test database on an Ubuntu 16.04.2 VM here, compiling using Qt 5.6 (from [a 3rd party PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ci-train-ppa-service/+archive/ubuntu/stable-phone-overlay)).
No rendering issue like the above showed up, ***but*** the "Database Structure" tab took ages (~9.5 seconds) to show up.  Switching from "Database Structure" to any of the other tabs was instant.  From them back to "Database Structure"... wait 9.5 seconds again.  Every time.
So, something not quite right there.  Possibly just something weird with the VM, VMware Fusion, or whatever else too.  I'll muck around with a few settings next and see if that fixes the problem. Well, it's not caused by VMware Fusion's implementation of "Graphics Acceleration" for Linux.  Same problem both ways. Tried it with a fresh build with Qt 5.5 (using the initial compatiblity patch) instead.  Same behaviour with that database.
Using a different database (eg [this](https://dev1.dbhub.io/justinclift/Belfast%20Bikes%20Docking%20Stations.sqlite)), DB4S has no delay.  The "Database Structure" tab shows immediately when switching at all times. Ahh, this is interesting.  I just installed Qt 5.8 from the official Qt download site (qt.io).  When DB4S is compiled using that, the slowness issue isn't present.
Looks like whatever the problem is, it's been fixed in Qt sometime after Qt 5.6.1. Qt 5.7 doesn't have the problem either.
It really looks like both Qt 5.5 and 5.6 on Ubuntu aren't fantastic for DB4S.  For anyone having weird slowness or screen corruption issues, it'll need to be compiling using Qt 5.7 or above instead. Should we add a warning to the build instructions then that we discourage using Qt < 5.7 even though it compiles just fine? Doesn't seem like we can do much else about it. Yep.  If you want to do it, then go for it.  Otherwise I'll get it done later on today. :smile: @justinclift Done :smiley:  Interesting.  Would you be ok to screenshot the oddness?
It's a bit hard to mentally picture just from the description. :smile: Good idea!
However, we'll have to check if there is a reasonable way to implement this in our code. In a quick search I found [this forum thread](http://www.qtcentre.org/threads/55953-Scroll-QTableView-beyond-last-column-row) but their code is depending on per pixel scrolling which we can't use in DB4S because of [other reasons](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/e5bca9d2dbeb92cc18cda9d0d217a8480e871a08). :disappointed:   You could download /build the latest sqlite precompiled binary from this page:
https://sqlite.org/download.html
You can then replace the sqlite3.dll (well, for my Windows installation... I guess the Linux files may differ...) in the application directory.
This worked for me, but DB Browser for SQLite still showed the old version of SQLite in the about box...
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/25335062/41b76c4a-28e9-11e7-9008-586a5d38cf85.png)
@mburger81 Ahhhh, you'll probably need to compile DB4S (our abbreviation for our software) yourself, and use some environment variables to point the build process towards the SQLite version you installed.
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#ubuntu-linux
This may be pushed to next week (after looking at fairly immediate/urgent tasks), but it's of high importance so it won't be passed over. I've made a decent start on going through the docs from a Qt Creator perspective here:
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Compiling-on-Ubuntu-16.04-with-Qt-Creator
... but haven't yet gotten up to the point of determining how to override the system provided SQLite.
While doing that, I found that - unlike our CMake configuration - using `qmake` didn't install all of the required files.  It's since been adjusted to also include the "desktop" related files so it will show up in the menu.  But as @MKleusberg pointed out we still need to add the translation files to `make install` as they're not installed yet either.
If someone has the time and inclination to muck around with changing the [likely relevant lines](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/7ad80352616df1b185ab87f989cb7c2fd6c784c5/src/src.pro#L139-L140) in src.pro, it would probably work to find a user-installed version of SQLite.
Note that the link there I gave is inside a `mac` clause.  So, a similar definition would need to be added for linux ("unix" maybe?) for that to be picked up on.  I'm not 100% sure of the bits needed yet, but some trial and error would get it worked out.
Timeline wise, my headspace is deeply into DBHub.io stuff at the moment.  We need to get that in a useful/usable state for people in time for DB4S 3.10, and there are still major bits of it needing doing.  I'm almost certainly going to be working on my focus task for that (a new backend data model) through to the end of next week.  After that I may be able to pick this up again, or I may need to continue getting other DBHub.io bits done first.  Not yet sure. 😉
Does that help? As far as I understand you have (at least) two versions of the SQLite, @mburger81, the system version that was installed using the package manager and the manually installed version. During compilation we just statically link to the first library version we can find. In your case that should be the system one.
So what you'll need to do is recompile DB4S and configure the build to search for the manually installed SQLite version. How exactly this works depends on how you've built SQLite but the general idea is like this.
Edit the src/src.pro file. Around line 196 you should find these lines:
```
INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/../libs/antlr-2.7.7 $$PWD/../libs/qhexedit $$PWD/../libs/qcustomplot-source $$PWD/../libs/qscintilla/Qt4Qt5 $$PWD/..
LIBS += -L$$LIBPATH_QHEXEDIT -L$$LIBPATH_ANTLR -L$$LIBPATH_QCUSTOMPLOT -L$$LIBPATH_QSCINTILLA -lantlr -lqhexedit -lqcustomplot -lqscintilla2
```
Change them to
```
INCLUDEPATH += /path/to/your/sqlite/lib/header/files $$PWD/../libs/antlr-2.7.7 $$PWD/../libs/qhexedit $$PWD/../libs/qcustomplot-source $$PWD/../libs/qscintilla/Qt4Qt5 $$PWD/..
LIBS += -L/path/to/your/sqlite/lib/a/file -L$$LIBPATH_QHEXEDIT -L$$LIBPATH_ANTLR -L$$LIBPATH_QCUSTOMPLOT -L$$LIBPATH_QSCINTILLA -lantlr -lqhexedit -lqcustomplot -lqscintilla2
```
Where the first path points to the directory that contains the ```sqlite3.h``` file and the second path points to the directory that contains the ```libsqlite3.a``` file.
Then just run this from the root dir of the repository to build the application:
```
make
```
If you want to use cmake, you'll have to edit the ```CMakeLists.txt``` file and change line 252
```
find_library(LIBSQLITE ${LIBSQLITE_NAME})
```
to this
```
find_library(LIBSQLITE ${LIBSQLITE_NAME} HINTS /path/to/your/sqlite/lib/a/file)
set(ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_PATHS /path/to/your/sqlite/lib/header/files)
```
And then run this from the root dir of the repository:
```
mkdir build
cd build
make
``` Awesome. :smile:  Interesting.  A couple of questions, just to get a better idea of things... :smile:
* Which version of DB4S (our abbreviation for SQLite Browser) are you using?
* After making the change with your own script, are you closing the reopening the database in DB4S?
* After making the change with your own script, are you quitting out of DB4S, starting it up again, and reloading your database?
* Is your database on an external device?  For example an Android phone or tablet or something?
The answers to those should help us figure out what's going on. :smile: In theory (!) it should work.  But for some unknown reason, Android devices are occasionally reported to not copy database files correctly.  (not just for us, but in general)
It's been going on for a few years now, so there's a decent chance someone has worked out a solution or fix to the problem.  I don't use Android, so it's not something I've ever really come across myself. (sorry)
Someone else here might have some ideas though... :smile: > Pull the database directly from my Android device using ADB
On what platform are you using DB4S? (not that that makes a huge difference, but just in case...)
If you amend the database, does the file have an updated modified date? ADB → Android Debug Bridge: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html This may be the problem:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9058169/sqlite-database-disk-image-is-malformed-on-windows-but-fine-on-android
As pointed out by @MKleusberg [last year](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/476#issuecomment-168403277). DB4S itself definitely uses WAL.
If so, that causes the rows to be sorted by that column.  An arrow then shows up shows up in the column header indicating a direction, and you can click the same column heading again to sort in the opposite direction.
Not sure if that's what's happening here, but the concept seems kind of like what you're mentioning. :smile: No worries at all @kyliostricor, we all start at the beginning.  Keep on going. :smile:  No worries.  Two thought come to mind right away... :smile:
* Not sure if you've tried this yet, but you can right click on the heading for a column and choose **Edit display format**.
There are several pre-made formats listed, one of them might work.  It's probably a good idea to try [a recent nightly build](https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx/) too, as (from memory) there were some more formats added after the 3.9.1 release.
* If that doesn't work, are you able to cut-n-paste some of the 9 digit values here as an example for us to think on? :smile: You can also use SQL.
`select date(2457864)` or
`select date(fieldName)`
`select date(2457864)` would return todays date.  The `date()` function returns YYYY-MM-DD format, but you can change this.
https://sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html

so you can do `select *,date(fieldPooPoo) as date1 from tableDooDoo` Awesome @chrisjlocke. :smile:
Just thinking it might be useful for debugging purposes if it is. :wink: Thank you, that's awesome. :smile: Thanks for reporting this, @NF1198, and also many thanks for the detailed analysis :+1: That helped a lot :smiley:
I think I have fixed the issue with the latest commit. But just to be sure, can you build the latest version from master and check if it's fixed for you? Awesome!  Closing this issue now then.
Thanks for reporting it @NF1198, and giving us the info needed to resolve it promptly. :smile:  Thanks @deepsidhu1313, I'll setup a *buntu VM again later today and investigate. :smile: This is probably because of the Qt version. The QVector::removeAll() method was introduced in Qt 5.4 (see https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qvector.html#removeAll), so when trying to compile with any version <5.4 this error will occur. In theory we could work around that but I vaguely remember there being more features from newer Qt version that we're using...
Edit: According to the [Building.md file](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md) you'll need Qt 5.6. Does anybody remember the reasons for this? :wink:
Edit 2: Found the reason :smiley: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/832#issuecomment-270996239 Ahhh, from memory we require Qt 5.6 and above now.
@deepsidhu1313 which versions of Ubuntu don't have that available? As a data point, the [CMake approach in our BUILDING.md instructions](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/c8dba296df117a6f8ab486ade8418328580e2961/BUILDING.md#ubuntu-linux) is working fine "as-is" with Kubuntu 17.04.  Tried it today since I was already looking into DB4S compiling stuff for other Linux distributions anyway. @deepsidhu1313 This was fixed by @MKleusberg a few days ago, with https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/6e6f7cdc18e127a0004296c53e13054c5da7c24d.
Closing this now as people using Ubuntu 16.04 have confirmed the nightlies are building correctly again. :smile:  This is a bit unclear. :wink:
DB4S doesn't natively support FTP itself... so I'm not sure what you're meaning.
Are you ok to explain in a bit more depth? :smile: k, still needing a bit more information. :smile:
Next, what's the exact error message you're getting?  Maybe screenshot it if there's no confidential info in it?
Ahhh, just noticed that you do have the info in the original bug report, it's just inside the javascript hiding brackets.  I'll remove those and it should show up...
Yep, that worked. :smile: The "unable to open" bit might be helpful.  It kind of sounds like the file permissions (or maybe ownership) of the file itself are causing an issue:
"unable to open C:\RIT\ISTE_646\rogue6_project1\RIT-esports\db\sqlite\sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3180000\ESports.db"
Maybe double check that?  If there's nothing obvious there, I'd ping one of the school admins and ask if there's a likely reason.  This is almost definitely not something related to DB4S itself.
Oh... unless DB4S is still running and has the database open when you're trying the transfer?  If that's the case, this could be a simple file locking problem.  eg close DB4S and try again maybe? :smile:
Awesome, you're welcome. Glad it worked. :smile:  Now it looks better. :smile:
The "target" branch was incorrectly set (there is a drop down for it) to "sqlb-3.x".  Changing it to master makes things look better.
As a thought, is your patch here useful too? https://github.com/keedhost/sqlitebrowser/commit/78b8ec22bf25820a939cff66cbe435cf25a0d365
It's not yet included in the above list, but I can add it.
Thanks for taking the time to do this too.  It should be useful for people. :smile: Thanks for this @keedhost.  Closing this now, as I've manually merged it and @Genyk's two later patches as well. :smile:  'Open a new database' - do you mean open an existing database, or create a new database?
If open an existing database, are you sure its a valid SQLite v3 database?  Its not a .sql file is it?  (ie, human readable SQL commands, rather than a database of records) @ofelius Ping?
Meh, just going to close this.  9 days without response is generally a good sign the problem is fixed or no longer of interest to the reporter.
@ofelius If that's not the case, you're welcome to reopen this. :smile:  Interesting. :smile:
If you try the latest nightly build, does it works properly for you?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx/ Awesome. :smile:  Have you tried the latest nightly?
I'm not 100% sure what the font is, but thought Windows was a bit more sensible. Ahhh, interesting.  It probably wouldn't hurt to have the various font changing pieces be in the same tab, and have their meaning/labels be clear.  Thanks @ecki. :smile:
@FriedrichFroebel @VanDerSam What are you thoughts on this? :smile: Ahh, you're probably comparing version 3.9.1 to the translation file from the latest version here on Github (which eventually is going to be 3.10). Iulian has fixed the the typo in the meantime (see commit 1257134dc65547662a81c66bf331dd627ff576f5), so that's why it's correct in the translation file but not yet in the release versions. Can you double check by downloading the latest nightly build? It should be fixed in there :smiley:  Thanks @keedhost, that's excellent. :smile:
It's working fine when compiled on OSX.  I can change to Ukrainian, see messages in that, and change back to English without a problem.
It's not working on Windows though, and I have no idea why. 😦
On Windows, the option for Ukrainian appears in the list and can be selected, but DB4S is in English after restarting.  Changing to other languages is working fine though, so there's something not quite right with the Ukrainian change.  It's probably something I've forgotten to do, I just need to figure out what.
To solve this I'll probably need to install a full development environment of Qt on Windows, and debug the process.  I don't have time for it today though. :frown:
@chrisjlocke @MKleusberg Just in case, don't suppose you have any ideas what might cause that behaviour? :smile: Yep, I can definitely do that.  It will be tomorrow though. :smile: Hmmm, now I'm wondering what happens if we change it from "uk_UA" to just "uk".  Perhaps the Windows and FreeBSD are not recognising "uk_UA" for some unknown reason? I'll setup a Windows development VM again later on today, and see if I can figure out what's going wrong. :smile: I ***think*** this is everything. :smile:

It should be tomorrow, or Thursday at the very latest though. Found the problem.  It was indeed my fault... a typo in the change I made to src/translations/translations.qrc:
https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/blob/d5a6bc496dd97004dba6f005d5def7570962812d/src/translations/translations.qrc#L14
The filename extension on that line should be **.qm**, not **.ts**.  Oops.
I'll update my branch with that, and also pull in your updated patch. :smile: Ok, I *think* this branch has the latest changes, including Genyk's pieces:
Can you double check from your side?
If you're happy with it, I'll merge it in. :smile: Ahhh, I didn't see Genyk's patch-7 & patch-8.  I'll add those now too. @keedhost @Genyk I've added the patch-7 and patch-8 changes here too:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/commits/ukrainian_version2
Do you want me to merge it "as is", or should I take updated screenshots again? :smile: Hmmm, I'm just going to merge it. :smile: @keedhost @Genyk All of the Ukrainian translation patches are merged into our master branch now.
Do either of you have time to double check it?
I'll also close the Pull Request, as this was done a bit outside of that. :smile: @Genyk If you have the time to play around with it and try things out, then most (80%) of the program is fairly simple.  It's mostly just a display of databases in a spreadsheet format.
You can download a sample database to use with it here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://dev1.dbhub.io/justinclift/DB4S%20download%20stats.sqlite
&nbsp; &nbsp; (the green download button on the right side)
Does that help? :smile: @Genyk Awesome!
If you have questions, you're welcome to ask here and I should be able to respond without *too much* delay. :smile:  Indeed, the newer version of DB4S doesn't support XP.  It is possible, but due to the methods of building the application we use, not easily 'automated', but as DB4S is 'open source', someone else might 'do the honours'.  See this similar issue: #893
As a side note, Windows XP is quite an old operating system now and is unsupported as far as security patches, etc, goes, so if you use it in a 'production' environment (or for more than just 'testing') then it shouldn't be used to go online.
As another side note, more and more programs will drop support for Windows XP, so its not just DB4S which will fail to run.
As another side note, its still free to upgrade to Windows 10.  Not that really helps the above issue, and of course, comes with its own problems...  For me, when trying a few minutes ago (OSX 10.11.6) with a nightly build of a few weeks ago... this was inconsistent.  Some times when hovering a dock (eg SQL Log) over part of the main window the snapping function would work.  Other times it was just ignored.
It seems like we need to investigate this and make it work reliably.
In the meantime, double clicking on the title bar of the dock does seem to work.  So, at least there's a workaround for the moment. :smile:  This is sort of intentional.  Some people dont want their software updating automatically or to a different version than the one they have.  A message popping up seemed a happy compromise.  Yes, this was an issue in the 3.8.x installer (and 3.9 I believe) which should be fixed now, as the issue was identified when people starting upgrading to 3.9.1.
It didn't help that the directory location for the installation also changed between versions, otherwise this wouldn't have been an issue... ;)  What version of DB Browser for SQLite are you using?
https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/ (assuming you want 64-bit)
I think this was an issue in v3.9.1 which was fixed. \o/  Glad it worked. 👍   Interesting.  Does it still happen with our recent nightly builds?  Download locations are listed on our front page, if that helps. :smile: That happens because we have to execute all SQL commands inside a transaction and the foreign key pragma can't be set inside a transaction. The only reasonable workaround for us that I can think of right now is to somehow detect a ```pragma foreign_keys=x``` statement and disable transactions for that. But that's always going to be error-prone...
@qiulang Do you need to be able to do this using SQL? Or can you just use the GUI editor in the Edit Pragma tab instead? This also seems to be related to #966.  We'll need to add support for common proxies (eg HTTPS, SOCKS 4/5 ?, etc) for our connectivity with DBHub.io.
Proxies are used in ***many*** business and government places, so missing this would be a major growth limiter. :wink:  DB Browser uses SQLCipher encryption.  Does Sqlite.net-plc support 256-bit AES?
If it doesn't, then it can't decrypt the database, so sees it as corrupted/not a valid database. @govindrawat55 Sorry, somehow I missed this.
For encrypting SQLite databases, we use an Open Source project called SQLCipher.  It's made by Zetetic:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/
I'm not sure if it's compatible with "SQLite.net-plc".  Are you ok to contact them to find out? Closing this due to lack of response.  Interesting.  Would you be ok to run `ldd` on the sqlitebrowser executable and paste the result here?  It sounds like there might be a linking problem.
Er... just to confirm, you are using sqlitebrowser yeah, not straight SQLite itself? > Not using SQLite browser
You have posted this question on the DB Browser for SQLite support issue system.  This is for support for the application DB Browser for SQLite - not SQLite itself.
You can post your question to the SQLite support group by emailing the question to sqlite-users@mailinglists.sqlite.org @romio102 No worries at all.  Hopefully you get it solved. :smile:  Click in the 'Table' combo box (which on Windows you can get to by pressing Alt+T) then simply press the down arrow key.  You can press the down arrow key again and again to get the next table.
Depending on your operating system, you can get an application to 'wrap' these two keystrokes in one, so pressing something else (eg, F8) runs the macro of pressing Alt+T, then down arrow...... Install Windows?  ;)
Are you able to open the database ok with the command line version of SQLite?  That should help figure out where the problem lies. Are you able to email me the database at all, or is it confidential information? Weird.  Glad its now resolved now though. @Gilead7 On windows, it's probably the file level settings for "Read Only".  You can change that in Windows Explorer by right clicking the file, then choosing **Properties**. It should be in the dialog that appears, somewhere fairly obvious.
That's the theory anyway. :wink: Its also dependant on how you access that file.  What I mean by that is, if its a network share, then file permissions are based on that share as well as the physical file permissions.  So you might have physical file permissions, but the share permissions say otherwise.
If you're accessing the file locally, then yes, its file permissions.
If you're accessing the file in c:\program files or c:\program files (x86) then thats a bit more tricky, as Windows doesn't like you opening files there.  You have to have special admin permissions for that (usually right click a program and select 'Run as administrator')
Copy the database to your desktop or 'My Documents' and open the file from there.  You shouldn't get any 'read only' issues then.
It raises an interesting point though.  If you open a read-only Word document, it does warn you it's read only.  DB4S doesn't do that.  Wow, didn't even know that existed.  It's a really good idea.
Let's do it for our version 3.10 (or maybe 3.10.1 :wink) release, as that should have a lot of interesting capabilities. :smile:  Thanks @probonopd.  This looks interesting, and doesn't seem to bust anything we currently use, so why not? :smile:  AppImage looks interesting. Thanks @dridk and @probonopd, just merged it.  Going to watch this over the next few days to gain a better understanding of how it works in practise.
We'll likely need to document "how get get the transfer.sh URL out of the log" in our wiki, but that shouldn't be hard once it's understood. :smile: Keeping the binaries (for every commit) in GitHub releases sounds fairly terrible for our project.
We have a server for nightly releases, which could hold those kind of development centred builds.  We'd need to figure out how to get the Travis CI builds uploaded to that securely though, without embedding username/password in the .travis.yml.
Something to investigate at a later date. :smile: Interesting, thanks. :smile:  @revolter @innermous Do either of you have time to look at this, it seems super simple?
Would you be ok to try out the latest nightly version?  We've done a fair amount of work on our transaction control pieces since our 3.9.1 release.  There's a decent chance this bug won't be present in the nightlies. :smile: It's not something I have time to look at personally today.  My focus for today is on other stuff which is well overdue. :wink:
Hopefully one of the other team members has time to investigate. :smile: No worries at all. :smile: This seems to be the same issue as in #980. I've just tried to explain the problem in that issue and will just copy & paste it: :smiley:
That happens because we have to execute all SQL commands inside a transaction and the foreign key pragma [or any other pragma for that matter] can't be set inside a transaction. The only reasonable workaround for us that I can think of right now is to somehow detect a ```pragma foreign_keys=x``` [or other pragmas] statement and disable transactions for that. But that's always going to be error-prone... Maybe if add a checkbox option to the Execute SQL tab "[ ] Run inside transaction", so people can enable/disable the transaction themselves?  Ahhh, that's interesting.  Does it still happen with modern DB4S though?  Version 3.7.0 is really old, and we've changed the code that does this stuff a fair amount in the meantime. Thanks @dridk. :smile:  Just to confirm, you believe a program is affecting your physical WiFi connection?  As soon as DB4S is closed down, the WiFi status is returned to normal?
DB4S is an application, so its hard to see how it can affect the 'outside world' as such.  It would only use the WiFi....in fact, it doesn't, it goes through your OS.... to access files on a network share.
I'm not familiar with Macs, but does it show (when DB4S is running) the state of the network, eg, what application is using what?  In Windows,  its easy to see what application is using the CPU, memory, disk and network.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/23292461/e3f04dbc-fa57-11e6-99e7-0aa59f30c2c7.png)
Just to confirm, DB4S doesn't have any WiFi 'built into' it, so it just uses any existing network connection... I can't see how it would affect the WiFi.  It doesn't do anything out of the ordinary.
Do any other applications cause the same problem?
I'm kind of thinking there might be a problem with your WiFi hardware, which is being triggered by DB4S.  At the moment, that's the only thing I can think of.
If you try our latest nightly build (download locations are on the front page), does it still happen?  That's definitely worth trying. The only other suggestion I can offer at this stage is to confirm whether or not the ping request time improves after a short time.  I can imagine (as a possibility) DB4S doing some 'am I up to date?' checks, but apart from that (which should be minimal) DB4S doesn't use the network (unless you're opening a database over the network, of course...)
If left open, does the ping request time improve, or does the network only improve once DB4S is closed?  Does it return to normal if DB4S has no ddatabase open?  What if tabs are changed?  (ie, it might only happen on the 'Database Structure' tab.)
There are applications to monitor the network traffic down to the packet level, so you could confirm if DB4S was (for example) splatting garbage over the network (and thus the WiFi) but you'd need to know what you were doing and be comfortable dibbling and dabbling about..... Just one more idea: does it help when when you go to the Settings dialog and disable the Automatic update check? That's the only network activity in the application. > That's the only network activity in the application.
Unless you're opening a (big?) database over a network connection. @zhanghedr Just to check... did you download DB4S from our official locations? (eg sqlitebrowser.org, or from github.com/sqlitebrowser)
Just wondering if maybe the download came from somewhere else, and someone has put something dodgy in it. 😖  @zhanghedr No worries, it was just a thought.  And yeah, that is a weird problem. 😦   If you download and try the latest nightly (nightly version: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser#windows) then this should be fixed.  😃  Yeah, this was mentioned to us shortly after the 3.9.1 release, so has been in the nightly builds now for some time.
@AndreasSummer Are you ok to try out the latest nightly build? :smile: Closing due to lack of response. ☹️  Awesome. :smile:  Thanks @andrewvaughanj, that's interesting.  Looks like one for @MKleusberg. :wink: Turns out it's surprisingly difficult to inspect RHEL packages without having it installed.
@andrewvaughanj Can you help me here and find out if Red Hat's QScintilla package is built for Qt4? If so that would be the problem because we depend on a Qt5 version.
Either way, I'll try to add a command line switch for not using the distribution's library. Can you try again using the latest version from master and setting the ```FORCE_INTERNAL_QSCINTILLA``` flag? Like this:
```
git checkout master && git clean -f -d x . && cmake -DFORCE_INTERNAL_QSCINTILLA=ON . && make -j12 && ./sqlitebrowser
```
In theory this should work for you just as it did before. But it would still be interesting to know if your QScintilla package is based on Qt4 because it might make it easier to work around this problem automatically. @andrewvaughanj Thanks, this helps a lot! I'll try to find a way to automatically detect if the system's version of QScintilla works for us but can't make any promises on this yet :wink: But at least it builds for you now, I'm glad to hear that :smiley: Sounds reasonable :+1:
I hope this issue will gradually become irrelevant as Qt5 becomes more and more widespread. @andrewvaughanj And interest in making that Pull Request? :smile: We now have the needed note in BUILDING.md. c8dba296df117a6f8ab486ade8418328580e2961 :smile:  As a general thought, this seems like a general SQL question rather than something specific to DB4S.
What you ***probably*** should do is ask on the sqlite users mailing list:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mailinglists.sqlite.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/sqlite-users
There are many knowledgable & helpful people there, and it's very likely you'll receive good suggestions/advice. :smile: You're welcome. :smile:  Thinking about this, I'm not completely understanding the process you're using.  It sounds like you're exporting the first database as a SQL file (no problem there), but there's no mention of how you're exporting the 2nd one.
As a general thought, the error you're mentioning ***seems*** like the kind of thing that happens when an exported CVS file doesn't have the correct delimiters.  (eg they're not set correctly in the dialog for the export, so the import goes wrong).  It might be worth double checking your export settings, just to be on the safe side, though I don't fully grok your end-to-end process yet. :wink: @Phil1988 If you're ok with sharing the files with @schdub (or any other databases that give the same problem), he's very likely able to help. :smile:  I was thinking you could 'cheat' by using the 'history' of the last 4 opened files.... In Windows this is stored (I believe) in the registry.  Not sure where its stored on Apple devices...
My kludge would be to edit the history, then simply click the file in DB4S... At least on Linux you can just click File -> Open Database and copy the whole path including file name into the file name box at the bottom, then click OK and it opens it no matter what directory you are in. Have you tried that already?  Same here as in #955. Should be working with tomorrow's nightly build. Can you download that tomorrow  (or any later day) and check if it's improving things for you? :smiley: Hm, sorry about that! I have just made a change which should work around this 'not an error' error. Do you still have the original SQL file causing this error somewhere? And if so can you check again with tomorrow's nightly build? If it still doesn't work it'd be interesting to know what's going on around statement number 30, probably at the end of the file. Thanks for testing! :smiley:
If you think the import should print to the SQL log feel free to open a new issue for that. The problem here is that unfortunately it's not so easy to do that. When you're importing, say, 100k rows, printing them all to the SQL log would cost way too much performance. But maybe we can discuss a solution for this in a new issue :smiley:  How does it look when you double click that cell to open the Edit cell dialog? Can you copy or screenshot the value from there, including all the line breaks?  You're right! There are multiple problems with our SQL import. These couple of lines you've posted there were quite valuable for me because they revealed three problems at once. So thanks a lot for this :smiley:
The main problem here and for #957, too, is that we have to remove all transaction bits from your SQL code because DB4S always opens its own transaction right after opening a database file. That's necessary for the Write Changed and Revert Changes buttons. And unfortunately transactions can't be nested.
I've tried to fix all the bugs I could find and worked around the transaction problem by replacing them with savepoints. So I believe this should be fixed for you now but I'm not a 100% sure it's completely working for you now. So can you test tomorrow's nightly build and tell me if it's working for you with that version? :smiley:  Interesting.  Which version is this happening with, and on which OS? :smile:
If you're on Windows or OSX, would you be ok to try the latest nightly build? (download locations are listed on our front page)
Asking because we've improving our constraint and foreign key handling code recently, so there's a decent chance this is already fixed. 😁  @MKleusberg This issue sounds like it'll be of interest to you.
@mtissington Thanks. :smile: The .99 bit is kind of placeholder text to signal "this is a development build".  We really need to get that updated at some point so development builds shows the git commit hash they were built from instead (much more useful). :wink: > We really need to get that updated at some point so development builds shows the git commit hash they were built from instead
Or the date of the build.... that must be really simple to do?   This is actually easy to fix but that fix comes with a caveat. Suppose having this table layout:
```sql
CREATE TABLE test(id integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1, value text, PRIMARY KEY(id));
```
In this case I'm not so sure we want to use the default value because then the 'Add record' button stops working after the first insert because you can't use the value 1 multiple times. I don't think that's what users expect for table schemas like that either. So we're in a dilemma here.
I think fetching any duplicate errors from SQLite and then falling back to the old method isn't an option because it's really insecure and ugly programming-wise. And @innermous would hate us for doing that (see issue #628) :wink: So we'd have to parse the default value and see if it's a ```random*()``` function call or something like that. But that's not so easy either.
So I'm a bit in a loss here :frowning: Any other ideas? @chrisjlocke Build date sounds good. We used to have the git commit hash in there but it never really worked that well. I don't remember the reason why we deleted it but I do remember how I happy I was to finally get rid of all the build script magic that was needed :wink: @MKleusberg You sure we ever got it working (the git hash thing)?  /me really doesn't remember it :wink: > Or the date of the build.... that must be really simple to do?
Well, I guess it depends on what it would take to get a useful string (date, git commit hash, etc?) that can be compiled in at build time.
If we need to use OS specific stuff (eg sh on *nix, batch file stuff on Win) it could get tricky. @justinclift See commit 5c1347bb927e72227af1e744f758f5dd07adf75a, 441d4e79b7d4f8cac4256b6f9369045ecabe3338 and 69a6685eaae0bbf33e76338c309f1e34170b08c9 for example. We definitely tried to get it working :smiley: Seems like it only ever worked using the cmake build though. > Well, I guess it depends on what it would take to get a useful string [...] turned into a string that can be compiled in at build time
Does it have to though?  In VB, 'it' knows details about itself (version, current directory, etc) and as such its full path.  This is passed to the IO to determine the last modification date of said file...
Dont' know if any of that can be cross-platform.....  `*mind boggles, eyes glaze*` @MKleusberg Thanks. :smile: @chrisjlocke Yep, there might be compiler or build system variables we could use.  That would be good. :smile: @mtissington The random value is fine. Especially in your case collisions aren't very likely either. But what I'm worried about is that the same code (on our side) also had to handle non-random default values that are used in primary key or unique columns.
The file produced by DB4S is in 'sqlite' format, so should be openable by any version of sqlite.   So check the filesize of the database on Android.  If sqlite has created the file, you may be able to see the database, but it will be 0 bytes long.  Here are some issues @chrisjlocke found in the plotting feature testing the latest version from master. See PR #925 for details.
```
Initial thoughts:
*   Widget is not disabled when a database is not open
*   When 'Browse Data' tab is clicked on, X axis gets unticked (ie, when user flips from execute SQL to Browse Data) Two 'rowid' rows momentarily exist in the grid, but this is just a quirk of the grid re-populating I think.
*   When an item in the X axis is ticked, ticking another item unticks the original item, but the item you clicked on is not ticked, so you have to click the item you want again.
*   When selecting 'row #' as the X axis, '65536' is displayed as a label, rather than 'row #'.
``` All done :smiley: The first one is a little tricky because the widget is disabled, it just doesn't look like it. But that's something we can't do much about...
@chrisjlocke Can you double check that the other three are fixed in the next nightly build? :smiley: Will do.  😼  @chrisjlocke Ping. 😉   Interesting.  That definitely seems like a bug.

@SafaAlfulaij This might be of interest to you. :smile: Oh well. 😦   Thanks for checking @awi1369, that does help. :smile: @SafaAlfulaij Thanks. :smile:
And yeah, if you get this figured out we're happy to merge a PR. 😁   Excellent. :smile: Now #945 is resolved:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6525383/22335983/c7b3747a-e3f1-11e6-9faa-7b79695b0b6c.png)
Excellent, thanks for creating this @schdub, and thanks for confirming it @prutz1311. :smile:
Interesting.  Yeah, we'll probably need to look at [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) in detail again, to work out the right approach here. :smile:
From scanning over it quickly just now, section 3 (for the MIME registration) says:
> Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
> by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
> "charset" parameter.
So the CSV specification itself seems to allow more than just US-ASCII.  eg Unicode output is probably a good idea. :smile: SQLiteStudio supports Unicode.  might be worth a peruse...
https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt @innermous @schdub Any interest in updating our CVS export to output Unicode? :smile: @arjo1754 I've just tried this using the latest version and it's using the UTF8 format in the export... So I'll need your help debugging this:
1) Which version are you using? Have you tried the latest nightly build?
2) Can you download [this database](https://dev1.dbhub.io/x/download/mkleusberg/issue946.db?version=1) and try exporting the table in there? Does it produce the same error for you?
3) Which editor or program are you using to open the file? This does look like it's UTF8. So I'm guessing it's your editor that doesn't open it correctly. I don't know which editor you use but it probably has some way to manually set the encoding of the file to UTF8. Have you tried that?
To further narrow down the issue:
1) What do you get when you open this file? [test.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/735961/test.txt) That's what's exported on my system.
@arjo1754 Are you able to send us a working csv produced by SQLiteStudio?
We can probably figure out the difference from that. :smile:
Also, what happened when you tried @MKleusberg's two files? You just compromised peoples emails didn't you Yep, that added people's email details right into the ticket, publicly displaying the lot. 😦  I've just manually removed them.
@arjo1754 That turned out to not be a great idea.  Would you be ok to email the files to me instead (justin@postgresql.org), and I'll forward them to Martin.  @pmoorelegistek Yep, it's already pencilled in to be added with our next major release.  That's probably not any time in the real close future though.  eg likely a few months away at least As far as I remember, yeah.  Saying that because it's been a while (few months?) since I looked at that part of things, so my memory is hazy.
If it helps, this is the batch file we use for automatically building our nightlies on Windows:
&nbsp; &nbsp;https://gist.github.com/justinclift/11cc926f214e882c8162f97c53929c07
Note, it looks more complicated than it really is, because it runs twice.  Once for the nightly without SQLCipher, and once for the nightly with SQLCipher.
It might be as simple as just adding some kind of optional switch somewhere (maybe line 41?) to include FTS5 in the build.
If you work it out, we can update our nightly build script to include the change as well. :smile: Cool.  Does this look like a suitable replacement for line 41?
```
cl sqlite3.c -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3=1 -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5=1 -DSQLITE_API=_declspec(dllexport) -link -dll -out:sqlite3.dll
```
If that's the case, I can probably try kicking off a build now (takes 1/2 hour to finish) and put it on the nightlies server somewhere for you to try out. @justinclift This should be the most correct version, I think:
```
cl sqlite3.c -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5 -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3 -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS -DSQLITE_API=_declspec(dllexport) -link -dll -out:sqlite3.dll
```
See [here](https://sqlite.org/fts3.html#compiling_and_enabling_fts3_and_fts4). Line 80, too. Awesome.  :smile:
Now realising we can probably include JSON1 support along with it too, as per the comment here: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/677#issuecomment-266739629
Not sure if SQLCipher works with the same defines, but it doesn't hurt to try and see what happens. :smile:
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-2017-01-25-FTSv1-win32.exe
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-2017-01-25-FTSv1-win64.exe
In theory, they should both include the FTS3, FTS4, FTS5, and JSON1 extensions.
It's only the standard SQLite version (not SQLCipher) as a first go.  We can try SQLCipher things out after we're happy with straight SQLite options. :smile: @aludee Awesome, thanks for checking and confirming.
I've just added those options to the main nightly build script for windows.  It's only for the SQLite (not encrypted) version for now.  SQLCipher version still needs working on. :wink: You're welcome. :smile:
Am compiling a Win64 SQLCipher build with FTS3/4/5 & JSON1 extensions enabled right now.  Would you have time to try it out when it's finished? (assuming it doesn't break during compiling :wink:) @pmoorelegistek Thanks.  Please give this a shot and let me know if the FTS bits are working ok:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-sqlcipher-2017-01-26-FTSv1-win64.exe
For that, the approach I used was adding the FTS5 and JSON1 defines to the default list for SQLCipher: https://github.com/justinclift/sqlcipher/commit/c04e7b9a8affa6cc25da9d06622e6fe28d3fdc67
But, definitely need someone to test the result. :smile: Thanks @pmoorelegistek, that really helps.
I'll update the nightly build pieces for Windows, so everything has FTS3/4/5 & JSON1 included. :smile:  Aha, yep this is the right way to do things. :smile: Thanks a lot for fixing this :smiley: And yeah, my bad for breaking this!  Awesome @schdub.  @MKleusberg has been working on Foreign Key stuff recently, so this will probably interest him. :smile: Can't reproduce it.
```Execute simply select query to retrive data;```
It's not enough, something tells me it's specific for your table/database.
Please, provide more useful information. **UPD**: Sorry, I am able to reproduce it now. This happens if one hovers a cell for at least 3-4 seconds.
Working on it. Tooltips in execute SQL tab can't be shown right now, since foreign key functionality relies on fixed size tables as *static* database objects.
It sounds like this is fixed, even though the solution isn't perfect for the long term. Yeah, I guess we can close it. If you have the time you could open a meta issue for this instead to collect use cases for a full SELECT statement parser. This here is one of them, the two issues I've mentioned above are others, and maybe there are more.  Interesting.  No idea where to even begin with this, so hoping some of the others have ideas. :smile: Heh Heh Heh
I haven't tried, and probably won't for (at least) a few days personally.  My headspace is entirely in a different area at the moment and I **really** don't want to break that. :wink: Seems like a common issue with SQLite + Virtualbox:
https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=42404
https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/165867/ubuntu-on-virtualbox-w-shared-folders-sqlite-mmap-error
https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/44156/disk-i-o-error-in-sqlite/80594
From the last link
```
SQLite is quite strict with the filesystem, and it needs it to work as
advertised, for example with syncing and file locking. VirtualBox is
just not there yet. Go bug them. Give them a tiny test case, a
sequence of commands to create a repository and try to open it.
``` @MKleusberg Ahhh, that definitely makes sense.
I guess we should close this now, as it's not a DB4S problem (and we're trying to get the issue count down :wink).
@jlmcgraw Are you ok to file a bug with the VirtualBox project?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Bugtracker This seems potentially relevant:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10059
Not seeing any other tickets in their system about SQLite with shared folders.  Search page:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.virtualbox.org/search?ticket=on&q=sqlite  Awesome @schdub. 😁
@MKleusberg You ok to review? @schdub This should work.  I think. :smile:
```
$ git reset f728ff73ab18fe038c457fa2fb392fdd892dc808
$ git add src/sqlitetablemodel.cpp
$ git commit
$ git push [repo] [branch]
``` Either way, not to worry.  We can squash the commits into a single one when we merge it. :smile: @schdub With that last commit (FIX: Endless loop ...), that's for #941 isn't it?
If so, would you be ok to put that into a separate PR?  It helps to keep track of things when we're writing up release notes. 😀  The way I personally do things, is to keep my ***master*** branch in sync with the sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser master branch.  Then, when I want to create a PR I make a new branch from that and do the commits there.
Your repo seems a bit messy :grin:, so lets try a different approach.  First, create a totally new branch, then we can get it in sync with the upstream (sqlitebrowser) master branch.  After that, add your patch to it then push it to a new PR.
So:
1. Make a new branch
$ git checkout -b temp_master
2. Get it into sync with sqlitebrowser master branch
$ git reset --hard 31f73df721df0d79997fe1b7127c92cda2fcfd7a
$ git clean -dffx
$ git pull https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser master
3. Add your patch on top
$ git cherry-pick 47321bc4eb867f350a374b5735ce0ed520288dac
4. Push this new branch to GitHub, so you can make a PR from it
$ git push https://github.com/schdub/sqlitebrowser.git temp_master:temp_master
In theory, number 4 should create a new "temp_master" branch in your repo on GitHub, with just that single commit added on top of the main "master" branch.  If that works, then you should be able to create a new PR from it.
Once that's done, I can show you how to rewind your PR here (#939) so it doesn't include that last commit. :smile: Heh Heh Heh, just noticed you have figured it out already.
So, the way to remove the last commit in this PR is:
```
$ git checkout master    ← "master" here, because that is the branch name you used for this PR
$ git reset --hard HEAD^     ←  "HEAD^" means "latest commit - 1"
$ git push --force https://github.com/schdub/sqlitebrowser.git master   ←  The "--force" bit is needed, to move the index back one
```
In theory :smile:, that should work. You're welcome. :smile: Thanks @schdub! :smiley: Looks like you have put a lot of thought into this already. I'll have a closer look tomorrow or the day after tomorrow but I don't expect to find any problems :smiley: Looks good! Thank you for adding this :D   Yep, this does make sense to implement.  Shouldn't be to hard to do either. :smile:  Yep, why not?
Done btw. :smile:  Is this related to DB Browser for SQLite? If you're needing help with Lua coding, it's probably best to ask on the Lua mailing list:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.lua.org/lua-l.html
:smile: I wonder every time when I see such issues...  Sounds like a worthwhile enhancement.  We could probably do something to make this work. :smile:
@MKleusberg Thoughts? We've just merged a PR by @schdub that implements this (using the ```1~5``` notation) :smiley:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/22418793/62f771b0-e6d2-11e6-88ab-9e090208a9fe.png)
1 ~ 6 shouldn't be including 11 should it? If I change it to 2~6, I get the right result.
I'll ... er... doctor the screenshot until its resolved! ;) Wiki page updated.  👍
References to 'search' also changed to 'filter' as it was slightly cross-purpose and ... well, it made me twitch too much.... ;) @chrisjlocke I've stumbled upon that, too :wink: But that's actually because of SQLite's treatment of data types. ```Field3``` is probably of type ```text``` in your database. If you change it to ```integer``` SQLite it'll work as expected. That's just how SQLite works: you can save any kind of data in any column, no matter the column's data format. But as soon as you're querying the table the data format of the columns actually does matter. In this case 11 is between 1 and 6 because 11 is a text, not a number, and only the first character is used for comparison. If the data format of the column is integer, the value is basically casted to an integer before comparison and 11 is definitely not between 1 and 6 :wink:
Going one step further we could think about casting the field to an integer automatically when doing range comparisons but I'd suggest to leave it as it is in order to not hide the logic of SQLite. But we might add an 'attention' box to the Wiki page. What do you reckon? Good spot - yup, the field type was text.  `*blush mode on*`.  Doh! ;)
@revolter Do you remember the previous bug report about this?  From memory, you commented on it. In any case it's upstream bug, not SQLiteBrowser. Why an upstream bug? @kehugter Excellent, that's good info. :smile: Just quickly mentioning issue #635 here which seems to describe a similar problem (see the last couple of comments). However, that issue is older than the commits mentioned by @kehugter. No idea how to explain this but maybe this is some valuable input for somebody :smiley:  That's some interesting information, @akhilman! Can you double check one extra case for me? When disabling the ```View -> Edit Database Cell``` option do you have the ```View -> Plot``` option enabled? And if not, does setting it change anything?
If we can really narrow this down to the Edit dialog I could prepare a patch that adds tons of debug output to that dialog and, with any luck, this helps us tracking down the source of the problem.  I think you're trying to open up an `.sql` file, and not a database `.sqlite` file. If you open it up in a text editor, does it contain plain text SQL? I wonder if we can detect if the file is a database or not, and print something like "Not a database". Just to elaborate this answer; a database consists of tables, fields and records, etc.  A .sql file is instructions (in SQL) to recreate that database.  As such, DB4S cannot 'open' that .sql file, but it can import it, so you can create a blank database, then import that .sql file.  :) Ahhh, yeah.  That definitely sounds like a text file with SQL statements in it, not a SQLite database file itself.
@joelworsham Not to worry though, you should be able to import it using **File** → **Import** → **Database from SQL file...**

Are you ok to try that out and let us know if it worked for you? :smile: > I wonder if we can detect if the file is a database or not
Should be easy to detect if the first 100 characters or so of the file contains pure valid SQL commands .... usually only 'drop table if not exists' and all that jazz... @revolter *I wonder if we can detect if the file is a database or not, and print something like "Not a database".*
I suppose we could add a step in between those, where we try to detect if the file is standard text in SQL statement format, and automatically open the Import dialog if it is.  No idea how practical that would be to implement though... :wink:  Yeah, good idea. :smile: #827 ?
and #568, which it kind of related to.  ### Details for the issue

The archive that @nkahnfr uploaded [here][1] contains what looks like a corrupted preferences file. As pointed out by @jtlowe [here][2], the `databrowser.reg_bg_colour` key has the value `@Variant(`. @nkahnfr said that:
> After uninstalling the cask version of DB4S to test a nightly build I realized that another old version (3.9.1) was still installed...
I uninstalled it and reinstall latest version using cask and everything works perfectly!
but this might be an actual bug in our code. A check to see if this could be the case would be helpful.

You can also try the latest nightly build. I've recently fixed some grammar parsing issues in there, so you might be lucky :smiley: Closing this due to lack of response. 😦   Excellent.  Lets see if tonight's nightly contains all of the bits in the right place now. :smile: Excellent, thanks for checking @lulol.
The .ts files for the other translations are now updated too. :smile:  Interesting.  We've moved to require Qt5 for compiling, as it makes things better for development and pretty much every platform supports it now.
If you reinstall your Homebrew provided qt, in theory (!) that should get updated to Qt5.  Afterwards, compiling our source code should work.
Are you ok to give that a go? :smile: Yeah, these definitely happen because you're trying to compile using Qt4. You either need to stick with version 3.9.1 (or some of the slightly later commits) or need to install Qt5 when you want to compile the latest version from master. Closing this due to lack of response. 😦   This is a duplicate of #737. The latest nightlies should fix it. No, there is:
> DB Browser for SQLite-sqlcipher_20170109.dmg       09-Jan-2017 04:10 About the `cask` issue, the release's attachment name was renamed to `DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.9.1v2.dmg`. @justinclift, Any idea how can we update the cask's url? ![screen shot 2017-01-09 at 17 31 38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/21771796/7f3be35c-d691-11e6-91aa-ec357ad2720e.png)
@justinclift Can you change the ordering of that please? 😄  As for the curl error, try running `brew cask update`. @revolter The ordering is coming from Nginx... seems standard alphabetical.
I guess we can look into Nginx options and see if that can be changed. :smile: https://github.com/aperezdc/ngx-fancyindex this looks marvelous! @revolter No worries.  Want an account on the nightlies server, so you can get that done? :smile:  Awesome @lulol!
Are these ok to merge as is, or should we take screenshots of them in action first, or ? :smile: Thanks, @lulol :+1: I think, in order to have those missing strings included in the translation file, you'll need to re-run Qt Linguist on the application. Unfortunately I have no experience with that whatsoever... Ahhh, I can do that and commit the results if it would help. @lulol ? @MKleusberg It can be done from Qt Creator.  Tools → External → Linguist → Update translations (lupdate) @lulol Good thinking. :smile:
Just committed an updated Spanish .ts file (generated from `lupdate`): https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/e4fdb8f05dcd412529bebda2b52cbd727af93fd3
Take a look at it and see if it seems correct to you.  If it is, we can commit an update for the other .ts files as well. :smile: Sure, if you want. :smile: Excellent @lulol, that was very quick!  I needed to get sleep, so missed getting the PR merged right away (now done).  This is a duplicate of #737. The latest nightlies should fix it. Oops, somehow missed this.
@capitancooker Did the nightly builds fix this for you? 😄  Excellent. :smile:  Does this happen for any database or just for a specific one? Interesting.  The error message it shows can **generally** be regarded as one of two things:
* Either bad hardware (for example, flaky ram), or
* Something wrong with one of the shared libraries
Let's hope it's a shared library problem. 😀

Doing some searching online shows various issues with screen corruption in VirtualBox, and also some with AMD cards.
Does either of that apply to you? :smile: Hmmm, also wondering if it's maybe a Qt thing.  Hmmm.... Next thought, does it start out looking like that, or is the corruption triggered by something?  eg it starts out looking ok, but corruption happens when making the window bigger (for example)
Trying to make a mental picture here of what the cause could be. :smile: I don't think it's DB B related issue, seriously. @jlmcgraw Has that link changed?  Just tried it and got a 404. :wink:
* In the VirtualBox settings, see if changing graphics related things helps.  eg Try different video memory sizes
* Also in VirtualBox, do you have the Guest Addons loaded for the VM?  Not sure if it'll make a difference but try changing this (if possible for MATE 16.10)
Btw, the new download link worked fine.  Haven't investigated the data set yet (a tomorrow task). :smile: Use hastebin or alternatives for such long outputs next time, please :) @jlmcgraw Interesting looking data set. :smile:
Just loaded spatial56day.db here with DB4S 3.9.1 (on OSX).  No screen corruption (as expected).
I'll try out Ubuntu MATE in a VM (VMware Fusion though), and see if something shows up with that.
If it doesn't, I'm thinking you'll need to file a bug with the Virtualbox project.  But, let me try it here first. :smile: @jlmcgraw Unexpected surprise here.  The same screen corruption is showing on Ubuntu MATE 16.10 here in VMware Fusion:
![screenshot at 2017-01-05 18-44-12](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/21693043/5253b710-d377-11e6-8439-9e44f3a174fe.png)
So it's not a VirtualBox thing after all.  My next best guess is that it's a bug in the (older) Qt library being used.  The way to test that would be to download & install the latest Qt release directly from Qt.io, compile DB4S using that, and see if the problem goes away. @deepsidhu1313 You might find this issue interesting too. :smile: It seems like a bug in the older version of Qt (5.6.1).  After compiling it with the latest Qt (5.7.x, from qt.io), the corruption isn't happening:
![screenshot at 2017-01-05 19-52-51](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/21695222/c7c92b8e-d380-11e6-9553-82d93a4eec1d.png)
Some notes on things I needed to do for compiling with Qt Creator, in case they're useful:
* Remove the existing sqlitebrowser and libqt5printsupport5 package (just to be safe, in case they confuse things)
$ sudo apt remove sqlitebrowser libqt5printsupport5
* Install the build dependencies
$ sudo apt install build-essential git libsqlite3-dev mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
After that, start Qt Creator, open the sqlitebrowser.pro file.  "Run qmake" (in the Build menu), then run "Build All".  Once that (hopefully) finishes ok, you can launch the build with Ctrl+R (in the Build menu too).
@jlmcgraw Does that help? :smile: Awesome. 😀
Are you ok to take it from here if we close this issue? Well, (to me) it seems like a Qt bug that there's not much we can do about until the Qt library in Ubuntu is updated.  It's probably going to be triggered by all kinds of weird stuff, and isn't really worth the time to investigate more as we're already kind of overloaded with things.
Note - It's not a complete loss, people will be able to find the details in this issue here with some simple searching. :smile: @jlmcgraw With the spatial56day.db database, it seems good for testing our SQLite parser with (an area of things we're working on).
Is it ok with you if we hang onto it and use it for development stuff? Awesome @jlmcgraw, thanks. :smile:
@MKleusberg The archive here has a database in it (/databases/spatial56.db) that seems useful for your parser testing:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.dropbox.com/s/fk1uup3zx7sb8r0/data.tar.xz?dl=0 ...and that hasn't been stored on dbhub.io because..... ;) @chrisjlocke nice catch @chrisjlocke Good point.  I haven't created any real reference data sets on the dev1 server yet mainly because I've been working on the visualisation stuff.
But yeah, it doesn't hurt to upload it there to make things easier. :wink: @chrisjlocke It's on DBHub now:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://dev1.dbhub.io/justinclift/spatial56day.db :smile:
It's over 200MB in size... that's the first one of largish size I've tried btw.  Kind of surprised it uploaded and downloaded without issues, though it did.  Upload was a bit slow, but that's probably because it's not a beefy server at the moment.
Did a binary compare of the database file downloaded from DBHub, to the original... it's bit perfect.  Yay. :wink: Always good to test 'real data'. ;)
200 MB for a database (uncompressed) is quite minimal really....  Heh Heh Heh, good points. :smile:  Interesting.  Two thoughts spring to mind right away:
* I'm not sure that the VB.net encryption layer you're trying to use is based on SQLCipher.  We use SQLCipher to provide the SQLite encryption, which is *probably* different and not compatible.  Note, I'm not sure about this. :smile:
* For the crashing, it's definitely not supposed to crash when it can't open the file.  Ouch.
Kind of wondering if the vb.net encryped database is somehow "close enough" to a SQLite file to get past the initial "open the database" check, but is then barfing when our SQLCipher layer hits it.  Not sure.  I suspect this is going to take some debugging effort with some dummy encrypted data to trace throught the opening and see what's happening.
Er... SQLite doesn't have any password protection built into it.  (Thus our use of SQLCipher)
The wrapper of sqlite for .net (commonly refered to as system.data.sqlite.dll) has encryption, but its a weird legacy implimentation.  Certainly not compatible with sqlCipher.
sqlCipher do do a .net flavour which is (obviously) compatible, but you have to pay $$$ for that.
@CarlCDHPIX No worries at all.  I'll close this for now, as I don't think there's much use in leaving it open at the moment.  We're kind of overwhelmed with the number of issues at the moment right now anyway. :wink: Appreciate this is closed, but @CarlCDHPIX , which .NET component were you using? @chrisjlocke Are you still interested in that info? Could be handy to know.  If there is a 'demo' to download, I could then test it. :) Ahhh, that definitely makes sense.
@CarlCDHPIX ? Thanks @CarlCDHPIX, that should help @chrisjlocke locate the right bits. :smile: Interesting - thats the exact same .net component I use for my sqlite databases.  Never used the encryption side of it though.
What I would suggest is therefore in the application a routine which creates a database backup (always useful...) and then (optionally) removes the encryption from this database.  This would allow you to view the contents of the database if needed.  If any modifications were required, you'd need the application/another application to re-encrypt this database so it could be replaced in place with the original again.
Either way, DB4S isn't going to be able to open the encrypted database (unless someone wrote an RSA plugin).  DB4S can't use the .net sqlite component, so can't 'talk' to it to unencrypt the database, and certainly can't use it to talk directly with it... @CarlCDHPIX @chrisjlocke Just stumbled on this: https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net/commit/4858d1fba57f6a4a26157a4daa72a4da1a9f4004
I'm not at all a .NET person, so not 100% sure here... but it sounds like SQLite-net (close to it's next release) supports encrypting with SQLCipher.  Which might mean we can open databases created with it.
Well, hoping that's the case. :smile: I don't think this is the 'official' system.data.sqlite.dll but a separate
project, but if it 'solves an issue', could be worth investigating.
anyway) but a major issue with the 'official' release is that while you can
specify table names in sql queries, the fields returned back aren't table
I'll have a look at this implimentation though, as I'm looking at images in
SQL databases at the moment, and it appears the only way to do this is via
parameters, which I've not played with lately.  Now im definately waffling. Cool. :smile:  Ahhh, that might be our grammar parser needing work then.
@MKleusberg Your kind of thing? Yes! I'm referencing our help-wanted issue #741 here, just because that's exactly the kind of issue I was thinking about back then :smiley: @ghellquist Feel free to play around with this! :smiley: We highly appreciate any help in coding!
If that's difficult to do, try and just outright remove them using Add/Remove programs.  In theory (!) Windows should then use either a basic non-accelerated driver (but still work).  That should then be stable enough to try installing graphics drivers again.
And use a different version than you loaded last time. k.  It sounds like the 3D component of your graphics card drivers is fine, but something is messed up with some other component of them. Maybe 2d acceleration related or something.  They don't just do 3d. :wink: Out of curiosity, which graphics card are you using? Hmmm, is a specific brand of Radeon?  eg MSI (etc) k.  Some of the graphics card manufacturers release utilities just for their brand of graphics card.  eg for overclocking, doing updates, monitoring temperature, (etc)
Do you have the MSI one of that installed? That's nice, but not what I asked. 😁
I'm asking because people often load the manufacturer add-on utilities (not graphics drivers) without knowing better.  Those utilities are very often a complete pile of steaming dog turd.  eg source of problems.
I'm trying to think of potential things that could be the cause. Well, atiumd64.dll is one of the files provided by the ATI graphics card drivers.  It sounds like it's having weird issues interacting with something.
If you're not able to narrow down the problem more using the utilities pointed out in https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/395#issuecomment-269245184 then you'll probably just need to try different ATI drivers out in the hope one of them works.
Sorry I don't have better/easier answers for you. Cool. :smile: Yeah, I'm not sure if that's good or bad. :wink: Hmmm, you might need to get someone (eg a competent IT shop) to take a look at it.  It's pretty hard to diagnose this stuff over a comment style conversation. :wink: So, all fixed then? Oh well.  Um, good luck with it? :smile: Nice wall of text in notifications btw. Just locked this.  We've put enough time into this, and it's not really related to DB4S at all.  Hmm, there's supposed to be.
Which Linux version are you using, and which version of DB4S? Ouch, something isn't right then. 😦
@deepsidhu1313, any ideas?  You're familiar with the package on Linux, so hoping something obvious springs to mind. :smile: Maybe [this](http://askubuntu.com/questions/762137/applications-menu-missing-from-menu-bar) would help. @JonathanJohann How did you go with this? :smile: Yep, that's definitely not showing the menu bar.
Do any of the menu's show if you try triggering them via the keyboard?  eg Alt+f for the file menu? Cool. :smile:
Just to confirm, you're able to get the CSV import dialog happening now yeah? Closing this now as it **seems** like it's fixed.
If it turns out not to be, you're welcome to reopen this @JonathanJohann. :smile:  We need some sort of database visualization.
My suggestion is to create another tab in main view. Within it one can select tables he wants to observe, and main view in which tables and connections between them are shown. It should be updated dynamically whenever table layouts are changed(table removed, modified).
This is just a concept by now, I'll provide sketches.
Help is really wanted. If anyone is interested in this - let me know, we'll create new project in canban cards and a team for it, create issues and assign people to them. I can provide information you might need to know, and we can estimate our efforts and see when we can make this stuff ready2go.  Sounds good.  Which sort(s) of visualisations are you thinking of?
* ER diagrams?
* Frequency tables?
* etc :smile: ER diagrams, or something close to that.
I'll stick to something like SQL Server diagrams and we'll see. @schdub Ping, any interest? 😁  @schdub Awesome! :smile:
Would you be ok to chat with @innermous about it?  He's back from a break and full of energy 😀 , and this is a task he has a lot of enthusiasm for.  Tips/guidance/collaboration/writing-code (etc) from someone who's already done this kind of thing would probably be super helpful. Personally, I don't like how that looks. @schdub in my local branch.  ![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8950786/21457487/4ed2d9e8-c938-11e6-86c8-308432fca305.png)
Cool, I think @MarqueIV mentioned this bug annoying him a few times too.  Good that it's finally fixed. :smile:  I you have a few minutes, would you be ok to try this with any of our recent nightly builds?
We've added a few bits and pieces for better constraint support since the v3.9.1 release, though they're not yet extremely well tested.  Feedback would be useful. :smile:
(download locations for the nightly builds are listed on the front page of this repo, if that helps) What sort of constraint do you need? In the Create Table dialog we have fields for NOT NULL, unique, check, and foreign key. But if any of this isn't working as expected or if there is anything missing that you need just give us a quick example of what you'd like to be able to create :) Foreign key constraint requires more user friendly widget, I think.
Maybe I'll get around that soon. @polaris197 ping? @innermous I fully agree :) Wondering if this was linked to #872, where the primary key can't be set... ?  Wondering if the parser was broken... ?  (just thinking out loud...) Parser is alright.
Martin added some refactoring that caused broken primary keys. Closing this due to lack of response. ☹️   Ahhh, interesting.  Sounds like something one of the more experienced Windows dev's will need to look at. (eg might be a curly problem)  Hmmm, that sounds familiar... I **think** this might have been done not long ago, as part of #759.
Would you be ok to try a recent nightly build and see if the refresh key (F5, or Ctrl/Cmd+R) works for you? Awesome. :smile:  Sounds interesting.  To me, that kind of sounds like some sort of special support for the EXPLAIN command (which can be run in the Execute SQL tab now).
Are you meaning that, or something different? :smile: SQLite doesn't offer much profiling information. The explain command tells you something about what SQLite is doing when a statement is executed but doesn't include any timings. Then there is the sqlite3_trace_v2 function (https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/trace_v2.html) which allows profiling but all it does is measuring the total time that each statement took. So we can't really use it because a) it doesn't allow us to distinguish between Application and User SQL like we're currently doing it in the SQL log and b) it doesn't give us much more information than out timer in the Execute SQL tab right now.
But then again, I have to admit I'm a little confused right now. Is that what you need anyway? :) Hmmm, doesn't the SQL Log tab ("Application log") already show that?
If not, then maybe we're filtering something out which might actually be useful? Hmmm, yeah we might be able to do something about that.
@MKleusberg thoughts? Unfortunately that's most likely not possible. The problem is that SQLite is serverless. Each application opens the database on its own and doesn't share the connection. So even though multiple applications can open the same file at the same time it's basically two separate connections that can't really interact with each other (except for some basic locking functionality). But this means one application can't see what the other is doing and vice versa. So DB4S has no chance to log the SQL statements executed by another application :frowning: What you will need to do is add some hook to your application that does this job. The ```sqlite3_trace_v2``` I've linked to above is an easy way to implement this into an existing application. Ahhh, so an ideal solution would be some kind of SQLite proxy.  eg load that and point it at a database, then load DB4S and point it at the proxy
It's not something we can do ourselves (in the short term anyway), though as a separate idea it does sound kind of nifty
Doing some quick Google searching turned up a few hits for "SQLite proxy", but nothing seeming to be the right kind of thing. @denisz1 You might have more luck than me if you look look further, I just did cursory searching.
Hmmm... guessing we might as well close this Issue too, as it seems like something we can't really do much about. Even a 'proxy' would be difficult to do because SQLite only opens database files. So the proxy would just open the database file, but what would the application open? It can't open the same file because then it's no proxy. But it can't open some connection to the proxy either because that's no file. So I'm afraid you'll definitely need to update your application or the SQLite library...  What happens if you leave off the '(' and ')' characters?  eg:
SELECT * FROM Keywords WHERE Keyword LIKE 'h%'
SELECT * FROM Keywords WHERE Keyword LIKE '_ello'
I'm unsure about the '[]' characters, but simple '_' and '%' are supposed to work.
Looking quickly on the SQLite site, I'm not seeing the reference documentation for wildcards though, thus my uncertainty about '[]'. Note - Weirdly, searching the SQLite website for the terms "wildcard" and/or "wildcards" turns up no useful information.  Oops.  Hole in the documentation maybe? 😦  Yeah, I just tried it out now using this query (and several others), which worked:
SELECT * FROM download_counts WHERE release LIKE '3._';
The database I ran it against is here, if that helps:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://dev1.dbhub.io/justinclift/DB4S%20download%20stats.sqlite
&nbsp; &nbsp; (download button is on the right hand side, should be green) Just tried those here too, and yeah, it's treating the '[' and ']' as literal characters.  You'll probably need to leave them out.
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#regexp
Working examples:
SELECT * FROM download_counts WHERE release REGEXP '^[3].[1-2]$'
SELECT * FROM download_counts WHERE release REGEXP '[3]\.[2]$'
SELECT * FROM download_counts WHERE release REGEXP '[3]\.[2]'
It doesn't execute fast, taking ~1.5+ seconds on my desktop compared to subsecond for non-regexp(), but it works.
Does that help? :smile:
Oh well, it was a thought. :smile: But you should still be able to open the same file using DB4S and its SQLite library, I guess. Or am I missing something there? This way you can develop using litedac (having no regexp) and check your data using DB4S and its regexp function.
Other than that I don't see any way of supporting ```[ ]``` wildcards either. We are completely dependent on what SQLite offers us, and for the LIKE operator that's just the ```%``` and ```_``` wildcards but no ```[ ]```. Closing this, as it doesn't seem like we can do much/anything to add support for [] characters.
@instrumentally You're welcome to reopen this if it turns out I closed it prematurely. 😀   Yeah, this is a known issue on Sierra.  There is a temporary workaround for now: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/737#issuecomment-262403564 Quick update, this was actually a Qt bug and was fixed be a recent release. The latest nightlies should work ok.  From memory, this was fixed not long after the 3.9.1 release.
So... if you grab one of the nightly builds from (say) a week after that it should work.  In theory. 😁
Download locations are listed on the front page of our repo, if that helps. :wink: You're welcome. :smile: Duplicate of #748.  Interesting thought.  Yeah, can't see why it wouldn't be a nice thing to have. :smile: I think this depends on the font you use. At least it works for me:
![screenshot_20161219_192721](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/21324277/59c4cbaa-c621-11e6-925a-b0c0788f9016.png)
Can you check which font you have selected in View -> Preferences, Data Browser -> Font?
Thanks @mgrandi, good catch. :smile: I noticed this too a couple of weeks ago but looks like I forgot to open an issue. I thought I fixed it too :-?. It looks like the link is in the translation files, so it isn't hard to fix. I've just pushed a commit which fixes this issue :) Iulian is right by the way: the link is also included in the translation files as well (even though it originally comes from the form file), which I didn't see at first. So there's a second commit now which updates all the translation files to hopefully include the fixed link, too.
@mgrandi Can you test tomorrow's nightly build (or any later one) to check if the bug is fixed in there? :)  And I didn't know it's in the `.ui` file too. Then, why is it in the translations files? If it's the same. Shouldn't we remove it from those altogether? Thanks for reporting back, @mgrandi ! :smiley:
I'm going to close this issue then. If anybody is bothered too much by the way the disabled links look, I think this should be a separate issue and unfortunately a little more thinking :smiley:   Hard to say what's causing the problem here :frowning: As a start:
1) Have you tried compiling using qmake instead of cmake? This should work using the ```qmake && make``` commands.
2) Do you have the antlr library installed using the CentOS package manager? As far as I can tell from http://centos-packages.com/7/package/antlr-C++/ this would mean that you have a package called ```antlr-C++``` installed.  Oops, yep.  We do seem to have missed that one.
Just tested it here, and none of the other font settings affect it either.
So, we'll need to add some way to change that. :smile: In theory the font and the font size in the edit cell window should be the same as in the data browser table view. What irritates me is that it doesn't really look like this is the case in your last screenshot.
One bug I see here is that changing the font or font size (the one in your first screenshot) was not applied automatically to the edit cell window. You'd have to restart the application in order to see the effect. This is changed, however, by the latest commit :) Can you do me favour and grab tomorrow's nightly build (or any later build), increase the font size by one or two using that version and check if it improves your experience in any way? :smiley:   Interesting.  Yeah, I tried to compile our Windows binaries with XP support (using Visual Studio 2013, as per the instructions [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S)), but in testing (quickly) it didn't load when launched.
So, seeing as XP has practically no users... I decided to not care. :smile:
If there's an easy way to change things such that it works, I'm not personally against doing so. Meh, it just seemed like too much effort. :smile:
I'm kind of surprised that XP can even download DB4S... apparently it's not able to connect to the GitHub HTTPS servers without installing other things first. (eg not impossible, but didn't sound likely) When compiling for XP, I did choose the XP compatible setting... I **think** it was "v120_xp" instead.  But, obviously didn't put enough time/effort into it.
You're welcome to make a mirror using an XP-friendly version if you want.  The project is Open Source after all. :smile: From memory, the 3.8.0 and earlier all should:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.8.0 @lulol Cool, that's good info. :smile: @lulol Ahhh, that date range triggers a relevant memory.  When we used to support building with Qt4, our Windows nightly build process was done on a Linux box, cross compiling to Windows.
When we change to Qt5-only, we set up a new build system for the Windows nightlies.  That was around October.  So it looks like the previous build process used to work for XP, whereas the new build process doesn't. @karim Yep, it's completely possible.
As a thought, since you seem to know a lot about this stuff... this is the batch file that runs automatically each night to create the windows builds:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://gist.github.com/justinclift/11cc926f214e882c8162f97c53929c07
It's using CMake to generate the MSVC project files, then builds them with `devenv`.  Any idea if that /SUBSYSTEM switch would work for `devenv`?  It kind of looks like it might (though I haven't tried it) If details are given on one of the wiki pages how to 'fiddle' with a program to make it XP compatible, then its up to the user whether they can use those instructions or not.  They're already 'dicing with death' using an old OS, so having a 'multitude of issues' will be the icing on the cake.  I don't think its up to us to do that though... (and maintain software for non-maintained OS's) Been thinking about this.  It seems it'll be fairly simple (in the short to medium term) to keep DB4S working with XP.  So, we might as well keep making XP compatible releases.
After all, we do support OS/2 still. 😀
When the underlying things we rely on (eg Qt, SQLCipher) stop working for XP, that'll probably be a reasonable point at which we can stop supporting XP.
We'll wait. 👍  @urmommaz You do realise this project is a volunteer based GUI for SQLite, not SQLite itself yeah? :wink: @urmommaz then why don't you just use them instead?  Due to idiotic further responses from @urmommaz, this Issue has been locked. @h1618 Do you have the time and motivation to create an XP compatible build of our 3.9.1 release?
Some people are looking for a Win XP compatible build, so having something verified as working (I don't have XP) would be good for them. eg #986 :smile:
If you can make it, we can put it on our "[nightlies](https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org)" server() and point people at it when they ask. :smile: Closing this issue as we updated our 3.9.1 release with Windows XP support a few weeks ago (14th May). :smile:  Interesting.  Yeah, that makes sense.
I wonder how everyone else is importing into Excel then, as no-one seems to have mentioned this before. (from memory anyway :smile:) No worries at all.  It shouldn't be too hard for us to implement this. :smile: I'm not entirely sure I understand you correctly :)
Currently we would be exporting something like this:
```
aaa;bbb;ccc;ddd
eee;fff;ggg;hhh
iii;jjj;kkk;lll
```
And from what I understand you'd expect it to be like this:
```
aaa;bbb;ccc;ddd;
eee;fff;ggg;hhh;
iii;jjj;kkk;lll;
```
Correct?
But that would be a different table from a CSV perspective. It would add an empty column to the right side of the table. Excel should definitely be able to import it without the trailing separator. Maybe it is an issue with line endings? Newer versions of DB4S support setting the line separator and for Excel it needs to be CR+LF. These settings *should* work for Excel with default settings:
![screenshot_20161228_140821](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/21522586/2743c3d8-cd07-11e6-8011-a7724d81753b.png)
@steda112 Ping... :smile: Closing this due to lack of response. 😦  You're welcome. :smile:  Thanks for reporting it.  Yeah, we should at least detect that the changes aren't written, and warn the user when it happens.  Cool. :smile:
Looks good here from a quick visual once-over.  It seems like the Travis CI infrastructure is having problems though, so it's a bit hard to do an initial verification on.
I'll merge this later on today, after I've manually compiled it locally just to make sure it's ok compile-wise as least on my system. :smile: Thanks @shanecb, it's compiling fine on my local OSX system, shows up in the menu correctly, and seems good here. :smile:  Oops, forgot to respond to this.  It's a valid concern, but I'm thinking the bug isn't really with us directly.
We create the installer (auto-generated) using CMake + NSIS.  This bug **sounds** like a problem with how with CMake is generating things, or perhaps even how the NSIS backend to CMake is doing stuff.
Any interest in reporting this to the CMake project people, so they can discuss/investigate it?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://cmake.org/mailman/listinfo/cmake
Asking because if/when it's fixed by whichever of those two is the causing bit, then it'll automatically be fixed for us when we update. :smile: Closing this due to lack of response. 😦   Hi All,
A release was made on the 4th of November for 3.15.1:
https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_15_1.html
Can the nightly updates include 3.15.1 now?
Thanks!
3.15.2 was just released:
https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_15_2.html > Hence I would suggest waiting at least a month before using 3.15.2. Just my personal view though.
Good point! I'll close this now and see what happens at the top of the year.  ### Details for the issue
<!--
Thanks for coming here to report an issue. :)
Please describe it in this section, fill out the correct check boxes
below with an "x", then click the "Submit new issue" button at the bottom
-->
As pointed out in #770, [deferred foreign keys](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_deferred) are not working. Having this database:
```
CREATE TABLE one ( pk INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT );
INSERT INTO "one" VALUES(1,'test');
CREATE TABLE two( pk INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, fk INTEGER NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY( fk ) REFERENCES one(pk) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED );
```
and entering a row in table `two` that violates the FK, it now throws an error instead of handling it correctly.
If this is not actually possible, please mark it as won't fix and close this.

Have you tried it with the latest version from master, too? I have changed something in there to handle deferred foreign keys at least a little better. With the latest version I can enter anything in table ```two```, even when it violates the foreign key. No error messages or anything are shown. Only when clicking the Write Changes button, an error message is thrown at you:
![screenshot_20161228_141208](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/21522653/de545132-cd07-11e6-88bf-c1f66aa9f9ee.png)
@revolter Do you have time to try this out on latest master build?  Interesting.  When you say the database is encrypted using "leCast128", that sounds like it's wasn't done using SQLCipher.
We only support SQLCipher encryption at present.  Adding support for other things can be done, but it would need someone with the time & interest in it to update the code & make a Pull Request with the changes. No worries at all, good luck with it. :smile: Looking in your list, you have eaAES256. If you could unencrypt your database and encrypt using this method, it might be compatible with SQL cipher. 256bit AES is quite secure and fast, so is worth using.
I think you've found the right db tool.... its just the right encryption you've got to find now.... ;)  Interesting.  We're using Qt, so I don't *think* we have any X11 specific code.
Do other Qt apps work for you under Wayland? Ahhh, that's making more sense to me now then.
This sounds like a problem with the Fedora (25) Wayland package, or perhaps the Fedora 25 Qt package (not being build correctly for Wayland).
Are you ok to open a bug about this on https://bugzilla.redhat.com? Awesome. :smile:  @SafaAlfulaij Any ideas? :smile: 😦  It's even documented [here](http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html):
```
Scintilla does not properly support right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew. While text in these languages may appear correct, it is not possible to interact with this text as is normal with other editing components.
```
So it's probably not going to change any time soon :frowning_face:  Bug report: https://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/bugs/1590/
It's so ridiculous that they are not even interested in fixing this :frowning:  The QScintilla approach to "Community" is pretty terrible too.  I've I'd known then what I know now, my recommendation would have been we find an alternative.
But that's hindsight in action.  It's still better than what we had. :wink:
Maybe we should add a longer term goal of finding a replacement?  Hmmm... looking at the screenshot, I can't tell what's wrong.
Give us a hint? :smile:  Interesting.  In theory, the installer for 3.9.1 is supposed to remove the previous version.  Sounds like that didn't happen.
Aside from that, the ".sqlite" file association isn't something the installer changes (yet).  It's a known issue for Windows, and ideally we'll have that fixed with the next release.
For now you'll need to change it manually (sorry).  Hopefully the info here helps: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/279#issuecomment-242426297 @chrisjlocke Also made a screencast showing the process, if that's useful too. :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Windows-File-Associations Ahhh yeah, that's definitely a left over 3.9.0 folder. 😦
Are there files inside the "3.9.0" folder, or is that folder empty? Ouch.  That 3.9.0 uninstaller **really** didn't work then. 😦
If you manually run the `Uninstall.exe` in the "3.9.0" folder, does that remove the older version? Ahhh cool. :smile:
Err... any interest in updating that wiki entry with the correct registry info for Win10?
(I don't have Win10 personally, so it's not something I can easily do) @XplittR Thanks for updating the wiki page, that kind of thing really does help. :smile: @XplittR We're ok to close this issue aren't we? Closing this, as there's nothing to really do at the moment. :smile:  > SQLite does not have a separate Boolean storage class. Instead, Boolean values are stored as integers 0 (false) and 1 (true). There is no boolean data type. ... "But as soon as INTEGER values are read off of disk and into memory for processing, they are converted to the most general datatype (8-byte signed integer)."24 Mar 2010
Also, in at least 3.9.1, if I add a field and make the type "widgetFluffyBum', then it accepts that.  In fact, it even accepts Boolean.  I think the issue is that people aren't pressing Enter to save the adjustment.  Here is a screencast:
http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cDXTlYQiO3
So I have a field called 's' which I change to 'fluffy'.  If I click OK, it doesn't accept it.  You'd think it would be like Notepad where it would say, "Do you want to save changes to .... ?" rather than just losing the amendments, but hey... maybe the next version .... :wink:
But the second half of the video shows pressing Enter saves the amendment, and all is good.
Heya, this has been reported a few times already (though not yet fixed).
Probably best to keep an eye on #737 for now. :smile:  From memory, this is fixed in the nightly builds.  Any interest in giving one of those a shot? :smile: The latest nightly works for me.  :)
> Hard to believe that the author added the right click menu items then didn't test them.:-)
More like it did work but then got broken...  this is applicable...
http://i.imgur.com/aiSRk1s.gif @JayWLord, It's not that it was not tested, it's seems to be caused by #748. Closing this due to lack of response. 😦   ### Details for the issue
Following these steps:
- select table
- click "Modify Table"
- click "Add field"
- enter row name
- click "Move field up"
I am presented with a warning popup alert with the message:
> renameColumn: cannot find column firebase_token.
This didn't happen in 3.9.0 (tested) though I don't have time now to test in the yesterday's nightly.
Wow, it looks like it's completely broken. After clicking "OK", if I go to "Modify table" again, the last row is named "Field18", being the default name. And if I only change (not move it) and hit "OK", it does nothing.

Seems similar to #390 and #836. Interesting.  I saw similar a week or so ago.  Something seems to have gone wrong somewhere which needs tracking down. 👼  Maybe a `git bisect` between `HEAD` and `3.9.0` would help figure it out. @revolter @MKleusberg
I found that commit: e76e5b3. If i just remove [this check](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/4ac931835d8116eec13efc933f9d7f9ee122678a/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L291-L292), moving fields up/down works as expected. This check returns `false`, the function returns `false` to another functions, which in turn return `false` again with similar checks, and in majority of them there is no `emit dbChanged(getDirty())` signal, which should trigger update of [`objMap` data structure](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/4ac931835d8116eec13efc933f9d7f9ee122678a/src/sqlitedb.h#L19). I still have not figured out which checks should be corrected. @prutz1311 Cool, it sounds like you're investigating this properly. :smile:
Do you want to assign it to yourself? It seems that we are not handling savepoints properly. For example, not every order of setting/releasing savepoints is possible:
```
sqlite> SAVEPOINT RESTOREPOINT;
sqlite> SAVEPOINT sqlitebrowser_rename_column;
sqlite> RELEASE RESTOREPOINT;
sqlite> SAVEPOINT RESTOREPOINT;
sqlite> RELEASE RESTOREPOINT;
sqlite> RELEASE sqlitebrowser_rename_column;
Error: no such savepoint: sqlitebrowser_rename_column
sqlite>
```
That is, if you release a savepoint `X`, the savepoints between setting and releasing `X` get released, and you cannot access them anymore.
I added a log statement in [bool DBBrowserDB::executeSQL](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/4ac931835d8116eec13efc933f9d7f9ee122678a/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L603) method and here is what I got when I opened a database, created a new column, tried to move it and closed the database:

```
So the handling of savepoint needs to be improved. Some questions arise:
1. Should we return false if there is no savepoint to release? (Doing this causes many thigs to break down)
2. Should we release all savepoints in between or do something else? (Seems like we should)
Hmmm, at first thought yeah... 2. seems like the better idea.
Want to try it out and see if turns out to be ok? @justinclift and @revolter Have you tried Oleg's changes? They seem to work for me :smiley:  Yep, just tested it here on OSX too.  Working well.
Thanks heaps @prutz1311. 😀   Its the default values which has thrown it out.  I created the SQL, but when I went to modify the table, DB4S thought it was empty.  Remove the 'default' option, and it works OK.
Referencing #741 as its an issue with the parser... Can you give steps you're doing so I can try to replicate this... Thanks for reporting this, @FreudGit! You've stumbled upon a nice corner case there. This happens when using an unquoted default value that's a keyword at the same time. In your case that's the ```DEFAULT NO``` part of the ```EMERGENCY``` column. I think this should be fixed by the latest commit. Can you try tomorrow's nightly build to check if it's working for you as well? :smiley:  Did you have a chance to test this yet, @FreudGit? :smiley: @FreudGit Would you be ok to try out latest nightly build, and let us know if it's fixed for you?  In theory, it should have been fixed a while back. :smile: Oops, sorry I should have mentioned it.  The latest nightly builds are here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest/  This isn't a bug per se ... It's by design. There are no in-built record editing features, but you can edit records using more SQL statements... Or using the 'browse data' tab... @Sojourneyman As Chris mentioned, yeah the output results from a SQL command aren't really editable.  If you're wanting to select specific rows to then edit (in a simple way), try out the filters in the Browse Data tab.  That lets you pick a subset of a table, and then edit specific rows.  Sorry for the delay, somehow I'd just not noticed this issue.
While some of our user base would have no problem doing this editing, others would.  So if it's easy + accurate to implement we might as well. 😄  No worries Larry.  Closing this issue then, but you're welcome to re-open it if it turns out to be needed after all. 😄  Yep, no problem at all, Larry :smiley:   What's line 1 in the file, or could you email it to me?
Just to confirm, did you import this using the 'File | Import | Table from SQL File' ?
If so, did you then get a screen showing a sample of your data?  eg:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/20458091/9b568d52-ae92-11e6-8bb4-5da743b65cf0.png)
'File | Import | Database from SQL file' wouldn't work, as I assume would give the above error...
You need to create your blank database first, and create the fields the data is going to be imported into.
The export from Access is just the data, and not the schema on how to build a database table.
\o/
No problem.  Guess its not that intuitive if you're used to other systems.  Something else to add to the wiki... ;)  Glad you got it in the end.  :)
Yes, this is a known issue (see #849)
From memory this was fixed shortly after the 3.9.1 release.
Would you be ok to try out one of the nightly builds?
https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org
The last nightly works correctly for me.
Weird.  Works fine for me on 3.9.1 (so not from HEAD...)
http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cDXF6TQnDT
Can you try 3.9.1 and the latest nightly?  IN fact, I'll try the nightly...
Confirmed.  The nightly does not work.  It be broken.  Try 3.9.1, or a slightly older nightly...
Installed every nightly (up to Oct 17) but each one exhibits that behaviour.  The only version that was working was 3.9.1, so unsure when it stopped working.  At some point from 3 Oct to 17 Oct.  I don't have any nightlies from 3 Oct to 17 Oct.
Wrong. Works only in early september builds.
OK.  So are the nightlies a separate build from the 3.9.1 release, because, as I said, it works (as per my screencast ... unless thats wrong too?) in 3.9,1, and thats dated 3 Oct.  Unless its working for me for some other reason...?
It stops working after 5c17115 commit.
Ahhh, somehow I didn't notice these comments.
Some data points, which might help clarify:
* The nightlies build from master
* When 3.9.0 was getting made (~August), I created a new branch from master-at-the-time called "v3.9.x".  3.9.0 came from that branch, and so did 3.9.1.  3.9.1 is pretty much 3.9.0 + a bunch of minor-ish commits added that seemed to fix bugs aren't weren't very likely to add new problems.
So, 3.9.1 is kind of a stabilised build forked from nightlies code in August.
Does that help put things into a sensible time line? I already said I know what's wrong and need @MKleusberg help...  @prutz1311 This should be fixed with the latest commit from master. Can you grab that code and rebuild to check if it's working for you? :smiley: Yes, with a40fe0b it works as expected:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6525383/21654555/03fefa6c-d2c7-11e6-9c2b-8845a98e8b4f.png)
Can we close the issue now? Wow, that was a prompt reply from your side :smiley: Thanks for testing this!
Yep, I'm going to close this issue for now. If any further problems with this or anything else should occur feel free to open a new issue.  Hmmm, I'm kind of thinking the Ctrl-S behaviour might be getting caught by the overall "Save database" (Write Changes) thing.
But, I'm on a break at the moment (back next week), so won't be looking at this properly until then.
Ctrl+{something} is normally linked to a menu option, so is therefore application-wide.  Alt+{something} is normally linked to a visible button/option, so is screen/dialog-wide.  Mind you, we recently did something similar for Ctrl+R (#759) so could be replicated here.  While on the 'Browse Data' tab, Ctrl+S saves changes, but on the 'Execute SQL' tab, it saves the file...
And <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> in `Browse Data` could open up the export table dialog 😉
As @revolter points out, it's definitely possible to add further key combinations to open up the various save dialogs though.
Awesome. :smile:
Both @MKleusberg and I are taking a short break to recharge (back next week), so we'll get to this then.
Are you ok to figure out the Travis CI failure problem until then?
This is travis CI that breaks stuff during pre-build scenario.
Thank you @prutz1311, this should really help. :smile:
@chrisjlocke Any interest in testing out the record deletion speed with tomorrow's nightly build? ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/20630119/0e706270-b327-11e6-9daa-a0d3eed79ca3.png)
Surely can.  @revolter This sounds like it would be of interest to you, if you have the time? :smile:
I remember fixing this (again) after 3.9.1. @chateb, Could you please try out the nightly version?
Indeed, the apostrophe "fixes" this, though I have no idea why 😆  I tested it myself on the latest nightly on macOS and the failing query works.
Awesome @chateb, thanks for letting us know. 😄   That makes sense. :smile:
```
maxVisibleItems : int
This property holds the maximum allowed size on screen of the combo box, measured in items.
By default, this property has a value of 10.
Note: This property is ignored for non-editable comboboxes in styles that returns true for QStyle::SH_ComboBox_Popup such as the Mac style or the Gtk+ Style.
``` Good to know. There's no problem for me. As I said, I like that it's showing full height 😄   Ahh interesting.  Yep, it makes sense we should handle this better. :smile:
These are our nightly builds for OSX:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx/
It sounds like maybe a Windows Update or similar fixed the problem.  At least it's working now.  Oops, that shouldn't happen! 😦
Which version is this happening with?
Cannot replicate this on several Win 10 x64 machines I have at work.  Thats 3.9.1 and the latest nightly.
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest/  Please provide more info. Is this an error message? Does it appear inside DB4S?
I usually get lock errors in my iOS app when I update some rows in DB4S but don't hit save.
Interesting.  Thanks for mentioning it.  Will investigate later on and see whats causing the problem. :smile:
I don't have this problem on my windows 8.1 machine. After associating .db with `DB Browser for SQLite.exe`, I'm able to double-click the database and it will launch the application.
Do you have the time/inclination to try some stuff out to hopefully figure out what's wrong?
Specifically, the process monitor tool pointed at by @chrisjlocke here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/847#issuecomment-256763348
A few comments down from that Chris has an overview screencast, showing how it operates.
That might help track down what's wrong when the spaces are in the path. :smile:
Ahhh, that's interesting.  Looks like you've found the cause. :smile:
With our installer and uninstaller, they don't yet set up any Windows file associations.  It's on our ToDo list for the next release, but until then... yeah, manual approach. :wink:
> HKCU\Software\Classes\Applications\DB Browser for SQLite.exe\shell\open\command, and that looks like the culprit. It has a value of "C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite\3.9.0\bin\DB Browser for SQLite.exe" "%1"
Thats half of it.  In another post somewhere, I suggested a Microsoft tool of ASSOC and FTYPE.  It depends on what .db files are registered as.  If they're registeered as 'big green panties' then it won't be looking at the 'HKCU\Software\Classes\Applications\DB Browser for SQLite.exe' part.  I think the underscores are a new thing, thus the new registry.  You can check this in the registry by looking in HKCR.db (or HKCU\Software\Classes.db, if you've overwridden the default) and check the 'default' value.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/20002829/e5937232-a27a-11e6-9fed-636555362c48.png)
So in my example, I've manually set .db files as 'sqliteDatabase' and then _that_ is registered to DB4S.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/20003847/909aa4ac-a280-11e6-8fdd-d0cb236e34e6.png)
I've got a virtual Win 8 box, I'll try installing 3.9 and upgrading, and seeing if a 'fix' is possible...
That sounds doable.  I think we'd want it to be something enabled in Preferences though, as some people probably wouldn't want it.  eg when the default value generates a new unique key or something, it could cause problems for people just wanting to view the data and no change things
I see DB4S as a development tool, rather than a 'user entry' system, as it can cause so much damage.  Hand it to a user to input records and they go, "I didn't know what those extra tables were for, so deleted them."  This (or similar) has actually happened at work.  That 'clang' sound you heard was my chin hitting the floor when I found out...
Anyway.  I digress.  Knocking up a simple program to do what you want (ie, just log athletes) would be far simpler, safer and quicker to impliment than to use DB4S for data entry in a 'production' (albeit trackside!) environment.
Just my thoughts, anyway...
Well, the Browse Data tab does lend itself to data entry pretty well too.  It's not an unusual use case. :smile:

This error message comes from sqlite when you are trying to empty a primary key cell (https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/b5345fe6766d1c6ed3457f3d89a78a9a62b7bb81/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L988). Should we notify sqlite developers?

```
```c
/* issue859.c */
#include <sqlite3.h>

Thanks for the detailed analysis, @prutz1311! This helps a lot! :+1: There's probably no need to ask the SQLite developers, it kind of makes sense now. The column is a ```INTEGER PRIMARY KEY``` and we're trying to set it to an empty string. Usually SQLite (more or less) ignores the data type of a field but when they've built an primary key index for this column assuming it's an integer data type it only makes sense to not allow empty strings.
I've just pushed a workaround that checks for all cases in which we're trying to set an integer primary key field to an empty string, and sets the field to '0' instead. Of course you can only do this when there is no row with an ID of 0 yet.
Does this work for you, @revolter and @prutz1311? :smiley: It seems like the actual data type doesn't matter, e.g. you can insert this value:
```c
const char * value = "99";
```
and it will proceed just fine (an integer gets inserted).
I will check your commit later, have to go now. I think the variable type in C doesn't matter for SQLite. If it's convertible to an integer it is treated as an integer, even though in C it's a char*. There is also `int sqlite3_bind_int(sqlite3_stmt*, int, int)` and some others https://sqlite.org/c3ref/bind_blob.html.
Now (fd1f4f2) if I press <kbd>backspace</kbd>, the value changes to zero:

But if I press <kbd>backspace</kbd> the second time on another cell, I see another error:
> Error changing data:
> UNIQUE constraint failed: A.A_id

It would be great if you could undo a delete or insert. And redo if you changed your mind.

You'd literally need a copy of the database ... and some databases are huge!  if I deleted 10,000 rows, while that statement is instant, I wouldn't want DB4S to then 'import' those records in some temporary database on the off-chance I would want to undelete... surely thats the purpose of the 'Commit Changes' button - its a 'yup, I'm happy with that' button.  If I deleted 10,000 rows and only meant 1, then I'd press the 'Revert Changes'...
Maybe I'm just paranoid, but if I'm going to be doing dabbling on a database, I make sure I have a backup first.
Also, if you delete a record and the database has gubbins to delete child records (linked tables), how would you put these records back if you pressed 'Undo' - as DB4S technically doesn't know anything about them - it just knows the record(s) you deleted.
Yeah, thinking about this particular case I'm not sure how it could be implemented in a thorough way.
Any query which modifies data in non-trivial ways would probably be very challenging to automatically reverse. :smile:
Well, Qt offer some undo stack classes which we could use. So having a undo/redo feature for the Browse Data tab would be do-able, even without copying the entire database. However, when the user modifies the same table using the Execute SQL tab, another instance of DB4S, or another program we'd end up in a complete mess.
Maybe a compromise would be to add a way to add savepoints manually and offer a way to revert to one of them.
I briefly thought about this (without taking into consideration all the implications) while mistakenly entering data in the wrong cell and had to close the database without saving and open it again, instead of a quick <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>z</kbd>. We could wait until more people ask for this if we want to support it partially as @MKleusberg said.

When I select all the records in a big (~ 4000) table with <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> and hit the `Delete Record` (which should say `Delete Records` to be clear that it would delete multiple records) button, DB4S hangs for quite some time.
Firstly, if it really takes this long, it should show a progress bar.
Secondly, it would make sense to run `DELETE FROM table` if we notice that the user selected all the records, which would run very fast, instead of running one `DELETE` per record.
Also, wouldn't a transaction help?

At first thought, yeah, that sounds like it would work.  At least for rowid tables anyway.
Want to submit a PR? :smile:
It looks like that method is called for each row [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/1ced89779353346548d2e71d8eb58dc4d278f1ca/src/sqlitetablemodel.cpp#L415), so maybe this is where the IDs array should be created and passed to a new method that builds the correct query.
Can't we use the [`removeRows`][1] method instead?
[1]: http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qabstractitemmodel.html#removeRows @revolter Would you have time to see if this is working decently in the nightlies?  @innermous updated the deletion code to use `removeRows`, so in theory it should be ok now. :smile:  OSX is unlikely to ever get FTS4 support, as we already include FTS5 support and they seem to be mutually exclusive. 😦
It's not super hard to build it with FTS4 instead of FTS5, if you really need it. (as per the issue you pointed out)
On a side note, I didn't realise our Windows builds include FTS4.  I'm not specifically doing anything there to include it... maybe it's getting pulled in as a side effect from something else (SQLCipher?).
Hmmm, I'm not seeing FTS4 in there.  FTS3 and FTS5 yep, not 4:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/blob/master/Makefile#L67-L69
Am I being blind? :smile:
Cool, that looks pretty simple then. :smile:
Any interest in sending a Pull Request to the Homebrew team, adding those two options to the line here?
- https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/688ee73bdff427227632b4dfaeb9463da873c041/Formula/sqlcipher.rb#L31
When DB4S gets built, we pull in SQLCipher via the Homebrew package.  Getting it added there means automatic support. 😀
Excellent. Once that's merged, our nightly builds should automatically pick it up too, if that helps. :smile:
In theory, it should be automatically included in our nightly builds at this point.
Do you have a few minutes to try one of the recently ones out to verify? :smile: Awesome @compengi, thanks for putting the effort in for this, and keeping on top of it through to completion. :smile:  Ahhh, this seems to be specific to Sierra.  We've had a few reports of this, but haven't yet tracked down what's causing it. 😦
Actually, I'm going to close this as it's a duplicate of #737.  So, probably best to keep an eye on progress there.  @esilverberg Ahhh, it's probably the default newline setting it set to blank in the Export dialog.
Would you be ok to try the export again, and double check the newline is set to "Windows" ?
For reference: #842 :wink:
You're welcome. :smile:
Ahhh, interesting.  From memory this was fixed shortly after the 3.9.1 release.
Would you be ok to try out one of the nightly builds?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org
@MarrinerDev Did you have a chance to try the nightly builds? :smile:
Wow, I didn't even know about the "Browse Table" option! 😲
Also, I don't think adding duplicates to the milestone would help much. It looks like #748 is the first one, followed by #757, #784, #849 and #873. Awesome, thanks Michael. :smile:  Ouch, that doesn't sound good. 😦
Does it happen even when you save using a project file?
1. Open database
3. **File** → **Save Project** (then pick a filename to save as)
![screen shot 2016-10-27 at 12 21 06](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/19765373/e8e53d30-9c3f-11e6-8b1c-3fdcfb6f13ba.png)
4. Close the database
5. **File** → **Open Project**
![screen shot 2016-10-27 at 12 22 01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/19765385/0348c728-9c40-11e6-9399-c23a4d7bf31d.png)
In theory, settings are supposed to be saved ok when using project files.  They're a way to wrap "meta" information about a database in a safe way.
But, it's definitely possible that's not working properly for this. 😦
As a first thought: is the check box in View -> Preferences, Database, Foreign keys checked or unchecked? That's odd. You said it's also ignoring the pragma after manually turning it on. I assume you did click the Save button at the bottom of the window? Sounds like a stupid question but I sometimes forget that button :wink: If you're sure you saved the modified pragma settings. it seems like we have a general problem with foreign keys in your case. Not sure yet what to do then :smiley: I did some further research: you can't edit the foreign keys pragma inside a transaction (https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_foreign_keys). That makes it impossible to set that pragma from inside the SQL editor. Also, unlike other pragmas, it is not stored in the database file but must be set again each time a new connection is built (https://stackoverflow.com/a/15303742). This makes it impossible to set the foreign keys pragma in the Pragma editor and expect it to stay with that value. That's pretty stupid but we can't do much about that :frowning:
The only question is why the the check box in the Preferences dialog doesn't work for you. However, I've just changed the settings handling a bit, so tomorrow's nightly build might be worth checking out. Can you give that a try? :smiley: If it's really needed to kept, we could store that pragma setting in the (per database) project file. Just added the foreign keys settings to the project file :smiley: I think that's all we can do at the moment. Awesome. :smile:
@tomcumming Would you have time to try out the nightly build (tomorrow), and check that the pragma setting works for you when the database is saved & loaded via project file? No worries, was a thought. :smile: Oops.  Sorry, wrong button. :wink:
@tomcumming Our automatic nightlies get built for OSX too if that helps?  Thanks for reporting this. :smile:
Not sure we'll be be able to look into this properly in the near future though. `ntdll.dll` seems to be Windows "catch all" kind of error thing, not really giving any useful detail.
As a thought, would you be ok to try these two nightly builds and see if either doesn't crash?
- https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-2016-10-26-win64.exe
- https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-sqlcipher-2016-10-26-win64.exe
The first one is a build with only SQLite support, not SQLCipher.  If that one doesn't crash, but the 2nd one does, at least that narrows things down. :smile:
It would be worth seeing if it does it in safe mode.  Aditionally, you could also test for the problem when logged on as another user (which you may need to create for testing purposes).
I run DB4S on a Win 10 64bit machine at work and have never had this issue.  :(
Hmmm, ok the next thing to try would be grabbing dependency walker and running that on the installed exe you're launching:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://dependencywalker.com/
Note - The website for Dependency Walker looks like it was written in the 1980's... the tool itself though is fine, so don't get stressed by the website. :smile:
The tool itself is helpful for showing .dll problems.  Here's a screenshot from when I was looking into a problem a while ago:
![dependency_walker01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/19777975/92d06c16-9c72-11e6-8f68-60891f6a713d.png)
In your case the crash kind of sounds like a .dll problem, so I'm thinking it might be the right tool to investigate with. :smile:
Interesting, sounds like we're making progress. :smile:
It seems like there's something missing on your system then.  If you have time, try to find out which Microsoft (or Qt) package includes them, and get that installed on your system.
It's really weird this is happening though, as the dependencies are supposed to be automatically installed already. 😦
Hmmm... what happens if you manually run the vc_redist*.exe file?  It should be in a subdirectory of the DB4S installation.  If that gives an error, it might help explain what's going wrong. :smile:
@chrisjlocke Any idea about the API-MS-WIN-CORE-SYNCH thing shown in the screenshot.  Searching online shows an informational MS page about Windows "API Sets", but not sure how (if) it's relevant here.
Ok, well that's one possibility ruled out. :smile:
Microsoft (was SysInternals) do a process monitor tool.
https://download.sysinternals.com/files/ProcessMonitor.zip
Its comprehensive, but a bit confusing.  I'll have to do a screencast tomorrow, if you want to go down that route.  The beauty of that program is that it shows all the files Windows has tried to run but failed.
I'll try and run DB4S on as 'basic' Win 10 machine I've got to try and replicate the issue.
Awesome @chrisjlocke, that Sysinternals tool does sound useful.
If this works for finding a solution, we can probably use these tools for investigating future windows crash problems too. :smile:
OK, so heres a quick screencast of the MS Process Monitor.  As shown, its 'noisy' and monitors everything, but I think at this stage, you only need to monitor file activity, so I've shown how to toggle the other buttons off.  At the bottom of the screencast is a CC button to turn on captions.  They don't work too well, and are distracting (by the time you've read them, the screen has moved on) so you might need to watch it more than once!
http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cD6uQyjHkL
Alternatively, if you're brave, you could install Teamviewer and I could remotely control your machine and have a look, but I can understadn the fear of some unknown having access to yuur machine...
Excellent, that looks really useful for debugging this kind of thing. :smile:
Not sure why (will have to test on another machine) but when I click the 'New Database', a squillion read requests are made.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/19857866/3dd5bea2-9f77-11e6-9642-4a7ce81ca539.png)
Haven't found a machine at work that DB4S crashes on yet...
As part of our 'install' for every machine, we put on .NET Framework.  Just as a test (or confirmation) do you have any .Net frameworks installed?
@softdev2016 Any luck with this? :smile:
No worries, we definitely all get too-busy sometimes. :wink:
@chrisjlocke Those read requests are probably for the 'Save file as' dialog, maybe some recently opened files or places. So that should be all fine. But other than that I'm afraid I can't say anything on this issue :/
That's an interesting observation, @ibinshoid! :smiley: We've recently moved to Qt5-only, so it's worth trying again with the latest code and using Qt5. Closing this due to lack of response. 😦   Thanks @bssthu. :smile:
@MKleusberg Do you have time to look at this?
Thank you, @bssthu! Good work spotting this issue and thank you so much for even providing the proper fix :+1: If you should ever feel like fixing some more bugs you're very welcome to open more PRs :wink:
### Details for the issue
<!--
Thanks for coming here to report an issue. :)
Please describe it in this section, fill out the correct check boxes
below with an "x", then click the "Submit new issue" button at the bottom
-->
Testing the export of a database table issue on Windows, and noticed I can't get quotes around field contents with spaces in.  Have tried both quote options, and the 'Other'.  Nothing.
http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cD6T6ijEHX
Tried 3.9.1 and the latest nightly.  In my experiments with options, it did do quotes once, even putting quotes round fields that didn't need it.  I couldn't reproduce that though, so unsure if something is screwy somewhere.
Edit: Just filling in the info below, and noted I'm using the 64bit version.  Unsure if it'll make a difference, but will try on the 32bit version too.
### Useful extra information

Oh, interesting.  Something doesn't seem correct there.
It'd be really useful for us to add some kind of automatic testing for this to catch regressions.  Not sure how to achieve it though.
32bit was the same, and on a different computer, so its not just me... ;)
Haven't tried older versions to pick out where it went wrong.  I'm sure it used to work...
Looked (briefly) through the code, but without debug info, its hard to find out whats going on .... it _should_ work.  Guess I'll add some...
Interesting thought. :smile:
Thinking about this more, it sounds like Chris wants an option to "quote all fields", even if the quotes are not strictly needed.
Hmmm... trying to think of a use for that though... not sure what it would be useful for? :smile:
Aah, might just be me then.  I was under the mis-conception that fields with spaces in would need quoting (not just escaping quote characters).  Thats why 'A' would not need quoting, but 'A A' would.  I must just be having a brain fart then.  I'll close this then, and revisit it if its an issue.  😄
Cool. :smile:
Some initial thoughts from my point of view: :smile:
1. **I was looking to see whether the intrinsic JSON1 extension could be turned on by default in the nightly builds _(at least the Windows version)_ of SqliteBrowser**?
Yep, this would be welcome.  The current build process we use for Windows (via MSVC) is - as you said - overly complicated.  Having any kind of reliance on MSVC isn't something I personally like either. ;)
The only thing which has stopped us from adding in the JSON1 support on Windows by default... is lack of time to try it compiling it in.
If you have the time & desire to work out what we need to do - eg extra commands/steps to run - in our build process, we'll definitely try it out and likely adopt them wholesale. :smile:
2. **Would it make sense to enable seamless `make` of SqliteBrowser _(on any platform, but especially Windows)_ using `clang` as a supported _(possibly-default)_ choice for a fully cross-platform compiler build tool for SqliteBrowser**?
Any (good quality) alternative to MSVC would be warmly welcomed. Our OSX builds already use clang, as that's what Apple's Xcode comes with.
On Windows, we use CMake to generate MSVC "solution / project" files.  These can then be either used interactively via MSVC, or compiled in batch fashion using `devenv`.  One example is our [nightly Windows builds batch file](https://gist.github.com/justinclift/11cc926f214e882c8162f97c53929c07).
CMake can be told to generate Makefiles and similar, so it might be quite possible to get things working with a native Clang install.
If you have the time & desire to figure that out, we can definitely try building that way.
Personally, I'd be only too happy to completely remove MSVC from our requirements list, and completely remove it from our documentation. :smile:
Note - In both instances above the "If you have the time & desired to..." bit. That's because we're volunteer based, so the things that get done are whatever people put time into.  You're absolutely welcome to join in and attack things of interest. 😁
Same for the side note - hosting related extensions could be done - it needs someone with the interest & desire to make it happen though.  If that's you, then great.  If not, then maybe someone else will.
Cool!
Personally, I'm travelling at the moment, with only a Linux laptop.  No access to my normal development stuff.  I'll be back Friday evening/night, so should be able to get to this properly on the weekend or Monday. :smile:
They'll be in the next major Windows releases too. :smile:  Awesome @bssthu, it's now perfect. :smile:
For reference, these are the changed strings in operation:

Is it ok if we contact you when we are near to our next major release?
We will probably make a few string changes between now and then, and it would be great to have everything 100% translated at release time. :smile:
Awesome. :smile:
Thanks @bssthu, I'll get the screenshots done in a bit, so you can double check before we merge this. :smile:
This is every screenshot I could think of. :wink:
To me, this looks very good.  If you feel it is ready, I'm happy to merge this.  Just let me know. :smile:

Hmmm, I'll merge this in now instead.
That will mean the nightly build in a few hours will have the updated translation, so you can test them directly if you want. :smile:
If there are further adjustments to make, just put them in a new PR. :smile:
The 'Write Changes' and 'Revert Changes' button don't have the proper translations ... is this v3.9?  Thought (sorry ... assumed) all translations for the UI had been completed...
Can't reproduce it in HEAD revision.
Try nightly version. In such situations you should always try nightly versions.
@chrisjlocke We didn't receive updated translations for either of the Chinese locales in time for 3.9.x. 😦
The "simplified Chinese" translation is being updated for the master branch in #840, so the nightlies should see some improvement there soon. :smile:
Can you see chrisjlocke.co.uk?  I can duplicate them there for you.  Alternatively, I can email the latest over - they are approx 14 MB... so some email systems might baulk at that size.  Or I can lob some up at wetransfer.com...
Excellent.  I've copied the 32 and 64bit versions (of both types ... normal SQLite and SQLCipher) to my site.

Hope it works! 😄
Awesome, thanks Chris. :smile:
It's interesting that our nightlies server is probably being blocked by the GFW.  It's running from my old personal VM in Linode, as I hadn't moved it to Rackspace.
I'll create a new VM in Rackspace, and lets see if that gets blocked or something too.
Edit: Thats boring.  "Great Firewall".  Prefer furry wombles...
:wink:
GFW == Great Firewall. The name commonly given to China's national-level firewall implementation.
Does this link work for you?

Awesome. :smile:
Yep, sounds useful. :smile:
### Details for the issue
<!--
Thanks for coming here to report an issue. :)
Please describe it in this section, fill out the correct check boxes
below with an "x", then click the "Submit new issue" button at the bottom
-->
Using the latest nightly.  Created a database fine.  However, if I edit a table and click 'Write Changes', an error is displayed.
Interestingly, the changes **are** saved.  Closing the database and re-opening it contains the modifications made.

### Useful extra information
<!-- The info below often helps, please fill it out if you're able to. :) -->
#### I'm opening this issue because:
- [ ] DB4S is crashing
- [ ] DB4S has a bug
- [ ] DB4S needs a feature
- [x] DB4S has another problem
#### I'm using DB4S on:
- [x] Windows: ( _version:_ _10 (64bit)__ )
- [ ] Linux: ( _distro:_ ___ )
- [ ] Mac OS: ( _version:_ ___ )
- [ ] Other: ___
#### I'm using DB4S version:
- [ ] 3.9.1
- [ ] 3.9.0
- [x] Other: _3.9.99 (64bit)__
#### I have also:
- [x] Tried out the nightly version: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser#windows
- [ ] Searched for an existing similar issue: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20
Interesting.  Sounds like a side effect of https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/e76e5b3241af5e79474ae32fda393da921696d96.
@MKleusberg Probably of interest to you? :smile:
Just an additional note too that clicking 'Close Database' and selecting 'Yes' to the 'Do you want to save changes?' doesn't display an error.  I guess that means that way of closing a database either isn't saving the savepoints like the 'Write Changes' button, or if it is, its not displaying any errors...
V3.9.99 means it's a nightly build. What's the date of this version (file modified date)
Have you tried one of the latest nightlies?  Hmmm, looking at the testing ppa listing:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser
It seems to be saying the last build was 2016-08-24.
@NicoDupont You may need to attempt building from source yourself.  It should go fine, but if it doesn't then cut-n-paste any error message here and we'll probably be able to help. :smile: Oops, no.  I was looking at the "stable" one.  The testing one says it's last build was an hour ago:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser-testing
This might still be a bug we need to look into then. @NicoDupont Does the error occur for often / all the time, or just sometimes, or ?  If it happens often, is there a way to reliably trigger it? @NicoDupont Interesting.  That's an error message we - in theory - fixed a while ago.
I'll take some time this week to go through our Linux compiling instructions and update them, so you can then try compiling things yourself.  It should be pretty simple, once I've done the update. I'll close this issue because it has been solved by @prutz1311 and @innermous a while ago. The Ubuntu problem reported by @NicoDupont seems to be fixed, too. See issue #1008.
If it turns out to be still an issue, feel free to reopen the issue :smiley:  @bssthu Thanks, I'll get to this in a few hours, and take screenshots so you can double check things are ok. :smile:
Lots of screenshots, with your updated translation included. :smile:
There are still a few places with English strings showing.  Are you interested in getting those done too?

Any chance of a copy of the database?  I've a database of 500,000+ rows, and recently had to export, and didn't have any issues...
Also, any chance of a copy of the file exported?
I can test with a test database, but if you're having issues, it would be handy to use the same database you're using, in case its something specific with the data.  You can email it to me, and I can confirm the database will be deleted after testing.
A quick export of 229,000+ rows worked fine.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/19466458/ed08b89a-9502-11e6-8844-b6139dbe83bb.png)
And exporting a table (as opposed to exporting a database)
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/19467598/ea7b10e4-9509-11e6-829c-6101521152f7.png)
Noticed there was an unnecessary blank line at the end, but certainly not 'unreadable'.
whyaintthisworking@chrisjlocke.co.uk is great.  If you can send over the results you got too, that would be handy.... the CSV with goo in it.
Oh, and while there is probably only one way of doing it, the steps you performed to create the gooey CSV would also be handy.  😄
CSV file received.  Issue 'solved'.
The CSV file has no carriage returns in it, so all the fields are on one line.
When you export, try setting the 'new line characters' to the Windows option.  I assume this setting is currently blank?
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/19492198/a4cf9952-956d-11e6-821a-272275f1dd9f.png)
If no option is set for the quote character, then a NUL character is used.  This is the 'unreadable' characters you see in the final CSV.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/19492420/8019cfc8-956e-11e6-864d-cdcbc05ad1d6.png)
So in summary, use these options.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/19492441/942b34de-956e-11e6-8da2-3b95646b38f6.png)
A quote character as a .... well, quote character, and CRLF (carriage returns and line feeds) for new line characters.  It'll work wonders! 😄
Let us know how you get on.  👍
Ahhh, this makes the third bug report for that same problem then.
@chrisjlocke Do you reckon we should change the default on Windows? (it's pretty easy to do)
Yes, I would suggest so.  It appears this option is getting missed.  I would change the quote option (NUL characters isn't helpful - quote characters are more 'traditional') and the newline characters.  Added the 'enhancement' label...
@Latorrer have you had a moment to verify the approach suggested by @chrisjlocke works?
Thanks @Latorrer. :smile:
Good stuff @chrisjlocke, well done. 😀
Thanks Lev, we'll look into it. :smile:
Sorry for the delay, @leventelist! Can you try again using the latest version from master? This should work now:
```
make
make install
``` @leventelist As a thought, it's probably a good idea to install Qt 5.7 from the Qt.io download site too, then complie DB4S using Qt Creator that comes with that.
I've been trying things out on Ubuntu 16.04 today, to investigate a few of the issues reported over time.  It turns out that Qt versions older than Qt 5.7 have some weird problems. 😦
Qt 5.7 though seems fine. :smile:  Sort of. :smile:
When you install Qt 5.7 (eg in ~/Qt by default), it comes with it's own version of `qmake`. eg somewhere under ~/Qt/5.7/
If you run that version of qmake, it's supposed to automatically choose the correct Qt 5.7 versions of bits instead of the older ones.
Hmmm, as a temporary thing which might be helpful, I took a bunch of screenshots earlier today of the Qt install + compile process, but on Ubuntu 16.04. I haven't yet renamed them into sensible things + added good description, but if you follow the sequence by timestamp it be pretty self explanatory:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/db4s-screenshots/tree/master/wiki/ubuntu_16.04
With the Qt version... it just needs to be version 5.7 or later.  Thinking about it now, you might as well pick the latest one (5.8), as there's probably useful extra bug fixes in that anyway.  The screenshots are for 5.8 too anyway.  But, up to you. :smile: Thanks Lev. :smile:
I'm working through some `qmake` stuff at the moment, and yeah our CMake setup turns out to be more complete for Linux.
When CMake is used it puts the icon file, metadata, etc in the right places.  But our Qmake install doesn't.  I'm looking into it now, but it might take a few more days of mucking around with until it's correct. :smile:
I doubt either CMake nor Qmake will detect missing dependencies up front though.  It's normally the kind of thing which a configuration file does (eg ./configure, which we don't have)... or the end user when the compile busts. 😁  No worries Lev, thanks. :smile:  It's been pointed out in private email that CMake is broken for our 3.9.1 tarball builds, while qmake still works fine.
We might as well update the Linux compile instructions in BUILDING.md for Qt5 and qmake.
Getting this done will probably address #803 too.
Ahhh, interesting.  We're just about to switch to Qt5-only, so we'd better get that fixed sooner rather than later. :smile:
Cool, no worries at all. :smile:
I got things to compile on Ubuntu MATE 16.10 yesterday using these steps:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/920#issuecomment-270742689
Maybe I should spin up a VM and go through the steps again... 😁  Cool.  I still have the VM, so I'll try it out now. :smile: k, just updated the VM I was using yesterday with our very latest source code.
It compiled without issue, so that's good news.
I'm downloading Kubuntu 16.0.4.1 now.  I'll put that in a VM and try out the steps from yesterday on it, and see if I can figure out a proper build process for updating our instructions with. :smile: Kubuntu looks interesting.  I've not tried KDE in many years (since 3.x?), so this seems like a very polished experience.  Looks like the KDE development Community has gone in a good direction (unlike my personal opinion of the Gnome direction). :wink: Yep, the existing (CMake) build instructions are failing for me in a new Kubuntu 16.0.4.1 VM:

Next step, try with qmake instead. Same message with the version of qmake installed from the Kubuntu repos.  The error line in the message seems to be:

I'll try with the latest Qt (from qt.io), and see if that makes a difference. Looks like this function is missing: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qvector.html#qHash
The documentation says it's introduced in Qt 5.6, so I assume Kubuntu 16.04 ships an older version? Yep, seems to be Qt 5.5.1. @MKleusberg What do you reckon the right approach here is?  Should we declare ourselves to be Qt 5.6 (and above) only, or should we consider alternative approaches to making the code work with older Qt5?
I'm kind of thinking Qt 5.6 and above is probably ok.  The existing "long life" distributions (eg *buntu LTS, CentOS/RHEL) will be providing older builds of DB4S anyway.  Anyone wanting to build the latest code can *probably* download Qt ok. (?) Well, this is interesting.  It's impossible to download the Qt 5.7.1 release *without* getting Qt Creator forcibly installed as well.
Haven't managed to get it compiling from the command line though, and I need to move onto some other stuff.
Are you ok to try the newer Qt approach? I think Kubuntu 16.04 uses Qt 5.5, correct?
In this case we could try this:
1) Open ```src/sqlitetypes.h```
2) After line 9 (```#include <QVector>```) add a new, empty line and insert this:
```c++
template <typename T>
uint qHash(const QVector<T> &key, uint seed = 0)
Q_DECL_NOEXCEPT_EXPR(noexcept(qHashRange(key.cbegin(), key.cend(), seed)))
{
return qHashRange(key.cbegin(), key.cend(), seed);
}
```
3) Try to recompile. Does it compile now? If yes, are table constraints working? If not, has the error message changed?
Maybe we can add this one function and get the minimum Qt version required down to 5.5. Just added a comment about Qt 5.6 and C++11 to the BUILDING.md file :smiley:
@justinclift What do you reckon, can we leave it like this? Or do we need to suggest using qmake instead of cmake as well? I'm not entirely sure if cmake is still broken and/or on what systems it's broken. Oops.  Just added this to my ToDo list for investigating this week.
I'll try it out probably Saturday and see if we can make it work with Qt 5.5. :smile: @frispete Yeah, it's a right PITA at the moment. :wink:
As a thought, have you tried building from our master branch instead of the tarball?  Some of the problems should be fixed there, though not all. 😦  @frispete No argument here.  We [changed the project name in CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/2957974974bb874b0219e52d63c198658c02f686) when we realised the scope of the problem.  It's now only "DB Browser for SQLite" for the OS's which have a need for that (OSX and Windows).
On OSX it's still a bit tricky, as there are two distinct use cases for it:
1. Launch via the GUI ("DB Browser for SQLite" is appropriate there)
2. Launch from the command line ("sqlitebrowser would be better there")
We don't have that fixed properly yet either.  We're only really catering to 1. above at present. ☹️  @MKleusberg @innermous Any interest in getting the system provided QScintilla picked up?
I rarely use Linux (more into OSX, BSD), so it's not something I personally care about atm. :smile: @justinclift I hate that cmake file. But I will have a look at it, maybe even this evening.
So it's a deal, @frispete :wink: Ugh, the libscintilla2-dev package in Debian (and Ubuntu) is still built against Qt4. So unfortunately I can't test this that easily.
@frispete I've just pushed a largely untested commit which *might* work on openSUSE. Feel free to give it a try :smiley: @frispete Added some notes for compiling DB4S on OpenSuSE Leap 42.2 and Tumbleweed:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Notes-for-compiling-on-OpenSuSE
Only tried with CMake so far.  As @MKleusberg points out, the QScintilla provided by the system isn't functional (for us).  So, even though we can point the compile at it, and it finishes without error... the result segfaults immediately on launch:
```
$ /usr/local/bin/sqlitebrowser
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
```
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
The resulting executable compiled from that works fine.  Tested just now.
Any idea if OpenSuSE is likely to provide a Qt5 version of QScintilla? :smile: @MKleusberg Your [suggested patch to sqlitetypes.h](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/832#issuecomment-271159422) works, and lets DB4S build on Ubuntu 16.04.2 again.
Made a proper commit out of it [here](https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/commit/c6fbb84773dc11bcc6a60d5e6d67f645068abe0b).
If that patch is your creation and you're happy with it, should we pull it across it across to master "as is"?  If it's a cut-n-paste from the Qt source though, we should at least change it a bit first to avoid licensing problems. :wink: An alternative that seems to work is installing Qt 5.6 through this PPA first:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://launchpad.net/~ci-train-ppa-service/+archive/ubuntu/stable-phone-overlay
Compiling DB4S works after that, without the above patch.
If the patch approach is workable though, it's probably better as that'd also give us slightly wider compatibility in general (Qt 5.5). @justinclift Hmm, not much to change in these few lines ^^ I've changed the commit to include an ```#if``` in order to not break the build for anybody using Qt 5.6 or later and pushed it to master. If there aren't any more problems, building on Qt 5.5 should work now. Awesome. :smile:  At present, our Windows nightly builds aren't signed.  Mostly because I wasn't aware of a way to do it automatically. :wink:
StartCom support have emailed through some links with information on how it can be done:

It's not urgent, but would be a good thing to get happening.
Are you sure the _records_ are getting sorted, and not just the _view_ of them? I think in the newer version, the rowid is sorted descending, so newer records are at the top of the list.
Records are not 'sorted' per se, but have a rowid column. Unless this is an auto increment field, rowids will get reused.
It should be pretty easy to make this work for you though. :smile:
With SQL databases, you control the order of rows using an "ORDER BY" statement in your SQL query:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_orderby.asp
With your application, what is the SQL query you are using at the moment?  We can probably suggest how to adjust it, so the order is how you want. :smile:
There was a question recently on the sqlite mailing list that mentioned sorting, and someone wanted to specifically insert a record between two rowids, so 'shuffle down' the other rowids.  Thats not what the rowid column is for.  So this was a good explanation:
> You see, in the relational database model there is no such things as "records".  What you have above (a table) consists of a "bag of tuples".  There is no order to them.  They are merely a "bag" (known mathematically as a set).  When you issue a query (SELECT) you project sets and conditions and obtain a set of data as a result (another bag of data).
>
> If you wish an order, you tell it what order to put it in (using an ORDER BY clause).  Due to the inherently sequential nature of modern computing technology most programming languages are unable to deal with the data in its native form (a set) and therefore you retrieve and work on them one after each, in forward order only, in the order you requested presentation using the ORDER BY clause.
>
> The "integer primary key" (whether you use autoincrement of not) is simply a unique key in each record that is derived sequentially (unless you provide it) based on the previous (or biggest ever previously used, if you use autoincrement) number in that field, to uniquely identify the contents of that tuple.  It does not contain any useful information which you should be manipulating in any way other than using it as a linkage to perhaps other related tuples in other tables.
@justinclift i think he means db sctructure tab.
Hmmm, that's possible too. :wink:
You will probably need to update the SQL query to be:
```
Select * from adapter ORDER BY something_goes_here;
```
The **something_goes_here** is a new column, with a row number in it, so that the order is always given in the row number.  Kind of like this:
| something_goes_here | field1 | field2 | field3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | stu | vwx | yz1 |
Does that make sense?
By the way, pick a better column name than "something_goes_here". :smile:
The problem is that SQL databases _never_ guarantee an order for their results without being told to (eg using ORDER BY).  SQL databases aren't really a spreadsheet, even though they can look like it at first.
With SQL, you really, really, really need to know how to grab the exact bit of data you want.  Using a row order like a spreadsheet is kind of um... playing with fire?
@rvalk As an alternative approach, instead of using an order like the above example... do each of your configuration lines have a unique name or something?
Ahhh.  Yeah.  It sounds like adding an index will probably be the best idea then. :smile:
Thanks @rvalk. :smile:
Both of those issues were definitely fixed... Now they're popping again.
**UPD**:
> Also when I switching through the tabs, the table that I selected in "Browse Data" tab suddenly relocated to the first table of the db.
It works fine since gbeff43a revision. Happy hacking!
Hi @roxx
If you download the latest 'night;y' build of DB4S:
these issues should be fixed in that version.... theoretically....
@chrisjlocke they are not.
> If I want to browse the data which I select from "Database Structure Tab"
> It opens the first table of the database, not the one I selected.
This was working couple months ago, after some of @MKleusberg 's commits. Real question is what was that commit exactly.
> @chrisjlocke they are not.
Aah, sorry.
> Also when I switching through the tabs, the table that I selected in "Browse Data" tab suddenly relocated to the first table of the db.
This doesn't occur in the latest nightly.
Yeah, it doesn't. But I am talking about another bug he mentioned. He mentioned 2 bugs.
Yup, got that. Just reporting my findings... :smile:
Isn't this the same as #879, which is caused by #748? @revolter Sounds like it.  The carriage return isn't set automatically for us Windows users... I presume you've found that option now! :smile:
@chrisjlocke Should we change this default for Windows users?
I think it's just making the option more prominent. If have to check on a fresh install, but I think the option is blank, which doesn't help, so it's easy to miss.
No worries.  It should be pretty trivial to change the default for Windows. :smile:
If it does turn out to be needed, file an issue and someone can probably get it done pretty quickly.
### Details for the issue
<!--
Thanks for coming here to report an issue. :)
Please describe it in this section, fill out the correct check boxes
below with an "x", then click the "Submit new issue" button at the bottom
-->
I had a database with a 'database image is malformed' as my application crashed during importing.  DB4S was able to create an export of the database.  Back in DB4S and I clicked **New Database** and **Import Database from SQL**.  So far, for a 80 MB SQL file (approx 501,000 lines) its taken an hour and its on 2%.  CPU for DB4S is approx 26%, but the disk is chuggin' away.
Edit: Cancelled it.  It had done 20,000 rows in that hour.
Edit 2: Just pasted the 80 MB SQL file in the 'Execute SQL' tab, and now regret that decision.  Thats worse than the import (wondered if the Execute SQL would obey the 'BEGIN' and 'COMMIT' transaction but don't think it will...) as its now got no progress.
If anyone wants to experiment, the 80 MB .SQL file is here:
https://we.tl/sTRssetyAB
(link will expire in one week... will upload it somewhere else by then)
This links to issue #568 and was first 'identified' in that, but todays 'experience' has reminded me to open another issue about it...
### Useful extra information
<!-- The info below often helps, please fill it out if you're able to. :) -->
#### I'm opening this issue because:
- [ ] DB4S is crashing
- [ ] DB4S has a bug
- [ ] DB4S needs a feature
- [x] DB4S has another problem
#### I'm using DB4S on:
- [x] Windows: ( _version:_8 and 10 ___ )
- [ ] Linux: ( _distro:_ ___ )
- [ ] Mac OS: ( _version:_ ___ )
- [ ] Other: ___
#### I'm using DB4S version:
- [ ] 3.9.1
- [x] 3.9.0
- [ ] Other: ___
#### I have also:
- [x] Tried out the nightly version: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser#windows
- [x] Searched for an existing similar issue: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20
This might be a good way for us to experiment with profiling stuff for DB4S.
If it turns out the problem bits are in our code, instead of in SQLite/SQLCipher, then it's something we could probably affect.
With PostgreSQL, performance for things like this can be hugely changed by adjusting buffers and some PostgreSQL settings prior to an initial import.  There might be similar things we can do for SQLite/SQLCipher, as this performance problem has been mentioned multiple times before.  It's probably a good thing for us to get fixed. :smile:
I'll knock up my own VB app pumping this stuff into a database, comparing one transaction to a series of transactions.  Its mentioned that a series of inserts without a transaction is effectively a series of individual transactions, which is extremely costly, performance-wise.
OK, so while adding records into my 'bloat' database to help tinker with another issue, I tweaked it to add 'test' into a database.  My program can import about 10 records a second.  Disk IO is also quite high, as its committing each insert to disk each time.  It'll take 8 to 10 minutes (and a new hard drive...) to import 5000 records.  While there is one connection, it is creating a new 'transaction' (simply an insert statement) for each record.  To clarify for the avoidance of doubt, I am not using BEGIN/COMMIT around the insertion of this one record.
After wrapping the whole routine of importing 5000 records in a BEGIN and COMMIT, the initial insert of 5000 records takes 4 seconds and approx 3 seconds of a disk splurge at the end to commit the data.
From this experiment, I can conclude the import from DB4S is not using transactions.
I'll amend my program to read the DB4S table export and see how long that takes...
Cool.  That's definitely something we can control then. :smile:
The question is now "why is it doing that?", as we've previously put effort into making sure imports happen in a transaction.
@chrisjlocke If you have a few minutes to try, would you be ok to try importing with DB4S again, but try manually setting the synchronous PRAGMA to OFF (via execute SQL tab) first?

Updated patch here, developed by [Alan Garny](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/qscintilla/2016-October/001167.html):
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/5877
Haven't tried it yet as I'm focused on other bits.  If no-one gets to it before me, I'll try it out in the next few days. :smile:
@justinclift Any update on this? :smiley: I'm kind of thinking this probably isn't an issue now, since (I think) the [update for qscintilla you pushed yesterday](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/bddae31bf12b3ad050104352851d7a0b25886613) takes care of things.
I'm kind of thinking we'll either needs to drop back to the version prior to that change, or pick a different library. 😦  Further reference:
* https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/qscintilla/2016-March/001105.html
* https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/qscintilla/2017-May/001203.html Same problem here. We have some (minor) problems with QScintilla and I hope that the new version (or some future version) might fix them. And since I don't know about any good alternative we'll probably have to stick with QScintilla...
Same for qcustomplot by the way. That seems to be licensed under GPL v3, too, and that not just for the latest version. @agarny Thanks. :smile:
@MKleusberg I likely jumped the gun with worrying about the QScintilla license change.  The MPLv2 part of our licensing looks like it's compatible, so we're ok:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/#mpl-and-lgpl Closing this, as it seems solved. 😁  Cool :smiley:
This license chaos always reminds me of [this article](http://250bpm.com/blog:82) :wink: Oh wow, that's a fairly awesome article.  Hadn't come across it before and it raises a concept I'd not yet seen. :smile:  Heh Heh Heh, that's interesting plotting. :smile:
This request makes sense.  Personally I have no idea how to implement it, but hopefully someone else in the team does. 😀
I'll just drop this link here as a reminder for myself:
http://www.qcustomplot.com/documentation/classQCPCurve.html  Hmmm, this seems like it might be do-able using straight SQL.  Probably something like using a temporary table along with an auto-increment key.
I don't have the time/inclination to try it out personally just yet, but in theory (!) it should work. :smile:
There are at least two ways to realise this in SQL:
1) Create a temporary table like with the results of your select statement. Then plot the data from that table instead of directly plotting the select results.
``` sql
SELECT rowid,* FROM tmp; -- <- Plot this!
```
2) Modify the query to include a row counter. But this makes the query a lot more complicated.
``` sql
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM jhem x, jdata y WHERE x.jid>a.jid AND x.jid=y.jid ORDER BY y.total_vol) AS rownum, b.total_vol, a.jname FROM jhem a, jdata b WHERE a.jid=b.jid ORDER BY b.total_vol;  -- <- Haven't tested this but you might get the idea.
```
Still, I think @struck89's suggestion to have it in the UI makes some sense. None of these approaches is very userfriendly and I am almost certain that I made a mistake or two in the SQL for the second approach.
@struck89 Sorry for the delay but I believe this is fixed now :smiley:
The gear button you discovered was actually buggy. It is supposed to load all data (for large datasets only a part is loaded, so there would be data missing in the plot) but it did this only for the Browse Data tab. When there was a plot based on a manual SQL query like you had it would load the data from the Browse Data tab and show that. This data included the rowid but was not connected to your query in any way. This is fixed now: the gear button should always load the correct data now.
I've also added a 'Row #' column to the column selection view. In simple cases this is the same as the rowid but is way more reliable for what you want :smiley:
Do you have the time to give tomorrow's nightly build a quick test and report back if it's working for you? :smiley:
Also thank you for testing the nightly build and confirming that it's working now :smiley: I'll close this issue then. By the way, out of curiosity: what sort of data were you working on there? I was wondering, especially when seeing the loop in the 'order by' issue :smiley:  As a thought, have you tried adjusting things in `Preferences` → `SQL`?
![screen shot 2016-10-12 at 16 57 38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/19317481/0e86600e-909d-11e6-9a4a-ef43f76cd244.png)
In theory, the "SQL editor font" and the font size field below it should control that.
If that's not working for you, let us know so we can investigate. :smile:
No worries at all.  We all do things like that occasionally. :wink:
I remember I had the same problem when I first installed DB4S. Could we bump up the default size?
For sure! Here it is: #737. I also noticed it too while working on another issue. Needs to be solved.
@revolter If you want to increase the default font size, go for it. :smile:
As a curiosity, @OneMHz, what font size did you use?
I was thinking to bump it up to 12 too. I'll wait for more opinions then I'll do it, thanks!
I have it on 8 and it is still quite large?! Using the Bitstream Vera Sans Mono font. Writing text on a computer screen is so weirdly complicated.. ^^
Hmm, I use 12 on a MacBook Pro Retina and an older iMac and it's not too small and not too large :-?
Heh Heh Heh, it might be practical to #ifdef the default to be OS specific.
Might be necessary. But I'm not entirely sure if it depends on the OS or if it's even more random.
This is Courier New on OSX at size 15 for me.  It's not a HiDPI screen:
![screen shot 2016-10-12 at 22 48 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/19328936/17bf8e76-90ce-11e6-94c0-fe20bd7459ed.png)
We should probably try it out on a few different OS's with the exact same font, and see what the results are.
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font
It uses the Open Font License, so we're ok to test with it. :smile:
This is with Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, at size 15 (on OSX, using a [Cintiq 27QHDT](http://www.wacom.com/en-gb/products/pen-displays/cintiq-27-qhd-touch#Specifications) monitor - 2560 x 1440px resolution, not HiDPI):

And here on 15pt:

I'm running on Debian Linux using KDE and a 1680x1050 monitor, no zoom or anything.
Interesting.  That 8pt text would be "too small" for me.  The 15pt probably "too big". :wink:

@revolter Try with [Bitstream Vera Sans Mono](http://www.dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font)?
I can't install it :(
Nothing, `Font Book` opens, but the font isn't in the list nor in the DB4S's fonts dropdown after restarting it.
Guess what, it works now. I added it from the `Font Book`'s `File` menu
Cool. :smile:
Font size 15:
<img width="1185" alt="screen shot 2016-10-13 at 02 15 59" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/19331077/0c6e3cd0-90eb-11e6-8f4a-0ca78fde622f.png">

I personally find 15 to be too big with either font.
k, for OSX lets make the default 12?
The others can probably remain whatever they are for now. :smile:
Just added a commit to make 12pt the default on OSX: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/980429debd4cfb358333b8f86967349dac08b7a6.
Sounds like a good first step :smiley: It's only affecting new users though. Might be a good idea to try to do some poll via Twitter or so to ask long time users what settings they use there. Not sure if that's a good idea or just producing more confusing data.
Just joining the sharing party with a Windows inclusion... (also so there is a comparison)
15pt:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/19349994/e1f03676-914d-11e6-8bf0-58f9bd9d822a.png)
12pt

So for me, 10 or 11pt would be my chosen size.
Heh Heh Heh.  @chrisjlocke Pick one? :wink:
If you're meaning for DB4S, the font size can be changed in `Preferences`.  We don't have any key combinations to change them live though... but now that you mention it, that's not a bad idea for us to think about. 😁
@whamsy As an extra thought, for the applications which use <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> to shrink the font size, some of them use <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd> to increase it.  Guessing you've already tried that?
No worries. :smile:
With DB4S there are two settings for font size in `Preferences`, each affecting different things.
![screen shot 2016-10-14 at 01 44 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/19372005/ef71fb6a-91af-11e6-8fc7-eda403db38e4.png)
To change the font size for the `Execute SQL` tab, go to `Preferences` → `SQL` → `SQL editor font size`:
![screen shot 2016-10-14 at 01 45 19](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/19372004/ef7114d4-91af-11e6-8e26-c3cb30acd14a.png)
Does that help?
Testing it here now though... and yep it works.  At a guess, it _might_ be something we inherit from one of the widgets we embed (QScintilla).  But not sure.
Trying out <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd>, it works for me if I use the <kbd>+</kbd> key on the number pad (I'm using a full sized PC keyboard via usb).  But it doesn't work for me using the <kbd>+</kbd> key on the main keyboard. :frowning:
> it works for me if I use the + key on the number pad but it doesn't work for me using the + key on the main keyboard
There's a similar quirk in Windows.  With date picker controls (eg:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/19376755/980fd4d6-91d8-11e6-94ec-da773c35b5df.png)
You can click on the day and use the + and - to go forward/back a day.... unless you use the +/- on the main keyboard, when it does nothing.  Annoyingly it doesn't work on my laptop either.  👎
@chrisjlocke I'd like to close this issue, as the default font size on OSX has been adjusted.
If you pick new font size for Windows, we can change it as well. :smile:
@ghellquist Yeah, this was added after the 3.9.1 release, so (in theory) it should be in the nightly builds from a few weeks after that release. No worries at all.  Sorry if I was a bit abrupt, it's been one of those days... 😦
The download locations for our nightly builds are on the front page of our repo if that helps. :smile: Closing this now, as it seems to be fixed. :smile:
(if that's not the case, this is welcome to be reopened)  You can lower the `prefetch` setting that specifies how many rows to load in advance. You can find it in `Preferences > Database > Prefetch block size`. The minimum value is `255`. Let me know if it improves the load speed or not.
Is this linked to #761 where a large amount of text (eg, BLOBs) is in the table?
![screen shot 2016-10-01 at 17 27 46](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/19015944/0b954b48-8806-11e6-8710-644bdbbab6ab.png)
If you make it something really low, like `1` just to experiment with, it would be interesting to know if that makes a difference. :smile:
Thanks, that's useful to know. :smile:
It's definitely not the text rendering then. :wink:
Are you able to send us the database you are using? Or remove sensitive information and send it? Or only the schema and the number of rows in it?
How big is the physical database (MB) ?  To solve another issue (fields with >300,000 characters) that database has thousands of rows (about 20,000), and while my laptop initially struggles to open it (compared to 'normal' databases) its only about 20 seconds.  This database is about 800 MB.
I assume during the two minutes it takes to open the database, the disk IO is going through the roof?  The details from the task manaager would be handy - memory usage of DB4S and disk IO rate.
Closing this due to lack of response. 😦   If you double click on the coloured bar in the Y column, a colour picker should appear allowing you to pick an alternative colour.
Oh, and no, if you save the database as a project, the plot colours aren't saved, so if you do spend an hour picking lovely colours, they'll be lost when you close the database.  So don't ever close the database.  Ever.
Oh, and welcome to GitHub / DB Browser for SQLite, etc.  Your first ticket was a great one!  Welcome to the group!
Interesting.  Trying out the plot stuff now (it's not something I've used much personally) looks useful.  The filters in the Browse Data table affect it too, which is good for displaying specific things.
At the very least, we should save the plot colours into project files, and restore them when loaded.
Trying to think how best to solve the "default colours" problem though.  Maybe we need to add yet another set of Preferences :wink:, this time holding the default colours to be used for the `y` column.  Something like:
- Row 1 = blue
- ... (for say, 16 rows)
I _think_ this would achieve the general goal, and if combined with saving colours in project files, would let people override things for specific databases too.
Thoughts? :smile:
Hmmm, I fear having colors preferences is a bit of an overkill. We could create a constant common sense palette of colors and use those, _and_ save the user's overwrites in the project file.
We can also generate them using HSL instead of RGB, by changing only the hue while maintaining a constant saturation and lightness like [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/470747/865175).
I could try, sure 😄
@struck89 First of all a warm welcome to Github from my side as well :smiley: Thanks for opening this issue!
I've just opened a pull request (#819) with which the plot information will be stored internally. This will have two effects:
1. When configuring a plot, changing the current table, and then coming back to the first table you'll see your plot again with all the colours you have defined.
2. And (hopefully) all the plot information will be stored in the project files. You will still get yellow plots from time to time but at least your personal colour settings can be stored this way. And as far as I understand, Iulian is working on a better colour selection algorithm, too.
Also, feel free to open as many issues as you like, no matter whether plotting related or not. Maybe not every issue will get as much attention as this one - we're all having our private lifes - but it's good to know what we can do to improve DB4S even further :smiley:
@MKleusberg Any idea how easy/difficult it would be to have some kind of image export for the plot area?  eg "Save to PNG" (or maybe something scalable like SVG?)
There already is :wink:

Oops. 😁
No problem :smiley:
@struck89 and others, what do you say about this:
<img width="489" alt="screen shot 2016-10-13 at 03 05 40" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/19332142/0902f8cc-90f2-11e6-9399-020ea5daa2ff.png">
?
Well, it was 3AM when I did that. I was hoping of achieving these colors programmatically, but sadly, I didn't get it right, as you noticed. I'll try to fiddle with it and see if I get it right. The advantage of this method is that the colors are the same every time for a given table (actually, for a number of rows).
Then use your first piece of code from above to generate an initial colour list, + use a "colour distance" algorithm to make sure similar values aren't grouped near each other?
I tried using the algorithm from [this article](http://martin.ankerl.com/2009/12/09/how-to-create-random-colors-programmatically) too but there are some 2 similar colors pairs.
No worries.  If all else fails we can just pick a suitable (say) 20 values and hard code them. :wink:
@struck89 Just merged that PR. So if you're using the project files or plan to do so, with tomorrow's nightly build the plot settings (including the colours!) will be saved in the project file.
Well, I couldn't get it well by generating the colors programmatically :( I wanted for them to be generated based on the number of columns. So, for a table with say 10 columns, they would get the same color every time, not completely random.
If you set the same seed value every time, wouldn't the randomness disappear?
Didn't thought about that :-?
:wink:
I've just pushed a commit which adds a static colour table of 12 colours (taken from the LibreOffice chart colours). Until we come up with a working algorithm this hopefully improves the situation a bit :) As a data point for choosing colours, this site might be useful:

Pressing <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>backspace</kbd> white in the _Execute SQL_'s editor, it starts to undo modifications instead of deleting words.
Pressing <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>left arrow</kbd> correctly jumps through words.
Is is the same on Linux and Windows too?

Alt+Backspace deletes everything in Windows.
Alt+Left arrow does nothing.
In Windows, Ctrl+Left arrow jumps backwards to the beginning of the previous word.
<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>backspace</kbd> on macOS is <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>backspace</kbd> on Windows. Sorry I forgot to mention this.
Same with <kbd>left arrow</kbd>.
@revolter When you say "instead of deleting words" where is that expectation coming from?
Note - I'm no shortcut expert, so it's completely possible it's a well known thing and I've just somehow never learned it (until now). :wink:
@justinclift, Really? It's a standard keyboard, default system one, works in almost any editor. I was using it since having a Windows machine.
And I just read your disclaimer 😆 Yes, it's well known. Only that is <kbd>ctrl</kbd> on Windows but <kbd>alt</kbd> on macOS.
No worries.  It's not the first one I've somehow never known about. :wink:
I thought so too. I'll look into QScintilla's documentation some time soon, but this annoyed me tens of times since I started using DB4S but delayed creating an issue.
I think it's built into QScintilla :-? The problem seems to be in this line and the next one:
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/libs/qscintilla/src/KeyMap.cpp#L131
So it's not a Qt problem but not exactly a QScintilla problem either because this file is part of the underlying Scintilla library, not part of the Qt wrapper around it. Might be worth it to check if they changed these lines in their latest version and, if not, open an issue upstream.  How come it's not? From what I can tell tabs on your screenshot can be scrolled, so you are able to switch between them.
There's no _expected behavior_ explained, so there's no subject currently. If you could provide some suggestions how it should handle different density displays, we would discuss further details.
The general font size looks large, compared to the caption and menu font size.  Shouldn't they all be the same?  All fonts looks the same size on my system...

@chrisjlocke, I think that's @roman-ku's problem actually. What Windows version are you two using?
I'm on Windows 10, but with a 'standard' display.  I don't have access to a high-res display system to test this.
Interesting.  It could mean we need to do some extra handling for system fonts on windows, similar to what we needed to do for the sql editor and data browser fonts a while ago: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/f64afff9861ebf5c2d0dc9287ca6ce90ca129524 https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/ec2d060df6439dfe0030802496ae274276b1f4c3
This sounds like a Qt bug :(
@revolter Yep, that's possible too.
If some kind of event is fired when the window is dragged to a new screen, then it may be possible to work around the problem.  eg by detecting the dpi of the new err... display screen, then reloading/repainting the fonts in the UI.
No idea if that would actually work though, and it sounds like a lot of effort to investigate. 😦
No worries at all.  I'm starting to think a manual - or at least an intro wiki page pointing out stuff like this - might be useful for people.
Thoughts? :smile:
We do accept PR's too btw (hint hint). :wink:
And beer.
@mrexodia Thank you so much for letting us know :heart: I'm really happy when we can help people by providing our little tool :smiley:
Could you explain it better or better yet, post some screenshots with the problem you're having? It would help us understand it better.
Are you meaning this?

@revolter It's possible this is another report of what was happening for @MarqueIV on macOS Sierra.
Agreed. :smile:
Closing this due to lack of response.  While testing out silent mode install on Windows for #804, something interesting showed up.
After installation, the "vcredist_64.exe" file was still left in place.  It looks like theres a bug with this line:
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/5dddffd7a0eb8698885c324bd4f2080b9fb9fb21/CMakeLists.txt#L409
I doubt any other software package does it after uninstall.
What if another application uses redistributable too?
Nah, it works a bit differently from that.  The thing which needs to be removed - and isn't being - is the vc_redist*.exe installer itself.
During the DB4S installation process we run that installer silently in the background, which installs the redistributables.  Once that's done, the vc_redist*.exe package isn't needed, and (in theory) should be getting removed automatically anyway (by us).
As a data point, I tried the batch file approach yesterday.  eg we run a batch file at the end of the installation process, and it does a `del /F vs_redist??.exe` (with the correct file name), then rmdir's the redistributable's subdirectory.
The deletion command always fails with a "permission denied" error, so it seems like vc_redist*.exe is being installed using Admin priviledges, but the batch file is being run with user level priviledges.
Didn't investigate any further.  The next step will probably be to use a batch file to run the vs_redist*.exe installer, because the batch file would need Admin already to install things.  The same batch file - already running as Admin - should (in theory) be ok to delete to the redistributable and it's sub-directory afterwards.  Thanks @firateski, that's awesome. :smile:
Do you want me to take screenshots, so you can verify things before it gets merged?
Ok, give me a few minutes. :smile:
Here's the output of the `--help` option:
``` bash

I **think** all of the main changes are there. :smile:
Cool.  More screenshots needed, or should this be merged, or ? :smile:
And yeah, screenshots do seem to be useful.  Easily worth the time/effort needed for me to take them. :smile:
Thanks.  I'll try it out in a VM later to see what's wrong. :smile:
``` bash
$ qmake
$ make
```
In theory, they both should work... however, that's not always the case. 😦
- The config file for CMake is [CMakelists.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt).
- The config file for qmake is [src/src.pro](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/src.pro).
It's totally possible for one config file to be changed, breaking one system, but leaving the other completely fine.
It would probably be better if we update the Fedora/CentOS build instructions then, to use qmake. :smile:
Yeah, master should keep good. :smile:
Just updated the building instructions slightly for CentOS/Fedora:
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/06398be8840d7b9f7f36334446caa8e6c20d771e/BUILDING.md#centos--fedora-linux
Tested here on Fedora 25 x64.  I still haven't looked into how to override paths yet, for example when providing a custom compiled newer version of SQLite... but I should get that figured out over the next few days. :smile:  Ouch, I'll take a look later.  It sounds like something which might be BSD specific.
Is this translation good to merge as-is though?  It seems ok here, from looking over it visually.
Ahhh sorry.  I mis-remembered you as running BSD. :smile:
Which OS are you on?  I'll merge the translation now too btw.
Thanks. :smile:
Thanks @schdub. :smile:
@schdub Are you sure you have built the latest source from master? If so, are you using Qt4 or Qt5?
At least I cannot reproduce this at the moment, but the latest changes to foreign key handling are making use of some Qt5-only features. I tried to make it work for Qt4, too, but couldn't test it. So that would be my current guess.
Awesome, thanks for testing :) Now that we've 'officially' dropped Qt4 support there should at last be no confusion as to what works with which version.  Thank you @FriedrichFroebel. :smile:
Do you want me to take screenshots?
Awesome, thanks. :smile:
Do you want me to take screenshots, so you can double check?
This looks like something I can test tomorrow on Windows too. :smile:
Thanks @schdub. Tested it here on Windows 7, and it works perfectly. :smile:
Thanks @schdub, that looks good for the master branch. :smile:
Do you have time to do the translation for the v3.9.1 branch too?
I guess that mean "Oops"? :smile:
No, it means "Thank you"
Just copied and pasted the changes to v3.9.x branch: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/d95f9aa4095fa2d863f2d78b63db05858365c80f :smile:
Oh, I forgot to ask... do you want me to take screenshots, so you can double check?
Cool, I'll get it them done soon.  Updating some other things first. :smile:

Thanks @lulol, just merged it. :smile:
No further string changes will be happening for 3.9.1, which I'll start building packages for in a few hours, and we'll probably release tonight.
Thanks.  The master branch isn't important yet.  When it starts to be important though, I'll email you again. :smile:
> large CSV tables.
Out of interest, how large is large?  How many fields per line, and how many records?  Is this after one import, or after a series of imports?
Guess we'll need to come to grips with Valgrind & similar soon. :wink:
It looks like the memory leak is happening [on this line](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/DbStructureModel.cpp#L155), but I can't figure out what's the problem. Maybe @MKleusberg or @innermous have some ideas?
Hmm, looking at it quickly:
```
QTreeWidgetItem* itemTables = new QTreeWidgetItem(itemAll);
```
If that method is called multiple times, then maybe "itemTables" is given a brand new QTreeWidgetItem() on each call, and nothing frees the memory of the old QTreeWidgetItem() from the previous call?
Thanks, that's helpful. :smile:
I've fixed all the memory leaks that Valgrind would tell me about after opening a database, importing some CSV into it, and then closing the application. Here's the commit 7b86b17788cadb7ec08a7bed39aa214dcc42b526. This also fixes the memory leak that Iulian observed.
Either way, the CSV import uses _way_ too much memory. That's where I'd start at least. Maybe don't use Qt objects in there. And maybe we shouldn't read the entire file into memory first; for large files it might be better to INSERT the rows every now and then and free the memory.
The memory leak still occurs, for example, when I import a 200M csv file, sqlitebrowser uses something like 2.4 Gb of RAM (60%) and does not release it after the import. Maybe that's due to the way `QTextStream` and `QFile` work. In contrast `.import` command of the command-line tool `sqlite3` uses only about 0.1% of my 4Gb RAM (`ps aux` output). Would it be a good idea to try to include their implementation of import? @prutz1311 could you provide data set, please?
Nvm, I think any dataset is viable. Something like that https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0ARB4SyceKZN2JtdVAzVFJDZVU  Hmmm, interesting.  It _sounds_ like a bug, but we'll probably need to investigate more before we're sure. :smile:
By the way, does this happen for every value, or just certain things?
😦
As a workaround, click the cell once to set the focus, and click it again to go into 'edit mode'.  The cell contents will be highlighted.  Right click this selection, and select 'Copy' (or press Ctrl+C).
Alternatively, double click the cell contents, and the contents will be displayed in the 'Edit Cell' pane.  Again, the contents will be highlighted.  Copying this text as in the above manner will not be quoted.
Until you mentioned it, I'd never tried pressing Ctrl+C in a cell.  I normally go by menu options, so as there is no 'Edit' | 'Copy', I assumed there was none.
Highlighting two cells gives quoted values, separated by a tab character.  Wonder how long before we have another option to change that to a comma, or some other user-defined character.... ;)
@swinster, I added a commit that should fix this. Thought copying multiple cells still quotes the contents, so only copying single cells will leave the contents unquoted. Are you able to build the project yourself? @justinclift could point you out to the instructions. If not, a nightly build containing this fix will be available tomorrow.
@swinster If you're feeling adventurous, it's definitely workable to compile things yourself instead of waiting for the auto-generated nightly builds: :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S
@swinster Do you have time to try out our latest nightly release? (download locations are on the front page, if that helps)
This should be fixed in both our recent 3.9.1 release, and a few further things fixed in our latest nightly builds.  Verification from your point of view would be cool. :smile:
Closing this due to lack of response. 😦  Thanks @swinster. :smile:  Being able to switch tabs in the Main Window interface using keyboard shortcuts (eg Alt+1, Alt+2, etc) would be useful.
@innermous has implemented it in https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/11558a86b45a65e01d49a46b6cf4ec0231f36aff & https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/45e17c9b497eafa8000c73eb60fcfce5c419d151.
Just to be careful, before merging that into 3.9.1 we should test the result under both Windows and OSX to ensure we're not conflicting with existing key bindings.
Testing here on OSX, Alt+[number key] isn't working.  I'll dig into it a bit later on.
@justinclift :open_mouth:
Why wouldn't it work on OSX?
Yeah, I have no idea.  Looking at it visually, nothing seems wrong.
I'll dig into this properly fairly soon.
I'll stay tuned, this is important issue.
Looking into this at the moment.  It _seems_ like `QKeySequence` might be better than `QKeyEvent` for this.  Not sure yet, still reading.
As a first investigation thing, I changed the current code to this:
```
int keyPressed = event->key();
switch (keyPressed)
{
case Qt::Key_1:
tab = Tabs::StructureTab;
break;
case Qt::Key_2:
tab = Tabs::BrowseTab;
break;
case Qt::Key_3:
break;
case Qt::Key_4:
tab = Tabs::ExecuteTab;
break;
default:
break;
}
```
With a breakpoint on the `keyPressed` variable to see what it shows.  It keeps coming back with a value of `0x01000023`.  So, it's catching the initial press of the Alt key.
Reading the `QKeySequence` and `QShortcut` class docs, they seem better suited to multiple-key combinations.
Something like (say) `QKeySequence(Qt::ALT + Qt::Key_1)` might work, added to a `QShortcut`.
One approach (only tested on OSX) is this: https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/commit/5a0ac4685e2d37ce39fd54b462ff0662e94cde21
That still needs work though:
- The key combo doesn't always work straight away.  Sometimes tabs need to be manually changed first, and **then** all of the key combo's work.  This is weird, and obviously not going to be workable as-is. 😦
Switch block captures value only **once**.
@justinclift
> The key combo doesn't always work straight away. Sometimes tabs need to be manually changed first, and then all of the key combo's work. This is weird, and obviously not going to be workable as-is.
This happens if something else is focused, this is normal.
It's definitely possible I'm doing something wrong. :smile:
The keyPressEvent() though is definitely firing as soon as the alt key is pressed, and not waiting for the full key sequence.
@justinclift and the next keyPressEvent is fired as soon as you press another key holding alt.
Ahhh, I see what you're meaning.  Ok, a better way for me to debug this might be to printf() the keys to stdout or something.
@justinclift if you will introduce any changes to this code, don't forget to add `return;` statement after `setCurrentIndex`. This will be safer.
Like this?
```
...
if (event->modifiers() & Qt::AltModifier && tab != -1) {
ui->mainTab->setCurrentIndex(tab);
return;
}
QMainWindow::keyPressEvent(event);
}
```
Yeah. There's no need to capture event by default QMainWindow event processor if event we are interested in was already processed.
This is the adjusted function to printf() keyboard output:
```
void MainWindow::keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent* event)
{
int tab = -1;
int keyPressed = event->key();
printf("0x%x\n", keyPressed);
switch (keyPressed)
{
case Qt::Key_1:
tab = Tabs::StructureTab;
break;
case Qt::Key_2:
tab = Tabs::BrowseTab;
break;
case Qt::Key_3:
break;
case Qt::Key_4:
tab = Tabs::ExecuteTab;
break;
default:
break;
}
if (event->modifiers() & Qt::AltModifier && tab != -1) {
ui->mainTab->setCurrentIndex(tab);
return;
}
QMainWindow::keyPressEvent(event);
}
```
This is the output from it, when pressing Alt+1, Alt+2, Alt+3, Alt+4, then Cmd-Q to quit:
```
0x1000023
0x1ffffff
0x1000023
0x1ffffff
0x1000023
0x1ffffff
0x1000023
0x1ffffff
0x1000021
```
The number keys aren't being detected properly.  Any ideas?
I don't understand this, tbh. I mean, AFAIK, mac's don't even have Alt keys, right?
Btw, use qDebug(), you are working in Qt environment after all :) There's no place for c-style printf's.
Why wouldn't they have Alt keys?
That being said, I use a Mac Mini.  They don't have an inbuilt keyboard, instead relying on people to use their own.  I'm using a standard everyday 101-key keyboard with it, using US layout.
@justinclift I don't know, I never seen Mac keyboard. I just heard they have **this stuff** with CMD button.
Ahhh.  The Cmd key is (on mine) mapped to the Windows key.
@justinclift hm.
Did @revolter  try this commit? I hope he uses Macbook not Mac Mini.
Ahhh, not yet.  He wanted me to build him a .dmg for testing with.  I'll do it now.
@justinclift alright alright...
I am gonna investigate how QtCreator handles tabulation.
@innermous, Yes, I'm using a MacBook and I can test a built binary if provided. And yes, Apple keyboards have the <kbd>alt</kbd> key too.
@revolter .dmg here: http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-issue788v1.dmg
Didn't use the pretty .dmg creator though. :wink:
Noticed a weird behaviour.  The Alt+[number key] works before a database is loaded.  After loading a database though... they don't work any more.
@justinclift Thanks! Yes, it works ok up until opening a database.
Cool.  It sounds like we're at least on the path to finding a solution. :smile:
Yes, it's losing focus after opening the database.
If I:
- open DB4S
- hit <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd>
- hit <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>
it works ok. Then if I:
- open a database
- switch to another window like `Finder`
- switch to DB4S
- hit <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd>
- hit <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>
it works again.
Interesting yeah.  That does kind of work.
On the "Execute SQL" tab though, the number keys go into the SQL window. :wink:
Moving this to 3.10.0 for now, just in case. :smile:
What's the status of this?
The Serverless project has an interesting way to show contributors:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/serverless/serverless#contributors
We might want to do similar.  Even for release notes. 😀
Thoughts?
Looking at the source for their README.md, they seem to be embedding HTML directly.
eg, this is their first entry:
```
| [<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2752551?v=3" width="75px;"/><br /><sub>Austen </sub>](http://www.serverless.com)<br /> |
```
So, one of those per person, with the various bits tweaked to match (eg avatar, name, URL).
What's the point in that, after all?
@justinclift what's wrong with "Contributors" tab? It's just for that.
Nothing in particular wrong with it, it's just having stuff on the README.md will appeal to some. :smile:
Yeah, the `Contributors` tab seems nicer, with graphs and stuff.
Having them in the `README` seems a duplication of info, bloating the file, and requiring often syncs.
As probably some people don't know about the tab's existence, we could add a `Contributors` section in the `README` like this:
## Contributors
You can see the list by going to the [**Contributors** tab](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/graphs/contributors).
No worries at all.  Let's close this. :smile:
Thanks Richard.  We'll be making a 3.9.1 release in the near future, which is probably a good time for getting this fixed. :smile:
Awesome. 😀
@RH-Euronext Just tried this here on a CentOS 7-1511 install.  Both `cmake` and `make` compiled fine (no errors), though I did have to install both `cmake` and `gcc-g++` which our docs were missing (now fixed).
Only tried with our latest development source code though, not the previous 3.9.0 release tarball.
Is it feasible for you to compile from git source?
CMake 3.6.1 is fine.  :smile:
With the bug in this issue, I _think_ it's a duplicate of https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/758.  That was fixed ~1 month ago in our master branch in git, with https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/2957974974bb874b0219e52d63c198658c02f686.
If you want to try compiling with our git head, it should "just work". :smile:
We're also putting out a minor bug fix release (3.9.1) soon (maybe tonight), if that's useful.
---
On a side note, CMake 3.6.0 and earlier can generate windows binaries with a (low risk) [security problem in them](https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake-developers/2016-July/029039.html).
Your version (3.6.1) has the main fix for that problem in it, so no worries there.
Closing this, as I'm really sure it's a duplicate.  @RH-Euronext If if your testing it turns out not to be, you're definitely welcome to reopen this so it can be investigated. :smile:
Ouch, that doesn't seem good. :smile:
Would you have time to try the latest nightly build?  We have been fixing some of the problems with our handling of constraints (and similar), so there's a fairly good chance it's already been solved.
The download locations for nightly builds are on our front page, if that helps. :smile:
Aaarrgh.  That's right, we busted the build yesterday.  Sorry, I completely forgot.
The build was fixed earlier today though, so a new one should be automatically generated tonight.
Umm... would be ok to try it out tomorrow? (sorry for the hassle)
Sorry, I'm focused on other stuff over the last few days, and probably until early next week.  Thus my leaving it to the automatic builds. :smile:
Arrrgh. 😦
Thanks for checking. :smile:  This is definitely a bug we need to look into then.
Thanks @dragonstar0828.  Yeah.  We're using GitHub, which has it's own ideas of what files are and aren't allowed in attachments. :smile:
Replicated the issue here.  Simply created a new table with just one new field of an autonumber.  No index created.
http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cDQZr4jr3E
"wtf are you adding records into the sqlite_sequence table for?!"
Sounds like people might hit this fairly commonly. 😦
It's unlikely to be fixed in the next few days, and probably not in the next week or so.
There are many other SQLite tools around.  At least one of them should work for you well enough for now. :smile:
...or create the index manually.  Its not _that_ difficult... 😉
Once you realise you have to create them manually, its an easy workaround...
The indexes can be created later and the databases will work (albeit a millisecond slower) without them.
Good point. :smile:
So should an index be created for every table with autoincrement column?
Interesting.  Technically you don't need a primary key autoincrement field, as this is just an alias for the ROWID column anyway.
https://www.sqlite.org/autoinc.html
...and that doesn't have an index.  So I'd argue its not needed.  Haven't read the whole page yet though, as .... well, other things to do...! :wink:
I knew that, but the code I'm working on never used the rowid, and I got used to the "primary key autoincrement `id` column" so I started using it in sqlite too, but I don't think it **has** to have an index too. Aren't indexes optional?
Ok, I know understood what you guys meant, and a colleague confirmed this behaviour too. Didn't know about this at all.
Just a note that the following SQL **does** create an index.
`CREATE TABLE test (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY ASC)`
This was on v3.9
Actuallly I lied.  It creates an index, but they're empty.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/18904545/75da2b02-8556-11e6-99b4-d333a2690dc5.png)
This was using the 'execute sql' tab.
I haven't read the entire conversation here to be honest but here are just some thoughts.
We get the indices list directly from SQLite. You can check it, too. Just run `select * from sqlite_master where type='index'`. Now the point is that SQLite doesn't add primary keys to that list. They are sort of implicit indices that are there and are used as an index but aren't an index object like manually created indices.
So to avoid confusion in other places I would tend to leave it the way it is, i.e. rely on SQLite's behaviour here. Maybe we can highlight primary keys in some other way? Any suggestions would be welcome here. At the moment, if you expand the table tree and list all the columns, the PK will have a different icon. But that's it :smiley:
This issue was already reported here: #757.
It was fixed and will be available in the next 3.9.1 release. 😄
...or the next nightly, assuming that gets resolved before 3.9.1 is released... :wink:
Not a problem. And as @chrisjlocke mentioned, you can try the nightly version until the release, which, AFAIK, contains the fix.
We've not yet put time into tracking down and fixing the one which don't sound critical though.
Hmmm, that doesn't seem happy at all. 😦
Which version of OSX is this happening on?
As an experiment, would be ok to try compiling it yourself?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
If you have OSX Homebrew already installed, it's very easy. (5-10 mins max)
Asking because that's something I do fairly often, then use `open` (as you show above) to start it up.  This has generally worked for me... but it could be my system is configured strangely. 😇
We had something similar with FTS support and OSX.  (See #762).  Wanna change your OS? :wink:
@justinclift started mentioning homebrews and stuff - think he might have got confused with his whiskey collection.  None of that really helps you, but can only assume DB4S for Windows can be 'tweaked' to include FTS support....  @justinclift will bounce along soon and either confirm or ... something else.
On Windows the version of SQLCipher (a encryption enhanced replacement for SQLite) we used was compiled without any of the SQLite extensions.
It's only due to a lack of time for researching if/how to compile them in.  It's completely possible the FTS5 module is easy to add, it's just no-one's yet looked into it.
If someone with a working DB4S build system has time to investigate, then provide steps to SQLCipher with FTS5, that would make including it easy for future releases. :smile:
You're on the right track. :smile:
With our Windows release, I compiled SQLCipher myself using the instructions here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Win64-setup-—-Compiling-SQLCipher
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/justinclift/sqlcipher
It's a fork of the SQLCipher repository, with the changes made to it as written in that doc.  That repository has a branch each for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, as there were slightly different path changes needed.
For FTS5 support on Windows, we just need someone to spend some time doing that compile again, then figuring out how to add FTS5 to it.  It might not be difficult, it's just that none of us have looked into it yet.
If you have the time/inclination to get that done, we're _absolutely_ open to including FTS5 in our next releases. :smile:
Does that help?
You're welcome.  We all help out where we can. :smile:
Updated the windows build scripts just now.
The nightly builds on Windows - both with and without encryption - now include the FTS3, FTS4, FTS5, and JSON1 extensions.  Fixed in 1257134. It was the German translation who had this typo.
Ahhh, well spotted.  Yeah, that should be fixed. :smile:
@wodim This should be fixed now. :smile:
![screen shot 2016-09-27 at 15 24 23](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/18878023/0d370fbe-84c7-11e6-8e73-b132242da2db.png)
Would you be ok to try the nightly build (tomorrow), to verify it from your point of view? :smile:
Excellent.  Thanks for verifying and getting back to us @wodim. :smile:
Updated my system last night with "XCode 8", without thinking it though. 😦

It's compiling and running perfectly fine against Qt4 though.
Anyone have suggestion on what it could be caused by?
Removed Xcode 8, and re-installed Xcode 7.3.1.  DB4S compiles without issue.
Looks like an Xcode 8 specific problem.
[This answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/39499500/865175) says that it will be fixed in Qt 5.6.1.
Nah, that answer is for a different Xcode 8 problem.  It's for an incompatibility with Qt 5.6.0/5.7.0 and Xcode 8.
When starting Qt Creator 5.7.0 with Xcode 8 installed.  This error is displayed:
```
Project ERROR: Xcode not set up properly. You may need to confirm the license agreement
by running /usr/bin/xcodebuild.
```
The link you gave has a working fix.
The compile problem I'm reporting here isn't fixed by that. 😦
@joshua-meng Hmmm, that didn't work for me.  I had already made that fix to get past the initial Xcode 8 warning.
Is it working for you?
Thanks.  I'll look back into this again later, I must have been doing something wrong first time around. :smile:
Yeah.  Use Xcode 7.3.1 instead for now.  Not a great solution, but it works. :smile:
Sure, will do.  Will get the Xcode 8 install happening again shortly to test with. :smile:
I'll test this tonight too.
@ilovezfs, I guess that it worked for you with that patch, right?
@revolter This is the patch from @ilovezfs, adjusted to work with our QScintilla: https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/commit/4590ff6bf749ca389e66423740c0c199d1b1492d
@ilovezfs Any idea if it's upstream, or been submitted there?  @revolter Asked on their mailing list in regards to XCode8 compile troubles, and no-one bothered to respond. 😦
XCode 8 probably has a different level of C++ support than XCode 7.x.
To investigate it more closely, we could check what version of clang is bundled with each, compare C++ support reported by those, then check what your compiler on Linux says it supports.
Yep, it's compiling here perfectly now. :smile:
Tested with XCode 8 on both Qt4 and Qt5.
I'll merge the patch into both master and our v3.9.x branches shortly.
Awesome! Do you think it's a good idea to update `QScintilla` before applying the patch?
Hmmm, good point.  I'll test with XCode 7.3.1 again shortly. :smile:
@revolter Sure.  Probably make it a PR though instead of directly pushing it, so we can do a bit of testing on it first.
I tried updating it hoping it will solve the build problem and I remember it updated with no conflicts or anything. So I'll make a PR sometime soon.
@ilovezfs Just tested it here with Xcode 7.3.1 as well.  Still compiling fine with both Qt4 and Qt5, on OSX 10.11.6.
Looks like a good solution. :smile:
Btw, this is the commit applied to both our active branches: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/969e263e5bf71e63df8ee908cb4a2014b9a55c9b
I can't believe this works, and I can finally build it again, and it was such a small fix. Thank you a lot, @ilovezfs!
@ilovezfs Do you want to submit the patch to upstream QScintilla?  If you're feeling lazy, we can do it. :smile:
@justinclift I have no idea where the QScintilla source code is
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/qscintilla/2016-October/001160.html
It builds for me too (again ❤️).
Thanks @joshua-meng, that's an interesting thought.  Have you seen this?
- https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/qscintilla/2016-October/001167.html
- https://github.com/opencor/opencor/commit/70f3944e36b8b95b3ad92106aeae2f511b3f0e90
Not sure which approach to go with. :smile:
I'll look at reverting the initial patch we applied here then, and using yours instead. :smile:
@justinclift Is this related to #824? @MKleusberg Yep, same (now fixed) issue.  Well spotted. :smile:  It would have helped if you completed the issue template and not remove it. So, what version? What operating system?
As well as what @revolter mentions (it's important), info about when/where it crashed would help.  For example, did it crash as soon as you opened it, or did it crash in the middle of doing something, (or something else)?
Are you ok to help us out with that info, so we can try figuring it out? :smile:
@justinclift Do you have time to test this on your VM?
> Windows 10
64bit?
Works fine for me.  I can only assume (as is usual) Windows will try and open the last used location.  If this is on media that no longer exists, DB4S might be getting confused?  Is there a registry entry telling DB4S where to open, or does it just rely on Windows?
I assume double clicking a .db file opens the file correctly in DB4S.  If you close DB4S, re-open it and _then_ click 'Open Database', does that work? (ie, it has stored its last used location...)
Nonetheless, it should not crash. Are you able to force the last path to a non-existing path and reproduce this?
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/18547230/387e7bb2-7b3a-11e6-8702-9dca32ecfd3a.png)
I can't reproduce this, so this may not be the cause. :cry:
Even deleted the whole registry leg for DB4S and it just recreated what it needed.
I'm currently logged on as an administrative user (so not Administrator, but I have admin privileges).  so not sure if a 'normal' user would have a different experience.  Will check.
Great job! Shame that the news is bad :(
1. Did you use DB4S before this crash?
2. Do you have admin privileges on your current account?
Deleting the DB4S registry leg could also be an option.  I can knock up a VB program to do that, as I was just creating a program to reset the file associations.
We might want to add some debugging info / error handling to the "Open Database" method, even in just a once-off temporary build, to try and understand why it's crashing.
I've a Windows 10 64bitty PC at work, so will try with a non-admin user.
@drescherjm Thanks for mentioning it.  It was sounding like a one-off thing until then. :smile:
@elyorm @drescherjm Would you be ok to screenshot the error information?
For me, when a crash happens on Windows, a dialog comes up that sometimes has useful information about the crash.  If that happens for you (eg giving a .dll name), that would help us fix this. :smile:
Unfortunately, the 'stopped working' dialog doesn't give any information, apart from 'its dead, Jim'.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/18579693/2f29f64e-7bef-11e6-8818-688ccaf42f0a.png)
The event viewer sometimes gives a bit more detail, but not really that helpful... just the .exe and memory location ... can't really debug with such little information.
@chrisjlocke Thanks.  Maybe the info is directed elsewhere then.  Does crash information from DB4S show up in Event Viewer?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest/ Thanks @drescherjm, that's interesting.
My first guess is there's some kind of dll conflict.  There are some tools around to show which dlls are being used by a program, so we should be able to compare what your system is using with a "known good" one.
But yeah, it'll need you to have the laptop in hand.  Ping us when you're ok on your end and we can take a look at this. :smile:  Good catch. :smile:
Yeah.  On a similar note, if you want to see weird things happen (and you use Libvirt for anything), make some VM's with unusual unicode characters in (eg) the VM name, paths to their storage, etc.
Note - Don't do that with anything running important data.  Just saying. :wink:
Just chippin' in, but I don't think or regard this as a bug per se.  If I type this:
`create table⁪⁪⁪⁪⁪⁪⁪⁪⁪⁪⁪          jack            (id text);`
`create index     jack2         on jack (id);`
Then the table 'jack' and index 'jack2' are created as expected (well, as semi-expected - without whitespace).
If I enclose that in quotes, then yes, the whitespace is created.  However, as its explicitly set, DB4S is doing what I'm asking.  There may be a specific reason I want a table called "jack " (with spaces) and it would annoy me (and I'd consider it more of a bug) if I asked for one using "jack " and DB4S changed that to "jack".  I haven't tested the official sqlite3 commandline program, but I'm sure that would do as it was told!
As `create index 'jack ' on jack (id)` works, and `drop index 'jack '`, I personally don't see this as a bug.
I can happily type `mkdir " jack"` in Windows, but trailing spaces are removed.
I would further argue that DB4S clearly shows whitespaces in table and index names.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/18700563/da95b4a8-7fcf-11e6-9ef0-51edc825970a.png)
Again - just my opinion. :smile:
Creating tables/indexes/(etc) with spaces isn't really the problem.  The problem is DB4S failing to work with those tables/indexes/(etc) afterwards.
eg select the "jack " index, choose to delete it... and the delete will fail.  In the code for the deletion, there seems to be the equivalent of a trim() function happening on the object name before it's getting deleted.
I took a quick look at this just after @mafagafogigante reported it, but the reason isn't obvious.  The code to determine the object name so it can be deleted receives the name already without whitespace.  I didn't have time/energy to dig further then.
Yep, that's clear. :smile:
Aah, through the GUI.  Apologies - so used to using the 'Execute SQL' tab, I do all the work through that.
Would you have a few minutes to compile the latest code to verify from your point of view? :smile:
Thanks for both reporting, and verifying this. :smile:
We're likely to create a `3.9.1` release in the next few days, with a few bug fixes and improvements over `3.9.0`. Should these updates be applied to the `v3.9.x` branch for that too?
Trying out the Preferences tab now, those two weird blocks in the top right aren't showing up on my desktop (MacOS X 10.11.16).  Tried with both Qt4, and Qt5.  They look identical:
![screen shot 2016-09-11 at 10 52 13](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/18416465/ee7e099e-780d-11e6-9917-ec8eef424b09.png)
Not sure what could be causing it on your system.  Sounds like further investigation is needed?
No worries, I can test that shortly. :smile:
Do these help?
When compiled with Qt4:

No worries. :smile:
Is it ok to merge this PR then?
Cool. :smile:
> Arrg I don't know where the text I just typed went.
Oops.  When you wrote it out, you put it inside the `<!--` and `-->` tags.  Browsers don't show stuff between those tags, so it effectively disappeared.  I've just removed those two tags from around what you typed, so it shows up now. :smile:
Btw, would you be ok trying the NOT NULL foreign key support with our very latest code from the `master` branch?  @MKleusberg was improving our foreign key support last week, so there's a chance that's working now.  (I'd call it 50/50 :wink:)
Excellent, thanks for testing it and letting us know @dflogeras. :smile:
@MKleusberg Sounds like this will be of interest to you. :smile:
Hmm, this is going to be an interesting issue :wink: What I can do is print an error message when trying to save, i.e. when doing the COMMIT. At least this way you'd know that there is an error and that the DB wasn't actually saved as expected. However, the only error message we can get is "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed" but not any details.
Yep, working on it right now :smiley:
I've just pushed a commit which changes the behaviour here. Now it prints an error message when trying to save the database. Can you test this by just building the latest source from master, @dflogeras, and confirm if it's working for you? :smiley:
Thanks for reporting back so quickly, @dflogeras :+1: Also good working finding this bug - I honestly would have never found it :wink: Are we ok to close this issue then?
@sqlitebrowser/developers, As the actual issue is not fixed, wouldn't help to open a new issue with this and hopefully get it fixed sometimes? We do want to support all SQLite features in the future, right? @revolter Yeah, that makes sense. @justinclift Care to create it yourself please? 😄  Maybe later.  My head is buried in other stuff at the moment.  Interesting.  Version 3.8.0 is a bit old now, and we've made a **lot** of changes for the recent 3.9.0 release.
Are you comfortable with compiling things yourself?  If so, the instructions for Ubuntu **might** "just work":
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#ubuntu-linux
As an alternative idea, @deepsidhu1313 may have suggestions.  He creates our official Debian/Ubuntu packages, and may find [Maru OS](https://github.com/maruos/maruos) interesting. :smile:
@pchtsp ping?
@deepsidhu1313 Any idea about building 3.9.0 for Maru? (eg Debian on ARM) :smile:
Thanks @deepsidhu1313. :smile:
Awesome @pchtsp, that's good news. :smile:
Out of curiosity, which repository had 3.8.5 in it, so we can investigate?
If FireDAC provides a drop-in-replacement for the sqlite3.dll which we could use, this might be an option.  Any idea? :smile:
With SQLCipher, they provide a drop in replacement .dll for the SQLite one.  With that, it meant our code didn't need much changing to add a few specific SQLCipher calls to get the encryption working.
I'm wondering if FireDAC can do the same thing, as it's hard to see from that link what kind of suitable download they provide. 😦
Thanks, that's easier to grok. :smile:
We'll probably not add support for FireDAC (Delphi) encryption then.
If at some point they add support for encryption with shared library (non-static) builds, we can look at it again. :smile:
Yeah, it might be feasible to do, with some digging.
Would you have the time/inclination to look into it? :smile:
Is this a DB4S issue, and not a SQLite issue?
> SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times. Instead, the built-in Date And Time Functions of SQLite are capable of storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values
>
> Each column in an SQLite 3 database is assigned one of the following type affinities:
> - TEXT
> - NUMERIC
> - INTEGER
> - REAL
> - BLOB
So if you stored your date as text or numeric, its up to your program to convert the data?  In my .Net apps, I normally use `dateVariableImUsing=cdate(sqlreader("dateFieldInDatabase").value.tostring)`
Interesting.  Trying to visualise how it's not working, but I'm kind of failing. 😦
Is it feasible to show a screenshot or record a screencast or something of the bit that's not working?
Looking at the table in section 3.2 [here](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html), it seems like "DATETIME" is automatically treated by SQLite as the "NUMERIC" type.
If you define a field as "NUMERIC", instead of using SQL to create it as "DATETIME", does that allow the .NET DB provider objects to work with it properly?
Thanks @Plutonix, that definitely helps show the problem. :smile:
From my perspective, I'd call this a bug in our handling of the field definition values.  We're not detecting when a person has typed their own value (eg `DATETIME`) into the Type field.  Instead, we just blindly use the string value before it was overwritten.  eg `INTEGER`, `TEXT`, `BLOB`, etc.
If we change the code so it uses the manually entered string value, would that solve the problem from your perspective? (assuming the .Net provider then does it's bit correctly :wink:)
Cool, this is probably doable. :smile:
Just a query, but when you type 'datetime' in the text field, are you pressing Enter?  If I do that, 'DateTime' is set for the field...
![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/18304097/5efa590e-74d8-11e6-839c-4cbda0abfb13.gif)
Hard to see in a GIF when I press Enter, but .... if it helps, I can make a 'tap' sound... not that you'd hear that either :wink:
We need to update the create statement with the current `Type`'s value on blur too, not only when pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
Well, blur is the opposite of focus, so it is when a control loses focus, irrespective of where it goes to
Thanks, makes sense. :smile:
Never knew that either...
Ahhh, interesting thought.  The OSX version includes SQLCipher, compiled using OSX Homebrew.  I didn't add the "--with-fts" option for the SQLCipher command line though. 😦
If you have Homebrew installed, it's very simple to build a version with FTS support included (5-10 mins max):
```
$ brew install sqlcipher --with-fts
$ brew install qt
$ git clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.git -b v3.9.x
$ cd sqlitebrowser
$ qmake CONFIG+=sqlcipher
$ make
```
The "DB Browser for SQLite" .app should now be in the src/ subdirectory.  You can drag it to /Applications or run it in place, etc. :smile:
- https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#macos-x
- https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#build-with-sqlcipher-support
Ahhh, just found something relevant.  Looking at the SQLCipher formula in Homebrew, the "--with-fts" option includes FTS5 not FTS4:
- https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/47d7f56c299bf965cda82ae342763c683d183086/Formula/sqlcipher.rb#L30
Is it feasible to update your query for FTS5?
Yep.  In theory, changing the line in sqlcipher.rb file to say `-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS4` instead of `-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5` should work.
eg: `brew remove sqlcipher`, then change the file, then `brew install sqlcipher --with-fts`.
The sqlcipher.rb file is probably in this location:
- /usr/local/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/sqlcipher.rb
Make a backup of it first, and replace it when done (to be safe). :smile:
Just tested that change here and it seems ok:
```
$ brew install sqlcipher --with-fts
==> Downloading https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher/archive/v3.4.0.tar.gz
Already downloaded: /Users/jc/Library/Caches/Homebrew/sqlcipher-3.4.0.tar.gz
==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/sqlcipher/3.4.0 --enable-tempstore=yes --with-crypto-lib=/usr/local/opt/openssl --enable-load-extension --disable-tcl CFLAGS=-DSQLITE_HAS_CODEC -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS4
==> make
==> make install
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/sqlcipher/3.4.0: 11 files, 2.2M, built in 39 seconds
```
The `FTS4` bit on the end of the `./configure` line looks like it's in effect.
Didn't try the rest of the build steps though.  Will leave that to you. 😀
Oh, it's probably a good idea to run `macdeployqt` on the .app after you're built it too.  That will copy the OpenSSL, SQLCipher, and Qt shared library files from the Homebrew directory into your new "DB Browser for SQLite" app bundle.
```
$ cd /Applications
$ macdeployqt DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite.app -verbose=2
```
With that done, if you uninstall OpenSSL, SQLCipher, or Qt from Homebrew, the .app won't suddenly stop working. :smile:
Define "doesn't seem to handle it to well". What's exactly happening? UI freeze?
Is it a locally attached database, or on a network?
Although only 90 MB, how many tables and rows within those tables are there?
Is it just when you change tabs? You said 'updating the db' - can you give more detailed steps to reproduce?
I created a table with four fields and filled it with 549,000 rows.  The fields just had 'a' as a content.  The only real lag I see is changing a field type, eg, from text to integer.
We made _some performance_ enhancements with the recent 3.9.0, but if you're using that one and it's still not great it sounds like more effort is probably needed.
As a second thought, if you're on Windows or OSX, would you be ok to try the latest nightly build?  That has some internal changes which should make some operations faster, so it **might** help. :smile:
Any chance of a copy of the database?  Only ask to test it on another machine.  Such a lag sounds 'odd' so wanted to check it here...
From the schema you've provided, I could knock up a 'possible duplicate', but just wanted to cut a corner or two! :wink:
@chrisjlocke This one is yours for in-depth investigation (eg knock up the duplicate for testing, or email @abhilash1in, etc). :smile:
1. Make a copy of the database
2. In the copy, empty out the image column.  eg `UPDATE slides SET img = NULL`, and see if the performance noticeably changes
3. Also try the same "empty out X column" with other ones too, just to test.  It might also be useful to just empty out **some** of the images (use a WHERE clause), to see if there's a threshold where things change
Those should at least be decent steps to gather useful info with. :smile:
Feel free to ZIP the database and email it to me at chris@chrisjlocke.co.uk
I can knock up a program which wipes out blocks of X records (eg, 10 or 20) and see what happens.
I've just amended my database with about 30,000 characters in each of the four fields, and while there was no lag, DB4S did 'cough' and thus, showed no data.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/18209358/4e6fd092-712b-11e6-93a2-c047a693f313.png)
Can confirm long strings in a field make DB4S cough.  Have attached a small database.  Shove 100,000 characters in a field, and DB4S struggles browsing data or viewing records via the 'Execute SQL' tab.
It didn't make much difference having a long continuous line of text or text with spaces in it (thought the grid would prefer the latter).  As the grid can only display X characters, would it be worth the grid only showing the first X characters of the field?  Or would that have too much of a speed impact to be worth it?
Creating a SQL query without the long field (so 'select _rowid_ from a') is speedy.  'select \* from a' is not.  This would point to it being a 'displaying the data' issue rather than 'DB4S can't cope with large blobs of data' issue.
The problem isn't twice as bad with 200,000 characters in each field, but it is worse.  I just changed the database to 200,000 chars in each record, and its a lot slower.  (bloat1b.zip)
Using `select substr(a,1,40000) from a` works, but only in the 'Execute SQL' tab - it would be handy if the 'browse data' tab could 'truncate' data, with the 'Edit Data Cell' pane obviously showing the full data.
[bloat1.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/453013/bloat1.zip)
[bloat1b.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/453019/bloat1b.zip)
Interesting.  As a test, it's probably worth checking whether monospaced fonts (eg Courier) make a difference.
With the hex view in the Edit Cell panel, they're noticeably faster than non-monospaced fonts.
That's unlikely to be the complete solution though. :wink:
I wonder whether we should default to only pulling back part of a very large field and then go back for everything only when needed. Easier said than done I know! I used to work with a database that was pretty much like that.
Changing the font to a fixed width font has no effect - either positively or negatively.
As there is no benefit of displaying 300,000 characters in a grid cell, maybe there should be a display limit, so that the 'edit cell' pane is used for full editing.
In the above screenshot, I linked to where DB4S displayed 'Inf' instead of the cell contents.  Its worth noting that even the 'Edit Cell' pane displayed 'Inf' and said the cell contained 3 bytes, rather than the full cell contents and the correct number of bytes.
Just a note too that the memory usage is phenomenal while using the above database.  The .exe was using about 1 GB, but on my 16 GB machine, I noticed I was using 91% of it.  Closed the database, and it all came back... unsure which 'process' had it (will play with that some more)
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/18225470/5ecd7308-71ea-11e6-80d0-e170422a8176.png)
I still didn't get answer to my question. Is it _just_ UI, or mix of both back-end and front-end lags?
**UPD:** Alright, I see what you are talking about.
By the way, folks... Don't even try to copy data from cells :D
Honestly, it's not essential. Both your original and @chrisjlocke 's modified tables are causing troubles that should be fixed...
Well, I found a way to optimize it. I am working on pull request. Someone won't probably like it though, that's why I don't push it straight to master. So we'll have a discussion.
But this solves the trouble for you, at least. Test it with latest commit, please.
Check the nightly from here:
http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/
It appears to only display/retrieve the first 5,000 characters from the field.  So the good news is that it displays in the grid much quicker, but the downside is that you can no longer view/edit the full field contents.  Consider it a temporary tweak... :wink:
Aah, go to 'Preferences' and 'Data Browser' and there is a 'Content' group box.  Change the value as required.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/18237913/0c4e6d26-732f-11e6-995a-d3311cb51e15.png)
Aah, again.  Don't try changing the value.  It has no effect yet.  Sorry - I'm jumping the gun and giving details on bits and pieces that haven't been completed yet ... thats why they're nightlies! :wink:
Do you reckon it would be a useful if we take small screenshots of new things (like in your post just above), and add them to a page on the wiki named something like "New features in DB4S 3.10.0" ?  It'd be useful reference info, and we could probably use it as source materials (eg cut-n-paste :wink:) for the 3.10.0 release notes. :smile:
The wiki certainly could do with padding out... :wink:
@chrisjlocke I was confused by this, too :smiley: For me at least the problem was that the minimum value for this field is 1000. If you set a value below that (I was trying 5 for testing purposes) Qt recognises it as an invalid value and changes it back to 5000. Other than that I couldn't see any problem with the settings dialog.
```

```
This should be fixed by 4b79f92eaac280c621244cb36c6954f0976c5142. So the next nightly build might be worth checking out :smiley:
That's awesome @MKleusberg.  I was wondering how to distinguish between the two different uses for the same data() call.
As you've just shown... that's what roles are for. :smile:
@chrisjlocke do you really think 5k symbols can be displayed handy? Editor is just for that, grid is preview stuff...
No, I don't think 5000 characters is handy ... The grid can only show at tops 20, and as its truncated, shouldn't be edited, so I was entering low values, and it was being reset to 5000. . I didn't realise the 'edit cell' pane was showing the full text either... It only displayed '5000 characters' in its status. I didn't test it any further or deeper as I thought it was work in progress...
I assume that's what you meant by 'do you really think 5k symbols can be displayed handy?' - did you think I wanted more??
@chrisjlocke feel free to change it?
And yeah, 1k is lower limit. As I said, feel free to change it, even via github. Say, to 1.
Yeah, 1 makes sense to me as a lower boundary.  If people want to choose that, we might as well let them, it's shouldn't hurt anything. :smile:
Any updates on this issue? From memory of ages ago, I changed the lower limit to be 1 (as in a singular character).
Haven't followed up though to check for performance differences. :wink: You're right, looks like the minimum is 1 now. But I'm not sure if that helps performance-wise either :wink:   ### Details for the issue

I know the 'Database Structure' shows the database schema, and I print this out a lot when working on various databases.  I work in Windows, so its easy to do a printscreen, slap it in Word or something, and print it out.  However, one of the systems I'm working on is 17 tables, with one of these having 17 fields.  Nothing 'major', but it means printing it from the 'Database Structure' is a pain.  I use PicPick to help print scrollable windows, but it struggles on Qt widgets, so can't be used with DB4S.
In desperation, I knocked something up in VB.

This pulls in the database schema and creates a form of treeview controls.  Its still manual, as I have to 'screenshot' it still, but PicPick is able to scroll it for me and capture it as one image.  It also fills the page left to right, rather than the 'Database Structure' view, which for me, is just one long column - not efficient with paper usage.
Requirements for this for other users might be low, so just 'throwing it out there' to see what others think, but a schema view thats printable could be quite useful.

Seems like a good feature to have.
@chrisjlocke So.. this might be a good starter project for your C++/Qt learning? :smile:
Oh crap....  :wink:
As a thought, would you be ok to try the build with `qmake` instead of `cmake`?
That's a curiosity thing on my part, just to understand if `qmake` works ok on DragonFly BSD. :smile:
Regardless of that, I've just pushed a commit to the `master` branch which should fix the CMake issue.  In theory.  If you have the time/inclination to test that, it would be cool. :smile:
Damn. 😦
Just to double check, did you reset & clean the git tree before attempting those? eg:
```
$ git reset --hard HEAD
$ git clean -dffx
```
That's just me hoping the build failed due to left over files from the previous run. 😁
If that's definitely not the case, then what happens if you roll the git repo back a few commits, to just before the change I made? eg:
```
$ git reset --hard e12e043
$ git clean -dffx
[then qmake / cmake, etc as appropriate]
```
Excellent. :smile:
This is linked to #744 which has recently been fixed.  However, we usually have 'nightly builds' which have the latest fixes and tweaks in them, but unfortunately, due to one of the latest fixes and tweaks having a mind of its own, the program isn't compiling properly, so the nightlies aren't available.  However, check back in a couple of days, and theoretically, this issue might have been fixed.  Give @justinclift a hug (in a virtual sense, of course.....) :smile:
Oh, and thanks for reporting this by the way!  Always good to get feedback, whether good or bad!
Sorry @appjeanne, I accidentally broke our automatic nightly builds while adjusting some settings.
In theory (!) it's fixed now, so the new nightly build tomorrow should be fine to use.  Though, we'll need to double check again anyway, just in case something else is still making it unhappy. 👼
@appjeanne, Can you test the [latest nightly build](http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com) and confirm that this is fixed?
Awesome.  Thanks for letting us know @appjeanne. :smile:
Just as a 'workaround', could you not run multiple copies of the application?  Not a fantastic solution (and probably not even a solution) but I've tried it a couple of times and it sorta worked...
Nice thinking, it does sound like something we should be doing
Reading through this, the concept sounds fine.  If we can do it in a way which keeps the UI simple for newcomers, it's probably a good thing to make happen.
The tabbed main window approach is probably a good thing for newcomers.  eg it's fairly simple to get the idea of.  We could add a checkbox in Preferences to switch from the tabbed view, to a "multi-panel" (best term I could think of) view instead.
For a multi-panel view, we'd probably have each of the main window tabs being in their own dockable/floating panel.  Similar to how the "Edit Database Cell" panel works in 3.9.0.
For a first attempt, each panel would probably have just the one instance. eg no capability to have multiple "Browse Data" panels open at the same time, each with a different view.
But, that could come later, after the separate panel code itself is known to work. :smile:
Interesting thought, that's a useful sounding approach. :smile:
Emailing @rp- now, to see if it's fixable. :smile:
Haven't heard back from @rp-, so took a different approach instead as pointed out by @MKleusberg: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/2957974974bb874b0219e52d63c198658c02f686
I **think** the nightly build will be ok again now.  At least until we switch to Qt5, by which time we'll need to have a Qt5 compatible version of it running. :smile:
The logs from the nightly build seems to say it succeeded.
Haven't personally tried the resulting package though. :wink:
Just tested the nightly, and it works.  Compared the 'about' box with 3.9, and noticed 3.9 doesn't show a SQLite version?
3.9
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/18156266/ee5e7754-700c-11e6-9726-b38b1977cab0.png)
3.9.99
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/18156272/fe1d2e60-700c-11e6-8096-b78c6d12bc21.png)
Also, the icons for both are different - 3.9.99 is a lighter grey... Wasn't sure if these 'differences' should be there...
@chrisjlocke Yeah, the version info shown for our SQLCipher builds is a bit wonky.  We query the SQLCipher library for it's version number... but instead of telling us the correct info, it just returns the version of SQLCipher it's based on.  That info is probably helpful for some people (maybe feature detection?), but doesn't really match up with how we're doing things.
We do have an open DB4S issue about fixing the version number displayed for SQLCipher, but I'm not finding it right at the moment. 😦
Aah, pull 585...
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/585
Thanks.  That's why I missed it... only looked in the Issues. :wink:
But the icon didn't change, right?
The builds for windows have been working for some time. Closing now. :)
@justinclift, Why does this Windows issue have the `linux` label? 😆
The Windows nightly builds (at the moment) are cross compiled on an Arch Linux box. :wink:
Sorry @rvalk, that's my fault.  I changed the default installation directory to include the version number (eg `3.9.0`) in the path name.  It turns out that was a bad idea. 😦
You can fix the problem manually though.  If you're ok with using regedit, you can adjust things yourself using @chrisjlocke's instructions here:
- https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/279#issuecomment-242426297
There is some older info here, but Chris's instructions are probably better: :smile:
- https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Windows-File-Associations
Note - We're also working out a proper "more permanent" fix for this in #279.  We'll probably add something in the Preferences dialog so people can set file associations there.
It hasn't been added yet, but research is happening. :smile:
In Windows, you can also right click the file, select 'Open with...', tick the ticky box, and click 'More apps' (if on Windows 10) then find where you installed DB4S.
http://chrisjlocke.co.uk/associations/
You said, "even after browse and select," so it sounds like you've tried this?  What version of Windows are you on?
Nirsoft also provide a comprehensive file type manager.
http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html
This program doesn't need installing and is simply an .exe file.
@rvalk Was any of the above useful to get it working again? :smile:
Cool.  Hopefully we'll have a proper solution working for the next major version. :smile:
@chrisjlocke Just tried watching the video on your /associations/ page.  For me, it's not working through the Jplayer thing on the website.  [Downloading it directly](http://chrisjlocke.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/31_0750.mp4) and watching with VLC works fine though. :smile:
Hmm, that's interesting. Must be a poor player. Worked ok on my Chrome. :disappointed:
Ahhh, that's interesting. :smile:
In theory, that's **supposed** to be happening already in a few places:
- File → "Import database from SQL" dialog. (code [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/684958b29ce3d26684d9142d73df773b11189d54/src/MainWindow.cpp#L1132))
- "Open SQL File" button in the Execute SQL tab. (code [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/684958b29ce3d26684d9142d73df773b11189d54/src/MainWindow.cpp#L1517))
Sounds like it's not working for you though, or it needs to be added in other places too?
Would you be ok to attach the screenshot using the web interface?
GitHub doesn't recognise images in attachments, so they just get dropped. 😦
Thanks, yep that worked. :smile:
With your `.sql` files, are they databases or saved SQL statements?  Asking because it's **unusual** to use the file extension `.sql` for actual database files.
Note - there's nothing technically stopping that from working though.
As a thought, this request can probably be considered a part of #659.  Once that's implemented, you'll be able to set any file extensions you want. :smile:
> They are sqlite3 files. I don't like such a long file extension
SQL is a language, and as such its 'common' for .sql files to contain SQL commands, thus the reason they're used in database import/export dialogs, etc.
A database isn't a collection of SQL commands, but instead, a collection of data.  It makes more 'sense' to use a .db extension to denote a database, rather than a collection of SQL commands.
As Justin says though, you can do whatever you want, but was just pointing out the 'reasons' why .sql isn't in that dialog by default.  As you like short extensions, changing to '.db' solves two problems - its in the dialog, and its a shorter file extension! :wink:
Yeah, this is a hard call.  If someone came along and suggested an extension that's not commonly used for a different purpose, there's a good chance we'd add it.  After all, it's would be unlikely to have a negative impact on anyone.
... but ".sql" isn't like that.  It's commonly used (including by us) for a specific purpose as **not** a database file. :wink:
This is **sort** of like if someone asked us to add ".doc" in the extension list for our opening/saving dialogs.  There's nothing technically stopping it working... but ".doc" is widely used for something else.
All is not lost though. :smile:
There are two potential solutions coming to mind, depending on how much effort you're ok with:
1. Adding new file extensions yourself is fairly simple.  There's only one line to you'd need to change:
- https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/684958b29ce3d26684d9142d73df773b11189d54/src/FileDialog.h#L20
You will need to compile DB4S yourself (with that line changed).  There are full, end to end instructions [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S) for installing the needed software (including the needed settings), and it walks through the entire process.
It's not complicated at all, it's just time consuming the first time around to download the bits, run their installers, etc.  We're happy to answer questions, if you're up for this and need assistance at points. :smile:
2. Wait for issue #659 to be completed.  With that done, you'll be able to add/remove the file extensions yourself through the Preferences dialog.
Workable? :smile:
Cool, no worries at all @bobatwhidbey. :smile:
Ouch.  Yep, that does sound like a bug.
@MKleusberg One for you?
This seems to be a bug in the SQLCipher encryption dialog. I've increased the max page size to 65536 (and the min page size from 1 to 512). Should be all good now :smiley: We don't have nightly builds for Windows with SQLCipher support yet, but if you want to test the changes, @TheOriginalWinCat, you can ask @justinclift to build you a once-off. He'll only need to know if you're running a 32bit or 64bit Windows installation :smile:
Awesome @MKleusberg, thank you. :smile:
@TheOriginalWinCat Would you have a few minutes to try out this build?
- http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-issue752v1-win64.exe
That has @MKleusberg's fix in it.  In testing here, it accept encryption key page sizes up to 65536 now, and the same works when unlocking a database too.
Verifying it from your point of view would be nifty. :smile:
Maybe the page size needs to be a proper power of two or something?  We can ask the SQLCipher people if that would be useful too. :smile:
@TheOriginalWinCat Ahhh, yeah.  We don't support System.Data.SQLite databases at this stage.
We **probably** won't either, unless someone submits patches to add the support (which we'll happily accept).
Don't suppose you're a C++ developer? :smile:
Heh Heh Heh, no worries at all. :wink:
Btw, this is a related issue also about System.Data.SQLite from just a few days ago: #739
It mentions a GUI called [SQLite2009 Pro](http://sqlite2009pro.azurewebsites.net), which seems like it would work.  It's home page shows was updated in 2014 as well, so it's not _completely_ ancient. :smile:
SQLite Studio is open source (and cross platform).  Haven't tried it with SDS created databases.
http://sqlitestudio.pl/
Closing this now, as the reported issue is fixed (in testing here), and we're unlikely to add support for System.Data.SQLite any time soon.
It seems to be having a problem with `&oacute;`.  Is that a typo for `&acute;` ?
To answer my own question... it's a real thing:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.fileformat.info/format/w3c/htmlentity.htm
Ahhh, good thinking. :smile:
Thanks @lulol, that looks good. :smile:
### Details for the issue
When built with Qt5 on OSX, DB4S isn't showing all of the table data.
The table info shows the correct total number of records, but the scroll bar isn't correctly scrolling to the bottom of them, and the page buttons don't work properly either.
It's a bit hard to describe using just words, so I'll do some screenrecording later today to show the problem in action.
This doesn't happen on Windows, and it also doesn't happen for Qt4 on OSX.  So, there's possibly something OSX specific about the problem.
This is a blocker to going Qt5 only. 😦

Yep, this is the one.  Figured it best to put in a separate issue, so we can track this one down as it's own thing.
Which reminds me, this really needs some screenrecording things of the bug in action to properly convey the problem.
Don't suppose you'd have the time/interest to do some?  If not, no worries, I will get around to it. :smile:
Ahhh.  I'm suspecting this is a different issue, though probably related.  But, both should be looked into.
@justinclift Did you have a chance to do a screen recording of the scrolling behaviour yet?
Also, does this happen for each table in every database, or just for some of them? Does it depend on the number of rows in a table or the size of the window (i.e. the number of rows shown on the screen)? Is it sort of random or are always the same rows missing?
Lots of questions, I know :wink: But I'm trying to narrow this down for easiest debugging since I don't have a OS X system available here.
Ahhh yeah, I really need to get around to that.
It happens for every table in the database, regardless of # of rows, table size, window size, etc.
My suspicion is it's something to do with the way we're paging things in the backend.  But no more idea than that.
Give me a bit, I'll compile it again and record it now.
k, screen recording here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/issue_uploads/DB4S_Issue_750v1.mp4
There is only one table in the database, so I wasn't able to show it with multiple tables, but it should be clear enough to show the problem.
Can provide the database too if that helps. :smile:
Ah interesting :smiley: Not entirely sure how to track this down though. Can you do me a favour and tell me the value in Preferences -> Database -> Prefetch block size as well as recording this again with the SQL log opened?
Yep, can do.  1 min. :smile:
Prefetch block size is "50000".
I'll do another recording now with the SQL log open.
With the SQL Log open:
- http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/issue_uploads/DB4S%20Issue%20750v2-50%25.mp4
- http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/issue_uploads/DB4S%20Issue%20750v2-75%25.mp4
Not sure how wide your screen is.  If the 75% one doesn't fit, try the 50% one.  The smaller one is kind of blurry though. 🙁
@MKleusberg As a thought towards debugging, maybe we should add some println() style statements to the SQL Log, showing the values of whatever seems appropriate?  I'm completely ok with compiling stuff and recording again.  I just don't know which things we'd be interested in. :wink:
@justinclift Yes, let's do that :smiley: To be honest, I still don't see the source of the problem, though it definitely feels like we're getting closer.
Can you try this hacky patch? Just scroll all the way down and paste the SQL log. No screen record needed this time :smiley:

It seems like the table inside the enclosing widget knows the full table size.  It's just the outside scroll thing seems clueless. 😦
It's completely possible to scroll to this false "end" (eg row 16670), then use the cursor keys to keep moving down.  The view window still doesn't move down though (eg still shows only up to row 16670).
Yeah, the problem seems to be with the scrollbar itself :confused: Let's do some further testing. Here's an updated patch. It needs to be applied on a clean head, i.e. not on the last patch. Again, I only need the SQL log.

Hmmm, those row values in the bottom left.  eg: `16657 - 16670 of 499723`
Looking at the .ui and source, that "to" value (the middle one), seems to be getting involved with the false maximum:
- https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/969e263e5bf71e63df8ee908cb4a2014b9a55c9b/src/MainWindow.cpp#L680
The code for that line is:
``` cpp
int to = ui->dataTable->verticalHeader()->visualIndexAt(ui->dataTable->height()) - 1;
```
Perhaps either `dataTable->height()` is returning the wrong value, or the `visualIndexAt()` method isn't getting things correct.  Maybe some println() from that would help? :smile:
Actually, I'll try adding a few here and see what shows up. :smile:
I think the code in MainWindow.cpp is working correctly. All it does is getting the row numbers of the first and the last visible row in the table view. And as far as I can tell from your videos it's doing that correctly. So the problem must be in the table view somewhere and the fale maximum value at the bottom is just an effect of that.
The scrollbar is also being set as expected. Looking at your screen recordings now, it seems like the scrollbar is doing exactly what it's supposed to do, triggering prefetches where it's at least plausible to do so. But the table view seems to be lagging and getting out of sync.
You're probably right.  If it helps though, this is the output from scrolling to the end of the table, using this [simple patch](https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/commit/def049a8d314f8e4f6cd5fdfca76c6d6077ffcfc) on top of your 2nd one:

Hmmm, looking at my output first (I'll try your patch in a second), that visualIndexAt() call is definitely returning incorrect values.
k, I'll try your patch next.  Gimme a minute. :smile:
The dataTableHeight value in your log is constant. No idea if it's correct but it looks plausible. And it definitely should be constant as long as you don't resize the window. So as far as that goes it looks all good. The to value is wrong of course, but that's ok as long it's correct in relation to the from value: it should be the from value plus 14 or 15 in your case.
Why not use qobject_casts?
Yeah, the "from" value is 16658, the "to" value is 16670.  No worries with that then. :wink:

In this I've also changed the cast to qobject_cast for Vlad :wink:
No worries, will try in a second.
Does it help that I can breakpoint on things, and potentially go poking around for values to look at? eg:

The position_\* values seem like we're getting closer. :smile:
The only question is why they aren't even close to the `value` value.
Can you try setting the Prefetch value in the Preferences dialog to 500000 and see what happens? If there are still problems it's definitely not the prefetching that's causing trouble here.
Same problem.  Damn. 😦
And the output from it, just to verify the prefetch is 1/2 mill:
```
SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_master UNION SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_temp_master;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,* FROM `download_counts` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,* FROM `download_counts` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC LIMIT 0, 500000;
ExtendedTableWidget::updateGeometries -> totalRowCount=499723, numVisibleRows=14.

ExtendedTableWidget::updateGeometries -> totalRowCount=499723, numVisibleRows=14.
ExtendedTableWidget::updateGeometries -> totalRowCount=499723, numVisibleRows=14.
```
And there are no more appearances of `ExtendedTableWidget::vscrollbarChanged` lines in the log I guess? Also I'm now online in Gitter, so we can chat there :smiley:
@MarqueIV Makes sense to me. :smile:
I was thinking about something similar, too. But it looks like we're not really interfering with the scrolling in any way. As long as the window isn't resized and there are no prefetches to be made (we disabled that by setting the block size to 500k), we're not doing anything that would affect scrolling. At least I think so.
🎉   Fixed by @revolter in https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/e5bca9d2dbeb92cc18cda9d0d217a8480e871a08. 🎉  😁
Well, there are the nightly builds.
Are you waiting on something in particular? :smile:
There is a possibility of us doing a 3.9.2 release in the near future, with stuff like this + memory leaks and some other minor stuff included.  But, that's not guaranteed to happen, it's just an idea being considered. :smile:
No worries at all. :smile:
Aside from a potential 3.9.2 release, the next major release will be 3.10.0, and we don't really have a firm timeline for that yet.  The main thing's we're wanting to get into 3.10.x are better [foreign key/constraint support](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/projects/2), and also "reasonably ok" integration with our new [DBHub.io](https://dbhub.io) project.
Coding on DBHub.io hasn't even begun, so it's hard to tell.  Probably have the very first alpha(s) in a few weeks though (~start of November?), mostly to get people testing DBHub integration + report back bugs / suggestions. :smile:
@karim Thanks for pointing this out.  This is happening here too on a freshly installed system.
It sounds like we need to adjust how the default font values are chosen and displayed in Preferences, so that it's not blank/incorrect like in your screenshots.
@karim if I send a fix in next few minutes(via PR), are you able to test it?
@justinclift says he can reproduce it, so I hope he will test changes.
@innermous Yep, I can test it here. :smile:
I can also build a package for @karim to test with on Windows too.  One of my VM snapshots has everything set up for building, I just need to give it updated source code. 😀
Building it now.  Gimme 15+ minutes, as the build server isn't super fast. :wink:
@karim As a side note, if you're ever interested in building it yourself, we added step-by-step instructions to set up the development environment then do the build here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S
It's not tricky at all... just very time consuming the first time around. 😼
- http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-3.9.0-issue749v1-win64.exe
It's the 3.9.0 release + @innermous's potential fix.
@innermous It works for me, testing on a fresh Win 8.1 VM.
It fixed the blank "Font" field in the "Data Browser" tab.  The concept seems good. :smile:
The same adjustment needs to be done for the "SQL editor font" in the "SQL" tab too, when you commit it.
Fixed [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/b15c7f20a5c735f6e059d6e5a7a91df435a3526a).
We need to get the other field fixed too. :wink:
As a thought, if you use the binary editing mode in the "Edit Database Cell" panel much, try setting the "Data Browser" Font field to Courier.  Or any other fixed width font really.
The binary editing mode seems to look weird using a font that's not fixed width, at least on my system. :wink:
No worries at all.  I use keyboard navigation a lot too when editing text data. :smile:
- http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-3.9.0-issue749v2-win64.exe
In theory, that should be fixed for both of the font fields. :smile:
Hmmm, from memory, it should be controllable through the Preferences.  I **think** it's the "SQL editor font" option in the "SQL" tab, but don't quote me on that. :wink:
I'd have to look at the code to be sure, and I've closed down that VM.
If it's important to you though, I can look over it in the morning to refresh my memory.  Just let me know. :smile:
You're welcome @karim.  Thanks for reporting this and testing the fixes.  It definitely helps. :smile:
@innermous Will your fix for #744 solve this one too?
1. Not related to #744, it was about schema tree structure.
2. It is already fixed a week ago, use nightly build.
Would you be ok to try out [the latest nightly build for Windows](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser#windows), and let us know if it's fixed for you?
The download locations are on our front page, if that helps.
Awesome. :smile:
I'll close this now then, as the code is available in our nightlies, and will be in the next major release too. :smile:
Ahhh, that's interesting.  We changed the name of the command from "sqlitebrowser" to "DB Browser for SQLite".
But, that might not have been a great idea for people used to launching it from the command line. 😦
Depending on which shell you have configured, it **might** be possible to launch it by typing `DB` then hitting tab for autocompletion.
If that doesn't work, it's probably possible to create a `sqlitebrowser` soft link to the new "DB Browser for SQLite" executable.  eg using something like:
```
$ cd bin
$ ln -s "/path/to/new/DB Browser for SQLite" "sqlitebrowser"
```
As long as the "sqlitebrowser" soft link is in your PATH, it should work.
Does that help?
Btw, out of curiosity, did you update using the .dmg from the release page?
Yep, please share it.  It's better to see the error, just in case it is important. :smile:
Thanks.  That warning isn't a problem, you can ignore it. :smile:
Ahhhh.  Try using `qmake` instead of `cmake`, using the steps here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
The `qmake` then `make` commands at least should work (in theory).
It will generate an .app bundle though, which I'm not sure you want. 😦
Cool. :smile:
Yeah, the new DB<tab> approach is probably the way to go. :wink:
Yep, in theory this should work.
However... it seems like I broke the file extensions again with this release by changing the installation path. 😦
We have a now-outdated wiki entry for the old location:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Windows-File-Associations
The concept mentioned in it is correct, although the paths need updating for this new release.
I'll spin up a Windows VM now, and see if I can figure it out. :smile:
Actually, I think this might be a duplicate report for an existing (much older) report of the same breakage.  But, lets get this fixed for now, and we can figure out the duplicate-or-not later.
Hmmm, investigating this more, it seems like association with file extensions isn't something we've **yet** done automatically (or given an option for).
But, because almost everyone uses file extensions for this exact purpose :smile:, everyone has been creating the extensions manually (eg using Windows Explorer).
Two bits of thought arise for this:
a) Changing the installation path - which I did for this release - will probably break the existing (manually created) file associations everyone has set up.  Ouch. 😦
b) We really should offer to set up the file associations, either during installation, and/or through our "Preferences" dialog.  That should solve a) above too. :smile:
@AdamPS I can investigate the this stuff, but it's not going to generate an immediate solution.  In the meantime, you should be able to manually create the association from whichever extensions you want, to DB4S.
If you're not sure how, let me know.  I just took a bunch of screenshot for the process while trying things out, and can put them somewhere useful as an step-by-step sequence. :smile:
Found it, #279 is the older issue about this too.
@AdamPS I'll close this issue now as a duplicate, and we can continue to get a solution in place through the older issue. :smile:
Thanks for reporting this @Swabek, this is definitely a bug.
It's happening here on OSX too, so this isn't just a Windows thing either.
@justinclift it's not even close to bug, it's intended behavior by someone who've written that code.
Every time on changing current tab it wipes whole dbstructuremodel and fills it from scratch.
It sounds like they may have tried to "keep it safe", and got it wrong. :wink:
Should be more or less fixed by 684958b29ce3d26684d9142d73df773b11189d54 which I committed yesterday. The DB schema view will still reset as soon as the DB schema actually changes but at least it doesn't happen on each and every tab change anymore :wink:
@Swabek Currently our nightly builds are broken but I hope they'll be up and running this or the next night. As soon as that's done you'll be able to test the changes and report back if it's working for you :smiley:
As the initial issue was solved, can we close this? And maybe @Swabek opens a separate issue for the last problem (if one wasn't already created).
Moved this to 3.10.0 instead of 3.9.1, as the commit makes a _lot_ of changes.  It doesn't apply cleanly to current 3.9.x source, and doing it manually isn't really appealing. :wink:
Ouch, that doesn't sound good at all.
If not, no stress, I can still try tomorrow using a made up database here. :smile:
Thanks @rudolf323.
I'll install Chrome in a VM tomorrow and see what's going on. :smile:
We might be releasing a v3.9.1 in near future after all. :wink:
Just in case it turns out to make a difference, which version of Windows are you running?
Thanks @rudolf323. :smile:
@rudolf323 With this, I haven't yet tried out the Chrome extension.  Something popped into mind though, which might explain the problem.
In the export dialog (_File_ → _Export_ → _Export data as CSV_), the drop down option at the bottom is "New line characters":
![screen shot 2016-08-25 at 15 02 08](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17972022/380802ea-6ad5-11e6-9fc5-89aa25f863e7.png)
For that, does the corruption go away if that's set to the Windows option?
Do you have time to give that a try, and let us know if it helps? :smile:
Awesome, that's good news. :smile:
@goozak Thanks for pointing this out.
I remember seeing this as well when testing the NSIS package, but completely forgot about it.
We'll investigate this in time for the next release.  In the meantime... damn. 😦
In theory, it's probably just something simple in our NSIS package generation variables:
- https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/efba2eb388cec6260cd24d6077ce357d1d6a3fd9/CMakeLists.txt#L374-L406
- http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-201608291559-win64.exe
With that build - for me - the correct entry is now appearing again in Add/Remove programs.
It'd be really helpful if you have time to verify it from your point of view. :smile:
Thanks @goozak that's one bit solved at least. :smile:
With the uninstaller not checking for files in use... ouch. 👿
Not sure if it's something we can control, but I'll take a look and find out. :smile:
The NSIS (3.0) uninstaller itself has exactly the same problem.
It _might_ be fixable by using a different Windows packaging mechanism (eg [WiX](http://wixtoolset.org) or [Inno Setup](http://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)), but we're unlikely to change over in the near/medium future.
Going to close this now, as there's probably not much more we can do at this stage. :smile:
Ahhh, that's interesting.  Hadn't seen that. :smile:
Our grammar parser needs some more stress-testing, I think. The grammar parser is the part that tries to understand the `CREATE TABLE ...` statements and extract all the information on the table. So testing it is as simple as creating a new database, adding a table (via SQL), opening it in the Edit Table dialog and see the SQL code it prints. If there is something missing, that's a bug. Or if you have a database and notice that some existing table isn't fully parsed, it's a bug, too, of course.
If you are more of a systematic person, you can check out the diagrams at https://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html and try out the various combinations and keywords mentioned in there.
There are some features which we know are missing. These are:
- [x] Named constraints (names for unique/primary key/foreign key constraints)
- [ ] Sorted indices (ASC/DESC in primary key/unique constraints)
- [ ] The COLLATE keyword and all its uses
- [x] Primary keys with multiple columns in it
But there are certainly more :smiley: So I want to encourage everybody who stumbles upon another issue to open a new issue for it.
Also there are some parts that our parser understands (multiple columns in a unique constraint for example) but you aren't able to create or edit using the UI - only using SQL. Every one of these is worth opening an issue, too :wink: Just make it clear whether it's a problem with the parser or the dialog.
Thanks to all helping to make the grammar parsing as complete as possible for the next release :smiley:
@MarqueIV With the behaviour you're describing, how recent a build of DB4S is that?
Asking because @MKleusberg has been improving the constraints handling code over the last few days, including adding a warning message when our parser can't understand all of the constraints.
If you've the time/interest, trying the nightly build out (tomorrow) and seeing if that problem still happens would be useful. :smile:
Awesome. :smile:
The nightly builds for OSX are here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx/
@MarqueIV Yes, this might be related. But either way it definitely sounds like a bug :smiley: Unfortunately I can't reproduce this using one of my test database. So I'm afraid you have to send me that 20MB file; maybe you can zip it though or upload it somewhere.
In the latest nightly (9 Sep) the parser seems broken for multiple lines...
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/18404358/174da74e-76e2-11e6-86f9-350352d50168.png)
This occurs if you click the 'Execute current line' button.  Previous versions parsed the line to be up to the next semi colon.
It might be from this commit by @revolter yesterday: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/55d8905b904ac57cf759db3b235b1ce27ab8c8a5
Oops, now I feel guilty...:wink:
Ups, sorry. So should a line mean a text line or an SQL line (up until the first semi colon)?
A line should be up to a semi-colon, so lines can be split.  Its more readable creating a table like:
`create table blah (`
`id text,`
`piddlePop integer,`
but thats just me... :wink:
I'm working now on a fix.
Well, It didn't work ok in 3.8.0 too. I'm working of a proper fix.
Also merged this into the master branch (after running `lupdate` on it).
Looks good there too. :smile:
Hmmm, it's unlikely.  Out of curiosity, do you know if that part of .Net is one which MS have Open Sourced?
Ahhhh sorry, my bad.  Are you meaning this?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki
Ahhhh.  I understand part of it.
The System.Data.SQLite software can add RSA encryption to files.
Do you know if it uses [the official "SEE" encryption](https://www.sqlite.org/see/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki), or if it uses something else?
Thanks @Disactive, it's making sense now. :smile:
We've taken a quick look at the System.Data.SQLite bits... and it doesn't really seem like there's much benefit to implementing that in DB4S.
It might be possible to adjust our SQLite layer to use that, but it's probably a fair amount of work.  It would only give us version basic encryption too, unlike the strong encryption in SQLCipher.
If you have C++/Qt skill though, and are willing to do the work, we're happy to accept good patches. :smile:
What do you think?
Hmmm. It sounds like a lot of work needed on our part. 😦
Sorry, but this is very unlikely to happen unless someone willing to do the work themselves gets involved.  I'm going to close this issue, but if someone **is** willing to do the needed work to implement this, they're welcome to reopen it and get it done. :smile:
Just a nod that this (or similar) came up recently on the system.data.sqlite mailing list.  Dr Richard Hipp mentioned System.data.sqlite can be recompiled to use SEE, rather than its own encryption library.
> I am working on a project using the System.Data.SQLite .net Classes. I
> use the encryption available with this classes.
> Is the encryption used by System.Data.SQLite when setting a password
> compatible with the encryption used in the SEE version of SQLite?
No.  Databases encrypted by the legacy encryption mechanism in SDS are
not readable or writable with SEE, and vice versa.
SDS can be recompiled to use SEE.
Hmmm, if System.Data.SQLite could be recompiled to use SQLCipher, that might make things easier.
It's not something I'm personally interested in, but @Disactive may want to ask about it on [the SQLCipher forums](https://discuss.zetetic.net/c/sqlcipher).
Thanks @MarqueIV, that's a very timely report. :smile:
We have an open ToDo list item for [signing our releases](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/711), but weren't thinking to get it done just yet.
Sounds like it should be a higher priority.  I'll spend some time looking into it today/tomorrow, and see if it's possible to get tomorrow's release signed in time.
For macOS Sierra itself... might be time to get my Apple Dev Membership renewed, and start looking through the beta too.  Not sure when though. :wink:
Thanks Mark. :smile:
It looks like the Apple Developer staff work on weekends, and they just sorted out the paperwork for that side of things.  Now.. reading time. :smile:
It's taken some doing, but I **think** signing on OSX is working ok now.
@MarqueIV If you have a few minutes to try it, please grab this latest build (3.9.x series) and test if OSX throws up a warning when trying to run it:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx-prerelease/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-3.9.0-beta2.dmg
In theory the signature is all good, OSX is happy, etc.  But... would prefer some people (other than me) test it first, just to be on the safe side. :smile:
@MarqueIV Tested the latest nightly build on macOS Sierra (newly installed "Version 10.12 Beta (16A239m)") just now:
&bull; &nbsp; https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx/Older%20Versions/Aug%202016/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-sqlcipher_20160822.dmg
Two fairly concerning problems show up immediately, though both seem more like bugs with Sierra.
When trying to mount the .dmg on Sierra through Finder, it claims the .dmg is damaged and should be moved to the trash.  The .dmg is actually fine, as mounting it from the command line poses no issue:
```

```
After dragging and dropping the DB4S icon to Applications... DB4S refuses to start, claiming it's damaged.  Again, this is just plain wrong, as launching it directly from the command line works fine:
```
$ /Applications/DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite.app/Contents/MacOS/DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite
[the application starts fine, seems to work ok, and preferences are stored between runs]
```
It's signature seems ok too:
```
$ codesign --verify --verbose /Applications/DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite.app
/Applications/DB Browser for SQLite.app: valid on disk
/Applications/DB Browser for SQLite.app: satisfies its Designated Requirement
```
Note - I haven't tried with any of the older, unsigned builds.  It's completely possible they'll have different behaviour.
Hmmm, Sierra is saying there is a new update available (Beta 7).  Going to give that a try too, just in case it fixes the bugs seen above.
It's interesting about the 3.9.99 nightly build not properly browsing data.
Something like that happened on my system a while back.  eg In a database with 140,000+ records... The Browse Data tab would only show (say) up to the ~18,000th one using the slider and/or the controls.  Literally no way to see all of the data. 😦
That wasn't happening for anyone else though, so I thought it was just something on my system.
From memory, when building using um... Qt4 I think... that problem went away.
I'll look into it again.  It might be another Qt4/Qt5 difference we need to solve before switching to Qt5-only.
Interesting.  Sounds like the code around this needs a bit of love and attention.
Will take a look in a few days. :smile:
Found the reason for the weird error with Sierra claiming the .dmg and .app were damaged.  It's because Sophos anti-virus was installed prior to the upgrade.  Seems like it doesn't work with Sierra (or at least doesn't survive the upgrade process), but leave enough of it's remnants behind to break application launching.
After redoing the upgrade without Sophos, that problem has gone away.  The signed version of DB4S seems happy too.
Haven't investigated the default preferences yet, nor tried out the newer "beta 7".  Will probably do so later on today.
Not sure what the root cause is yet, but the problem of all data not being shown does go away when building with Qt4.
We'll probably build this release with Qt4 then, and figure out the proper cause/fix afterwards.
As a data point, this bug with all of the data not being shown isn't happening on Win64.
Seems like it might really be an OSX-only bug. 😦
@MarqueIV Would you have time to test this?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx-prerelease/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-3.9.0-beta3.dmg
That one should allow you to see all of the data.  The only real change is that it's using Qt4 instead of Qt5.
But, Qt4 is "good enough" for the moment.  We'll do the switch to Qt5 when all of the potential issues are resolved.
I'll look through our preferences code now, to see if something obvious jumps out.  Otherwise, this will have to be figured out at a later time.  It sounds like a Sierra-only bug, and may not be affecting everyone.
With your Sierra setup, is it a VM, or physical hardware, or ?
Just wondering on the details, in case something springs to mind from them. :smile:
@justinclift, All the background colors (`*_bg_colour`) are [defaulting to white](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/078c48d6791238c68c370c5d8b15968db9e43706/src/PreferencesDialog.cpp#L296-L305), so it looks like maybe it's a Qt bug?
@revolter Yep, that's possible.  It's going to be hard to figure out the problem unless we can replicate it.
Your CV shows in-depth programming skills, including C++.  So, it's probably right in your skill set. 😀
Setting up a DB4S development environment on OSX is fairly easy, if that helps.
No idea why it's black on black. The default, in the case that there is no config file, is black on white (https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/PreferencesDialog.cpp#L282). How are settings stored on MacOS anyway? Do they have config files or something like a Windows registry? In the latter case Sierra could at least in theory send Null values which we wouldn't notice because 0 is not no value.
@MarqueIV Wiping the preference files is an interesting thought.
For my OSX 10.9.5 desktop, this is where they are for my user:
```
$ ls -la Library/Preferences/*sqlitebrowser*
-rw-------  1 jc  staff  8286 25 Aug 11:25 Library/Preferences/com.sqlitebrowser.sqlitebrowser.plist
-rw-------  1 jc  staff   203 23 Aug 15:54 Library/Preferences/net.sourceforge.sqlitebrowser.plist
-rw-------  1 jc  staff   101  7 May 15:39 Library/Preferences/sqlitebrowser.plist
```
And yeah... spread out.  Trying to maintain compatibility with historical releases, so people (in theory) don't have to setup their preferences again just because they upgraded. :wink:
Checking Sierra, they're in the same place too.  Deleting those files should just mean they're recreated on the next run.  But yeah, one way to find out. :smile:
If you're still up for that, try with the installers from yesterday's 3.9.0 official release:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.0
@justinclift, Did / Can you test this on El Capitan?
I can, but not right now. :wink:
Nope, not yet.  @revolter was just meaning I should test it on El Capitan to see if it's a Sierra only thing. :wink:
As an initial workaround (emailed to me directly, thanks Roger! :smile:), this seems to effectively force DB4S to use the defaults for each session:
```
$ rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.sqlitebrowser.sqlitebrowser.plist
$ ln -s /dev/null ~/Library/Preferences/com.sqlitebrowser.sqlitebrowser.plist
$ ls -l ~/Library/Preferences/com.sqlitebrowser.sqlitebrowser.plist
lrwxr-xr-x  1 roger  staff  9 22 Nov 18:36 /Users/roger/Library/Preferences/com.sqlitebrowser.sqlitebrowser.plist -> /dev/null
```
Hopefully I have to look into this properly in a few weeks to get it fixed "the right way". :smile: Interesting.  If I update the OSX utils on the build box, are you ok to try out the tomorrow's nightly build? Awesome. Just finished updating everything on the build server, then ran a new build manually instead.
When you have a minute, please try out these two and let me know if they're ok:
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx-prerelease/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite_3.9.1v2.dmg
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx-prerelease/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-sqlcipher_3.9.1v2.dmg
If they are, we can add them to the 3.9.1 release page and point the Sierra users towards those. :smile: Excellent Gunnar, that's good news.  I'll add the new build to the 3.9.1 release tomorrow (need sleep atm).
The build itself was done from the 3.9.x branch, which is pretty much the same as 3.9.1 but (from memory) with a few translation updates as well.  It should be fairly similar to the existing 3.9.1, with no real possibility of extra bugs introduced. The 3.9.1 Releases page is now updated with the new OSX binary, and the website points to it now too.
Cool, closing this now then.  If it turns out to still be a problem after all, I'm sure someone will make an Issue for it. 😁  Thanks for the effort you've put in to chase this problem Gunnar, it's definitely helped. :smile: @ghellquist A big thanks from me too! @jtlowe Excellent, that's good info. :smile: As @jtlowe said, I think you need to delete the preferences file (while DB4S is closed), as they might be corrupted or something. You can do so from terminal by running this command in terminal:
rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.sqlitebrowser.sqlitebrowser.plist
or by simply going to that location and manually removing that file.
@jtlowe, Correct me if I'm wrong. Interesting.  It sounds like the Qt fix might not be as complete as we were thinking.
@revolter @jtlowe Yep, that does sound like a new bug.  Seems like a serialisation problem.  Do either of you have time to create an Issue for it? (if not, I can do it) :smile: @justinclift, Done. Excellent, thanks @revolter. :smile:  Thanks @progh2, I will go through this soon. :smile:
@progh2 Well done, this looks very good. :smile:
There is one small piece I'm not sure about.  In the "Edit Pragmas" tab in MainWindow.ui, some of the English strings seem to be untranslated.
If that's how they're supposed to be though, that's not a problem. :smile:

### Details for the issue
<!--
Thanks for coming here to report an issue. :)
Please describe it in this section, fill out the correct check boxes
below with an "x", then click the "Submit new issue" button at the bottom
-->
When entering multi-line data in DB4S, the data is changed so that CRLF is changed to LF.
Possibly.
Please see this screencast.
http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cDjo29iM8o
I enter 123 456 789 (split on 3 lines) from my Windows program.  This loads and saves fine.  DB4S shows this as 3  lines.  If I add a further line, 000, my program now sees it as one string.  HOWEVER, if I press the right arrow at a set interval (not easy to pick up as there is no audio!) you can see the cursor 'stick' where the new lines should be - the textbox is seeing a LF but being Windows, doesn't know what to do with it.
Exporting the field to a text file and viewing that in Notepad++, shows LFs, not CRLFs.
Exporting the field the first time, showed CRLFs.
Notepad++ sees it as a 'Unix' file.
Viewing the field in DB4S correctly shows the 4 lines.  Copying that to the clipboard correctly shows CRLFs.  Its as if the data is wrong, but DB4S 'corrects' it.

Additional testing.  Correcting the text in DB4S mangles it further.  A mix of CRLF and LF.  However, additional saving DOES NOT mangle it further (ie, editing does not compound the issue)

Ahhh, that's interesting.  As a quick thought, would you be ok to try the [3.9.0 beta1 for Windows](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.0-beta1)?
A lot of the copy-paste code was changed around just before release, and it seemed to pass all of the (rather basic) testing we did on it.
I didn't specifically check for CR/LF characters being kept unchanged though, so this bug **_might**_ still be present.
Just tried the beta with the same results.
http://screencast-o-matic.com/u/hnsz/stripped1
In further testing, I exported the field to a text file, converted it back to CRLF, imported it, confirmed all the fields in DB4S were showing OK, and exported again to show back to LF.
http://screencast-o-matic.com/u/hnsz/stripped2
Just to confirm, as someone will probably say, "the data is OK, but the exporting is borked", but my application doesn't like the data in the database, so the raw data is LF, not CRLF.  I've viewed the database in binary format and also confirmed this.
http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cDjDQmiLuY
One last screencast.  Promise.  I added 0d codes to the field so that it was od 0a (I understand thats binary for CRLF).  Switched to text and saw the World was good.  Switched back to binary, and SWITCHEROOO!  Clang!  Thanks DB4S! :wink:
I entered 0e by purpose just to see if it was stripping characters anyway, but then added a random 0d on its own, and that was converted too.
Its a bit naughty its having to do any 'conversion' or data manipulation anyway, isn't it?  Surely if I want LFs or CRLFs, it should display that, as it must be there for a purpose.  For it to decide, "hey, you've got this data in your database.  I'll just tweak that for you..... " seems a bit scary.
Thanks Chris. :smile:
The original screencast URL wasn't working for me at first yesterday, but seems to be now.  So, the new ones will probably be workable too.
I'll try them out in a bit, I just need to finish some other things first. :smile:
Reading through this bit again:

Yep, that's super clear.  It's a side effect of the data being stored in one format for the hex editor, [then being converted to plain text](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/4d29271954c69148d7b61531202d29415ea56759/src/EditDialog.cpp#L124) for display in the text editor. ([and vice versa](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/4d29271954c69148d7b61531202d29415ea56759/src/EditDialog.cpp#L354))
The central reason is these editor views have their own buffers... they can't share, and they require different data formats.
But, it may be possible to fix this.  It'll need some thinking about, and probably some experimentation to get right.
Almost no chance of this bit being fixed for 3.9.0, but the 3.10.0 release is possibly feasible. :smile:
Can't the viewers just view 'as is' rather than 'converting'?  There may be a reason (especially if HTML code) for CRLFs and LFs.  Thats the nice thing with the binary view - WYSIRWYG!  (...really what you get!)
It'd be fantastic if it was that simple. 😁
For the hex editing view, that's the closest thing to what you describe.  It's a view into a literal array of bytes.  No weirdness involved.
The text editor though is [one of these](https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qtextedit.html).  It has it's own internal buffer which seems to be a [very text oriented data type managed by Qt](https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qtextdocument.html), and not a byte array.  The conversion problem seems to be biting when going between these two., as these two widgets can't just share data. 😦
Well, that's my understanding of it so far.  It might turn out there are ways to accomplish it.  Just not sure at the moment.
In the worst case scenario, we **might** be able to subclass the QtTextEdit box that's used, to include some non-corrupting import/export functions.  No idea yet...
All help is welcome though, if you're keen to dig into it. 😁
_backs slowly away..._ :wink:  I was following you up to "simple"....
Would it be a good idea to always pass to `EditDialog::loadData(const QByteArray& data)` only the data from the database cell instead of taking it from some other buffer when changing editing mode? Though that would introduce questions like how to deal with unsaved data, i.e. when `Apply` has not been pressed.  Thanks, will do.  I'm going to get some sleep now, but will go through this in good detail tomorrow. :smile:
This is pretty well done. :smile:
There is some kind of problem to do with the CipherDialog.ui menu option, for setting an encryption key.  The menu option isn't showing up at all, though it does for other languages.
With MainWindow.ui, the strings tab for editing Pragmas are a mixture of English and Brazilian Portuguese.  It looks kind of strange. :wink:
With the languages updated so far, the strings in that tab have generally been either all English, or all [the translated language].  So, yeah... unsure of the right approach here.  Would appreciate your thoughts. :smile:

Something seems to be wrong here, as the File menu option to set the encryption key is not showing up.  It shows up for other languages though.
I can investigate this later on today. :smile:

The Brazilian Portuguese string is `Configurar Encriptação`.
It turns out that **any** string starting with the word "Config" is being removed without any warnings/errors/etc.
Not sure exactly why this is happening.  Suspecting it is because Qt on OSX is confusing it with the string for "Preferences".  On OSX, Qt automatically moves the "Preferences" item to a separate menu.
As a possibly easy solution, is there an alternative translation string that could be used? :smile:
Sure, no worries at all.
The exact string in English is:
```
```
And yeah, it's definitely a cheap workaround. 😦
Ahhh, understood.  Screenshot coming up. :smile:
Does this help?

A possible better solution for the missing menu item has been suggested through the #qt channel on IRC:
```
15:50 <@peppe> justinclift: or, actually: give all of your action proper menu roles
```
I'll try that shortly. :smile:
No need to figure out an alternative approach. 😁
The fix has been added to the `master` and `v3.9.x` branches.
No need to sign anything at all.  I'll merge this here in a minute.  Hopefully that's one less thing to stress about!
@mvt91 I'll go through this in detail soon, making screenshots to verify things, and look into the Plot view too. :smile:
(the other bits I'll answer via email :wink:)
Thanks Michel, this also looks very complete. :smile:

- EditDialog.ui - Unsure about this.  The `:` seems to be in the wrong position, but both the .ts file and .cpp files seem to have it correct.  So I'm not sure what is going wrong. 😕
`tr("Type of data currently in cell: %1 Image")`
```
<message>
<location filename="../EditDialog.ui" line="187"/>
<source>Type of data currently in cell</source>
<translation>Type des données actuellement dans la cellule</translation>
</message>
```
- ExportSqlDialog.ui - Is the dialog heading correct?
The screenshots below might help.  I'll look into the plot settings shortly as well.  It's not an area of our code I have investigated before, but now is a good time to start. :smile:

Ahhh, yeah.  We're creating the release packages for our new "3.9.0 beta 1" release right now.  That should be released later on today.  If no serious bugs show up, then the "3.9.0" full release will probably be next weekend. 😁
Btw, a  separate branch ("[v3.9.x](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/v3.9.x/src/translations/sqlb_fr.ts)") was created in git for this new 3.9.x series just a few days ago.
I should have applied your .ts file to that branch for the screenshots, but it's not important because there are no English string differences yet.  Between 3.9.x branch, and our current main development branch "master" for 3.10.x that is.
For compiling the program under Mint, in theory it should be the same as for Qt4:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#ubuntu-linux
Just... see if there is a Qt5 version `libqt5-dev` (?) of the development files instead.  DB4S **should** compile with either Qt4, or Qt5.
But having both `libqt4-dev` & `libqt5-dev` on the same system at the same time might confuse it.  One way to find out. :smile:
With the height of the SQLCipher window, we should be able to make it variable.  It does look too wide at the moment for almost every language.
So, feel free to put in some line breaks, and we can adjust the sizing of that window before the proper 3.9.0 release next weekend. :smile:
This is looking Awesome now @mvt91! Thank you heaps! 😁
With the Plot dock... I haven't looked at it yet.  It will need to be a task for tomorrow instead of today, as my brain is fairly melted from looking at the computer too long atm. 😇

Cool. :grin:
When you saw "Done", are you meaning "Justin, please check your email for an updated.ts file?"
Asking because if you tried to attach the file to this GitHub Issue, that doesn't work.  The GitHub Issue system seems to ignore email attachments. 😦
By the way, we created a "[Translators](https://github.com/orgs/sqlitebrowser/teams/translators)" team for the sqlitebrowser org here on GitHub.
It doesn't give write access to anything, but shows you're a "member of the team" for anyone that looks. :smile:
Any interest in being added to that?
Adding these, just in case they're helpful. :smile:

@mvt91 Is this ok to merge as-is? :smile:
Fantastic!  Thank you for putting the time into this @mvt91. :smile:
Ahhh, interesting.
Would you be ok to try the latest nightly build?  It has a **bunch** of bug fixes in it, some of which affect things like this.  There's a good chance this is already fixed in that. :smile:
As a side thought... are you using the 32-bit or 64-bit build on Windows?  Asking because I'm creating the Windows packages for our "3.9.0 beta1" release today.  If you have time to test for the bug in that, it would be nifty. 😁
Interesting about the schema.  Not sure we've done any fixes in that area of code, so it might still be present. 😦
Btw, with `4.` above, what drops the table before it gets re-created?
Oh, I guess that's what you're meaning with `...`.  Didn't realise. :wink:
It's possible that `Refresh Data` only refreshes the ... data 😄
Clearly the bug is fixed. Remembered I had the same problem: #496
Awesome, thanks guys. :smile:
Can you test the nightly build tomorrow?
@revolter those were not related to hex editor in Editor Dock.
He was meaning the code before, where you fixed the Copy/Paste handling. 😁
@justinclift I don't understand what you are talking about.
@justinclift, @innermous is right, this issue is about the Edit Dock, sorry!
Oops. :smile:
Thinking about this a bit more... could part of the problem be how we detect BLOB's?
eg Valid unicode text with \0 inside it
Dude, it has nothing to do with anything like blobs or nulls or whatever you are thinking. This is just not related. This is not related to my commits either.
It's wrong behavior of textedit itself for some reason. Key word is _Unicode_...
Hm. I can't reproduce it here on archlinux.
It's possible this is only happening on Windows.  I can try giving it a shot here on a Windows PC in the next few days.
Thanks @lulol, I'll go through it now. :smile:
Excellent, this looks very complete. :smile:
Only two queries with it, though I'm being picky with them. :wink:
- For ImportCsvDialog.ui, there is an & in the text which I'm unsure of.
- With the 4th screenshot for the Preferences dialog, one of the lines doesn't start with a capital letter, unlike the rest.  It kind of looks strange (to me).  But if it's meant to be that way, then no worries. 😀

Also noticed a slightly different problem, which I'm not sure how to fix.  It almost seems like a Qt bug, because this isn't a dialog we have layout control over.
![screen shot 2016-08-10 at 19 37 56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17566457/5c0af4a2-5f33-11e6-8fd1-aba44f362ee0.png)
As an idea, is there a shorter alternative for the words that might fit instead?
Thanks, will double check them, then merge (assuming no problems seen here). :smile:
Going to get food first though. :wink:
I'll rebuild this with Qt5 in a bit, and see if they still show up the same.  If they do... I'll file a bug with the Qt project, and see if something useful turns up there. :smile:
Make changes and force push. Or just add another commit to branch (I hope Justin will do squash merge :smile: )
Yeah, I'll squash these into one commit.  I've learned my lesson about that. 😁
Excellent stuff @lulol.  It's all good here, so merging now: :smile:

When built using Qt5, the dialog doesn't have the _"Ficheros de"_ problem:
![screen shot 2016-08-10 at 21 47 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17570466/6b4b2598-5f44-11e6-80bb-1c17a4f5d3ca.png)
However, the buttons are not translated.  They might be using up the system language (still English) rather than the DB4S language.  I'll try changing my system-wide language to Spanish later, and see what happens.
The text on the buttons seems to be set from the system language.  When OSX is set to use Spanish as it's primary/default language, they seem ok:
![screen shot 2016-08-10 at 22 01 48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17570938/4ced28ce-5f46-11e6-8986-efe388a356d0.png)
Looks like we're in good shape after all. :smile:
By the way, yesterday we created a "[Translators](https://github.com/orgs/sqlitebrowser/teams/translators)" team for the sqlitebrowser org here on GitHub.
It doesn't give write access to anything, but shows you're a "member of the team" for anyone that looks. :smile:
Any interest in being added to that?
With the untranslated tooltip problems, I'll take a look over the next few hours.  At a guess, they're probably strings embedded in our .ui files.  If that's the case... investigation for a fix will be needed.
The Delete table tooltip is hopefully something simpler.  Will find out too. :smile:
For the release itself, technically it could be done right now.  The code is in a decent state, and apart from the stuff you've just pointed out above :wink:, the translations seem in an ok place too.
People have been pointing out a few times recently, that having our releases "unsigned" throws up warnings for people downloading on Windows, and for people installing on OSX.  So, I submitted paperwork yesterday to get signing certificates.  As soon as they arrive (hopefully Monday/Tuesday), then we'll make the release.  With signed binaries. 😁
Yeah. :smile:
Oh, if possible, do the PR against the `v3.9.x` branch. The code in that will be used for the release.
Sure.  It might be better timing though to wait until we know for sure why those bits aren't being translated.  It's fairly likely some of the code will need updating before you do a new PR.
So, forking after the code has been adjusted is probably the easiest approach. :smile:
I'll try to get this done tomorrow instead. :smile:
@lulol, I often went back to [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7244456/865175) to sync a fork. I finally learned how to do it, but after 20-30 visits on that page.
> Are the Delete Table, Delete View and Delete Trigger tooltips configured independently? Seems that all show the same tooltip set for Delete Table. Don't know if it's meant to be this way.
Yeah, that doesn't sound good.
The `Delete Table` tooltip is defined here:
- https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/21b1fbe79362e9876c09a3b7eda2fe4f4eb4f74e/src/MainWindow.ui#L1556
And yeah, it looks like that doesn't get updated even when something other than a table is selected.  The corresponding (non-tooltip) text which **does** change, seems to be this:
- https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/21b1fbe79362e9876c09a3b7eda2fe4f4eb4f74e/src/MainWindow.cpp#L1212-L1219
That can be updated to change the tooltip text at the same time.  They should allow translation for those ones. :smile:
##
The "Close Tab" one is proving to be more tricky.  I'm not finding the source of those words either... still looking though.
The `Delete Table` tooltip problem should be fixed in this: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/7c5f8743199137af594c685de6b7b860155b474c
The `Execute current line` one, I think it my fault.  I changed the tooltip a few days ago... but forgot to generate a new.ts file. 😦
- https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/7c5f8743199137af594c685de6b7b860155b474c/src/MainWindow.ui#L1737
I'm still looking for the cause of the `Close Tab` one.
While we're at it, there are a few other tooltips which need updating anyway: #721
I was going to put that off until the 3.10.0 release, but it might be better to make that change right away.
For the 3.9.0 release, I'm mostly waiting on the security certificate to come through from StartCom.  Was kind of expecting it to arrive this morning... but haven't heard from there.  (have sent messages, no response)
In the meantime, it makes sense to do some extra "polishing" through small-ish tasks that shouldn't break anything. :wink:
With the "Close Tab" string... yeah, it's definitely not in our source code.  Looking through the Qt5 source code, this seems to be it:
- https://github.com/qt/qtbase/blob/0b9acb3e320b39f159c7638cb89f92017b4e91da/src/widgets/widgets/qtabbar.cpp#L2587
It's enclosed with `tr()`, so it should be translatable.  As a complete wild guess, it might be the Spanish translation hasn't been submitted to upstream Qt for that.
Looking here, there doesn't seem to be a Spanish translation file for "qtbase" (the base Qt5 widgets):
- https://github.com/qt/qttranslations/tree/dev/translations
This seems to be the Qt4 equivalent:
- https://github.com/qt/qttranslations/blob/dev/translations/qt_es.ts#L60-L67
`Close Tab`isn't translated in this one either. 😦
Technically it would be possible for us to compile Qt5 ourselves, including updated Spanish translations for those missing pieces.  Compiling Qt5 isn't something I've personally tried though (it has a reputation for being painful)... so... I'm thinking lets skip this for now. :wink:
If you have the time + interest to translate the missing terms in Qt itself, they'd likely welcome it.  And our future releases wouldn't have this particular problem. 😁
Yeah, apparently there aren't going to be any more new Qt4 point releases, so that would probably not be a productive use of time. :wink:
@lulol, Probably it will be better for a Spanish translation for Qt to exist, even if not perfect, than not exist at all. I say you can help them translate if you want, without any fear.
@lulol Just now pushed a new commit to the `v3.9.x` branch, containing regenerated .ts file for all languages: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/v3.9.x/src/translations/sqlb_es_ES.ts
If you want to adjust the last few things, the updated file might be useful to grab.
Btw, in theory I should be able to sign the Windows executables tomorrow.  Once I've figured the process out properly, I'll do the final `3.9.0` release with whatever translations are ready at the time. :smile:
Possibly a weird idea, but if you know any other people who do Spanish translation, maybe it's a thing for discussion and spreading the effort out among a few people?
@lulol Found this while waiting for some stuff to compile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Localization
They have .ts files generated daily, available for download here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://l10n-files.qt.io/l10n-files/
Maybe the correct approach is to only do the strings you're sure of, and let someone else do the one's you're not sure of?
Interesting.  I can check 3.9.0 on Windows pretty quickly, as I have that VM already running.
Looking now.
The 3.9.0 release seems ok, which is a relief. :smile:
![3 9 0 spanish translation check](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/18034666/b906d9b8-6d3a-11e6-9822-b388ed7464b6.png)
The problem can likely be mostly ignored for now then, as it'll just be in the nightly builds.  When we're closer to the next release, we can update the translations to 100% again in time for that. :smile:
That being said... if you do feel like translation strings which are on the `master` branch, then we'll definitely accept them. 😀
Hmmm, we can do it now.  It's simple to merge in after all.
That'll mean the nightly builds are more accurate until the next release anyway. :smile:
As soon as Travis gives it the green light, I'll merge it in.
It turns out that some key combinations are displayed via our tooltips.
However, they're not displaying the correct key combination on OSX, instead showing the Windows/Linux key combo.  For example, in [sqlitetablemodel.cpp](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/538116c97b9dab60908199b82d4e58a3f8f757ac/src/sqlitetablemodel.cpp#L249):
```
return tr("References %1(%2)\nHold Ctrl+Shift and click to jump there")
.arg(fk.table()).arg(fk.columns().join(","));
```
This should be reasonably simple to fix using something like `#ifdef Q_OS_MAC` or `#ifndef Q_OS_MAC`, such that the correct key combination is shown for each OS.
- [tr("References %1(%2)\nHold Ctrl+Shift and click to jump there")](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/538116c97b9dab60908199b82d4e58a3f8f757ac/src/sqlitetablemodel.cpp#L249)

There are two occurrences in `MainWindow.ui` as well.  They may need to be set through code, instead of directly in the .ui file:
- [<string>Execute SQL [F5, Ctrl+Return]</string>](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/538116c97b9dab60908199b82d4e58a3f8f757ac/src/MainWindow.ui#L1637)

Wasn't it mentioned in some other thread/topic/issue/branch/sub thing about customising shortcut keys, etc?  If so, shouldn't the message be more 'generic' on its 'push the blah blah key' rather than specific?  Surely its bloating the code by adding in superfluous code 'if its this OS, do this, otherwise do that', etc...
Just my 2p's worth....
Yeah, I know the Issue you mean, but can't find the number for it at the moment.  It's the issue raising the idea of moving all of the shortcut assignment keys out of the .ui files, and into a common piece of code.  Then we could add a tab to the preferences dialog box, so users can customise the key mapping to what they want.
And yeah, this would probably tie in with that.  Or get superseded by it. :smile:
Aah, #682 be the jobbie...
Thanks @chrisjlocke. :smile:
### Details for the issue
With DB4S git master (b7be134 as of 10th 2016), the "Import CSV" dialog isn't always displaying the preview image correctly.
This happens with at least when DB4S is using the Russian language, though it may also happen for other languages too (not yet tested).
![d2d3dd00-5f16-11e6-88b2-f091fd9e6ee7](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17561165/b0a747ac-5f1c-11e6-90f2-1769c5a9eda9.png)
As a data point, noticed this when testing the new Russian translation.
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/719#issuecomment-238903240
Some helpful points to try are mentioned in that issue.
Also worth noting, is that with a different CSV file to import the behaviour changed.  Instead of not displaying the preview, instead it displayed what seems like corrupted data:
![screen shot 2016-08-10 at 17 17 00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17561535/6bd9ace4-5f1e-11e6-8da7-04296970c48b.png)
That's from a CSV export of a database with some PNG files in their cells.  The PNG data seems to be quoted (though I've not checked it's correctness), so it's possible either the export or import function isn't handling binary data well.
As a data point, the [CSV RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) doesn't define a way to encode binary data.
Wonder what it would take to create a follow up RFC, filling in some of these edge cases we've noticed are missing:
* encoding of binary data (eg probably base64 encode it)
* clearly establish NULL vs "no value provided for this field" (so use the default value): https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/195#issuecomment-78546221  Awesome @schdub, this looks very complete! 😀

One strange thing occur when making the screenshots above.  It seems like the "Import CSV" dialog doesn't display the contents correctly.
It could be a bug in our code, or it could just be my system.
Do you have a second to check if that dialog displays things correctly for you? :smile:
Thanks @schdub. :smile:
I'll file a new bug about it.
Ahhh, that could be it.  I'll try that now.
It might not be a bug after all. 😀
It was worth trying, but it doesn't seem to be that. :wink:
When testing with an empty "Other" line separator here (created by "Export CSV"), a preview is always shown for the import.  Even if it's just one very long line of header:

For now, created a new Issue #720 about it.  It can be investigated at a later date (after 3.9.0 release). :smile:
Thanks @schdub, I'll look into it now. :smile:
With:
```
for FK's with 0 index
```
I'm having a bit of trouble understanding that. :wink:
Would you be ok to take a screenshot of the database structure or similar, so I can see what you mean?  If the database file has no sensitive data, maybe email it to me and I'll try that way? :smile:
Thanks @schdub, I can see the problem now. :smile:
Sorry for the delay with this.  Today I've been learning about Qt's Model/View approach, which I want to understand properly before debugging through the `sqlitetablemodel.cpp` code. :wink:
Thanks for reporting this, @schdub I've just pushed the fix you've proposed. Can you test the next nightly build and report back if you find any remaining problems with this?
Thanks @schdub, that really helps. :smile:
I'll pull this into the v3.9.x branch now too.
Done. :smile:
Ahhh, that's an interesting observation. :smile:
It's **probably** because opening the database (using the SQLite library) does several setup and housekeeping type operations on the database, including creating temporary journaling files (and more).
From the database's point of view, it doesn't know ahead of time that no data will be changed.  So, it just does all the setup needed as if it will be.
If keeping the database completely unchanged is important to you, setting the "Read Only" property on the database file (eg using Windows Explorer) should work.  We added some code ages ago to work with "Read Only" databases (as set by the file system).
Does any of the above help? :smile:
No worries. :smile:
Are we ok to close this issue?
Well... we _could_ reset the timestamp of the file after access, but (sorry) it's probably a bad idea.
The SQLite library may have done other housekeeping tasks on the file meanwhile, and if we reset the timestamp then the file will appear as if it's been untouched (from a timestamp point of view).  Even though that's not really the case.
Personally, I can imagine some people being pretty annoyed with us :rage: if we reset the timestamp back to the original one, even when the file has been modified internally.
So... it's better if we skip that, at least for now. :smile:
Ahh yeah, this frustrated me ages ago too, until I learned that OSX provides a key combo exactly for this situation. :smile:
When you've opened any applications's "Open File" (or similar file dialogs) press this key combination:
&nbsp; &nbsp; <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd>
The hidden files will then be shown in the dialog, allowing their selection/opening/etc.
Side note - This key combination doesn't work in Finder itself. 😦   It's only for dialogs.
Finder can be configured to show all hidden files though, by using the `defaults` program from the command line:
```
$ defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
$ killall Finder
```
The `defaults` command above turns on the display of hidden files, the `killall Finder` command reloads Finder without needing to logout/login nor restart the computer.  Use `FALSE` instead of `TRUE` in the command aboves to turn off display of hidden files.
Hopefully the above stuff helps. :smile:
@justinclift, Can't we use [`QDir::Hidden`](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qdir.html#Filter-enum)?
@revolter Reading over it, that sounds like it would work too. :smile:
@justinclift, We're using `QFileDialog`, so I tried out [QFileDialog::setFilter](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfiledialog.html#setFilter) to no avail :(.
Is the code you tried in a branch somewhere?  I can try and beat it into shape too if you want. :smile:
#### I'm opening this issue because:
- [x] DB4S needs a feature
- [ ] DB4S is crashing
- [ ] DB4S has a bug
- [ ] DB4S has another problem: ___
### Details for the issue
We have an Edit menu, but the standard Copy & Paste items are missing from it.
When our Copy/Paste code is in good shape, we should probably add them back in.
Please try out the nightly version and let us know if it happens there too.
@eeinfalt Thanks for reporting this.  We're **very close** to releasing a major new version 3.9.0.  There's a pretty good chance this is already fixed in that.
If you're ok to try out the nightly build (download locations are on our front page), it's the same code as our upcoming 3.9.0 release.
Are you ok to give that a go and let us know if the problem still happens?
Closing this due to lack of response.
Awesome, I'll give this a try here now. :smile:

It's most likely because I removed the "&amp;amp;" substring inside them just a few commits ago.  They didn't seem to be doing anything useful, instead making the lives of translators more difficult.
Looking through the dialogs now.  It's 95% of the way there. :smile:
- MainWindow.ui needs discussion (as above).
- ImportCsvDialog.ui seems to have broken the filename filtering, such that files matching the filter aren't able to be selected.  Are you ok to investigate?

Trying it now. :smile:
Don't forget the dialogs are just 10% of the translations.  The application throws up messages, etc, which also need to be translated, otherwise, its just a 'bodge job'.  It would be 'weird' having an application where you can select a language so the GUI changes, only for it to throw up a message ("Are you sure?") which you can't read...  and then the "Yes" and "No" are in the CORRECT languages..... argh!
Sure, that's completely correct.  With Issue #643, we'll get the UI elements in each of the languages matched up to their existing translations.
Once we have 3.9.0 code frozen (should be soon - definitely next few days), we can then reach out to the individual translators for string updates.  That will solve the problem properly. :smile:

It's working for me :-? No idea how to reproduce it.
@bakercp, Can you please test it in the [latest nightly](http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx)?
@justinclift Of course.
The height is ok now. But the column names are cut out :(

Didn't realise that before. 😦
Try sorting too, the arrows are now close to the upper margin instead of centered.
Good point.  It's not so high up as to be a killer though. :smile:
![screen shot 2016-08-02 at 21 24 18](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17343840/96b9bc6a-58f7-11e6-9691-502459fb0a5f.png)
But it's more up than before. Also, on my laptop it looks like this:
<img width="1305" alt="screen shot 2016-08-02 at 23 33 50" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/17344122/b9116d14-5909-11e6-809a-d6b526afe191.png">
After [discussion on Gitter](https://gitter.im/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser?at=57a1f4519e85d3e82683520a), the general decision is we'll close this PR (without merging it) for now, and come back to it later likely for 3.10.0.
The fix in this PR does help with Qt5, and with Retina displays.  It's not really workable for Qt4 though, which we need to support.  So, we'll investigate in more depth again later.  For now, the grey bar will just have to do. :wink:
![screen-shot-2016-08-01-at-12 08 45](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17336758/80f49ed8-58d7-11e6-9265-964cb5bbc36c.png)
Hopefully not too hard to resolve.
As something to look into for this, maybe QFontMetrics would help us calculate an optimal size, based on the header and filter fonts in use:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qfontmetrics.html
In the binary (qhexedit) view inside the Edit Database Cell, there doesn't seem to be any way to switch panes from the left to right sides.
It would be useful to capture the tab key (or something similar), to let the user switch which side they're editing in.
![screen shot 2016-08-01 at 18 17 41](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17302610/e74dbf16-5814-11e6-9ce1-ddcd6e2c928d.png)
I think that this would need a QHexEdit PR. Or a search for their API
I'm not sure.  Kind of suspecting that the only reason it doesn't work at the moment, is that we capture the tab key for the window ourself.  It would surprise me if QHexEdit doesn't have this capability already.
Saying that because I've used [command line hex editors](http://rigaux.org/hexedit.html) before, and they (all?) support doing this.  So, I'm kind of expecting that QHexEdit does too. :smile:
Oh, ok. It makes sense.
This sounds like a useful enhancement, especially for people using JSON friendly languages.
If we add a command line option to drive this as well, people could use this headless in their toolchain. :wink:
We've made a bunch of usability tweaks to it, and could really use some feedback. 😁
(there is a crash bug when closing a database that I'm chasing down, but it's just annoying, not a data loss thing :wink:)
Thanks.  With the crash we know it happens on OSX, but haven't tried others.  @revolter [has just provided a fix](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/690), so the nightly builds from tomorrow onwards should be very stable.
For yourself, just try out the application itself and see if there are any really obvious silly bits. :grin:
Also, we've redesigned the "Edit Database Cell" window, to hopefully make it more useful.  If you could try that out, it would be great.
Just to be careful though, don't use it with live data if you keep binary info in the cells.  There's [a bug we need to fix](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/674) in that situation before our next release.
As a data point, this issue probably ties in with #677.
@revolter have a chat to @schdub about this, as he's indicated via email that he's going to put time into this as well. :smile:
We should implement this using Qt's JSON support, I think: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/json.html
For export this makes things easier because it allows pretty printing or compact printing (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qjsondocument.html#JsonFormat-enum). Plus it would allow us relatively simple import of JSON, too.
Only caveat: it requires Qt 5.0+. But I see no reason to not drop Qt4 support for 3.10.0 :)
I've just pushed a commit which adds basic JSON export support. There are a few things missing here and there (more menu entries for easier access throughout the program, an option to change from CSV to JSON format and back while being in the dialog, a way to export SQL query results as JSON, and exporting multiple tables into one JSON file). Other than that JSON export is there :smiley:
Unfortunately, the OSX nightlies are back to using Qt4 again.
There's a problem with Qt5 on OSX, where it doesn't show all of the data in the tables. 😦
Until we get that figured out... Qt4.
**_sigh**_
That aside, the basic JSON support is really welcome.  Windows builds will be able to use that. :smile:
Created a new issue about the Qt5 problem on OSX, so we can investigate it properly: #750
@MKleusberg JSon is not working correctly, it generates 11MiB files for 3 record table and file is just corrupted.
Could you please attach a screenshot? It would help us understand the problem easier and faster :smile:
@huangjennifer947 Have you solved this problem yet? :smile:
If not, can you add a screenshot here to show the problem?
Closing this due to lack of response.
As pointed out by @bhj [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/677#issuecomment-236206890), we should probably add some OSX developer docs too.
eg more than just the basic "How to compile" info [we have](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#macos-x) already
@bhj What kind of docs are you wanting at the moment?  Something like an OSX version of [this](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S)?
The Mac section is still current. :smile:
The issue you mention used to happen occasionally.  No-one seems to have mentioned it (via these Issues) since adding the note though.  Unsure if that means it's not happening any more, or if people are reading the note and working around it. :wink:
For OSX development, is using Qt Creator an ok thing for you?
eg If I create a wiki page with "How to set up a dev environment on OSX", my initial thought is to make it Qt Creator oriented
Started adding info here (rough notes) as I remember them. :smile:
Oops.  Completely forgot to include the link in my comment.  Thanks for fixing @bhj. :smile:
That's exactly how I were doing it. I don't have my code anymore, but it didn't work correctly on resizing for some reason.
Oh, should've make it manually. It adds badge on new row, which is awkward
I added it
Awesome, very good idea. 😎
I have to admit, I knew it was added but could not see it for looking!
Yes, thank you, I did find it but my point was if I knew it was there and could not see it, will anyone see it?
Personally, I think it's just not a very "stand out visually" kind of button.  I had to hunt for it too.
But for me, that's because I'm used to seeing "a piece of green in the upper left" of our README. md.   Two pieces of green instead of one wasn't noticeable without looking. :wink:
Well, I think it's pretty "standard" to have the badges in a single line beneath the first header like [this](https://github.com/zeit/hyperterm) and many others.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17189392/1f0813aa-5439-11e6-89d9-7a3b77a7278e.png)
This is also reflected in the schema column.
However, as soon as you modify the table, the schema column changes to double quotes around the table name.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17189451/67001766-5439-11e6-9ef7-f79c20e3c2bb.png)
I remember reading recently about double quotes and apostrophes (single quotes), but can't find it now.  But I did see this about quoting, and it said using grave accents was purely for MySQL backwards compatibility.
https://www.sqlite.org/lang_keywords.html
It suggested using double quotes for identifiers.   I note the examples on the sqlite website doesn't use any quotes at all, apart from when to escape an apostrophe:
`INSERT INTO xyz VALUES('5 O''clock');`
Again, suggesting strings should be enclosed in single quotes rather than grave accents.
Should a standard be adopted, rather than a mix of bits?
Yeah, being consistent in our approach is probably a good thing to make happen. :smile:
But how do we decide wether to use ` or "? Or do we make yet another user preference setting for it?
In theory :smile:, that shouldn't be **_too hard**_ to figure out:
1. If the SQLite approach is documented well enough to figure it out, use that
2. If there are spots that aren't completely clear from that, lets see if we can figure it out from the SQL standards
3. If that doesn't work then copy PostgreSQL's approach.  aka [What Would Postgres Do?](https://youtu.be/ZvmMzI0X7fE?t=3m8s)
> But how do we decide whether to use ` or "? Or do we make yet another user preference setting for it?
From my understanding, there is no reason to use grave accents (`)
They are there solely for mySql compatability.  So we should be using double quotes and single quotes only.  No preferences needed.
`create table "blobby" ("field1" text, "field2" text);`
`insert into "blobby" ("field1", "field2") values ('my text values','my text values')`
The keyword list is not exhaustive, so don't think you can program for that.  If a user wants to use a table name called 'plan' or 'from' (which are keywords), the above still works fine.
`Query executed successfully: insert into "from" ("field1", "field2") values ('my text values','my text values') (took 0ms, 1 rows affected)`

This is related to #629 too.
So an user preference setting as I said? :smile: So we don't bump into other users who want compatibility with MySQL.
Looks like it? :wink:
I guess so
> So a user preference setting as I said?
Our preferences screen will look like this soon! :wink:

We could default it to quotes, and add the option to change it in an "Advanced" section, as to not clutter it (like in @chrisjlocke's SS :laughing:). And probably move the "escape character" and/or other settings in the "Advanced" section too while we're at it.
We've been asked via Twitter if we have a list of keyboard shortcuts:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://twitter.com/john_law_kelly/status/758061269702160384
We don't yet, but it would be very useful to create one, probably on the wiki.
@glawrence Any interest? :smile:
I was thinking the other day of a `Keys` menu in `Preferences`. Where you could see **and** update the keyboard shortcuts. Like VLC has, for example, where you can even search through them.
While going through the translation files, I noticed you could set the & shortcut wherever you wanted, and initially thought it worked the same as .Net, but noticed from @justinclift's code, this has to be 'hard coded' in Qt - shortcut keys have to be specifically coded.  I presume then that the accelerators defined by a & sign on labels, etc, are for cosmetic purposes only?
If you have a menu item with the text `T&est`, does pressing `ALT + e` on **Windows** trigger it? I remember this is the way ampersand worked, though I don't know how it would work on mac.
@chrisjlocke For the top drop down menu's (eg File, View, etc), adding an &amp; sign should in theory automatically create a platform-appropriate shortcut.
In reality, it seems to be a bit inconsistent for DB4S.  It might just be we're doing something weird, or out-of-order in our code base though. (unsure)
@revolter If you want to add a user changeable "Keyboard Mapping" thing to the Preferences, that sounds really useful for people. :smile:
@justinclift I know, it would be awesome. I searched for an already created library (widget) but couldn't find one :(
I stumbled upon [this package manager](qpm.io) though, but I'm not sure that [the packages page](https://www.qpm.io/packages.html) contains all of the available packages. I'll install it in a couple of days and see if I find something useful there.
Was thinking about this earlier.  If we remove the &amp; signs from **_all**_ of our strings, and instead create all of the keyboard shortcuts at program startup (eg [like this code](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/MainWindow.cpp#L178), that would probably benefit us in two ways:
- The keyboard shortcuts could then be stored/retrieved using PreferencesDialog::saveSettings()/getSettingsValue().  That would let them be mapped into a new tab in the PreferencesDialog for learning/changing.
In initial thinking through of that... depending how the "choose your new key sequence" bit is done, it could be simple to implement.
- If we go for the simple approach, such as a Line Edit field with "Ctrl-A" (or whatever) typed in manually, we could get an initial implementation done pretty quickly
- The most user friendly approach is probably one where the user gets to click a widget, then press their desired key combination, which the widget captures and converts to the appropriate Qt shortcut combination.  That doesn't sound like a particularly quick/easy/accurate thing to implement though.
Personally, I'd go with the first approach just to see how usable that turns out to be.  It'd probably be acceptable. :smile:
@justinclift, I don't think is a good idea to let the users type the shortcut. Even in your example, you wrote "Ctrl-A" but I would have typed "CTRL+a".
Also, I think that a middle solution that's not complicated is to have ComboBox for the modifier keys and a 1 character limited text field like this:
![Sketch](https://imgur.com/XZvQonk.jpg)
@revolter Heh Heh Heh, well for me yeah it wouldn't have worked like that... I would have had to figure out to use "+" instead of "-" (as you did properly).
Kind of thinking it wouldn't be a real issue though, as the fields would be pre-populated with the current keys.  Wouldn't that clue people into the correct format to use?
@justinclift, I personally wouldn't bet on that. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention, and we can't (and shouldn't) rely on them.
k, was just an initial thought.  Your combo box idea does sound better, now I think about it more. :smile:
I've just created a Wiki page of Windows shortcuts.  I presume these are the same (albeit Control instead of Ctrl) for Mac and Ctrl (?) for Linux.
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Windows-Keyboard-Shortcuts
I'll amend it so its 'Application Keyboard Shortcuts' and split by OS, rather than 3 separate pages for each OS.
Out of interest, Ctrl+D seems to be a dupe of Ctrl+P - showing and hiding the plot pane.  Is this correct?  Pressing Ctrl+D in the 3.9 build shows and hides the Plot pane, which Ctrl+P also does...
@revolter why would user type a shortcut? He would just press it and apply settings.
You guys really don't understand how it works, nobody enters shortcuts in text field.
You worry about irrelevant things. Relevant thing is to create observer which would control all possible shortcuts in all possible classes where they are currently hardcoded.
If someone creates a list of those in wiki, I'll implement it.
**UPD**: list of shortcuts that _can_ be changed.
Thanks @chrisjlocke. :smile:
With Ctrl+P, it's probably that way from when it was first implemented.  P == Plot or similar.
On the other hand though, Ctrl+P is commonly by programs to mean "Print". (eg send the document, view, whatever to a printer)
@justinclift why would you change "Open file" shortcut, for example?
Sure, I don't have a need to... but some people might. (possibly assistive devices maybe? but I really don' t know)
Anyway, isn't the whole point that we give people a choice, so if they want to change it they can? :smile:
@justinclift never mind then, I don't like where it goes.
No worries @innermous. :smile:
I think once you have a system to change the keys ... someone likes Ctrl+R as thats what they're used to, but someone else is used to F5... then you can 'open the system' so people can change it all - you may as well change any key rather than just this one, that one or the other...
At work, we use the 'ICE' method of prioritising - impact, cost and ease.  The impact here is higher usability, but I'm not sure on the ease, so its hard to weigh this issue amongst all the others.  With VB, its quite easy to 'soft code' such doodlies.  I'm not sure if the same can be done in Qt.
> @revolter why would user type a shortcut? He would just press it and apply settings.
> I don't think is a good idea to let the users type the shortcut.
Anyway, I am already working on it. Help with testing would be really appreciated, as well as another wiki page for OS X shortcuts since those are beyond my conversance.
I said that the users should **_not_** type the shortcuts.
@revolter's solution (combo box and textbox) is the best solution - easier to validate what the user wants.  The Windows' method (ie, VB) is painful!

Noticed SmartGit's solution for this, from which we might take some ideas:

It detects duplicated and shows a breadcrumb style name separated by `|`.
![screen shot 2017-02-27 at 15 22 30](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/23362951/d12abfe0-fd00-11e6-87c5-30700d4ec582.png)
Here I set shortcuts for `Check Out` and `Cherry-Pick` and the initial ones move to the `Default` column.

That extension looks useful. :smile:
What happens when you try to add it using Preferences → Extensions?
Cool, no worries at all. :smile:
Yep, lets open another issue for it.
Done. 😄
@justinclift Does the JSON extension need to be compiled or something?
If not, @bhj, can you manually add it in `Preferences` and let us know if it's working?
@bhj Stumbled across info about this while investigating a different issue.  Including the JSON1 extension by default (on OSX) could be extremely easy.
If I create a test build with it, would you be ok to check that it works reasonably well from your point of view?
@bhj Please give this one a go:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-issue677v1.dmg
For OSX, we kind of cheat when building SQLite.  We just build it using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).  For this experimental .dmg file, I just rebuilt SQLite with `--with-json1` included on the Homebrew command line.
There's a fairly decent chance that worked.  Not guaranteed, but definitely worth a shot. 😁
If it did work, we can probably update our build & release process to include that from here on.
Done.
Just added it to our main OSX build instructions too.
For OSX at least, this should be included in our releases from here on.
Would it work on Windows too?
The extension code itself should, as far as I know, as it's a "core" extension.  Though it would take a separate piece of time to look into it.
I'll need to investigate whether SQLCipher + the JSON1 extension go together ok.  If they do, it should be feasible to have them both in 3.9.0.
@bhj The new release out today - 3.9.0 - doesn't have JSON1 included in it.  It's purely because we included SQLCipher by default in all builds, and I haven't yet had time to investigate how to build them both together.
It may turn out to be super easy... I just don't know (yet). :wink:
In the meantime, grabbing any of our nightly builds _without_ SQLCipher should work.  They have the JSON1 extension included as part of their automatic building. :smile:
We definitely accept Pull Requests if you're up for it. 😁
They'll be in the next major Windows releases too. :smile:  @deepsidhu1313 pointed out that the Ubuntu instructions [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser#ubuntu-and-derivatives), are not on the front page of our sqlitebrowser.org website.
That needs to be fixed. :smile:
@deepsidhu1313 In theory, this should be fixed now (by https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/5d9f0b0e0f2157fb16e30d34e095456c516a7795).
Would you be ok to take a look here, and let us know if something needs adjusting?
- http://sqlitebrowser.org/#ubuntu
- http://sqlitebrowser.org/#ubuntu-stable
- http://sqlitebrowser.org/#ubuntu-nightly
Haven't heard back from @deepsidhu1313, but I'm pretty sure this is fixed decently now.  Closing this issue.
If it turns out there's more needing to be done for this issue, feel free to re-open this. :smile:
Cool.  You're welcome @deepsidhu1313, thanks for pointing it out. :smile:
While dabbling with the translation files, I noticed that when Arabic is selected, the language dropdown is mangled with text prefixed by an opening bracket instead of suffixed by a closing bracket.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17024863/5d14f52e-4f51-11e6-9476-54f96cbd5e72.png)
@0xbsec your commit is broken :anguished:
Upd: I am sorry, I checked out  to commit before adding Arabic translation, issue is existing there.
Hmmm, yeah that doesn't seem happy.
It's not a deal breaker, but if someone has an idea what could be causing that it would be useful. :smile:
I think that the texts should remain left aligned, as they are in English.
@revolter This shouldn't be hard to fix.  Looking here:
- https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qwidget.html#layoutDirection-prop
- https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qt.html#LayoutDirection-enum
The LayoutDirection enum has an "Auto" setting. `Qt::LayoutDirectionAuto`
If that doesn't work for us in practise, instead we could add a small bit of code in the constructor for each dialog to detect an RTL language, then switch the layout direction for the appropriate widgets.
Sounds kind of simple in theory... 😉
Just tried out the 3 setLayoutDirection options on the Language selector drop down box.
It didn't seem to have any effect at all. 😕
### LayoutDirectionAuto
![layoutdirectionauto-english](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17247473/723520d8-558b-11e6-98a3-04c1d383bd80.png)
### LeftToRight
![lefttoright-english](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17247515/a6bb8414-558b-11e6-9f94-97a2761daa47.png)
### RightToLeft
![righttoleft-english](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17247521/b503b3e8-558b-11e6-90ee-74d3bb148dea.png)
`setLayoutDirection` was set using the Design window in Qt Creator.
I'll try setting it manually in the PreferencesDialog constructor next.
Ahhh, this might be what we need:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qapplication.html#layoutDirection-prop
Hmmm, adding this to Application.cpp definitely works to force most of the application to RTL:
```
QApplication::setLayoutDirection(Qt::RightToLeft);
```
... except that specific comboBox.
### English
![setlayoutdirection-rtl-english](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17247963/f6d31658-558e-11e6-89a9-1c3d424c2ff0.png)
Wondering if there's something wrong with our code for setting up that Language comboBox?
Cool.  Out of curiosity which OS are you using, and which version of Qt are you compiling against?
I might be able to spin up a VM to match, so verify on my end. :smile:
I'm building against Qt 4.8.7 at the moment, but I have Qt 5.6.0 installed too.  I'll give that a go after getting some food, and see if it changes things. :smile:
For "I think another bug report should be filed ASAP!" are you meaning for us, or for Qt?  If for Qt... um... are you ok to do it?  I probably wouldn't even describe the issue clearly enough for them to fix it. 😧
Looking at:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-55012?focusedCommentId=327173&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-327173
That's just a comment on an existing issue. :wink:
If you want it fixed 😜 , shouldn't it be a new issue so they can track/address it properly?
Refresh is definitely supposed to work. :smile:
Which OS are you on, and which version of DB4S are you using? :smile:
k.  Would you have a minute to try the latest nightly build and see if things are better there?
If so, download locations are listed on our front page. :smile:
For added info, how are you (trying to do) the refresh?
No worries at all.  We'll definitely look into this.  It might be a few days away though. 😦
Cool. Focused on some other issues at the moment, but may ping you for exactly that if it turns out to be needed. 😁
If you create a new database, does the same thing occur?  Is it a local database (C drive) or on a network?
No idea how to solve it just yet (haven't tried replicating it, so unsure what it will take).
@jtara Would you have a minute to try out this version?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-201607220858.dmg
It's our very latest code, plus some UI cleanup I was doing yesterday.  The refresh functionality in it is working ok (tested here on my desktop) according to the SQL log.
Thanks @jtara, that really does help. :smile:
Just moved the target for this to 3.10.0, instead of our next release (3.9.0), as it's doubtful we'd get it done in time.
Sure.  In theory :smile:, they're pretty easy to add.  The list that's supposed to be showing up at the moment is this:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/FileDialog.h#L20
Though I kind of remember there have been issues on some OS's at times.  eg they don't show up correctly on some OSX versions, so we disabled them all there.  Made it *.\* for Mac.
Btw, which OS and version of DB4S are you using?
Yep, sounds like the kind of thing that belongs in the Preferences dialog.
Shouldn't be super hard to code up. :smile:
@jmucchiello do you have C++/Qt programming skill (or interest to learn)? 😁
If not, no worries, maybe @revolter would be interested?
Yeah, time is generally the thing that's hard to come by. :smile:
@jmucchiello Does this seem like it would cover all the needed bits?
![edit file extensions concept 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16976118/5978739a-4e44-11e6-92d4-f2fbb3b6a4c0.png)
It's just a [quick concept mock up in Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/free), so it's easy to change elements in if something needs changing. :smile:
It's a little more work that the default row type preference feature, and as you know, I don't have time now :( So if no one gets it done in 3 weeks, I'll start working on it.
@jmucchiello Like this?
![edit file extensions concept 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16976465/f4e025ba-4e46-11e6-88ec-0def11e1ed40.png)
@revolter Yeah, it's probably yours or @innermous's.  After I get #480 done, I have an idea of other stuff I need to focus on already. :smile:
I would change the order of the OK and Cancel buttons... but only because I'm used to Windows.... :wink:
@chrisjlocke, Qt automatically puts the buttons in the OS's default order, so they won't show up exactly like in the mockup on Windows.
Good ol' Qt! Saving the day again, one dialog window at a time!
Thanks for the clarification.  One needs that on a Thursday.
Oh, that's not good.  From memory, we did have a bug in an older version where it wasn't recognising "Don't show again" had been ticked.
Which version is this happening to you on?
@perfect1077 ping?
@perfect1077 Errr... is this still happening for you?
It won't happen in the newer versions as there are no newer versions for it to check against! :wink:
You won't know until the next newer version and this newer version (now the older version) finds the newer version......! :wink:
@chrisjlocke, I think you can install some older version [from the releases page](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases) and be able to test this.
Closing this due to lack of response from @perfect1077. 😦
Thanks @DelphiGit, that does look like it'll be the right kind of thing.
Tomorrow, I'll build a new Win64 package for the original bug reporter and ask them if they're ok to test/confirm it's good.  Assuming we get a positive answer back, I'll merge it after that. :smile:
Built a Win64 package for testing here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/sqlitebrowser-win64-issue621v1-201607142006.exe
The original reporter on Twitter has offered to test the proposed fix, so I'll point them at this now. :smile:
Well, good and bad news. :wink:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://twitter.com/Ug_0Security/status/753678028513968130
The quoted path for the install command is indeed fixed.  However, the same problem exists in the **uninstall** command and needs to be fixed.
![uninstaller-unquoted-problem](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16855555/bbe3feae-4a0d-11e6-9fbd-b9bddfacd461.jpg)
... which I kind of suspect might need to be addressed in the NSIS source code, not ours (unsure), as I don't think we can control its generation. 😦
From eyeballing the NSIS code, this seem to be the line that needs fixing:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/kichik/nsis/blob/master/Source/build.cpp#L2305
The original reporter has tweeted the NSIS twitter account asking who to report stuff there too.  Hopefully the uninstaller part of things gets resolved by the NSIS people in near future.
In the meantime, lets merge this, as it fixes the part of the problem in our code.  The other half is a packaging problem. :wink:
Some strings in the main UI aren't showing their translation.  eg:
![screen shot 2016-07-11 at 19 36 49](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16742251/d5da519e-479e-11e6-84fe-c7e10b28b334.png)
Translation files are one huge mess, lines specified in .ts files are outdated and do not match lines in .ui files.
Even those translation strings that are displayed correctly atm - have wrong line numbers in .ts files. This requires a thorough work :)
I only know .NET programming, which is why I haven't gotten involved with programming/helping out before, but editing translation files sounds work I could be doing... matching up the lines and ensuring they're still valid?  I'm good at the laborious stuff, leaving others time to do the exciting bits!
@chrisjlocke Any help with this would definitely be useful. 😀
After a bit of investigation, it does seem like this is at least part of the problem.
For the French language example, here is what the UI looks like before investigating the punctuation symbols:
![screen shot 2016-07-12 at 13 43 01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16767703/a5ff30bc-4838-11e6-9a2f-32948c28d570.png)
Picking one of the strings that hasn't translated - "Revert Changes" - doing a grep for it through the src/ subdirectory shows it in [MainWindow.ui](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/MainWindow.ui#L1371):
```
<string>&amp;Revert Changes</string>
```
In the [French translation file](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/translations/sqlb_fr.ts#L1071) though, it's missing the `&amp;` at the start:
```
<source>Revert Changes</source>
```
After adding the `&amp;` string to the translation file here, then rebuilding the project, that string now translates correctly in the main interface:
![screen shot 2016-07-12 at 13 53 56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16767725/ac18b338-4838-11e6-98a3-54863e008b03.png)
So, it looks like string matching problems between the .ui files and the translation files for at least some of this.
@chrisjlocke Is going through the translations files and getting these adjusted to string match correctly something you'd be up for in the next few days? :smile:
As a data point, this doesn't look to be too complicated.  Just went through the French UI and fixed the main strings for the initial UI.  I'll commit the change to our repo in a minute too:
![screen shot 2016-07-12 at 14 08 20](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16768033/564465b8-483a-11e6-9ef3-3aa5af62970d.png)
I'll set up a VM following your examples / instructions to create a Windows development area and have a go... going through the files sounds doable, but 'rebuilding the project' is something I've not done before... but I like a challenge!*
*If supplied with enough beer and sweets.
The setup for the Win dev environment is kind of tedious.  Lots of downloading at the start to collect things, then lots of launching installers, picking the options (as given :smile:), then waiting for installers to finish.  The only challenge for that bit is patience. :wink:
Once you have that though, you're all set.  The instructions take you through building the project, so you'll find "rebuilding" the project itself super simple.
If you hit stumbling things, reach out. :smile:
@chrisjlocke Had a chance to look at this?
We'll probably do our next release next week, so this needs to be completed (+ verified) by then. :smile:
I'll set up a virtual machine this morning and follow your instructions. :)
Excellent, that will really help. :smile:
Yes, in the "Requirements" section, you need to add "4 days put aside to
install all this gumph"...  ;)
Yeah, that's the tedious bit. 😬
Quick 'confirmation'.  I can't find details of 'DB Schema' in the translation files for the tabs along the bottom - DB Schema, Plot, SQL Log
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17021134/be7ada68-4f3d-11e6-95ac-164c2115b2cd.png)
Found 'Plot' and 'SQL Log'.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17021539/882bce6a-4f40-11e6-8751-ec3ea27bcd67.png)
I assume there isn't a translation for every label?  Or should there be?
There's a 'schema' (<source>Schema</source>) but thats pointing to a different file...
Confirmation No.2 ... noticed a window caption was translated, but not the main one.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17021677/77f29dfc-4f41-11e6-8206-5f194532fa72.png)
Ahhh, co-incidentally I was looking at the dock labels earlier on as part of another change. :smile:
DB Schema is probably not showing up for you in a search because it has an &amp; embedded in its string. eg:
- https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/MainWindow.ui#L1277
See if you can figure it out.  We can always circle back to it later when the bulk of the other UI elements are done. :smile:
Thanks for the prompt reply. :smile:
Did search for 'schem' and >db but no matches.  No matches in the sqlb_ar.ts for 'DB Sche&amp;ma'.  Will skip that one.... :wink:
Will note down what I can't find so there is a list somewhere.  I'm sure there will be more ....
Maybe chuck them in a comment here, using a "list style"? eg:
## French
etc
People can edit their own comments, so you can update/edit the comment as you go.
?
(though, I don't personally trust browsers with long running text fields, so I'd personally use a local text file too :wink:)
OK... _scratches head_.  Last question.  Honest.  The *.ts files have <location> tags, with line=xxx parameters.  Are these critical?
eg:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17022223/a62be216-4f44-11e6-8561-e00f6411a9ea.png)
but the mainwindow.ui at those lines:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17022039/b0c0f3f2-4f43-11e6-8d9c-1e93aa419ccd.png)
Definitely ignore the line numbers. :smile:
There's a tool called "lupdate" which actually updates them automatically.  It seems to do that by looking at the source files, then updating the .ts files to correct the line numbers for each string.
You can launch it if you want from Qt Creator by (from the top menu) Tools → External → Linquist → Update translations (lupdate).
While I'm dabblin', in the 'About Dialog', it says 'SQLite Database Browser is..."
Should this be changed to 'DB Browser for SQLite' ?
Ahhh yeah.  Definitely. :smile:
... the "DB Schema" tab title just changed in our source.
I removed the &amp; in it, as it was misplaced anyway.
Sorry for the extra work. 😇
Yeah, the &amp; is supposed to represent a shortcut key.  It wasn't on the correct key for DB Schema anyway, so I just removed it.
OK, so after editing the .ts files and going back to Qt Creator, and doiing the lupdate and lrelease, its gone back and flagged a lot of the translations as 'unfinished'
`<translation type="unfinished">Version</translation>`
This stops the translations appearing.  Is there another step somewhere?  Manually editing the .ts files obviously isn't the right thing to do... :disappointed:
Here's where I wish I knew more about translation files. 😢
Which of lupdate and lrelease is adding the "unfinished" type to them?
Guessing you've already looked over this?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/linguist-translators.html
This one is overview stuff, but doesn't seem to help with "how to mark things as finished":
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/linguist-manager.html
Oops.  I've been editing the raw .ts files.  There is a big button in Qt Linguist (which I hadn't previously installed)
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17077698/99896ef0-50d1-11e6-9fe0-3f71bbdc7464.png)
This should make things easier! :wink:
Green ticks.  Thats a good thing.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17083260/af2f4228-5191-11e6-9081-b1b98f376c9a.png)
Compared to an 'untouched' file...
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17083322/c14f37f8-5194-11e6-8ffb-95ed163c0afd.png)
And off we go again! :wink:
Keep going @chrisjlocke, looks like you're nearly there! 🎉
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17083828/ebd1a416-51a3-11e6-938a-3e99666080b6.png)
I'm not used to Qt Linguist or Qt Creator, so not sure where (or if?) I should be looking... maybe its Linguist just getting confused, or the .de.ts file was copied from the .ar.ts file?
Its OK.  Sorted it.  For some reason, it takes the current selected language from the _real_ program, and so because Arabic was the last language I tested, it was showing that in the preview.  Bit mad...
Guess it's part of the learning process. :wink:
A lot of the translations have been corrected by me, due for 'release' soon.  Admittedly they're probably still not perfect, but the errors (like above) will have been addressed.  The main issue is that the program expects a shortcut key (so `&ampy` for ALT+Y, `&ampu for ALT+U, etc) so one has to be supplied, which doesn't always fit into the translation.
I'm more than happy for you to assist me in this challenge if you would like! :wink:
With this project, one important factor is that it's volunteer based effort.  All of the stuff you see (both good and bad) is the result of people willing to put their time into something, and they skill they have at it.
For example I'm personally a newbie with C++/Qt.  In no way am I good enough at it (yet) to make deep changes for this project. :wink:
However, [I can improve user visible dialogs](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/673) decently (in my opinion 😈 ).  Hopefully soon, my understanding of things will have improved enough that I can assist with the more fundamental changes we need. :bowtie:
You're right about the &amp; sign's in strings.  They're breaking a bunch of translated items throughout the user interface, and it seems to be across all languages.  @chrisjlocke is putting time into fixing that, using our current understanding of the problem.  Hopefully, this gets us most of the way to our translations being "usable", even if not 100% fantastic (yet). 😁
Would you be ok to look over our Arabic translation once @chrisjlocke has the &amp; sign problem fixed?  It should be within the coming week.
When you say your way of translation is different... are you meaning a different dialect of Arabic?
Ahhh.  Not sure then.  Would you be ok to discuss it with @0xbsec, [who recently made our Arabic translation](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/642)?
Just a nod that I'm not just correcting the `&amp; but also the missing translations.

This shows a large number of missing translations.  Some are just warnings of ellipses not correct, or full stops.  Its not just the dialogs, but messages displayed by the application.
Admittedly, its not going to be 100% - but I hope its not going to be as bad as this.... :wink:

Ahhh, ok. :smile:
@chrisjlocke How's this progressing?  We're closing out the last few issues now... :smile:
Going to try and fix the obvious UI elements somewhat quickly. :smile:
These are the translations we have at present:
- [x] sqlb_de.ts - German
- [ ] sqlb_en_GB.ts - British English
- [x] sqlb_es_ES.ts - Spanish
- [x] sqlb_fr.ts - French
- [ ] sqlb_ko_KR.ts - Korean - In a PR
- [x] sqlb_pt_BR.ts - Brazilian Portuguese
- [x] sqlb_ru.ts - Russian
- [ ] sqlb_tr.ts - Turkish
- [ ] sqlb_zh.ts - Chinese (Simplified?)
- [ ] sqlb_zh_TW.ts - Traditional Chinese
These are the UI's we have at present:
- <strike>AboutDialog.ui</strike> - **The text for this has changed, so needs an updated translation for all languages**
- ColumnDisplayFormatDialog.ui
- CreateIndexDialog.ui
- EditTableDialog.ui
- ExportCsvDialog.ui
- ExportSqlDialog.ui
- ImportCsvDialog.ui
- MainWindow.ui
- <strike>SqlExecutionArea.ui</strike> - **No strings needing translation**
This is pretty slow going stuff at present, while getting the hang of it.
Going to use one comment per language below, as it should make things easier to update.
- [ ] <strike>CipherDialog.ui</strike> - **No translated strings to work with**
- [ ] <strike>ColumnDisplayFormatDialog.ui</strike> - **No translated strings to work with**
- [x] CreateIndexDialog.ui - **Already ok**

Thanks @chrisjlocke that should help a bunch. :smile:
Make a PR for it though, don't just directly commit it.
@chrisjlocke By the way, which ones are those 6?  I'll continue on with the others. :smile:
Note, the Arabic translation has been redone completely today in #706.  Looks like 100% coverage too, which is pretty awesome. 😁
Write.  Sorry, right.  I can spend tomorrow doing some more languages.  I've seen most languages seem to have been completed, but unsure whether thats just the dialog or the full translations (I'm going through Qt Linguist, so doing the whole translation...) and I presume my 'bits' can't be merged with whats already been committed?  (Guess I could ignore the UI translations where they've been posted).  Sorry.  Rambling now...
If there is a specific language you want me to do next, let me know...
Thanks Chris.  Yeah, drop this for now.  Several of the original translation authors responded positively to being contacted, and have either given us complete translations back or said they would.
There are a few who haven't, but it's probably something we can look at closer to the weekend.  We might just leave those ones as-is for now.  Thinking we'll call it at the time.
Meh, we've done what we can for the 3.9.0 release.  It's "good enough for now".
:wink:
Excellent, this seems like a good start. :smile:
One small problem with it is showing up... the flag seems to be missing in the drop down list:
![screen shot 2016-07-11 at 06 26 04](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16720690/d92e152e-4730-11e6-9a62-b7acc68ad380.png)

Thanks @0xbsec, done. :smile:
(Btw, sorry team.  I forgot to choose the "squash commit" option for the merge. 😦 )
@0xbsec As a thought, some of the main strings in the user interface still seem to be in English when I try it.  Is that how it should be?
![screen shot 2016-07-11 at 19 36 49](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16742251/d5da519e-479e-11e6-84fe-c7e10b28b334.png)
Thanks @0xbsec.  Didn't know that was happening.  I've just created issue #643 about it, so we can investigate it properly. :smile:
@justinclift oooops, latest commits are a bit messy now.
Yeah, sorry @innermous.  I was tempted to manually merge them afterwards, then force push a single commit onto our main repo... but that's generally bad practise.  So I've resisted. 😧
But what 's done that's done :smile:
Yeah, next time one of us forgets, it probably would be better to manually merge then force push. :smile:
@justinclift I always check log via _tig_ three times before push :laughing:
Btw, which version is this on?
I can't reproduce this with the latest build.
@justinclift, Wasn't it fixed after `3.8.0`?
@ejohn54, Could you please try [the latest nightly build](http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser.exe.zip)?
@revolter Just tried here with the latest build too, loading a table, then going to Browse Data, then running a UNION SELECT query on it via the Execute SQL tab, then going back to Browse Data.
The ordering is keeping constant for me.
@ejohn54 If you can spare the time to check the latest nightly build, it would really help.  If you need a Win64 package, then this one from earlier today (solving a different issue, but it's good) has our latest code:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/sqlitebrowser-win64-issue621v3-201607151423.exe
@ejohn54 Thanks! :smile:
Is it a 64bit related issue? I have no idea what 64 implies (and breaks) related to code.
Yeah... same here. 😦
We'd probably need to look at our SQL statement generation code, and look at what controls the ASC/DESC piece.  It **could** be something like a bitmask going wrong, or maybe a variable being overwritten when it shouldn't be?  They sound like the potential data type screw ups that might happen with 32→64 bit.
Hmmm, Qt has some ability to "Set a watch on a variable" doesn't it?  That might be the go?
@innermous Any idea / hints with this one?
@revolter I am working on another rowid issue right now, can't help much.
If you filter any column then toggle the Show rowid column, all the filter text fields are cleared but the data stays the same.
It should reload the table, or better yer, not clear (or reapply, depending on the implementation) the text fields.
@justinclift, Not quite. As I understood, the refresh problem was just an UI issue. When minimizing and restoring the window, the column showed correctly.
I kind of remember there being a bug about this, and am pretty sure we've fixed it.  Well... 50% sure. :wink:
Ugh.  Well, that's not good. 😦
Thanks for checking btw, and updating this issue about it. :smile:
@justinclift Are you referring to #485?
Errr no?
It was a similar issue that caused the app to crash, and I thought that maybe could be related.
Ahhh, good point.  Yeah, it could be related.  Whoever looks into this should probably check the fix for that one, while figuring things out. :smile:
Exactly that I was thinking of, at least to find the source file that manages that context menu
Just to confirm on Win 8.1 (64bit) this occurs for me too.
http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cDiljqi4uR
Tried again with the latest nightly build with the same results.
Just played around with it some more, and when you view the rowId column the first time, it doesn't always display the rowId, but the previous column.... sorry, that probably doesn't make sense.  I did it once and took a while to recreate it.
http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cDilj5i4UO
View from 1:23.  First of all the rowId column isn't there - column 1 is still showing the 'x' from field1.  When I click where it should be, the display updates, so now I have two 'x's.
If I change tabs or click in the first column, then it updates correctly.
I have trouble explaining things properly sometimes ... wobble on with things I think are important, when sometimes a screen capture does the job quicker and easier!  "See - there - thats what I mean!"
I'm pretty sure this is related to #510. It probably crashes because of an overflow or invalid data.
Sorry, It didn't have anything to do with #510. I managed to reproduce and solve it in the latest PR. @karim can you test it? 😄
@karim Here's a once off Win64 build including the proposed fix by @revolter:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-issue639v1-win64.exe
Does it still crash for you?
> the problem was caused by using dlls that were built with Visual Studio 2013 in a project compiled with Visual Studio 2012. The reason for this was a third party library named the folders containing the dlls vc11, vc12. One has to be careful with any system that uses the compiler version (less than 4 digits) since this does not match the version of Visual Studio (except for Visual Studio 2010).
> The Microsoft C++ runtime dlls use a 2 or 3 digit code also based on the compiler version not the version of Visual Studio.
> MSVCP120.DLL is from Visual Studio 2013
> Now if MSVCP120D.DLL is missing, this means that the application you are trying to run is built in Debug mode. As OP has mentioned, the debug version of the runtime is NOT distributable.
> Go to your Project's Debug configuration > C/C++ > Code Generation > Runtime Library and select Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd). This will statically link MSVCP120D.dll into your executable.
Well, so much for that idea. :wink:  Sorry about that. 😦
I'll rebuild it in Release mode in a bit, so it uses the normal .dll.
@karim In theory, this one should run for you (tested on a VM here without MSVC installed).  It's a Release build version including the fix by @revolter. :smile:
&bull; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-issue639v2-win64.exe
Excellent. :smile:
Just merged the fix, so it should be in the nightly builds from tomorrow onwards.  @karim would you be ok to try one of the nightlies tomorrow, just to double confirm things?
@karim Just tried it here, and you're completely correct.  For some unknown reason, the fix for #510 isn't working, even though it was included in the build.
I'll reopen #510, and continue this there.
Hey Rich,
As a thought though, we have made a few bug fixes and general tweaks to things over the last few versions.  There's a reasonable chance (but no guarantee 😦  sorry) that the bug you're hitting has been fixed by our more recent versions.
As you're on Linux, it should be pretty simple to compile things from our latest source code, if that's something you're ok trying.  We have a build guide with general instructions for Linux, if that helps:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#generic-linux-and-freebsd
Is that something you're ok to try out? :smile:
No worries.  When you go to compile it again, try grabbing our latest source code ("master branch") from GitHub.
We're way overdue for a new release, and there have been a good number of bug fixes since 3.8.0. :wink:
Sure, no rush here. :smile:
Ahhh.  One useful way to see error messages is if you start it from the command line.
When it crashes, there should be output there.  Hopefully something useful.
Are you ok to try that, and let us know what it says? :smile:
Closing this due to lack of response. 😦
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/tree/master/libs/antlr-2.7.7
Yeah, it **could** be a path issue.
```
```
That "find_package()" macro runs this code, which seems to be where the problem is:
The trick will be figuring out what and why. :wink:
Btw, with qmake, run it in the main (root) checked out sqlitebrowser git source dir, then run `make` after it.  Like this:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.git
$ cd sqlitebrowser
$ qmake
$ make
[compiling stuff should happen here]
```
Note that sometimes when compiling this way on OSX it barfs after a while with an error about missing language translation files.  Running `make` again fixes the problem.  (yeah, someone needs to look into that, but it's a pretty minor problem)
Sure no worries at all.  Wonder if this is somehow showing up a weird gcc bug or something?
Thanks.  Please keep us posted. :smile:
No worries at all. :smile:
Healing well, and getting better is definitely of much higher importance. 😁
Cool, making progress. :smile:
a) Warning message about it not being found, but DB4S compiles + works ok anyway
b) Warning message, then failure to compile
With a), it can be ignored.  It turns out there there are two different approaches for finding ANTLR2 in our CMake configuration, one of them is a fallback to the other.  The "ANTLR2 warning but still compiles" situation happens when one of the approaches doesn't work (generating a warning), but the other one does (without giving a "found it!" message 😦 ).
With b) above... that's when it **really** can't be found.  You're not hitting that though, so it sounds like the build step is working "good enough" for you now. :smile:
As a first thought, would you be ok to try compiling against our `v3.9.x` branch, instead of our `master` branch?
If the focus problem doesn't happen with the `v3.9.x` branch, then we'll know it's our recent code which introduced it.  That'll give us a much better idea of what to look at. :smile:
@PSE-AG How'd this go? :wink:
Just to confirm I'm reading that correctly:
- When compiled for the `v3.9.x` branch, the focus problem **is** happening
- When compiled for the `master` branch, the focus problem **is not** happening
Is that right?
Thanks, now it's clear.  It's something we've done between the 3.8.0 and 3.9.0 releases, and it's still happening.
Damn. 😦
We can probably take a brute force approach to working out why.  (eg manual bisect)
It's a bit time consuming, although very effective.  I won't have time for it personally for at least the next fortnight though. 😦
[It looks](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2242490/865175) like you can activate a window using the `QWidget::activateWindow` function, and we only call it [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/55d8905b904ac57cf759db3b235b1ce27ab8c8a5/src/MainWindow.cpp#L788), but that shouldn't be a problem. So maybe it's an implicit behaviour caused by something else, rather than some explicit call?
Closing this due to lack of response from @venetasoft. 😦
As a thought, it might be worth trying the latest nightly build.  There are a tonne of bug fixes in that, and there's a chance this is already fixed.
On the other hand... I don't remember any window positioning bugs being worked on yet... so... the chance might not be huge. :wink:
Just tweaked the topic title, to remove the "Windows 10" bit on the end.  Hope that's right.
Note - I'm focused on a personal project (last few weeks, and probably a few more) so not keeping all that close an eye on things here.  I will get back to this stuff though. :wink:
@DelphiGit Hmmm, any interest in building it yourself?  We have a detailed [Windows build guide](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S) (best done in a VM) if you're interested.
@DelphiGit Sorry for the delay, didn't notice your fork & commit.
Here's a build of it for OSX:
&bull; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-issue633v1.dmg
Built that on my desktop though, instead of our official buildbox, so it **might** segfault for people using older OSX than 10.9.5 though (unsure).  Can rebuild on it our official buildbox later, if it does turn out to be a problem. :smile:
Sounds like a win all around then. 😄
@DelphiGit Want to make this into a Pull Request, so we can merge it?
Any interest in tackling other things too?
@DelphiGit Actually thinking this one: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/621
Unless you want a C++/Qt one, to gain experience with that side of things?
And thanks. 😀
Sure. :smile:
The NSIS packaging part, kicked off by the `PACKAGE` solution in MSVC has its bits [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L354-L386).
Looking at the screenshot from #621, the unquoted line is probably this one [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L378).
Hopefully it's as simple a fix as it sounds, but sometimes in practise the simple ones turn out to be hairier than thought. :wink:
One way to find out... 😁
For me, that minimises the running application down into the Dock.  To restore it, I click it in the Dock... which returns it to it's previous position.
Guessing you've tried that, but asking just in case. :smile:
k.  Marking it as a bug, but I'm not sure when someone will get to it.  Personally, I have no idea what could be causing that (yet). :wink:
If you have the time to try it, grab the latest nightly build (download locations are listed on our front page), and give that a shot.  It has lots of bug fixes for various things, and there's a (small) chance this is fixed in it.
@rvaneerd Would you have time to try out the new v3.9.1v2 binary for OSX, to see if this is fixed for you?
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/v3.9.1/DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.9.1v2.dmg Awesome. :smile:
Thanks too @ghellquist!  Ahhh, interesting.  Thanks for reporting it. :smile:
I am not familiar with RTL in Qt apps. Could you tell, please, how can I toggle it? Maybe then I could provide some solution to this issue.
Well, the issue is caused [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/FilterTableHeader.cpp#L73)
My suggestion is to check the app is opened in RTL mode via
``` cpp
bool reverse = isRightToLeft();
```
And do some changes in adjusting algorithm for that case. I tried to do some, but they have some glitches on resizing.
@chrisjlocke That `--reverse` switch might be useful for you in testing the Arabic translation as you go through getting it fixed. :smile:
If they don't happen when we build with Qt5, that would be another reason to move towards it. :smile:
The problem causing this issue is that drawing method is hardcoded, and the code inside it is strictly left-to-right.
I tried to make workaround, it worked well, but when you try to resize it becomes a little messy.
Was thinking the "glitches on resizing" thing might have been Qt4/Qt5 related.  Guess not. :smile:
Looking at the code you point out, I see what you mean about the hard coded order and needing to do a workaround.  Would you be ok to throw that code into a branch so we can take a look and maybe figure out how to keep it ok when resizing?
Interesting.  This shouldn't be too hard to implement. :smile:
```

before CREATE TABLE syntax?
This would be very helpful if the table existed in database. Thank you! @lvbeck Sure, no problem :smiley: I've added an additional option to the Export SQL dialog to enable this feature. So you'll need to set it up like this:
![spectacle lh5631](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/26000659/1275dc4c-372a-11e7-83a8-9c47cfb35cef.png)
Can you download the next nightly build (tomorrow) and check if it's working for you as expected? @MKleusberg I tested nightly build "DB Browser for SQLite-2017-05-15-win64.exe", it work exactly as expected, thank you for the amazing work!  Awesome. :smile:  Do we really need to write after each edit/insertion/removal? Why can't just user write changes whenever he wants or when database is closed?
App is tied to sql back-end too much, every action yields sql query triggered. Write for every action is redundant and application really suffers from it. Constraint bugs are hard to deal with update-per-action approach. In fact, if you look at other db managers - none of them writes every single change.
Currently, when we are adding new record - it's instantly written without letting user to input some data. It's so unnatural!
It's just my opinion, but maybe you can suggest something better.
What's the better way to do this, do you reckon?
Should we have most stuff be kept "in memory" (without running the SQL) until the person hits the "Write Changes" button?
If that's the case, any idea where we should start?
It's just my opinion, but keeping it in model and run SQL only on purpose sounds less error-prone.
@MKleusberg what do you think about it?
Yeah.  The current code base is the way it is due to a long legacy.
But, if someone wants to make things better, we'll definitely merge/patch/etc things so everyone benefits.
Definitely no incentive to keep doing things the old/bad way "just because". 😬
I'd vote for sort of a middle way here.
The issue mentioned by @chrisjlocke should definitely be addressed. I don't think either that it makes any sense to do that whole operation each time a field is moved. The only reason why we do it that way is because it's been the easiest and least error-prone implementation and I never got around to improve it. What we probably should do instead is comparing the old and the new table schemas and calculate a 'fastest' transtormtion from the one to the other.
There are probably more cases like these where we can reduce the amount of SQL commands issued in some way. But other than these I'd leave it the way it is, that is relying on SQLite for all the operations. Here are some reasons:
- We'd have to implement and maintain all this functionality and given our current manpower this would probably eat up all the time we have and which would be better off spent in fixing existing bugs.
- Also we'd have to keep track with SQLite's development. If the SQLite developers decide to change the behaviour of some feature, we'd have to re-implement it on our side too, to keep in sync with them. Again, they are definitely faster than we are :wink:
So to not reinvent the wheel I'd leave it the way it is. What we can and should do however is keep working on improving the way we use SQLite: @chrisjlocke 's suggestion is one example, but handling the errors SQLite generates when something fails in a better way, too. Also we should extend our SQL grammar parser to understand more ot the SQL commands by ourselves and not having to rely on SQLite for that.
I hope this makes some sort of sense :smiley:
@MKleusberg but how you wanna deal with situation where editing is locked due to instantly failed constraints(in various situations) and user being confused?
We should really start working on this issue, since a great amount of constraint bugs have been reported so far.
Let's start from the very beginning. Imagine we have a table, that doesn't fail when you add new row in a table with all those possible weird constraints :smile: It gives you possibility to edit fields of new record.
Then, eventually, you change focus, or press enter, or whatever - and the new record passes. It passes all constraints and is successfully added to sql backend.
But what happens if it's not? Should the new _virtual_ (I like to call it this way :smile:) record be purged, or should it throw errors again and again until we input everything correct? What are the ways to undo that virtual row, besides explicit deletion?
All those questions should have answers before we actually start fixes.
Timing wise... I'm kind of thinking we should do it after 3.9.0 is released - which I'm hoping to get done in maybe a week or 1.5 weeks.
Saying that because it sounds like changing the code in this way will give us a better foundation to build on... but at the same time is likely to show up lots of weird edge case bugs that we haven't fixed.  Better to do that for the release after 3.9.0 (4.0.0 maybe?), so we have more time to test, and not 250k people wanting to file new bugs. :wink:
Thoughts?
My only thought is this is kinda highest priority issue. It's not cosmetic or some not game breaking glitch. But it really reminds about itself every time. I had some research on it a month ago, now I am back to it again.
Help is really appreciated,  as I mentioned [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/628#issuecomment-233172979).
But well it can wait till release. I think this one will require some significant changes in the code.
Yep, same thought.  And the "wait one release"... think of it more like "wait just a few weeks". 👼
@schdub They seem like different things.  #241 seems to be about selecting several columns, then resizing all of the selected ones.
This issue seems to be about trying to resize a single column, but all columns are resized instead.
Am I reading it wrong? :smile: Ahhhh.  Yeah, I'm not sure of the best behaviour here.  @tonypdmtr ? Isn't that the case already? When I click Add Record the entire row is selected and highlighted just like when clicking the row number manually.
Another idea would be to only select the first column of the newly added row. This way the auto resizing won't happen. It would also make more sense for putting data into the row: when all columns are selected I can't just start typing and Tab-bing through the columns. The only downside of only selecting the first column that I can think of is that the new row is slightly less visible then. What do you think?  Ahhh yeah, that definitely sounds like the kind of thing that could happen.
In  addition, I wanna say, when copying _NULL_ field and inserting it in another cell just inserts **NULL** as text.
I've just reopened this because before we close stuff, we always ask the person who created the bug report to confirm it first.  That's because even though **most** of the time things are ok, sometimes fixes turn out to be not-quite-as-complete as we were expecting.  Or the bug reporter finds an unexpected side effect. :wink: So asking the bug reporter to verify things first leads to a better result.
@AO-StreetArt Just noticed your question about no validation of entries based on data type.
Just in case you're still curious about it, yeah, this is intentional. :wink:
SQLite itself considers the flexibility of datatypes to be a feature, and we'd be opening a weird can of worms if we didn't follow with the official position with it. :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html
Hope that helps. :smile:
Awesome. :grin:
We'll need to get the Travis check working though before anything else.  It's failing on the sqlcipher install part, prior to the compiling:
```
$ sudo apt-get install -qq libqt4-dev libsqlite3-dev libsqlcipher-dev libantlr-dev
libsqlcipher0 libsqlcipher-dev
E: There are problems and -y was used without --force-yes
The command "sudo apt-get install -qq libqt4-dev libsqlite3-dev libsqlcipher-dev libantlr-dev" failed and exited with 100 during .
Your build has been stopped.
```
Maybe add `--force-yes` to the apt-get line in the [.travis.yml](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/.travis.yml#L9) file as part of the PR?
It's worth a try. :smile:
Just amend it or add another commit and squash those into one.
Yep, GitHub associates this branch in your fork with this PR, so all the changes you do in the fork are automatically "known" by GitHub to be for this PR.
It means you can completely redo all of the commits however you want them (as long as you keep them in the same branch), and they'll all be part of this PR.  Generally it's very convenient. :smile:
With that latest commit, that seems to have worked.  I haven't had a chance to test the code yet, but probably will tomorrow.
Maybe @innermous would be ok to review it instead?  @innermous What do you reckon? :smile:
Cool. :smile:
You figured out how to update commits in PR? If not, write me in Gmail I'll explain if anything is wrong
Trying this out now, the .ui sizing seems to be off.  This is on OSX 10.9.5, using a non-HiDPI monitor. :wink:
![screen shot 2016-06-16 at 23 35 16](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16135370/1ae687f4-341b-11e6-8ea8-cf1463fd344a.png)
Testing out the functionality itself... it's not working properly for me.
Manually opening the file (before setting password info in the preferences dialog) works fine, with the password & page size prompted, then the database opening correctly when they're given.
After setting the same values in the Preferences dialog, the file no longer opens correctly.  A dialog saying "Invalid file format." happens instead, and that's all.  (btw, it should probably prompt using the manual password dialog when the automatic ones fail)
![screen shot 2016-06-16 at 23 42 48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16135553/43d04640-341c-11e6-9fc1-385dca21e59f.png)

I didn't attach a debugging to this to figure out what's going wrong.
Are you ok to investigate? :smile:
Can email the failing database file to you, if that would help?
Just a couple of thoughts, has anyone tried building this on Windows? Oh and I tried reading the changes but I can't fathom where the passwords are being stored but I trust we are not storing these passwords in plain text are we?
The first vital point, is "never roll your own crypto", so as long as we use some standard encryption library then we are fine. Not that you were proposing too but it is a point worth emphasising. Sorry, hope you don't mind.
I think the best approach is a "master password", a bit like Firefox, this password is then known by the user and used to decrypt, thus without it nobody can read the passwords. Remember, this is open source, so we need to make sure we protect passwords, so salting and hashing etc.
I appreciate this is a lot of work, so we could give people a statement to accept before using passwords stored in plain text. Then we have some time to consider a better solution. Does that make sense?
```
What do you mean by ".ui sizing"? The fact that I didn't managed to put the Add and
Delete buttons next to each other? 😂 I did tried a lot but couldn't figure out how to
do this.
```
With that, if you're in Qt Creator you can go into the "Design" part of things to resize the various GUI elements for a dialog.  It looks like the part of the dialog to contain the database name, password, and page size, aren't big enough for OSX.
In theory, it **should** :smile: be a fairly simple fix.  You adjust things in the Qt Creator "Design" part, then with git you add the corresponding .ui file to the commit.
If that doesn't make sense, let me know and I'll try to screenshot things in the next few days to demonstrate. :smile:
Ahhhh, no worries.  On the left side of the Qt Creator GUI there are tabs for coding (called "Edit"), vs GUI Design, vs meta info for the project, etc.  eg the Edit part:
![screen shot 2016-06-20 at 15 26 12](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16197851/8720d7ca-36fb-11e6-8fd0-bd602de116b5.png)
![screen shot 2016-06-20 at 15 28 07](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16197884/a8448e74-36fb-11e6-83b1-dffb457dbf8f.png)
To change GUI element sizing, double click on one of the .ui files (in the "Forms" subfolder), then the "Design" tab thing will become available.  eg:
![screen shot 2016-06-20 at 15 29 55](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16197942/dc89767c-36fb-11e6-9e85-51e24fc6ea18.png)
![screen shot 2016-06-20 at 15 30 27](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16197954/ef31d36e-36fb-11e6-9c1c-5d2bcbbc41a5.png)
In that, you can directly click on the **Database** tab (in the GUI itself), which will change things to show the GUI elements you're after:
![screen shot 2016-06-20 at 15 35 37](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/16198126/ae83272c-36fc-11e6-9fc0-500969902aec.png)
Then drag their edges to resize.  eg:
_Ugh, the GUI elements aren't resizing for me now for some unknown reason_
Well, that sucks. :wink:
At a guess, I think the GUI elements you're trying to do might need to be contained in some kind of layout widget.
But, I could be wrong.  I'd need to experiment with it further to figure it out, and I don't have time today/tomorrow. 😦
Maybe @innermous or @MKleusberg can offer pointers? :smile:
I'll read through all the comment and review the code tomorrow or on Friday. Then I can provide some more help and feedback, too.
But as for the resiting of widgets: the answer is, you simply can't :wink: Instead they're resized automatically based on the surrounding layouts. You can fine-tune this by adding spacers (appearing as springs in the Qt Creator form designer) or by setting the sizePolicy, minimumSize, and maximumSize properties of the wdget.
Qt docs for Layouts: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/layout.html
@revolter I'm looking through your pull request now and will just write my notes into the diff or inside here. I hope that's fine for you :smiley: First of all, thanks a lot for picking up this issue - I think you chose a nice task there, not impossible to do but certainly not easy either. If you manage to get this done you'll definitely be fit to do any changes you like. And so far you're doing really good :smiley:
Regarding the form layout: You can try all sorts of things here to make this look nice. For example you could try to make it look like the extensions list in the Extensions tab of the preferences dialog. I'll try to give you a step by step approach to this. If you have any trouble following me here, just let me know and I'll try to provide clearer instructions and/or screenshots. By the way: don't worry about having problems here. The Qt Creator UI designer often is super unintuitive to use :wink: Anyway, here we go:
1. Open the PeferencesDialog.ui file and switch to the Database tab
2. Right click on a free space inside the form (not on a widget). Click Lay out -> Break layout. Now you can freely move around the widgets and can do whatever you want with them. It's better not to so, however, because later we'll want to put them back into a layout.
3. Click the Add password button, hold the Ctrl key, and click the Remove password button.
4. When both buttons are selected, right click on of them. Click Lay out -> Lay out vertically.
5. Make sure the newly created layout is selected (i.e. the box around both buttons), then hold Ctrl, and click the saved password list box.
6. Right click on it, click Lay out -> Lay out horizontally.
7. Right click on a free bit of space somewhere in the form (having nothing selected) and click Lay out -> Lay out in a grid.
8. Right click again, click Lay out -> Lay out in a form layout.
9. Have a look on the widget list on the left: find the vertical spacer and pull it below the Delete password button but inside the layout surrounding the two buttons. This pushed them to the top.
Of course you can decide for another look and feel of the form, but however you want it to look like, I hope this will get you started :smiley:
Some other remarks on the form here:
- With this small widget, you should set the hirizontalScrollMode propery of the password table widget to avoid having this 'jumpy' ScrollPerPxel scrolling.
- For selecting the file name it would be nice to have a file dialog. It might be best to just auto open one when clicking into a cell in the first column and/or when clicking the Add password button.

I don't know how to open it when trying to edit the cell manually though. But I'm inclined to leave it like this, thinking that for the user to edit a database name cell, it means he already pressed the "Add password" before, which let him choose a database.
What do you think?
@glawrence, Agree. How will this show up in the UI?
Anyone knows why the Travis failed? It looks like it failed here:
```
553 1: Test command:
554 Unable to find executable: test-sqlobjects
555 1/2 Test #1: test-sqlobjects ..................***Not Run   0.00 sec

Actually, I think it failed here:
```

```
but don't know why :(
Maybe add a bold text line above the "Add password" horizontal layout thing, saying something like?
```
BE AWARE: These passwords are stored on your hard disk in plain text.  If someone
gets access to your computer, they are easy to retrieve.
```
@glawrence Your idea of a password vault thing seems decent.
eg We create a small SQLcipher encrypted database just for holding the passwords, and the user can enter a master password to open it up.
That being said... we'd want it to be the most thoroughly vetted/stable/unbuggy code anyone has ever seen.  Just the thought of an accidental bug corrupting such a vault for potentially several hundred thousand users gives me the shivers. 😱
With plain text, hopefully that's less of an issue.
Hmmm... thinking about it more, we should probably encourage people to backup their vault regardless (whether text or encrypted database), just to lessen the chance of disaster. :smile:
So what's the plan?
Also, if we use a small SQLCipher encrypted database, the password needed to access it would be in this open source code, so what would be the point of it?
Nah, it'd be a "master password" set by the user.  Not something we'd generate and store in the code ourselves.
Hmmm... I'm tending towards thinking the master password vault thing might be the best direction to go.
@MKleusberg @glawrence Opinions?
Sorry, I didn't understand well the first time. It sounds good, but I don't know where I would start 🤔
Ahhh, I probably explained the thought badly then. :smile:
So, imagine that the first time the user clicks the "Add Password" button, a dialog pops up and says something like:
```
Hi, before storing your passwords we need to create a safe place to keep them.
We'll do that by creating an encrypted database in [some path name], and we'll
lock it with a master password of your selection.
[OK][Cancel]
```
If they click OK, then it asks for a password to use for encrypting this "password vault" database.
This "password vault" database is a simple SQLite database (with SQLCipher encryption), containing the fields you are showing in the images above:
- Page size
When the user has given the "master password" to use, the code (in this PR) creates the database and encrypts it.
From then on, when a user presses the "Add Password" button, the info gets stored into this database.
Is that making sense so far?
Hmmm, anyone know of decent security people we could ping to get some advice about this?
I can email Bruce Schneier and see if it's his kind of thing if that would be useful.
Well, I understood the thought pretty well, I was referring to the implementation of this 😂
In my very own personal case, I have multiple databases in multiple locations, and I often switch between them, and I want to open them by just double click.
If you think this is a bad idea and/or not useful for other people, I'll just keep this version in my fork and periodically sync and install it (😢 ).
Ahhh... yeah, the "user needs to enter their password every time" was the thought.
Agreed, it does completely remove the ease-of-use approach you were going for.
Maybe the plain text approach + warning is the right idea for this after all.
I don't want to lead to bad decisions though. @sqlitebrowser/developers, would it be ok (do you have time) to discuss this and agree a safe solution for this, before the next release? 😄
Some thoughts on this...
- Adding a warning that we are storing passwords in plain text is a more open option
- If the data in a database needs a password then I am sorry but in my view access should not be convenient
- we should store passwords properly, plain text and a warning is not good
- the "master password" should be used to encrypt the passwords and hence without it they are unreadable
- other open source projects work with this, like Firefox and Chrome, so it is possible, just hard work
- I am now wondering what Oracle's SQL Developer does......
Thank a lot for the feedback!
So, the database needs a password for it to be accessed in an iOS app, but when working on it, I would want to access it fast, while keeping it encrypted.
I am definitely not saying you are wrong or something, it was just my use case.
But I still find the master password a little too much. Any idea how is Thunderbird storing the email's passwords? I can easily accesess password protected account without the need of a password. Can we apply the same reasoning/logic/implementation in DB4S?
On one hand, adding a text based password vault is maximum convenience.  But completely nukes security if someone has access to the local PC.
With a text based solution, the security of the databases doesn't sound like it would be compromised for the use case where they're really only intended for external distribution - eg to specific other people on different computers.  Only yourself (and the external people) should have the password.  Anyone else obtaining it (eg in transit) wouldn't have it.
I wonder if there's a better way?  eg support both approaches, and the user can pick the one that suits them?
I think supporting multiple (different) solutions is an superfluous overhead for the project. Maybe we should drop this or delay it until: one great solution is found / I have time to implement it / more users asks for this feature.
The Thunderbird source should be online somewhere.  Depending on how clear the code is, it **might** be feasible to look through that for ideas.  Or even the Firefox code?
k, going to close this for now.  If we figure out a better solution at some point, we can open it again or make a new issue. :smile:
If you read https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-and-import and https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/master-password you get a good idea of what is going on. The interesting item is if you reset your master password you lose everything. This is because the master is used to encrypt, without it you are stuffed. Yes, the source code will provide the answers but I think as a high-level design this is what we should work towards.
Well, I did take a look at Firefox's help page and started a draft comment which I'll post now as it is, not to forget about it at all, and we can discuss more when I get back from the vacation.
It looks like Firefox is offering a master password as an optional feature as described [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/where-are-my-logins-stored):
> On the other hand, putting all your logins in one place, unprotected, can be risky. Theoretically, someone who has access to your computer could open and view your logins in the Firefox Password Manager and go on an Amazon shopping spree ! Fortunately, Firefox lets you use a master password to prevent others from accessing your logins without your permission.
and [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-and-import):
> Even though the Password Manager stores your usernames and passwords on your hard drive in an encrypted format, someone with access to your computer can still see or use them. The Use a Master Password to protect stored logins and passwords article shows you how to prevent this and keep you protected in the event your computer is lost or stolen.
So Firefox (and probably others too) is storing the passwords on the disk encrypted, most probably with a key that's in the actual source code, so it won't need 0 difficulty to retrieve them at least.
Agreed. So without a "master" password the passwords are recoverable. However with a master password they are, I believe, encrypted with the master password, so lose that and they are all lost. This means those that are not too worried can store their passwords and easily get them. However the more concerned can encrypt the password store with a "master" password, making them readable, only with the master password. I trust that makes sense.
Like you I just brain dumped here. I think we might need to start a Wiki page or something and agree some workflows or something. No hurry though, all in good time.
This definitely sounds like something we should track down and fix prior to 3.9.0.
@abvanliew, Changed the milestone for the release following the next one as it probably requires some major changes which I and @justinclift are not able to do for 3.9.0.
Then I'll take care of this, been lazy for last two weeks.
@innermous, I _think_ the problem is in the parser stuff (eg `grammar/*`). I thought that maybe the bug is in antlr and we should update it (though we can't, atm).
Yep, the bug was in the `grammar/*` code, though not in the antlr code but in our grammar file which is then parsed by antlr. Should be fixed now :)
@abvanliew Can you test the next nightly build and report back if the issue is fixed for you?
@abvanliew Out of curiosity, would you have time to check if the fix @MKleusberg added works ok?
We have an upcoming release (3.9.0) this weekend, that would be good to get the fix into (if ok).
I can create a Windows build for you to test with, if that helps. :smile:
@abvanliew Yep, can do.  Btw, windows can run as either 32-bit, or 64-bit.  Do you know which one yours is?
If you're not sure, I'll just make a build for each one, and you can try them both to see which one runs.  It's not much extra time to do for either of us. :smile:
@MvGulik Yep, not a problem. :smile:
It's late here at the moment (I need sleep now), but I'll get into this tomorrow morning.
In the meantime if you need a possible solution, try the automatically generated nightly build linked from here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser#windows
That's a 32-bit one, and has the fix in it.  It also has some recent (untested experimental) code in it for other things... so I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of it even being usable.  But.. if it does, it might be ok until tomorrow. (make a backup of your data first!) :smile:
Using the same nightly, if I change the SQL to `CREATE TABLE subject_data_tmp (pid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ASC, pr_id INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT .5)` it works as required.
I also created a text field with a default of .5 (technically '.5') and that worked as desired too - it didn't get expanded to a default of 0.5.
Thanks guys, that's awesome. :smile:
I'll mark this as closed now, plus add the fix to the 3.9.x series code.
Official 3.9.0 will very likely be released this weekend, so it's not a long wait. :smile:
It's a reasonable suggestion, but it's not something we'll implement.
SQLite itself considers the flexibility of the datatypes to be a feature, and we'd be opening a weird can of worms if we didn't follow with the official position with it. :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://twitter.com/Ug_0Security/status/740569774548213760
Just created a new "security" label. :wink:
@justinclift not a windows user, unfortunately. I don't know about proper windows packaging, sorry.
Not a problem, wasn't sure. :wink:
I'll try to look into it this weekend. :smile:
As a data point, the reporter has asked if we can give public credit for this somehow when it's fixed.
We don't have a blog, so unless we start one, that could be difficult.
As an alternative thought, we're due to release version 3.9.0 in the near future, which this bug should be fixed in.  Maybe that's the correct place to give public credit in this case?
This should be a simple case or adding " around the path used to launch the vc_redist executables and any other executables the installer launches.
@glawrence Cool.  Want to give it a shot? :smile:
@DelphiGit The most optimal solution is to chuck your changes into a separate branch.
eg from the command line:
```
$ git checkout -b some_new_branch_for_issue621
$ git commit
```
"Branches" are used to keep groups of related commits together, so things are neat.  Then, when someone clones your repository they can switch to a given branch with one command and only have the commits you added in it.
So... make a new branch for it. :smile:
Yep, you succeeded, that looks good. :smile:
So, for this issue to be fully fixed, we need the NSIS guys to update their codebase such that the generated uninstallers don't have the problem too.  Once that's done, new/future packages should be created with that, and we should be good. :smile:
But, at least for now one part of it is solved. :wink:
As part of a discussion with the original reporter via email and Amir Szekely (@kichik) from NSIS, Amir pointed out it seems like CMake is the one at fault in this instance.  CPack (part of CMake) generates the NSIS script used to generate the uninstaller.  The template for that script isn't properly quoting things.  eg:
- https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/master/Modules/NSIS.template.in#L916
- https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/master/Modules/NSIS.template.in#L655
There may be other occurrences too.
The original reporter is in process of contacting Kitware, the main sponsors for CMake.
Will add further relevant info here as comes to light. :smile:
After experimenting with a few things, adding quotes to the first part of the ExecWait line pointed out by Amir fixed the issue: https://github.com/justinclift/CMake/commit/af65a04f690e1d6e6e2d3aa3467116689ab12b4f
Hopefully Kitware gets a new release out soon.  If not, we can just use a manually patched version of the template file in CMake when making our next release.
This is being addressed on the CMake developers mailing list:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/cmake-developers/2016-July/029039.html
The fix should be in CMake 3.6.1.
CMake 3.6.1 has been released, which includes the fix for the unquoted path problem for the 2nd half of the problem (during uninstall):
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-6-1-available-for-download/
This issue can probably be closed now. :smile:
That's great news, assuming the place where we do builds for releasing has CMake 3.6.1.....
@glawrence Good point.  I'm going to attempt doing the builds for 3.9.0, just to make sure we have the capability whenever needed. :smile:
Hmmm, looking at your screenshot... not seeing what you mean?
Adding this 3.10.0 milestone, as it wouldn't hurt for us to at least investigate the possibility. :smile:
Just pushed a commit that reduces the margin in there. There's more we could do to make this look better but I'm not sure we should. One reason is that this would mean the Database Structure tab would start looking different from the rest of the application. Another reason is that Qt does all sorts of things to make applications appear in different ways on different platforms and I'm not sure how much we want to interfere with that.
That being said, what does everyone think of the reduced margin? :smiley: Looking at this again now, and the reduced margin seems fine to me. :smile: @dridk Do you have a few minutes to try out a recent nightly build, and let us know if the reduced margin is now how you were meaning? :smile: > this would mean the Database Structure tab would start looking different from the rest of the application.
The other areas are now looking 'different' to the database structure tab.  So the docked SQL Log, DB Schema, etc, now have the extra margin.
Personally, I prefer 'some' margin.
So this is how it is currently (latest nightly)
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/24762914/bb4fa64a-1ae7-11e7-9199-03ca0c1fd808.png)
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/24763026/0cb12cac-1ae8-11e7-83c1-2298254f938d.png)
(with no right margin)
But it looks better with no left margin...  although now you've got a big gap in the middle between the two tab controls.
In the same vein, losing the left margin on the 'browse data' tab looks slightly better (which you can't replicate for the right margin)
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/24763233/aa551d9c-1ae8-11e7-87da-90744914d09a.png)
Although you don't exactly gain a lot of screen space by doing it! Hmmm, yeah not sure.  On OSX with the latest source, the margins still seem to be there:
![screen shot 2017-04-06 at 17 28 03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/24765093/6dd68d32-1aee-11e7-943c-05b90f134e68.png)
If you have some time to investigate on your end, make a copy of the database for yourself, then try emptying it of all the data (just leaving the tables).  If that no longer causes the crash, then it means there's something in the data triggering it.
If that's the case, then you'd be able to figure out the data-causing-the-problem by selectively removing stuff until only that is left. (again, using a copy of the original one)
Does that make sense? :smile:
No worries at all.  We'll close this issue for the moment, but if you do get it to reproduce please open it up again. :smile:
Ahhh yeah, that sounds like you are on the correct path.
Using multiple databases is a different thing, a bit more advanced.
Though to be fair, we need to fix the program so that works properly too. :wink:
Any update on this? Basically there are two ways to work with multiple databases:
1) Open a second instance of DB4S and open the other database in there.
2) Attach another database (as mentioned above) to the main connection.
The problem with approach 2 is that (at least for now) the attached databases don't show up in the UI. But that's a different issue, I think :smiley:  @chrisjlocke The fix for this, made by @innermous, has just been added.
Would you have time tomorrow to try the (new) latest nightly build, to confirm it from your point of view? :smile:
Would you be ok to try the latest nightly build? (download locations are listed on our front page)
There have been a bunch of fixes in it since the last release, many of which deal with crash type things. :smile:
@ghost Have you had a chance to try the nightly build? :smile:
Closing this, as it's been a month since asking and no update from the original poster.
@ghost, if this still happens for you even with the latest nightly build, you're welcome to re-open this issue again.
This looks like a good idea.  From my point of view it would be welcome. :smile:
The source for Heidi is available, so maybe take a look through that to get an idea of one useful approach? It may be you think of a better way, after seeing the way they do it. :smile:
Ugh, I knew our constraint handling is buggy and needs improvement, but this seems pretty bad.
Just tested it here on the very latest source code, and it's busted there too. 😦
Thanks for pointing it out @bontibon. :smile:
Thanks for reporting this! It should be fixed in tomorrow's nightly build. Can you test that (see the main page of our repo for download links) and report back if it's working for you now? :smiley:
Have you looked at using project files yet?
In theory, they're supposed to do exactly this.  eg when you first open a database you open the database file as normal.  After that, you can save a "project file", which has all of the database specific adjustments (eg column widths) saved in it.  From then on in you open the project file directly (instead of the database), then DB4S will load the database & apply the settings.
Does that make sense?
Btw, if something's not being saved properly in a project file, that's worth filing a bug for to get it fixed. :smile:
Sure, there's that.
Though on the other hand, some people can be a bit unhappy when tools add their own metadata/info into a database (mostly if it's unexpected).
We could probably make it config option or something, if it's something you feel others would prefer too.  eg "store project settings inside the database" ?
That being said, I have no idea of the effort required to implement this.  If it's a pain, it's unlikely to happen. :wink:
Cool, those are good feedback points, I might dig into them this weekend. :smile:
Fixes #610.
Expanded out many of the functions so they can be single stepped
through easily by newbies (eg me), which allowed for identifying
(then fixing) a few minor bugs.
- if setSeparatorChar() had an empty value passed to it the first
time, then in subsequent calls it would silently use \0 instead,
including using that in the output CSV data.  Likely not great. :wink:
- the empty option for the quote separator is now correctly retained
between runs of the dialog
Hmmm, I've seen both styles of bracket placement in the code already.  (eg do a grep -r "else" from the main dir)
So, I just picked my preference. :smile:
After sleeping on it, I kind of think the switch statement approach used in currentNewLineString() is super clear and without unwanted side effects:  https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/ExportCsvDialog.cpp#L322-L334
So, I might try redoing some of the methods in this PR using that, and see if it's an improvement. :smile:
Yeah, its a good idea. :smile:
With indenting the cases... I actually remember my decision here.  I went with the default that Qt Creator set them to when I first entered the switch keyword and hit return.
Personally, it's not something I care much about, so if we decide to have a defined coding style for them I'm happy to do whatever. :smile:
Rewrote the functions using a switch statement.  Also fixed another minor-ish bug in the output, found when examining the csv output using hexedit.
Side note, that [hexedit](http://rigaux.org/hexedit.html) util is nifty.  Nicely, it's available via Homebrew (`brew install hexedit`).
Noticed another weird bug in the Export CSV dialog, while investigating a different one (#605).
The new weird bug is that the 3rd option for the Quote separator character is never selected correctly in the widget.  It may be something to do with string matching on the character, due to the way the compare in the function is run.
Need to look into it properly after a decent amount of sleep though. :smile:
Thanks.  Yeah, I didn't know there were so many bugs in some of these areas.  Fixing now... :smile:
As a data point, I'm needing to adjust the code in this file just so it's easier to trace/debug through.
eg: https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/commit/203c51759f809215ce66387eb1c475777b88a62d
I'm opening this issue to discuss two ideas regarding the technologies we want to use and/or support. The two ideas are totally independent, so let's try not to confuse them :wink:
## 1) Start using C++11 (or C++14 or C++17)
- How about the nightly builds for Windows? What compiler version does mxe use? Let's not break the nightlies and let's not put too much work on Rene here.
- What documentation would we have to update?
- Any other processes relying on the current way it's building? If so, can we break them?
## 2) Drop Qt4 support
Qt4 is no longer maintained and it doesn't make sense to support it forever. At the moment we're limiting ourselves to the features supported by both, Qt4 and Qt5. Again, there's nothing major we're unable to do because of this but it would make the code a bit cleaner to be able to assume there's only Qt5 to support. I also see a chance of making the documentation and debugging a bit easiert by dropping Qt4 support because we can just make clear that we don't support it (and thus don't need to document it) and assume that each issue reported comes from a version compiled with Qt5 (since it won't compile with Qt4 anymore).
Problem: As far as I know, the Windows nightlies are using Qt4. If we dropped Qt4 support Rene would have to update the build process.
Also, I remember some issue or two where people would have problems with the Qt5 builds but got better results with the Qt4 builds. Does anybody remember these issues? Some font/display thing probably?
- Does anybody else use Qt4?
- Which version of Qt5 do we want to be the minimum requirement? Qt 5.0 doesn't make a lot of sense I think, but the latest version doesn't make much sense either.
So what do you all think? :smile:
I'm pro C++11 and pro dropping Qt4 but definitely don't want to rush this.
For 1), I have no opinion as I don't grok the difference yet. :wink:
As a way to see what breaks, we might want to add a stub C++11 feature to master for one night to see if MXE still creates the build or not.  If it does, then great.  If not, well we have our answer for that bit :smile: and can just revert it.
For the nightly windows builds, it's probably a decent idea for us to set up a new nightly builder using MXE.  I set up an initial CentOS 6 VM in Rackspace about a week ago for testing other stuff on, though I haven't yet looked to see whether MXE works there.  Rackspace supports a bunch of different OS's though, including Arch 2015.7 (just checked), so if someone wants to get it building there via cronjob that's completely workable.  I'm not familiar with Arch though, and don't really feel like getting back into Linux if I can help it right atm. :wink:
For 2), things broke when creating the OSX packages using Qt5 for um.. the 3.8.0 release I think.
By "broke" I mean that they seemed to work fine for me, but the .app created was just crashing for some people.  No idea why, as there didn't seem to be anything clearly in common with the reports (apart from being OSX, though across multiple versions).
I don't have enough clue with debugging OSX crashes yet to chase down why.  If this problem can be resolved, it would help. :)
Note - I kind of suspect it might be something to do with OpenSSL.  Maybe the builds were relying on system OpenSSL instead of Homebrew one?  I'm unsure, and don't remember.
As an additional point, at least OS/2 doesn't have Qt5 available.  Or didn't when support for that was added a few releases ago.  It's a pretty minor platform in usage though, so I'm not sure we should keep with Qt4 just for that. 😇
@innermous @glawrence What are your thoughts on this? :smile:
My personal view is we should move to the latest Qt as soon as possible and that this should be the priority as this can deliver real benefit to end users. Then I see no reason why we shouldn't move the latest C++ standard, providing Qt is compatible as well as all our build processes. Although in many ways I would rather see the builds fixed but we need to consider how best to use people's time and skills.
To drop Qt4, we need to figure out a solution for the static build problem (MXE), and the OSX problem.
Those two seem to be the only things really stopping us for Qt5.
For doing Qt5 things in a separate branch... ugh.  That sounds like a not-great idea to me.  It would be too easy to only implement features in Qt5 branch, ignoring the Qt4 one.
We would be better off doing stuff with Qt4, and then update to Qt5 once the migration problem are solved.  That one there is only one active development branch. :smile:
I've just been reading https://wiki.qt.io/New_Features_in_Qt_5.7 as Qt 5.7 is coming soon, the point to note is the first item "C++11 Support Required from the compiler". So even if we don't switch to Qt5 on all platforms straight away, C++11 is the right path to be going down.
@glawrence I already mentioned it :smile:
One new hiccup with Qt5.  Unlike Qt4, the Qt5 version of `macdeployqt` (a utility it ships with) doesn't work properly. 😦
Using `macdeployqt [name of .app]` is **supposed** to correctly determine the shared libraries needed by the .app, then bundle them into the .app package for deployment.
With Qt4, it "just works".  With Qt5, it fails to work correctly, even when claiming success.
Leading to things like this when users try to run it:
![screen shot 2016-08-14 at 17 13 37](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17650348/32cd0306-6243-11e6-9fe6-e9887f659d38.png)
We're not the first to have this happen.  It has generated a reasonable level of negativity towards Qt by OSX developers.  Hopefully there are good workarounds already written up, rather than needing to debug and fix macdeployqt itself.
I'll try to solve this for the main 3.9.0 release next weekend, but who knows... :wink:
As an interesting data point from quick testing on my OSX desktop.
When DB4S is built using the "official download" version of Qt 5.7.0 - the one through their online installer - rather than using the latest Homebrew one (5.6.0), then `macdeployqt` didn't screw up the dependencies.
I'll try it on our build server soon.  Hopefully the fix really is this simple. :smile:
Yay, that worked. :smile:
Going to add the Qt5 build to our 3.9.0-beta1 release page... and see if people start reporting crashes.  Hopefully not. :smile:
Not really up to date here... but if this build turns out to work, are there any reasons left to _not_ drop Qt4 support?
As far as I know... this was the last really concrete thing holding us to Qt4. :smile:
We could be ok to say "right, we're Qt5 only from now on!" in just a few weeks. 👯
Ahhh... the Windows nightly builds may need investigation too.
One alternative might be to attempt automating the nightly Windows builds on Windows itself.
Our OSX build box has Win 7 x64, SQLCipher, and the rest of the pieces needed for building DB4S in a VM.  It's not fast, but the box itself doesn't really do anything else and is (so far) very stable.
We'll need to figure out Travis CI too.  It's using Qt4 at present.
It may be as simple as changing the `libqt4-dev` here to `libqt5-dev`:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/.travis.yml#L9
Travis automatically builds on any branch in the repo, so we can experiment in a temporary "qt5test" branch to figure this out.  When we know exactly what's needed, we can commit that specific change to master. :smile:
@revolter Any interest in getting this done?
When building with cmake Qt4 is still the default, you have to enable Qt5 for building using the `-DUSE_QT5=1` option. The only exception is building on Windows using MSVC where Qt5 is the default. So this would need to be adjusted for Travis, too (besides the libqt4-dev).
I could change the build files to use Qt5 as default. But this would break the nightlies.
Oops.  Obviously hadn't read the rest of the Travis config properly. :wink:
@justinclift, I guess I can't understand this properly to fix it.
No worries.  I can guide you through it on the Gitter channel if you're interested?
@MKleusberg Qt5's new approach to image handling - using plugins - seems like it will stop static builds from being very useful: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/579
We'll definitely need to look at automating MSVC to create the nightly builds instead.
Another aspect of static builds... the Qt5 licensing has changed slightly from Qt4.
Looking at the [GPL license compatibility list](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses), we seem to be ok though.  But, that's from a rough read of things and I'm not a law professional. :wink:
These might be useful.  They're the MSVC2013 reference pages about its C++11 support:
- https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh409293(v=vs.120).aspx
- https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh567368(v=vs.120).aspx
- https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2013/06/28/c1114-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-vs-2013/
These are for MSVC2015, which I've not tried building DB4S with yet:
- https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh409293.aspx
- https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb531344.aspx
Updated our OSX nightly build script today.  It's now building with Qt5 (and signing the .app's), so that's one less thing to take care of. :smile:
There's a problem with Qt5 not showing all data records, on at least OSX: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/737#issuecomment-241616641
It happens for both SQLCipher and non-SQLCipher builds.  When dropping back to Qt4, the issue goes away.
Haven't tried on Window yet, to see if it's just an OSX-only thing.
I think I'll do a quick test and push a commit which introduces some C++11 code just to see if and where it's failing :smiley:
Just noticed something interesting while looking into #786.
CentOS doesn't include Qt5 in any of it's repositories.  It _can_ be manually compiled though.
This will need to be thought through... 😦
@revolter pointed out [this page for deploying Qt5 applications on Windows](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html).  Specifically, it seems to cover Qt5 plugins in some depth.
Just got rid of all the Qt4 stuff in our codebase :D I guess Vlad can start celebrating now :champagne: :tada:
@justinclift One more thing to do :wink: Can you maybe have a look at that Wiki page (https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Notes-for-setting-up-your-build-environment-on-OSX)? It looks outdated to me, especially now, but I'm unsure if it still contains some useful information.
Thanks, good thinking.  Just updated that page with we're-Qt5-only-now info. :smile:
With the SQLCipher support, I wrote up initial instructions on my fork of the wiki, but haven't transferred them to the main one as they're not finished yet.  That being said, there's enough info in them that you'll probably be able to work it out.  Look at step 7:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Win64-setup-—-Compiling-SQLCipher#7-compile-sqlcipher-into-db4s
With the Retina support for OSX, it sounds like it might be related to this:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/f0d692547031c43b29243fd162e0e973ad55adbd
Not sure why it's not in effect for you though.  Maybe there's and #ifdef or something around that's stopping that being applied to your system? 😦
@revolter Was the above helpful at all?
The error text in your comment above is indicating it's finding the SQlite3 libraries, not the SQLCipher one.  On my OSX development box I generally find I need to remove sqlite (`brew remove sqlite`) and ensure only sqlcipher (`brew install sqlcipher`) is installed.  That's the case even with `CONFIG+=sqlcipher` added to the qmake line, as per screenshot above.
In theory, it should be possible to make SQLite3 + SQLCipher co-exist on the same development machine ok.  In practise... I haven't quite figured that out yet. :wink:
Btw, I'm looking back at this stuff now that I've got my home lab setup mostly working.  Your feedback is definitely useful. :smile:
Yeah, I'm using Qt Creator 4.0.0, manually downloaded from the Qt website, with SQLite/SQLCipher installed through Homebrew too.
Not 100% sure, but I don't think Homebrew has a formula for Qt Creator.  It's completely possible I'm wrong though. :wink:
With the Qt version, so far I've been finding that if I have qt installed through Homebrew, it seems to confuse Qt Creator (gets the wrong one) and generally fails.  So I've been using the version of Qt5 that comes with Qt Creator instead.  Pretty sure that would be fixable too, with some adjustment of paths and stuff.
Btw, yeah, the `remote` vs `remove` was a typo.  Fixed now, thanks. :smile:
For breaking OSX stuff... it depends.  It won't break OSX itself, but if you have other Homebrew formulas installed using it, they'll barf until it's put back.
For me that's workable, as I don't really need anything else installed while doing dev stuff.  That may not be typical though.
Heh Heh Heh, unfortunately nope. :wink:
The error you're getting there is shown by the third line in that:
```
```
Notice the path for that is /usr/local/lib/ [stuff]  ?
It looks like something is trying to run, and depends on a Homebrew installed version of libJPEG.
Guessing you removed more than just SQLite? :smile:
Interesting. What does your `brew list` output show?
Btw, I'm kind of wondering if just recompiling jpeg ('brew remove jpeg --force; brew install jpeg`) would do the trick to fix that error. :smile:
Btw, what's the program you're trying to run that's failing?  It's not henplus is it?
Ahhhhh.  Wasn't sure from the context. :smile:
I have a tendency to wipe my brew's out prior to getting into dev stuff, then just installing the one's I need for that.  After doing dev stuff, I run the brew install line to install them all again.
My list is a bunch shorter than yours though, so that may not be feasible for you. 😇
😦
The `otool` command looks like it would be interesting, and help if you hit problems like this again:
```
$ otool -L src/sqlitebrowser.app/Contents/MacOS/sqlitebrowser

In theory that should show every library which the target executable needs (the sqlitebrowser executable in the above line.)  If something is missing, it should explicitly show it.
Yeah, I'm not sure.  I'm not clueful enough with otool yet to know.
It _might_ be one of the libraries in the list from otool was relying on it (Qt?), and a version mismatch happened for some reason.  Wild shot-in-the-dark guess though. 😦

It's not showing up big warnings for missing libraries after all.  Definitely need to investigate this more.
Ahhh, yeah.  There have been a few changes on the master branch in the last few days, including changing the application name to `DB Browser for SQLite` finally.  Way overdue.
Um... maybe take a note of the latest commit you have for your master, so you can reset back to it if the latest code upsets your now-its-finally-working setup? :smile:
I normally do:
```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
```
Ahhh yeah, that looks good too. :smile:
Yeah, our constraint handling definitely needs work at the moment.
It's fairly common to find busted things in it with the present release. 😦
As a thought, we have made _some_ bug fixes for this part of things, though not nearly enough (yet).
Which platform are you using?  If it helps, there's a chance the nightly builds might at least address the bug you're hitting at the moment.  Worth a try if you have the time. :smile:
Thanks.  That's one of the two main things I think we should improve for the next release.  The other one is to fix the data entry side of things, so that people can quickly enter many values into cells, by just pressing enter (or tab) to get to the next one.  It used to work, but the "Edit Cell" window thing now seems to break it.  I've been meaning to investigate it properly, but haven't yet done so. :wink:
@MKleusberg did you work on this issue? I barely can do anything about it, my only thoughts are to use proxy model and submit new row data to sql database as soon as that new row is edited and another row is selected/enter pressed, as it was suggested before.
And btw @justinclift there are 2 or 3 similar issues in tracker, we should probably close them, since we have this thread.
@Novo55 Unfortunately... this is unlikely to be fixed for the upcoming 3.9.0 release (maybe next week).  It's very likely to be fixed for the one after that though, as it annoys us all and we're sick of this problem hanging around. :wink:
@Novo55 As a possible workaround for now (after making a backup of your database, just to be safe), trying turning on the "Ignore Check Constraints" Pragma.
It's the 6th one down the list, in the "Edit Pragmas" tab of the main interface.  With that turned on, you can probably add the records you want.  After you're done, turn if off again.
Does that help? :smile:
Awww rats.  Well, hopefully the release after our next one has this fixed properly. :smile:
@Jeff-G As a thought, would you be ok to try **today's** nightly build?  @MKleusberg was fixing some of the constraint stuff last week, and it should be in better shape now.
Note the "**today's** build" wording though.  We added some experimental code this afternoon, which could break tonight's automatic nightly build (we're testing some things out).  There may not be a good nightly build from tomorrow onwards for a few days... :wink:
Thanks Steve. :smile:
Ahhh, interesting catch.  Give me a few minutes to verify this, then if good I'll merge it. :smile:
Thanks @revolter, that's perfect. :grin:
😀
More are welcome. *hint\* *hint*
Just sayin'. :smile:
@revolter Many thanks from my side, too, for this PR :smiley: If you feel like doing more PRs but need any help with it just open an issue or a half-finished PR and we'll try our best to help you.
Yeah, that's generally the best practise approach.
That way your patches don't depend on each other, which can be a bit weird if an earlier one needs changing before it gets accepted. :smile:
Also, I think if you accidentally have multiple PR's in one branch, they'll overwrite each other in GitHub.
Reading through that, I'm a bit uncertain.  When you say "text can be entered into the cell", you're meaning the "a", "b", "c", d" above in the Not NULL, PK, AI, and U fields?
If so... that does sound like a bug.  Not sure if it's in DB4S or in Qt though.  If it's in our code, we should fix it. :smile:
Errr, I've been meaning to look into this one, even if just for improving my understanding of Qt widgets. :smile:
Ahhh, I guess it means the Windows nightly build box isn't autoupdating its packages.
I've just emailed @rp- to see if he's ok to fix that.
Want to try the build tomorrow and verify things from your end? :smile:
Awesome. :smile:
Looks like 3.13.0 is still bundled with sqlitebrowser , but sqlite team has released 3.14.0, 3.14.1, 3.14.2 since then.
In a couple weeks (or less) 3.15.0 will be released.
sqlite releases happen quite often, as you can see here:
http://sqlite.org/chronology.html
13 releases for this year alone.
Prior to a release of sqlitebrowser, perhaps sqlite could be updated to the latest sqlite version. Then after that, follow sqlite's releases once a quarter? once a month? every releases?
I have no idea what would work best with the team, so happy to hear some input.
AFAIK, we don't use SQLite anymore, and instead, we package the Windows and the macOS apps with SQLCipher. So they need to merge the new releases into it. But I'm not sure this is correct, @justinclift knows the best about this.
What made the project switch away from sqlite itself and move to SQLCipher? Could that have been added as an extension?
With SQLite vs SQLCipher, it's a "one or the other" thing when the build gets compiled.  It doesn't seem possible to have SQLite be compiled in, and also include SQLCipher on the side.
The SQLCipher team will hopefully make a new release soon, and it'll probably be based on something much newer. :smile:
So I got it right 😄 And, yeah, I think there would be more upset people (including me) if we drop SQLCipher support than if we don't support latest SQLite feature. That doesn't mean that not having the latest features is a good thing, but as @justinclift said, we can't do both, so we only have to wait for SQLCipher to release new versions.
Does that make sense? If yes, is it ok to close this issue? 😄
It's not always about new features when upgrading, right? Bugs are fixed and many optimizations are made. Just take a look at the changes page:
https://www.sqlite.org/changes.html
You'll notice that there are new "features" but it seems there's a number of optimizations (using that very generically) and bug fixes.
Being dependent on SQLCipher may mean it's a good pairing with sqlitebrowser, but it also means users will miss out on sqlite's improvements.
Yeah.  On the balance of things, having encryption available by default seems like the right choice. :smile:
Would it be possible (as a feature...) to download sqlite.dll / sqlcipher.dll and plonk that next to the db4s.exe (not that its called that of course...) and it looks at that instead of its compiled version?  Of course, if the .dll is missing, it uses its compiled version.  This would mean the people who want the latest version of sqlite.dll to fix an issue can have that, otherwise they can have the sexy encrypted cipher version...
Guess its a bit like how WinAmp and the like work ... the mp3 DLL was shipped with the .exe, otherwise you could point it to a different version.
For me, I'd prefer the fixes and improvements[1] than encryption.
[1] Admittedly the improvements are mainly in the _use_ of the database, so are given to the users in a production environment, rather than in _development_ of the database, ie, adding tables, fields, etc... my main use of DB4S...
Alternatively, we could provide a build for each:
- Win32 + latest SQLite
- Win32 + latest SQLCipher
- Win64 + latest SQLite
- Win64 + latest SQLCipher
- OSX + latest SQLite
- OSX + latest SQLCipher
So far I've been viewing that idea as "unnecessary complication", rather than something that would benefit people.
Any ideas if there's a better way to do it? (the "provide your own .dll" thing seems too hard at the moment)
Wow, that does seem to complicate the build process. Maybe the only change being to include Win32 + latest SQLite?
The build process would be more icky yeah... I'm also thinking of the download page as well.  6 buttons instead of 3.
We definitely have novice users hitting the website, thus my strong desire to keep that particular side of things simple.
If you really want the newest SQLite included in builds, when I get around to making the new [automated Windows nightlies for Qt5](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/775), I can make sure that it spits out both SQLite and SQLCipher versions.  The OSX nightlies do that already, so it'd just be copying that approach.
This will only suit the people who know where to look though.  Most likely [here](http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/).
Thoughts?
Right, I don't think there would be an easy way to really explain the differences between
Win32 + latest SQLite and Win32 + latest SQLCipher to novice users on the download page.
I'm perfectly happy with your proposal and I'm thankful you've kept an open mind to the thoughts (not even going to say concerns) I've brought up.
No worries.  Sounds like we have a solution then. :smile:
There are builds with SQLite, and with SQLCipher, for both 32 and 64 bit windows:
- http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32/
- http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/
In theory (!) they should be good, but it wouldn't hurt to have someone double check and make sure. :smile:
@justinclift,
Both installed and worked without an issue for my quick testing!
Can @chrisjlocke give them a shot, too?
Thanks for the efforts on building both!
In the title where it says "Save the table ..." do you mean that this is happening in one of the export dialogs?
This might be difficult to fix since this is a Qt thing as far as I can tell. On my system the dropdown list immediately closes after clicking an item, so no chance to click on another one during the loading process. Which OS and which version of Qt (see the About dialog of DB4S for that) you're using by the way?
I finally recorded this: https://vid.me/E2IG. I know it looks forced, but it happens quite often when being in a rush.
Cool, that looks pretty straightforward.  I'll test it tomorrow, after I get some sleep.  Might need to get @MKleusberg to look over the code first too, as I'm still in early stages of learning C++ myself.
@innermous Thanks a lot for this contribution, Vlad! Looking really good :smiley: I have only two remarks here: the first one I've put into the code. It's about not copying NULL values to the ditto row. The second one is that it might be a good idea to check if the user is currently browsing a view or a table. And if it's view we should deactivate the 'Duplicate row' action. It currently fails with an error message, so it's not too bad, but as it'll _never_ work we might as well disable it. This would probably belong in MainWindow::showRecordPopupMenu(). Are you interested in implementing this? :smiley:
But again, other than that this looks really good. So thank you very much for all your effort here :+1:
@innermous Sorry for not having been more explicit there! @revolter is right, I meant the view database objects that are created by a CREATE VIEW command, like this one:
``` sql
CREATE VIEW viewtest AS SELECT 1;
```
Execute that, select that view in the Browse Data tab, and try to duplicate its row. At the moment this will result in an error message, so the option to duplicate rows on views should probably be forbidden :smiley:
Yeah, Qt4 is still important to us.  Although Qt5 has been around for a while now, we still need to maintain compatibility with the older version for at least a few more releases. :smile:
He is in EU timezone, but can get very busy with his study (at University) and job, so it's not always super fast.
When I have more experience with C++/Qt, this should be faster.
Again, sorry it is taking so long and being frustrating. 😦
Hopefully yes. :smile:
Btw, I'm not being lazy. 😇
This weekend I have been putting time into fixing a different project ([#5](https://github.com/freenas/freenas-build/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/freenas/freenas-build/pull/6), [#7](https://github.com/freenas/freenas-build/pull/7)), because I am trying to get my home LAN working.  That is almost finished now, so I should be able to focus back on sqlitebrowser (and learning C++/Qt) soon. :smile:
@innermous Sorry for the delay! But it's all looking good now :) As for the C++11 comment: I'm totally for using C++1, but I'll open a new issue first to have a discussion about that. There are pros and cons to this, so let's see what everybody thinks about this...
Anyway, thanks again a lot for this code! :smiley:
Yep, good idea. :smile:
In theory, this should be fixed now.  Only tested it on OSX and Windows though. 😇
The fix was really simple: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/f05e3a211c393bb21686aaf41b680176e608a8ea :smile:
Excellent. Thanks for verifying it and letting us know. :smile:
Made some changes a few days ago to the CSV export pieces, adding a newline option to the dialog, and some other minor cleanups there too.  Would be useful to have someone else cast their eye over the end result. 😀
Thanks for keeping an eye on it. :smile:
Ahhh, interesting crash. :smile:  I'll take a look at verifying it, then this fix, then merge it in a few hours.  (doing other stuff atm)
Yep, bug and fix confirmed.  Thanks heaps for this @innermous. :smile:
Hmmm, which version are you using?  Isn't the font adjustable via the Preferences menu? :smile:
Cool, no worries at all.  We've added a few new things that can be changed in our latest source code (and available in nightly builds).  But there doesn't seem to be anything for the cell editor font.
So, that would probably be useful to add. :smile:
No worries.  It's probably not that hard to get this fixed too. :smile:
Might attempt it later on today.
@pier4r @mjbe Just added some code which sets the cell editor font (both text and binary modes) according to the setting in Preferences → Data Browser → Font.
Would either of you have time to check the latest nightly build (tomorrow), to verify it works from your point of view?  Download locations are on the front page of our project, if that helps. :smile:
Cool!  Good luck with the crevice. 😀
Closing this, as it's almost definitely fixed.  Been using it here for a few days (on OSX) and no issues so far.
If it does turn out to not work properly for either of you for some reason after all, feel welcome to reopen this so we can investigate. :smile:
Good point, that would be useful. :smile:
I agree, good idea :smiley: That's why I've finally implemented it :wink: If you're still around, @tonypdmtr, are you interested in testing tomorrow's nightly build to see if it's working for you? Awesome :D By the way, I totally forgot to mention: you have to search for ```=NULL``` (all capital letters) for this. Is this in the current nightly?  Doesn't seem to work for me...
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/22584235/35ab4186-e9e9-11e6-8d74-f4b450cd6f40.png)
It definitely should be in there. I've also just tried this again and for me it's working. Very weird. Are you sure you're using the latest nightly build? Sorry, I apologise. Downloaded the last nightly, but the last nightly was yesterday's... there doesn't seem to be a nightly for this morning. Didn't look that closely at the date... Unfortunately, as per my message above, the nighties are temporarily unavailable. They be broke. Hopefully normal service will be resumed shortly. Sorry for the problem with the nightlies over the last 2 days.  They get built on a box here at my house... and the internet gateway died.  Seems like a hardware problem.
Things should be ok again from tomorrow, as the gateway is being replaced presently. (typing this message through it, but needs more testing) Thanks for testing! :smiley: Closing this issue then. If you should stumble upon any problem with this, feel free to re-open it anytime.  Ahhh, good thinking.  Merged. :smile:
Hmmm, thinking about it more, that's probably not quite right.  The heading for that section shows it's for both CentOS & Fedora.
CentOS doesn't use dnf, so now the command is wrong. 😦
Thoughts?
Yep, that works.  Merged too. 😀
Thank you.
Note - this is just for discussion at this point, don't merge it yet.
This commit adds the SQLCipher version number to the About dialog.
Weirdly, retrieving the SQLCipher version number appears to need an open database connection.  So, without an open database the field is left blank.
Updating this commit to cleanly handle both situations is required before merging this.
Btw - unsure if the requirement for an open database connection is something caused by our code, or a requirement from the underlying SQLCipher library itself.  The SQLCipher version seems like it should be available at compile time, not just at runtime.
Thinking about this more, even if the SQLCipher library itself doesn't provide a compile time definition with the version number , we can probably create one ourselves.  Might take some shell magic (and would need to be cross-platform'd), but should be doable.
Yeah, if one isn't provided.  They have a runtime function that can be called, but seems to only be available when a database is loaded.  That doesn't fit well with use of such a function in a GUI.
@revolter I believe SQLCipher is a replacement for the standard SQLite library, rather than it being an addin or plugin or extension to SQLite it is a "drop in" replacement. However they don't have a suitable runtime function for the version without opening a database.
I guess @justinclift we have some options, we could open a test database at build time get the version number and add that to a header for our use. Or we could just use their runtime and say "open a database" on the about screen. Or in theory could we issue a pull request or feature request asking for this?
Yeah, in this context SQLCipher is a drop-in replacement for SQLite3, done at compile time.  So, when compiling DB4S, either SQLCipher **or** SQLite3 gets compiled in.
We could do the "make a dummy database, retrieve the info, close the database" at startup time.  But yeah, that's way too hacky.
It'll probably be more reliable to somehow automatically extract the version number of SQLCipher at compile time, generate a constant or define for that at compile time, then embed it into the About dialog.
It's unlikely to be super tricky for the *nix OS's, but I'm unsure how to approach that on Windows.  Can probably muddle through it though, unless someone else wants to investigate? :smile:
Closing this for now.  Will redo it with a proper (complete) solution at some point.
Hmmm, that's probably the largest SQLite database file I've heard of someone using with this (so far).
Looks like we need to put further effort into handling large databases. :wink:
Out of curiosity, how much ram do you have in that computer?
I see you're using the nightly build? I actually think this might be caused by a bug we introduced since the latest release but that should be fixed now. So can you maybe try tomorrow's nightly build? :smiley: Would be interested to know if that's making things a little better :smiley:
@MKleusberg That's a good point.
Noticing some interesting messages in the output windows on Win64 with SQLCipher compiled in:
```
executeSQL:  "COMMIT;" -> cannot commit - no transaction is active
```
As per screenshot:
![commit failure messages](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/15022211/7d88dbca-1222-11e6-9060-04960dfcc2b2.png)
The first three lines were output when setting the encryption key (File → Set Encryption).
The final '"COMMIT;" -> cannot commit' line is output any time the "Write Changes" button is pressed.
I haven't traced through the code to figure out what's going on, and the data appears at cursory glance to be getting written to disk, as the database can be re-opened to find the data there.  However, this is something that bears looking into, just to be safe. :wink:
Hi Justin!
I looked into this and fixed it. This was caused by an overcautious COMMIT when saving a database. We'd save all changes and then do an extra-commit just to be sure. But since there was no need for this, SQLite would output that warning. So this isn't caused by SQLCipher but would happen with the normal version, too. Good news is that this doesn't cause any harm at all, so no chance of this causing any data loss etc. I've fixed it anyway, so the warning should be gone. Instead of just deleting the COMMIT call (which should have been ok, too) we're now checking if there is still a transaction after saving everything, and only if there is we call COMMIT.
Awesome :smile:, I'll verify it from my end probably tomorrow.
Tried this out again with the two latest commits applied.  Yep, that last commit message - generated when clicking the "Write Changes" button - is no longer happening.
But :smile:, found some other instances of it (and seemingly related).
This one is generated when creating a new database (non-encrypted).  The message appears right after choosing a filename to save the database as:
![db4s-issue583-screenshot_2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/15081362/9443c278-13ba-11e6-8f83-f6ca5ed124d0.png)
The "RELEASE RESTOREPOINT;" line after that is generated when clicking "Write Changes", directly after creating an empty table (without changing to the "Browse Data" tab yet):
![db4s-issue583-screenshot_3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/15081452/03f0c97c-13bb-11e6-9e93-f7d706d9cd80.png)
The third, fourth, and fifth lines are generated when the database file is closed.  Seems like fairly standard widget output message stuff, and is hopefully easy to address. :smile:
![db4s-issue583-screenshot_4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/15081537/5424d1d6-13bb-11e6-8885-32ac71de1297.png)
@justinclift Should be fixed, too, now :wink: Can you double check? Will do.  Probably later today, but it may get pushed out to sometime this week depending on how other things go. :wink:  Ahhh, that's a really good point.  Yeah, lets do that. :smile:
@TWiStErRob I'd completely forgotten about this one.  Good news though... we fixed the behaviour you're mentioning.
In the new behaviour for the Edit Cell, the drop down is always visible.  So, it's definitely always possible to view the binary data for images.
If you want to try it out, the 3.9.0-beta 1 release (last weekend) has that code in it.  The full 3.9.0 release should be this weekend too, if that's useful. :smile:
We're supporting whatever image formats are supported by Qt. Qt does support JPEG and on my (Linux) system DB4S therefore supports JPEG, too. However, the Qt developers have moved most images formats out of their library and into plugins. So for our Windows release, we'd need to distribute these plugins, too (or at least the JPEG one, that is). I hope this makes sense :grinning: So in effect, this is a distribution issue, not a code issue. Could be that the JPEG plugin is linked into the nightly builds, too; so that might be worth giving a try as well.
Ahhh, that's interesting.
@TWiStErRob Which OS are you using? :smile:
@justinclift This might also be interesting for your instructions for compiling on Windows. It'd be nice to have an extra directory called 'imageformats' inside the app dir. In this directory you have to copy some or all of the DLLs in ...\Qt Directory\Qt Version\plugins\imageformats.
@MKleusberg Doesn't sound like it'll be a problem.  I'll just need to understand better what needs to be added, and where. :smile:
Is this something extra we need to add/tick/enable for the Qt installation step (Qt install step in development here):
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Win64-setup-—-Step-7-—-Install-Qt
Or is it more of something to do prior/post compiling of DB4S?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Win64-setup-—-Step-13-—-Compile-DB4S-using-MSVC
@TWiStErRob As a thought, if you're interested in compiling DB4S on Windows, it'd be super useful having someone go through those instructions and test them out for Win 7.  I'm writing them up using Win 8.1, so I've been **assuming** they'll work on Win 7 the same.  But it would be good to have someone actually check, to make sure. :wink:
Note, I'm still going through those docs (right now, working on Step 8), replacing/fixing screenshots, tweaking wording, etc.  So, feel free to point out or ask things as needed.
@MKleusberg Hmmm, reading over your comment again... it's more something we need to add to the packaging step isn't it?  If so, we can probably add it into the NSIS package script, so it works "out of the box" for everyone.
Sure, no worries at all. 😉
(and yeah, it turns out to be a fairly involved process) 😧
Hmmm, if the solution to fixing it is as easy as shown in the answer here, we can probably do this for 3.9.0:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6724606/include-the-jpeg-plugin-in-my-application
This will have to be a 3.10.0 thing instead of for this release.  Didn't get time to investigate it properly for 3.9.0.
Kind of. :wink:
The more recent release build process for Windows uses Microsoft Visual C++, and can produce both 32-bit and 64-bit output.  (useful for some stuff)
The older method uses a cross-compile approach (MXE on a Linux build host), producing a static build.
Our nightly builds for windows still use the older method, so if you grab any of those, they'll be the single-big-exe file.
Does that help? :smile:
Yeah, our Windows releases situation isn't optimal.  @rp- who does the packaging for Windows hasn't really been active for much (other than release packaging) for some time.
It's fairly normal for longer running Open Source projects to have people move on over time, so it's not something too unusual. :wink:
Co-incidentally to you asking, I've been putting time into figuring out the build process on Windows today, and (after a **lot** of hair pulling frustration), managed to get it building finally [not long ago](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/482#issuecomment-215229614).
So, if I can gain more of a clue :smile: with the Windows packaging side of things, we might be able to expand out our download options there.  No promises yet though, lets see how much of a clue I gain first. :wink:
It would be a nice addition a duplicate row functionality.
Similar to the column name header right click popup (`Show rowid column`, `Edit display format`, e.g.), a popup could appear when right clicking the left column numbers which would present a `Duplicate row` menu item which, after clicking it, would insert another row with the same column values, except the autoincrement one.
From a logical perspective, having a button near the add/delete record ones makes sense.  Is that how people needing the feature would use it though?  (I'm not sure)
If it's easy to do, maybe try first with that and we can get some people to test it out to see if it "works ok" in actual practise?
So... I guess use your best judgement for now, and we can adjust things afterwards if it turns out to be not perfect in use? :smile:
Yeah, the right click approach sounds useful without cluttering up the UI right away. :smile:
Heh Heh Heh, that's why we discuss stuff. :smile:
Just to confirm, the `id` column is in the pics is autogenerated yeah? (that's why it's value isn't copied?)
It sounds like it should be used for all fields in the current row, that don't have a default (or autoincrement) value.
Oops, sorry. :wink:
@revolter I've just merged @innermous's PR for this. Do you have the time to try tomorrow's nightly build and report if it's working for you? :smiley:
Thanks for pointing this out. :smile:
We have a wiki page with a fix for a windows file associations problem.
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Windows-File-Associations
It's the same one isn't it?
@MKleusberg Is this something we should take care of automatically at startup time?
Yeah, it's a known problem and we have some ideas how to solve it. :smile:
But, it won't be done before the next release (3.10.0). 😦
Yep, that's the perfect way to do it. :smile:
This looks good to me, so I'll merge it now.  The nightly build tomorrow will have the change in it, which would be nifty for you to verify and report back success/failure. :smile:
@MKleusberg You might want to cast your eye over this (one liner), just in case. :wink:
Awesome.  Such a simple change, but so much effect.  Well done!
What's your next Pull Request going to be? :grinning:
Sure, a presenter mode would be a welcome addition.  Get it mostly right, and we can look over the code and possibly make some suggestions, or even make a few test builds for people to try it with. :smile:
Hmmm, second thought.  With that master OS image... er... how about getting the font size changed there, so its "correct" at the source? :wink:
One extra suggestion here: if this fix has no side-effects you should think about proposing it to the upstream QScintilla project. Otherwise your change won't be included in versions of DB4S which are compiled against an external QScintilla library (like on Linux distros) or might be overridden when we update the QScintilla source in our repository and forget about this...
Good idea. :smile:
Nah, here is probably good enough.  I'll just change the tag to "Enhancement" and we'll get to it whenever we do. :wink:
See issue #569. It would be nice to be able to enter custom display formats in the Edit Display format dialog when the format you require isn't part of the list. Bonus points for remembering custom display formats and having an option to give them names etc.
There are two problems here though. Both requiring us to add some more error checking code:
1) If the user types in some invalid code we'd get a syntax error. Not sure how we'd react there but we definitely don't display a proper error message.
2) The user could type in some code that generates more than one column. This one is tricky because it doesn't produce a syntax error but would cause a lot of confusion throughout the application. So by some means we'd have to detect this case and prohibit it.
That's a good point, I've noticed that too.  The label for the chosen option should probably be kept, instead of switching to "custom". :smile:
Thanks @Maxim-Mazurok, that's makes good sense. :smile:
Thanks, trying it out here now. :smile:
Hmmm, I must be blind... I'm not noticing a change from an end user point of view?
Er.... clue me in? 😀
Ahhh, interesting addition.  Found a bug in it though, where it's not clearing the existing Edit Cell data when a new field on the same row is clicked.
The test database I'm using is very small (516KB).  Just emailed it to you, along with the SQL used to trigger the bug.  Hopefully it's something simple. :smile:
Sure, no worries at all.  It's late here for me too. :smile:
Cool. :smile:
I really should get around to learning C++ eh? :wink:
Hi Lars!
First of all thank you very much for the contribution :smiley: I've just had a first quick look and it seems to work very well and to really improve the user experience :+1: I'll have a closer look soon and will just put some comments into the Github diff. From what I can tell it'll be mostly code style though :smiley:
I'm not sure either how the bug mentioned by Justin could be introduced by this. But maybe he can help us out here debugging this - though I assume the bug is to be found somewhere else, most likely in my code for the edit cell panel itself, not in your code. So I probably won't be worrying about that too much for this pull request.
I've put some comments concerning the code-style in your commits. Nothing major, though :smiley: There's one more techical suggestion in there, too. Despite those I just noticed one more thing: if you have multiple SQL tabs opened, each showing a query result with a selected cell, the edit cell panel isn't updated when you switch between the tabs. This might be a bit confusing for the user to see the 'old' value there. But again, nothing major :grinning: If you're interested you could maybe add a new slot which is getting triggered when the selected SQL tab changes and which just updates the panel to the current selection.
Sorry again for the nitpicking parts :smiley: I actually think this is quite a good pull request which I hope we can merge as soon as possible :+1:
Awesome! Looks good :+1: Thank you very much for this :smiley: If you should need any help with your next pull request feel free to always open an issue or email me directly - I'd be glad to help out.
Hmmm, that's breaking the build.  Are you ok to click on "Details" to check the error, and attempt to fix it? :smile:
There is one bit I'm unsure of though.  For decimal display, it's using "0x" as the prefix.  eg "0x10".
Isn't "0x" normally used to indicate a hexadecimal number?
Awesome!  Testing now. :smile:
Yes, this is looking fine :smile: Thanks for your contribution!
It's also nice to see somebody working on the display format feature - I wasn't really sure whether somebody is actually using it :wink:
@MKleusberg - just as a heads up while on the topic... the format definition box itself doesn't seem to be editable for the "custom" type.  eg people can't type in their own format and have it stick.  Is that supposed to work? :smile:
I'm not sure to be honest ^^ But the code looks like this was never supposed to work. Allowing to type in one's own display formats isn't as easy as it sounds either, because we'd had to add some extra error checking. With the current code I see two problems:
1) If the user types in some invalid code we'd get a syntax error. Not sure how we'd react there but we definitely don't display a proper error message.
2) The user could type in some code that generates more than one column. This one is tricky because it doesn't produce a syntax error but would cause a lot of confusion throughout the application. So by some means we'd have to detect this case and prohibit it.
So, yes, we can get this done. But it's a bit trickier than expected. I'll just open a new issue for now so we can keep this in mind :smile:
Cool. :smile:
Hmmm, yeah, that sounds like a design bug. 😦
As you mention, does the removing the BEGIN TRANSACTION statement at the start (and the COMMIT at the end) allow the import to succeed?
Are there pre-existing indexes on some of the fields or something?  If so - as a hint for future imports - it's a good idea to remove the indexes before larger imports, then recreating them afterwards.  That way it doesn't try to update the index for every single imported row (super slow), and just does a single big one at the end.
@chrisjlocke Interested in testing out a fix for this?
@revolter Has created a proposed PR ready for testing.  I can create a Windows package with the fix if you're ok to test?
@chrisjlocke Ping :D
Sorry - email has been playing up and I didn't see this notification...
Sure - happy to test all fixes!  Should it fix the 'not in a transaction' bug, or the speed bug?  Or should I just report my findings?  Aah, just saw #653, so will be the first one then...
I presume this is in the nightly Windows download?
No problem.
It's about the nested transaction indeed.
And, no, the PR that fixes it isn't merged yet. Maybe @justinclift can help us out with an once-off Windows build.
@chrisjlocke Try this one:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/sqlitebrowser-win64-issue556v1-201607152315.exe
Made that for the same issue (reported also in #556). :smile:
@chrisjlocke If/when you have a minute to test, the latest nightly build should include the fix for this.  Any chance you could give it a shot to double check? :smile:
Yes, the import now works.  The only 'niggle' is that the cursor remains the 'waiting' circle of doom when the 'Import completed' message box appears.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17104865/b842e27a-527c-11e6-95e3-c2168f190af9.png)
This also occurs if you import where the table already exists - DB4S correctly moans, but the cursor is 'waiting'.  Someone might think, "blimey - this is taking a while" when in fact its just the cursor hasn't changed.
I'm just going to test the '500,000 lines seems slow' thing.  That might have just been my end.
Cool, sounds like we're making progress at least. :smile:
One interesting thing though.  The export of a database is still a 'transaction'.  The export begins 'begin transaction' and end 'commit'.  However, if you cancel the import, it doesn't cancel the transaction - it has completed up until you cancelled it.  This would explain the slowness of the import - each import statement is its own transaction.  On the sqlite website, it mentions this is 'bad' as there is a limit of a few dozen transactions per second.
https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q19
I assume the import now ignores the transaction in the exported SQL, but does it add its own?
I appreciate I can revert changes in DB4S, but a transaction at the import level would greatly speed up the import.  I assume that was the 'original plan', but it was being done twice - at the export into the SQL, and again at the import.
Yep, that's interesting.
My reading of this fix is that it just removes all occurrences of `BEGIN TRANSACTION` and `COMMIT` on the fly from the SQL file being read in.
In theory, DB4S is supposed to be adding it's own `BEGIN TRANSACTION` and `COMMIT` at the start and end of each SQL file import.  It's weird to me that it's not functioning this way.
As a disclaimer though... I haven't personally dug into the data handing side of the code yet.  It sounds like there's some weirdness there which needs fixing.
That'll probably be done for 3.10.0, rather than 3.9.0.  @innermous has already pointed out that there's some mess in our data handling already (thus our constraints problems), which we need to get sorted out after this upcoming 3.9.0 release. 😇
As a curiosity thing, if after you cancel out of the transaction (and the data is still there), what happens if you issue a ROLLBACK from the Execute SQL window?
Well, indeed this is not the best solution, but was the easiest. Throwing an error for an SQL created by the same app is not ok. But for 3.10.0, we could, instead of removing the transaction, detect if the query starts with a transaction and stop starting our own transaction. As this works as the fix intended, could we close it and open another issue regarding the multiple transactions on a big import? So we don't mix things up. And assign it to 3.10.0 too.
Yeah, that's a good idea. :smile:
Would either of you be ok to create the new issue for tracking?  I've been staring at the computer for too long, and need to take a break for a bit. 😵
> what happens if you issue a ROLLBACK from the Execute SQL window?
Is that the same as clicking 'Discard Changes' ?
Rollback deleted the half-imported table, so that **would** imply it was in a transaction?
k, that Rollback behaviour does indicate it was in a transaction.
... with 'Discard Changes'... I'm personally not sure atm.
So there aren't multiple transactions? I looked a bit over the code and the only thing I saw related to this was a `setSavepoint` call, which actually executes the query `SAVEPOINT <name>`.
I read [about it](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_savepoint.html) now, and it looks like it works inside a transaction. But we are setting the savepoint (which is similar to starting a transaction) before executing the SQL, which in turn starts a transaction.
Instead, we should detect if the SQL contains a transaction. If it does, remove it from the SQL and manually execute it before the `setSavepoint` call, then set the savepoint, then execute the rest of the SQL, and it should work. But, knowing that there is this one savepoint already created, and it acts like a transaction, would it make sense to do what I described? If not, should we mark as invalid and close #675 and leave this as it is?
It looks like it won't improve the performance at all.
So, yes, there is only one transaction. And the import being slow question remains valid, right?
It took me a while to write this so the ideas might got mangled. Let me know if you understand what I tried to say and what do you think about it.
Hmmm, wonder if the slowdown is related to the Savepoint?
@chrisjlocke Is the database you're importing into on an SSD? eg a high I/O transaction device
I re-read the `SAVEPOINT` documentation and I personally understood that they actually are exactly transaction, but they have a name and you can nest them. So I don't think it should influence the speed. But we can easily test this with a large data set by temporarily removing the `setSavepoint` call.
Yep, same thought here.  Measured stats would definitely help.
Would you be ok to investigate **_after**_ you're back from vacation?
As an idea - for measuring this it would be useful to record a log of the start and end time for each line of the imported file. Shouldn't be hard, adding some timestamp calls.  Millisecond accuracy perhaps?
This would let us determine with reasonable accuracy if there's a slowdown over time during the import, and/or see if it's a steady rate (etc).
[Imagine that info in a graph here] ← :smile:
That should give us very useful information for analysing what's going on, and where to look next.
Sure thing.
I'm happy to test anything related to this, and in the above issue (# 827) I've posted a link to an SQL file causing 'delays'.
This is causing an error with the Travis CI build.
Are you ok to fix the problem? :smile:
Are you having trouble seeing the error message?
If so, it's here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://travis-ci.org/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/jobs/123551552
Scroll about 1/2 way down, and it has this info:
```
...
[ 56%] Generating qrc_icons.cxx
[ 57%] Generating qrc_flags.cxx
Updating '/home/travis/build/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/src/translations/sqlb_ru.qm'...
Generated 533 translation(s) (533 finished and 0 unfinished)
```
Does that help?
Awesome.  You'll need to push the updated version GitHub, so the Travis tests can run again. :smile:
Just played around with this a little (I have no experience with the translations tools either...).
But it seems to work if you delete the 'numerus="yes"' bit a few lines further up. There are multiple occurences of it though. Probably makes sense to look up how these numerus translations work though ^^
@FriedrichFroebel Oops, only just noticed this is passing now!  Do you feel it's in a good state for merging now? :smile:
For me this looks good. Thanks for all the work you've put into this, @FriedrichFroebel! :+1:
Just two minor comments:
1) Right at the start of the file there is still the old project name (Sqlitebrowser) instead of the new one (DB Browser for SQLite). That's not @FriedrichFroebel's fault because it's still there from my very old (and even more basic) translation attempts. But we might want to update it on the way.
2) Making this into one commit would look a lot nicer in the commit history.
But other than that I'm quite happy to finally have a proper translation into German :smiley:
@MKleusberg Good news.  We don't need people to squash everything into a single commit any more.  GitHub [added an option](https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits) for that to happen automatically when doing a merge.  It's the default (in this repo at least), so it "just happens" when doing merges with the GUI.  It can be turned off, but I've not found a need to so far. :smile:
@FriedrichFroebel Ahhh, you're still adding to it.  Let us know when you feel it's ready, and someone will click the Merge button. :smile:
Awesome! Thank you very much :smiley:
@FriedrichFroebel Thanks @FriedrichFroebel. :smile:
Thanks Tim, that's perfect. :smile:
Awesome, thanks for the high quality bug report. :smile:
Oops.  Thanks Chris, fixed it. 😀
Hmm, this is very strange. I've tried reproducing this using the file you've attached but wasn't able to. I have even checked out the code used for building version 3.8 and I'm using Qt 5.5.1, too. So I'm groping about in the dark here.
But your backtrace might be pointing to what could be the problem. Though obviously I need your help here, @zetok. Can you checkout the latest code from master, built it and try again opening that table? With any luck it should work now :smiley:
Cool :smiley: Thanks a lot for the quick reply and the detailed bug report :+1: Some day I'll probably install Gentoo, at least on my notebook :grinning:
Thanks, good thinking. :smile:
Nope, I just hit the wrong button is all.  *sigh*
Sorry for the confusion. 😦
I just tweaked it anyway, adding some padding space to the top and bottom to match the other similar lines in the README.md. :wink:
As a thought, any interest in tweaking the index.html for the website?  (it's in this repo too, in the `gh-pages` branch)
Cool. :smile:
Oh, that's not good.  Which version of DB4S are you using, and which version of Windows? :smile:
Thanks.  Hopefully one of the guys will have time to look at this in the nearish future.  It's very unlikely to be this week though. 😦
Hmmm, have you looked at our website? :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://sqlitebrowser.org
No worries at all. :wink:
Does this help?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Windows-File-Associations
:smile:
No worries, it was a thought. :smile:
From here, we'll need some more info so we can try to figure things out.
- Which version of Windows are you using?
- Which version of DB4S are you using?
- Also, do you remember what the previous version number of DB4S was?
- Are you comfortable using regedit?
First commit. May need tweaking.
Hmmm. Travis, the Github batch build compiler seems to [have a problem with libsqlcipher libraries](https://travis-ci.org/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/jobs/122137854). Any idea?
```
$ sudo apt-get install -qq libqt4-dev libsqlite3-dev libsqlcipher-dev libantlr-dev
libsqlcipher0 libsqlcipher-dev
E: There are problems and -y was used without --force-yes
The command "sudo apt-get install -qq libqt4-dev libsqlite3-dev libsqlcipher-dev libantlr-dev" failed and exited with 100 during .
Your build has been stopped.
```
Wow, that's awesome. :smile:
Just merged them (squashed into a single commit for neatness)!
The last version that works with non SSE2 enabled CPU AthlonXP on Windows XP SP3 is v3.5.1, which I suspect is due to newer versions compiled with the now default flags using SSE2 instructions.
Could you apply the GO386=387 flag and so that no SSE2 instructions are used and enable sqlitebrowser run on old CPUs?
Interesting question.  Technically it should be possible.  But it sounds like it might negatively impact lots of people by (maybe) being much slower for some operations (unsure).
Lets ask Rene, who creates the Windows builds.
Also note, if/when we get Windows compiling instructions fully worked out - so anyone can compile it themselves - that could also add more possibilities for people on unusual hardware. Hopefully I'll get time to look into that next week. :smile:
@rp- Thoughts?
Oh, as another thought, do the nightly builds work for you at all?  They're compiled using a different approach, though I'm unsure if the compiler flags for cpu instruction set features are any different. Worth trying if you haven't yet. :smile:
As you suggested have tried the windows nightly sqlitebrowser Version 3.8.99 and it works fine in a non SSE2 enabled AthlonXP.
Cool.  That's a good workaround for now then. :smile:
Since there is no warning at all that could give a clue to people with old CPUs potentially affected (AthlonXP, P3) that this issue is SSE2 related when running the program because it won't start or just crash inmediately, then in the mean time may worth adding a note to the README.md directing them to the nightly builds or to older releases. :wink:
Good thinking. 😀
Done: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/fd0eae9c14f7f7e1213b4c4153e0c01910206e5c
This should be fixed in the next nightly build. Do you have the time to try that build and confirm if it's working better for you, @OmarWKH ? :smiley:
There's still a bit of work to do, like adding/editing/removing multi-column foreign keys and key names but at least foreign key with multiple columns aren't ignored anymore.
Thanks @OmarWKH, looks like more stuff still needs to be done for this. :smile:
As a side note, those `<detail>` and `<summary>` tags collapse nicely in your post.  Hadn't seen that before.  Definitely going to copy for future use. 😁
Hmm, I'm having difficulties reproducing this. I've created a new database using the SQL posted under `To test two FK constraints with multiple columns I executed` but get
``` sql
CREATE TABLE `test_reference` (
`id1`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id2`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id3`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id4`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(`id1`,`id2`,`id3`),
FOREIGN KEY(`id1`,`id2`) REFERENCES `table1`(`id1`,`id2`),
);
```
@justinclift Can you maybe build a once-off using Qt5? Just to check it's not a Qt version thing? The fact that I needed to add 91615f940f109d0f20f9a8fe19599f4268ea3d40 makes me a bit suspicious here.
Yep, can definitely create a once-off Qt5 build with this in it.  No hassle at all.
@MKleusberg Should I build this with just https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/6a4d58042c8f808498aafc5fae215aae6a010d07, or include the new foreign key stuff you've been adding today too?
Maybe include d98338ce89089755aef305f8c04ce22ac2509ee9, too. It does change a lot but it's good to get this tested :wink:
@OmarWKH Sorry for the delay here.  Got caught up in other stuff. 😦
@MKleusberg Getting back around to this again.  Should a Qt5 build using master HEAD be ok?
@justinclift Yes, should be ok.
- http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-201608291559-win64.exe
It's our latest development code, with @MKleusberg's fixes in it.  In theory, it should be better for you now, but it's always good to check. :wink:
Awesome @OmarWKH, that's really good news. :smile:
I'll close this Issue now, as that build will remain online for people to use, and our next release will have this included also. :smile:
Yeah, it's a "one database per running instance" kind of application for now.  If your OS allows you to run multiple instances though, each should let you open a different database (that's the theory anyway). :smile:
It seems like you're also interested in multiple window support too.  It's a sensible suggestion, I just don't know when we'll get around to doing it.  We have **so much** other stuff needing to get done before even thinking that one through. 🙁
Yeah, makes sense. :smile:
If it's any help, there's a sleazy workaround :smile: for that problem on OSX.  For some applications (including ours), you can launch multiple instances of it if you do it manually from the command line.
For example, with DB4S installed in the standard `/Applications` folder:
```
$ /Applications/DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite.app/Contents/MacOS/DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite &
$ /Applications/DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite.app/Contents/MacOS/DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite &
$ /Applications/DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite.app/Contents/MacOS/DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite &
$ /Applications/DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite.app/Contents/MacOS/DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite &
```
Now I have four separate instances of DB4S running, each not-interfering with the other.
Btw, I'm not sure it's a good idea to try and open the same database with several instances.  I have a suspicion that could end badly.  Probably best to only open different databases, when doing this, to be on the safe side. :smile:
> I'm not sure it's a good idea to try and open the same database with several instances
sqlite is multi-user (the database is locked until you click **Write Changes**) so yes, it'll be fine. 😄
Yeah, I just get nervous when I read section 2 of this:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html
In theory we should be fine.  But I don't know how well tested that is in practise (with DB4S). :wink:
Can you have a look at tomorrow's nightly build (or any later nightly build) and check if the new version is working for you? For downloading a nightly build see the main page of our repository. Please let us know if the new version does the job :smiley:
Hmmm, it kind of sounds like our code for importing SQL needs to recognise + skip any transaction control statements in the file.  Without knowing any better, that doesn't sound too hard. :wink:
A proposed fix for this has been created by @revolter. It would be useful to have some people test it with real data before we add it.
If you're using Windows or OSX, I can build a package with the fix included for people to test.
Interested?
Sure, are you on Windows or Mac? :smile:
@elpoolet If you're on Windows, this should work for you:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-issue556v1-win64.exe
It takes a special setup to do it, and we've not needed to get it happening for anything other than the nightly builds. (so far)
Cool, that would really help. :smile:
Thanks @elpoolet, that makes complete sense.  There are two places which can import SQL files and have the bug.
1. File → Import → Database from SQL File  (still needs fixing)
2. In the "Execute SQL" tab, there's an icon to "Open SQL file".  That one should be fixed.
![screen shot 2016-07-22 at 16 33 08](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/17062356/89c58f6e-502a-11e6-9482-27d0a5cd7c80.png)
Number 2 might be worth giving a shot.
It probably won't suit large amounts of data though 😦 , because it loads the file into the "Execute SQL" window first.
@justinclift, Should we reopen this issue? Or can you solve it based on my partial solution?
@revolter Well, we've kind of already fixed the export part of this issue, but the import part is tracked here for #656.  #656 needs to handle File → Import → "Database from SQL File" to be a complete solution. :smile:
Sorry, pretty tired here, and having two problems on the same issue didn't help me. So, it should be a pretty easy solution if you know where the import is done. But unfortunately I can't do it at all. Do you thing you can manage it? :smile:
Yeah, I should be able to cut-n-paste your RegEx into the right spot.  Likely tomorrow though... I want to get away from the computer for a bit now.
You're on holiday from tomorrow yeah?  If so... have a good one, and hopefully things here haven't exploded in a bad way by the time you're back. 😀
Thanks!
Actually, I'm on holiday already, since today was my last work day. And I'm sure nothing will explode :laughing:
@elpoolet If/when you have a minute to test, the latest nightly build should include the full fix for this.
Any chance you could give it a shot to double check? :smile:
Hmmm, in theory, as far as I remember SQLite itself should handle multi-process access ok.  The limitation I remember was that there must be only a single writer at a time.
It sounds like we need to put some effort into testing this scenario, finding out what's going wrong, and fixing the problem so it works properly.  That's probably not going to happen in the next few weeks though (people are busy with other stuff).
As a workaround, how to you feel about using (say) PostgreSQL + ODBC drivers for VB?  That will absolutely work in this scenario.  But, takes more effort to setup. 😦
@chrisjlocke _In theory_ SQLite should be able to handle this. You can maybe have a look at the pragma page of your database in DB Browser and try to disable the journaling altogether. This should prevent SQLite from writing into a file DB Browser doesn't know about. But then again, this will reduce the overall performance of your VB application... So I'm afraid there's no optimal solution for this :frowning:
@chrisjlocke I observe something similar this with Python sqlite3 connector. What follows from the SQLite documentation https://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html is that no other process can see changes from your program before it calls something like `commit()`. Here is an example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE `tt` ( `a` TEXT, `b` TEXT );
```
```python
In [1]: import sqlite3
In [2]: statement = 'INSERT INTO tt VALUES (?,?)'

Btw if I change journal mode and then close and lauch the application, it is set to `delete` again.   @whieronymus Thanks for helping out. 😀

The Windows files there were built using an updated process, that (in theory) should be ok for everyone now. :smile:
Closing this due to lack of response.
Note - In theory, this should be fixed in [our new 3.9.0 release](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.0) anyway. :smile:
Makes sense.  Don't suppose you're any good with C++ and want to try whipping up a fix? 😀
Yeah, I think the reason it's not, is that DB4S predates using Qt's built in SQL stuff.  Personally, I'm only just learning C++ and Qt now, so am not really sure (yet).  Guess I will find out as I gain more experience with them. :wink:
Yeah, there's definitely some weird edge case that causes crashes (with the standard release) for a few people.  Personally, I have no idea where to even start for debugging it.
Keep using the Nightly's I guess. 😧
@whieronymus If you have a few minutes, would you be ok to try the "3.9.0 beta1" release we did last weekend?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.0-beta1
The Windows files there were built using an updated process, that (in theory) should be ok for everyone.
Theory however... well... I'd rather someone test it and confirm. 😁
Note, we [released 3.9.0 yesterday](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.0), so that would be the one to test with instead. :smile:
Last reminder ping... :wink:
Closing this due to lack of response. 😦
Hmmm, it's supposed to show up there.  Would you be ok to add a screenshot here, displaying what you're seeing? :smile:
Oops, not seeing any screenshots here.  How did you upload them? :wink:
With the version info not displaying in Finder GetInfo, that sounds like a problem with the way I built/created the .app bundle on OSX.  Sounds like it might be time to investigate how macdeployqt does stuff, in case that's the cause.
Ahhh interesting.  Checking there here on my desktop shows the same thing.  Now I grok what you're meaning.
I'll have to look into that for the next release.  Thanks for pointing this out. :smile:
@justinclift Where is the OS X building defined?
Do you mean the DB4S release version number?
For OSX, we've been manually (at release time) making the change to [src/app.plist](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/app.plist#L67-L71).  It used to also be in CMakeLists.txt, and src/gen_version.h (according to our slightly outdated [Release-process](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Release-process) doc), but looks like those last two don't have it any more.  That doc should be updated to the current approach... when we're sure what that is these days. :wink:
@justinclift, Great, thanks! Added a PR for this.
@Vidbuf In theory :smile:, this should be fixed now.  Do you have time to test the nightly build - tomorrow - (download locations are listed on our front page) to verify it from your point of view and let us know?
Just double checked this here, and it's definitely fixed. :smile:
How are you trying to set or save the image data?
If you only need to do a few images, you should be able to drag & drop them from your computer's file manager (Finder on OSX) application directly into a database cell.  Not sure if that helps you in your situation though. :wink:
Which version are you using? As Justin said, it _should_ be possible to just drag & drop an image onto the cell you want it to be saved in. That's faster than using the import button, too.
We probably don't have anything that can do a bulk import yet.  There may be other SQLite tools around that can you.
As a thought to help you in figuring our what you need, are you wanting something scripted (eg you can run in a shell or batch script), or maybe something with an option to (for example) point at a directory and load all of the files into a table?
Thanks @wierzba3, looks good from an eyeballing perspective.  Going to merge this, and will let others try the nightlies + report any problems.
(really though, the code looks pretty straightforward so not expecting any) :wink:
Hmmm, good point.  Should be a simple fix. :smile:
This should be fixed by now :smiley: Can you double check using the latest version?
And yes, the highlighting something and pressing F5 is an intentional, but undocumented feature. Maybe it makes sense having a Wiki page for each of the main tabs (and maybe the dialogs) mentioning the shortcuts and hidden features. > mentioning the shortcuts and hidden features.
But then they would no longer be hidden.... 😉  I'll look at adding some Wiki pages.
This does indeed work in the latest nightly.  Closing this issue.
Other people here may be able to help you though. :smile:
I have a Windows 10 VM and have no issues. You issue seems similar to https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/495 which is also a puzzle. Have you tried latest the nightly build?
Glad it worked but that is far from ideal from a project point of view. Thanks for updating us though.
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.0-beta1
The Windows files there were built using an updated process, that (in theory) should be ok for everyone now. :smile:
There shouldn't be a limit on the number of records imported.  It more sounds like there's a bug somewhere, silently ignoring some rows.
Which, if that does turn out to be the case... is pretty not-great. :frowning:
Is there some way you can tell if the rows-not-imported have something in common?  eg maybe some weird character sequence or something is throwing things off
Also as useful info, which version is are you trying with, and what OS? :smile:
Ahhhh.  It's good you've tracked this down. :smile:
But... (and sorry to say this), the bug isn't with this program.  It's actually supposed to wrap multi-line CSV entries according to their quoting, specifically so people can put multiple lines of data into a single field.
What you're describing really sounds more like a bug in the program which generates the CSV, as that's not escaping things correctly.  Some programs have the ability to change their behaviour in this regard (eg different export options), so you may be able to kick it into shape.
Now, if it's DB4S actually making the invalid CSV, then yeah, it is our bug. 😁
Closing this, as it really sounds like a data problem and not a bug in DB4S.  Ahhhh, I can imagine that some people would like 1-row-per-paste-line, and others would like 1-row-containing everything.  We should probably make it configurable. :smile:
Hmmm, this probably needs more thinking about.  We'll need to wait for whoever might implement this, to think it through. :smile:
OSX users have a menu bar.  It's in the normal spot that all OSX menu bars are.
For a special paste thing, I'm kind of thinking maybe a dialog would do for one time paste.  Taking up screen real estate for everyone's UI, when only a few people will use the feature... probably not the right approach.  At least to start with. :smile:
Ctrl-Shift-v as the keyboard shortcut sounds like a good idea too.  We'll need to ping @MKleusberg when he's back from holiday, to see what he thinks. :smile:
As a thought, which version is this happening in, and which OS? :smile:
Yeah, it looks like we have some constraint handling problems that need addressing.  You're not the only person to point this out recently. :innocent:
The person who'll likely fix this is @MKleusberg, and he's doing holiday stuff for the next month.  But (in theory) he should be back and able to look at this after that.  Sorry it won't be looked at in the short term. :frowning:
Took a bit longer but this should be fixed in the next nightly build :smiley: Editing of such UNIQUE constraints isn't supported yet (that would be issue #538) but at least such constraints are understood now by DB4S and aren't lost during editing.
@tchaloupka Thanks for testing this, and letting us know.  It definitely helps. :smile:
@MKleusberg Should we add the fix for this to the v3.9 branch, or leave it for 3.10?
@justinclift Hard to say. If we have a second beta version then definitely yes. If not, my intuition would still be to include it but I wouldn't guarantee it to be bug-free (but then again, it wasn't bug free to begin with either) :smiley:
Thanks @MKleusberg. Moving this to 3.10 then. :wink:
We could put out a the first of the 3.10 releases without huge delay, if things look decent.  There's no major reason we need to have 6+ months between each release. 😁
The 2.x version is about 10 years old, and uses a previous code base.  It's not something we can really comment on... :frowning:
Are you able to get a more recent version running?  Compiling yourself is generally not hard, if there aren't any packages available for you:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#ubuntu-linux
You're welcome. :smile:
Ahhh, that's not a bad thought.  From memory, it's not possible to disable it via an option at the moment, but it's probably something we should add. :smile:
Hi Colin!
Can you test the tomorrow's nightly buld (for download locations see the main page of our repository)? In this new version there is an option in the Preferences dialog for disabling the auto completion: View -> Preferences; SQL -> remove the tick next to 'Code completion'. Please let me know if this improves your user experience :smiley:
Awesome. :smile:
@cjdavies Ping? :smile:
Closing this as we have had a fix for this for some time now. If there are any issues remaining please just reopen the issue.
Sounds useful. :smile:
I've just made a commit that adds two new shortcuts for this. For now I have decided to set them to ```Ctrl + PageUp``` and ```Ctrl + PageDown``` because in my opinion Ctrl+Arrow keys feels like it's about selecting table cells (even though it doesn't at the moment), not like changing the table altogether. But that's just my opinion. If a majority feels like it should be the arrow keys I can always change the shortcuts :smiley:
Anyway, are you still interested in this, @tonypdmtr, and want to check out tomorrow's nightly build to see if it's working for you? Thanks for testing! :smiley:  It depends on the protocol used to access the remote database.  Generally it's not a good idea though, as (from memory) even many file based protocols don't get file locking correct... and if something goes wrong with the connection without the files being committed/flushed correctly, the database could be corrupted.
So, you might be able to get it working in the short term, but it's probably not a fantastic idea using DB4S as it currently is.
If we added some kind of code to fully download the database locally first, then copy it back to the remote server after any changes... that could work.
Also, if you're doing mostly-read only stuff, that might be something that's easier to get away with too. :smile:
Please be aware that SQL (don't matter which database implementation) does not define a default order.
Order is only guaranteed if an ORDER BY is specified by a query.
You can sort your data by clicking a column header
Sorry but here we develop and help each other with a utility for working with SQLite databases. We can't really help with C# issues, although I would suggest you go a little further and create a table and try accessing it to confirm your password issue. However I would recommend asking this on StackOverflow, or have a look in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/system.data.sqlite and see if you can find an answer.
I hope you sort it out!
In theory, we'd like to.  Most of our dev's seem to be taking a break recently now though, so we're kind of short on people with knowledge & free time. :frowning:
Hmmm, I just tried this both way on OSX 10.9.5, and for me it seems to be working correctly.
Just in case I'm not understanding... I just dragged and dropped a .sqlite file on a running instance of the application.  The .sqlite file was automatically opened into the .app.
So, then I closed the app, and dragged-n-dropped the .sqlite file onto the icon in /Applications.  The .app was automatically launched, with the .sqlite file automatically loaded.
Is that what isn't working for you? :frowning:
k, that's strange.  At some point I'll try to get a VM instance of 10.11.3 happening, then see if it's working for me in that.  If it doesn't, then it points to an incompatibility with the newer OSX.
Won't be today though. :wink:
@tempelmann Thanks for jumping in.  The help wanted tag is exactly for that. :grinning:
And yeah, I meant that I dragged and dropped a database file onto an open (eg running) app window. :smile:
That was with 3.8.0 (the release version), just to make sure I was testing the same thing as was reported.  I don't remember if there's anything in the development code that has changed since release though.  My headspace is in other stuff atm. :innocent:
Closed issue? :wink:
Yeah.  Guess you're right.
Thanks heaps for the assist too.  Please continue with it. :grinning:
That sounds like a bug, as we should be supporting anything which Qt and unicode allows.  That's the theory anyway. :wink:
Not sure.   We probably didn't really think about XP having a 64-bit version available.  Shouldn't be hard to fix from now on though... guessing it's just a matter of changing a setting in Visual Studio for the win builds. :smile:
As a thought, are you able to do some screenshots to show the problem?  That might help overcome the language barrier. :smile:
@woody1955 did you close this because you are happy or by mistake?
I _think_ this should be fixed in the latest nightly build. Do you have the time to confirm this, @woody1955 ? Just download tomorrow's nightly build (or any later one) from the main page of our repository and try the new version :smiley:
I'm going to close this for now, as I'm **really** sure it's the same as #633.
@woody1955 The fix for this is in our "3.9.0 beta1" release, if you want to try it out:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.0-beta1
If for some reason it doesn't work for you, you are definitely welcome to reopen this issue so we can investigate. :smile:
This isn't applicable anymore, as the 'dialog' window doesn't exist, does it?  Pressing Enter on a cell now displays the dockable / floating 'edit cell' panel.  If I click 'View' and 'Edit Database Cell' the docked window disappears, but double clicking a field cell just pings it back again.
I noticed (by accident) pressing Ctrl+Enter clicks the 'Apply' button, which is handy, but it would be handier if focus returned back to the grid.  Minor grip-ette though... :wink:
Ahhh, yeah.  Good thinking @chrisjlocke.  It should be fairly trivial to make the Apply button change focus back to the main window.
Do you have time/interest to open a new issue for that, so it's not forgotten?  If you don't, I can do it. :smile:
I'll keep an eye on the issue counter.... I think there are 178 other more deserving issues to resolve first! :wink:  When we get to below 100 and people are bored, scratching around for something to do, I'll add this one! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
I'll start learning C++ and proper coding skillz (not this lame VB stuff :wink: ) to get the issue count down!
You know... that would actually be really welcome. :smile:
If you're serious, this might help:
- [An Introduction to Design Patterns in C++ with Qt 4](http://www.informit.com/store/introduction-to-design-patterns-in-c-plus-plus-with-9780131879058)
Unlike what the potentially scary title sounds like... it's targeted at people with no experience or understanding of C++ or Qt, so introduces both on the way through.
Also, if you click on the "Download" tab there (middle of the page), you can download the whole thing as PDF.  No cost involved. 😁
Thanks for that.  Will defo download that and have a play. :smile:
Have you managed to follow the same process on Windows 7?
I have a Windows 8.1 VM that I have been trying to build DB4S on for a while now, with no success as yet. However I notice you have VS2015 and I don't think Qt is compatible with VS2015 yet, so you might need to try VS2013 instead.
As another thought, that might be a race condition in the build showing up.  If you run nmake again after it fails like that, does the compile then finish?
So much for hoping for an easy solution. :grin:
It has just dawned on me, Qt 5.6 has not been released yet and I believe it will work with VS2015, however if you are at the bleeding edge then you have less chance of success than using supported releases. Just saying, you're welcome to keep trying though
@mitchcurtis good plan! If you are happy, can you close this issue, or let me know and I'll do it, thanks
True but the nightly build process works as does the release build. Our Windows build process is not well defined but if it was I doubt it would cover Qt 5.6
I would expect so as I believe 5.6 will be the LTS release, however as 5.6 is only at Release Candidate right not, then it will be a while. Once we have a documented Windows build process then changing Qt version will be easier, right now you would need to do this on Linux and then copy the Windows output to Windows 10.
Yeah, it's kind of a hard call.  While it would be nice to support Qt 5.6 right now... we just don't have any developer around that are interested in this just yet.  When we go to make a new release after Qt 5.6 is out, it's reasonably likely we'll hit the same issues you're reporting, and get them fixed then.
So, not the speediest of approaches. :wink:
That being said, if you have the time/interest to work out what's wrong, and submit a Pull Request with the fixes, we'd gratefully accept it. :grin:
Hmmm, the only time I've heard of this happening before, was due to the database being damaged.  In the previous instance, the earlier version of DB4S used an older SQLite which doesn't have as good database checking as newer versions.
I wonder if it is the same problem here.
Are you able to open the database with the command line version of SQLite? :smile:
Interesting.  Are you able to try with SQLite 3.9.2 somehow?
Thanks. :smile:
Yeah, that sounds like a bug. :frowning:
Ahhh cool, thanks for taking the time to update this. :smile:
Yeah, this new behaviour isn't great.  Hoping Martin gets time to fix it in the near future. :smile:
I thought this was already fixed some time ago? @troyhen and @pmcoz, can you maybe test the latest nightly build (see main page of the repository for download links) and check if the error is fixed in there?
@troyhen Thanks.  And yeah, hopefully it's not too far off.  We may put it off for a few days though, to get some more changes in. :smile:
@justinclift, Shouldn't this be closed now?
Yep, well spotted. :smile:
Yeah, it should be pretty trivial to do.  "SQLite Browser.app" sounds like a decent start.
I'll update the nightly build script, and see if any problems show up from that.  If they don't then it's probably that simple. :smile:
Well, that didn't work.  The "macdeployqt" command fails.  Seems like it can't handle the space in the filename, which is weird. :frowning:
Renaming it after compiling definitely isn't a go-er.  What does seem to work though, is changing the TARGET line in src/src.pro prior to compiling:
```
TARGET = 'SQLite Browser'
```
When compiled, the output is now a 'src\SQLite Browser.app', which macdeployqt works with.
The nightly build script has been updated with this.  Should be good for the next release too (in theory). :smile:
@justinclift will you be committing that change then or do you have a fork on your build server? Just asking in case you forgot
It's not something to commit, it's a sed line in the nightly build script. :smile:
If we were to change it, then every build we do (for all OS's, etc) would use the new name.  That's not what we want is it?
I don't know, maybe it is, the name on the Windows Start Menu doesn't look great to be honest. I just assumed that as https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/src.pro contains the TARGET line you would change it. No problem though.
k, we should probably consider it then.  We'll probably need to make it conditional, so the command line version on BSD/Linux will still be one word.
It could be as simple as putting the TARGET keyword definition inside the "mac" and "win32" sections of src.pro.  I don't have the time/inclination to try it right now, but should get time to over the next few days.  Ping me if you don't hear from me. :smile:
Finally got around to looking into this.  Putting an updated TARGET keyword into the mac definition works.  Did the same for the win32 definition too, so anyone compiling on Windows using qmake will get the updated name as well.
As a thought, do you have Homebrew installed?  If so, it'd be worth seeing if things go better when you compile it yourself (super easy):
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
Glad that worked.  There does seem to be something not happy with the OSX binaries, but only for some people.
Unfortunately, I have no idea how to figure out what the problem there is. :frowning:
At least we know a workaround. :grinning:
By the way, which version of OSX is this happening on for you?
Yeah, that would be good.  We've had some previous discussion about it here: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/162
@sman591 Is it something you'd be interested in getting to work, even if for (say) just OSX for now?
No worries at all, thanks for taking the time to make the suggestion. :smile:
That makes sense.  We can probably fix that without too much effort. :smile:
@glawrence Reckon you could give this a shot?
Possibly but still struggling with getting myself a good development setup and finding time
No worries.  Properly documented Windows build instructions are more important. :smile:
The official release(s) for Windows don't yet have SQLCipher support added.
However, @huy-cong was able to compile things himself and include it.  More information [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/12#issuecomment-175526863), if that's an option for you. :smile:
Yeah, that's an early test build.  Everything should pretty much "just work" in it ok, as it uses the SQLCipher support that's been in our code base for a few versions now (on OSX, Linux, etc).
Am working through the process to make Windows support easier, and kind of hoping we can get SQLCipher support built into our next Windows releases from here on.  (that may or may not happen right away though, will need to do some more investigation/testing/etc)
@justinclift Should we close this?
Hmmmm, I'm on the fence about it.  Maybe lets wait for 3.9.0 to be released and people are using it?
Added 3.10.0 milestone, so we remember to look back at this to check. :smile:
Closing this now, as the SQLCipher support included with 3.9.0 seems to work ok. :smile:
could be also related to:
_Plot misses columns with NULL as first value_ #499
Regards Ralf
This is related to issue #822. Good news is that this is finally fixed now.
@wolfc01 If you are still interested in this, can you try tomorrow's nightly build and report back if it's working for you now? :smiley:
Any update on this, @wolfc01? :smiley: Closing this because it's an old issue without any updates recently. If this isn't working for you as expected, please reopen this issue. :smiley: @wolfc01 Carl, out of curiosity did you ever get time to check if this is fixed from your point of view? @zwrmueller Hmmm... I don't think we have a useful ongoing way to do that (yet).
If you need something to test "once off", I can grab our latest nightly, install it in a VM here, then make a .zip file of the installed files.  I think if you unzip that into a place of your choosing, then that should work.
No guarantees 😁 , but worth a shot if you need a nightly to try. :smile: You don't need to install in a VM and .ZIP it back up again - simply download the latest nightly and unzip that using 7zip - it'll create some 'wacky' directories, but the core files will be in one directory, then the 'platforms' directory.  @chrisjlocke Cool, didn't know that.  Sounds practical then. :smile: So, ignore the $PLUGINS directory, as thats the setup file's 'noise'.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/25914358/eb1c55c4-35b5-11e7-82d5-d16b3a073f7b.png)
...and the 'redist' directory, as that'll be installed anyway.  So just replace the files into the 'APP' directory of the portable installation.
I'll write this into the Wiki, as I'm sure someone else out there has the portable version! ;)  🍫   This is a duplicate of https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/513 isn't it?  If so, is it ok to close this one? :smile:
Closing this as duplicate.
If I select `Show rowid column`, the column headers correctly refreshes to show the new `rowid` column, but the columns data retains the old columns count.
So, after selecting the option, it looks like this:
![screen shot 2016-02-01 at 12 39 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/12715280/1eebccb4-c8e2-11e5-8511-cb3262410e59.png)
After **just right click-ing**, it correctly refreshed the columns data:
![screen shot 2016-02-01 at 12 39 30](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/12715296/3747f85a-c8e2-11e5-98f1-94c97ec41ccb.png)
After clicking the option again to disable the option, it looks like this:
![screen shot 2016-02-01 at 12 39 38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/12715308/4b8d487e-c8e2-11e5-8128-2a78d4a54ff3.png)
And after right click-ing again, it goes back to the correct initial form:
![screen shot 2016-02-01 at 12 39 43](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/12715319/5ec1fbe2-c8e2-11e5-9eca-5e5061c86317.png)
can confirm this with Win 7 SP1 and nightly build 3.8.99
Turns out this isn't quite as fixed as we'd thought. 😦
@karim pointed out in https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/639#issuecomment-232600998 that the nightly build, which included this fix... still has the issue.
Looking at the [build log](http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/build.log), that shows it using the correct git commit for building from.  Which means the code wasn't somehow missed out:
```

Now... to figure out WTF is going wrong.  Initial thought it maybe it's a Qt4/Qt5 thing?  I'll try compiling it here on OSX using Qt4 (instead of Qt5, which I used yesterday), and see if it's broken or not.
I think I'm using Qt4 home, where I solved this. I have no idea why wouldn't it work. And, how comes it worked with another nightly build?
Yeah, I just tried it here on OSX with Qt4.  The bug is fixed with that, so it's definitely not a Qt4/Qt5 problem.
Our official nightly Windows builds are statically built, [cross compiled on a Linux host using MXE](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#cross-compiling-for-windows).
The one off Windows build I created yesterday for testing the fix, was made using MSVC on Win 8.1, and uses shared libraries.
So... yeah... I'm not sure either.  ... and I'm not sure what to check next. 😦
Wouldn't it be simpler for @karim to test again the latest nightly build today, which is guaranteed (I guess) to include the fix?
Hmmm, I suppose it won't hurt.  I was under the impression that the build log for http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser.exe.zip was showing the fix already included. (but not working) :wink:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/sqlitebrowser-win64-issue639v2-201607131125.exe
That one's not **really** a nightly build.  It's just a once off I chucked on the server for people to test.
Maybe I should rename that `win64` directory to `win64-onceoffs` or something?
Yes, I think it's a good idea not to mix nightlies and manual builds.
k, moved those two into a hopefully-better-named subdirectory instead:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/
On what OS?
No worries at all, sounds like a decent plan. :smile:
@zwrmueller, As a safety check, can you test this too with the latest nightly?
Thanks @zwrmueller. :smile:
It sounds like the Windows builds will definitely need to be build using Qt5.
as I wrote at an other issue, with big data files it could be pretty much time consuming going directly to the BrowseData tab. I would opt for an option which tab to open first - or some sort of intelligent behaviour like this:
- if the file holds a single table, go directly to BrowseData tab
- if the file holds more than a single table, go to DataStructure tab
Regards
I agree with you, Tony.
For one reason see issue: "Useless time consuming internal SQL-commands at start-up".
Other reason could be: besides just showing the data via BrowsData-pane, just before running the Limit-SQL-query (internally run, as could be seen in the SQL_LOG-pane) for showing the data --> an other SQL-query for _counting_ the (whole) data is run, and _that_ query is not limited.
This behaviour is slightly different from running the same Limit-SQL-query manually from the Excecute_SQL-pane: here beforehand the Limit-SQL-query again a SQL-command for _counting_ the data is run, but this time including the LIMIT clause.
Maybe this is stuff for another "Useless time consuming internal SQL-command" ...
Regards
You're completely welcome to add further features + submit them here for inclusion if you want. :grinning:
It seems like this was introduced by #286. That PR changed the code for the edit dialog but not for the edit dock. I've just pushed a quick fix for that but haven't had a closer look at the changes made by that PR yet (not much time atm) but it seems to work now. Maybe if you have the time, can you help me out here testing the inline editing, the editing in dock mode and in window mode in the next nightly build? :smile:
Ahhh, forgot about this issue.
@tonypdmtr Going to close this, as it's fixed in the 3.9.0 release which came out yesterday. :smile:
It would be greatly useful if the save/open dialogs would save the last paths used per action type.
For example:
- for `Export`, the path could be `~/Users/Iulian/table_backups`
- for `Open SQL file`, the path could be `~/Users/Iulian/queries`
This was caused by a bug in our grammar parser which now should be fixed. Do you have the time to test tomorrow's nightly build and let me know if it's working for you, @darkfeline ? :smile:
Awesome!
Interesting.  That definitely sounds like a bug. :frowning:
Hmm, I have difficulties to reproduce this, both loading extensions and setting the pragma work for me...
By startup file you mean the Preferences dialog -> Database -> Advanced -> "SQL to execute after opening database" field? In this case there really shouldn't be any difference between opening the file via GUi and command line... So we'd have to do some more debugging on this :smile: As a start: What does it say in the SQL log area of the application when showing SQL submitted by the application? Do your commands appear there? In the meantime you can also load the extension via the Extensions tab in the preferences dialog and enable foreign keys in the Database tab.
@orbisvicis, Do you have time to test this using the nightly build?
@orbisvicis Ping.  Would you be ok to try our recent 3.9.0 release?  There's a fairly decent chance the bug is fixed in that. :smile:
Closing this due to lack of response. 😦   Hello,
I observed, that just _opening_ a big sqlite-file tooks lots of time. At the SQL_Log panel I could see that SQLitebrowser first  queries the sql_temp_master table, which is ok for me, but then also automatically queries the first table inside the db file. Just to show me nothing else more than the entry panel with the file structure. I think the last query is pretty useless, cause switching to data panel issues the query for the first table _again_!
Second:
If then I will have a look at the data and right-click on the table of choice and clicking _Browse Table_ then SQLitebrowser issues **2** queries: 1st) for the last table (looked at or automatically queried by program start) and 2nd) for the actual table I want to look at. Again I think the first query is pretty useless!?
Or do I miss a point?
Regards
Hmmmm, yeah, you're probably right.  It's kind of a semi-legacy code base, and we haven't really optimised things for working with large databases.  It would be useful for someone to join the team who'd be interested in doing that.
Would you happen to know anyone suitable and who might have the time/interest? :grinning:
Hello Justin,
we were on this before, unfortunately not. I can only offer my interest in beta testing/usability testing/reporting issues I stumble upon. But I’m not a programmer or know of anyone here.
I’m sorry
No worries at all.  I ask widely because sometimes it works out well. :grin:
Both issues should be fixed in the next nightly build. Let's have a thorough test here because this required changing some of the more central parts of the UI code :smile:
@zwrmueller Do you have time to test the next nightly build (tomorrow), and let us know if it's working better for you now? :smile:
Sure, that’s the least that I can do.
Regards
Hi, here is my testing:
I’m on Windows 7 SP1, tests with actual nightly build from 29.01.2016:
Issue 1) SQLiteBrowser now loads lightning fast – good!
Issue 2) just clicking on the tab _Browse Data_ results in incremental loadings of data in 50000 steps, which took looooooooong time - and finally crashed on a big data file, on small data file there is no crash; but the incremental loadings are not the behavior as before and pretty useless for a first glance at the file.
I answer per mail and put screenshots into it – dunno if it makes it to the forum …
Regards
Thanks Ralf.  And yeah, email attachments don't get added to issues.  They need to be added using the web interface.  Would you be ok to do that? :smile:

Regards
Thanks Ralf. :smile:
Thanks for the bug report.  Do you happen to remember which version the shift-click approach used to work?  That might help nail down the code which introduced the change. :smile:
Just tested this on my Linux machine and I don't experience this issue here at all. I can't remember any code changes related to this view either, so I assume it might be a Qt version thing maybe? I'm building againg Qt 5.5.1 but I'm not sure which version we're using for the Mac OS X bundle.
Ok, no worries :smile: That's a fine solution, too :wink: In case the issue happes again for you, feel free to reopen this bug any time.
Yeah, an extension environment would be great.  I don't know if we have anyone around who could implement it though.  If someone wants to volunteer/join-the-team/etc, that would be fantastic. :grinning:
@rp- Are you able to point out the code between the query result and the display, as @shirish93 is asking?  If so, that would help him get start in the code base... :smile:
@shirish93 The other approach would be to just set a bunch of breakpoints in the source, then step through them as the query happens.  It's not the fastest way to narrow things down, but it would get you to the code you're looking for within a few minutes.  And after that, you know where the code is, so don't need to do it again. :smile:
There are two places (leaving out a few unimportant ones) for issuing queries and displaying them in the UI: the Browse Data tab and the Execute SQL tab. For the latter I don't see any real chance of implementing some automatic decoding procedure. But for the former one we already have some sort of mechanism which might not be enough, though. You can have a look at the 'display formats' part of the code, especially in the MainWindow.cpp and ColumnDisplayFormatDialog.cpp. My first opinion would be that writing a SQLite extension and using that in the display format dialog would make most sense. But either way, we'd have to check for some C implementation of (un)pickle.
That's not a bad idea.  The installer is created using NSIS.  So, if NSIS adds a built in switch for silent install, that would likely work. :smile:
should work, see:
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#silent
@rp- Excellent, that's good info.  @swinster Would you be ok to read that info, then try the /S, /D, options (etc) as appropriate?
It sounds like it should be, but it might take some digging to figure out what the correct command line switches should be.  Might need to locate the NSIS source code (should be online), and take a look at the file in there which does the command line option parsing.  That would be pretty definitive. :smile:
Hi,
if the very first entry/value in a data column is NULL --> this column is no presented as a choice in the plot register.
I.e.: I got a table with 3 columns as
## A   B   C
1   10  NULL
2   12  21
3    8   123
then in the plot register frame only column A and B could be choosen for graphic representation - but not column C, column C is totally omitted and not listed for choosing it.
Could this be fixed please?!?
Small other issue with plotting:
in the graph section only data lines up to the SQL line limit are drawn. Took me a while to understand that. First I ever thought this behaviour would be a limit within the plot engine itself, but now I understood that it is correlated to the data lines shown within the data browser - and the data browser limits the data to 50000 at first view.
Suggestion: maybe a button "Show all data" right hand at the status line of the plot area would prevent others to stumble over that glitch.
Regards
just learn a bit of Markdown formatting, so here again is my example table:
| A | B | C |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 10 | NULL |
| 2 | 12 | 21 |
| 3 | 8 | 123 |
how does it look :-)
Hi Ralf, I've just fixed the second issue you've mentioned. The next nightly build should load all data automatically. As for the first and main issue I'm not really sure how to address this yet. Our plot code can't seem to omit those rows which are set to NULL, so they would always be treated as 0. But that's just wrong in my opinion because NULL means no data whereas 0 is an actual data value. But we'll see as soon as I have a chance for a closer look on the code.
Would having all of the data loaded automatically be a problem for people using very large (GB+) data sets?
me too I would prefer the suggested button to quickly get a grip on the actually loaded data - and visibly offer an option (button) to load them all for viewing the whole thing if desired
Regards
Sorry for keeping you waiting so long! But if you're still interested in this: could you try the next nightly build? I've added a small button for fetching all the data instead of doing it automatically. It's the small button with the cog icon in the plot panel :smiley:
Hi Ralf,
sorry again for the late response!
Today I haved pushed two commits which address this issue. One adds a progress dialog to fetch all data process. This way you can tell how long it's going to take and you can cancel it anytime.
The other commit actually addresses the NULL value issue and fixes that. For NULL data there will be a gap in the graph now. If it's just your first row that has a NULL value, the graph will simply start a little later.
If you're still interested, can you test tomorrow's nightly builds and report back if it's working for you? :smiley:
@zwrmueller Did you have any time to test this yet? :smiley: Closing this because it's an old issue without any updates recently. If this isn't working for you as expected, please reopen this issue. :smiley:  Thank you for reporting it.  Would you be ok to do a screenshot, to show us? :smile:
Thank you, that helps.
Yeah, the text does look blurry. :frowning:
@nickberry17 Yep, that's very helpful.  The "perfect" approach here would be for you to create a "Pull Request", with the code changes you've made in it.  That lets us directly merge them into our source code here, so they become part of the main project forever. :smile:
Looking at your fork of the project, it seems like you're still coming to grips with using git.  That can be a painful experience until it "clicks" and you get the hang of it (it was for me! :frowning:).
If you're up for continuing your journey of learning git, this is how to do a Pull Request:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/
If you'd rather not just right now (it's ok), let us know and either @MKleusberg or myself can look at coping across the changes manually.  (we'd probably need to ask follow up questions about which bits exactly/etc)
Workable? :smile:
Oh - forgot to mention... neither @MKleusberg nor myself have Retina display Mac's, so we'd probably need you to verify things being ok through either the nightly builds, or special one-off builds (I have a script for that, so it's easy). :smile:
Closing this, as @nickberry17 fixed it in #575.
No worries. :grinning:
Would you be ok to try our nightly build (download location is listed on our front page), and let us know if that works for you?  It uses a different (static) build proccess, and seems to work in many crash situations like this. :smile:
I am running Windows 7 with the standard 64-bit build from the installer and cannot reproduce this. I need to clear some space to test this on Windows 10 as I need to spin up a VM.
@glawrence That would be useful.  It kind of sounds like there's an issue with the dynamic linking part of things, as the static build version worked.  Not sure if that's pointing to a problem with some dll's on just @skifans' system, or if it's something more widespread, or something else... :anguished: If it happens for you too on a <strike>MS spyware</strike>Win10 system, that would help figure out if it's a once off vs possibly something just on Alex's computer.
I have created a vanilla Win 10 Pro (x64) Virtual Machine, downloaded sqlitebrowser-3.8.0-win64v2.exe from http://sqlitebrowser.org and installed SQLitebrowser, with no issues. I created a new database, added a table with some fields, a couple of rows of data and all was well. No matter what I did I cannot make it just crash after 3-4 seconds. All is well.
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.0-beta1
@skifans Just an update, we released version 3.9.0 yesterday.  When you're back, please test with that one instead. :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.0
Interesting, thanks for letting us know.  Someone mentioned something similar for one of the other windows too.  Looks like it wasn't a one off. :wink:
@justinclift I am seeing the same on Windows 7, it looks to me like the text in the first 4 menu items of the "View" menu is used for the menu item entry and the corresponding "dockable window title", however the latter does not handle & like a menu does, hence the problem.
k.  Hopefully Martin has time to look into it.
Good follow up Geoff. :smile:
Interesting.  Maybe it's a bug in the Qt 5.5.1 released that was used on Windows then. :wink:
I'm using Qt 5.5.1 on Linux and don't experience this problem. So it's not just the Qt version but either Qt on Windows or Windows in general. I've tried fixing the problem in the latest commit but don't have a Windows system to test my (somewhat naive) approach. So let me know if it works for you, ideally by first checking today's nightly build, then checking tomorrow's nightly build.
As today's nightly build will be gone soon I've made a backup, just let me know if you need it.
@wolfgang42 Do you have time to test the nightly build, and let us know if it's working better for you now? :smile:
Aargh.  Ok, new plan.  Would you be ok to try the nightly build tomorrow then? :grinning:
Awesome, thanks for letting us know. :smile:
I'll close this for now.  Our next release will have this in it. :grin:
Hmmm, it looks like it hasn't found the SQLite development pieces.  Which platform are you compiling on? :smile:
You're welcome. :smile:
Just went to add it... and er... it's already there.  3rd package on the "yum install" line.
Oops? :wink:
Ahhh yeah, that makes sense.  We added the missing dependency a few days ago from memory. :smile:
Thank you, that's a decent idea. :smile:
Interesting.   Would you be ok to add a screenshot showing the filter, and it not working? :smile:
Thanks.  Yeah, that doesn't seem to be working like it should. :frowning:
Hmmm yeah.  It sounds like there is a trigger for the filter which wasn't created. :frowning:
Thanks for taking the time to get in touch with us. :smile:
From memory, there's a key combination you can press to refresh it manually too, if that helps.  Trying to remember what the key combination is though... drawing a blank.  F5 on Windows, ⌘-R on OSX maybe? (no idea for Linux... may be window manager dependent?)
Thanks for the suggestion. The filters were applied after a delay time of 300 ms for users editing large tables. You could leave the filter e.g. by hitting Tab or you could hit Return to apply the filter instantaneously.
To improve this behaviour I've introduced a new option in the Preferences dialog for setting the delay time. You can disable the delay altogether as well by setting it to 0. I've also reduced the default waiting time to 200 ms. Please let me know if the changes work for you :smile: You can test them by downloading the next nightly build :smile:
@Aermec Did you have the time to try the nightly build yet? :smile:
Not sure, but it might be due to this commit.  That one is a first tentative attempt to fix a different problem: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/6784a6a854813bc6577f81c4300d8983abb3cee9
If that one really is the cause of the slow down, we'll need to find a different solution for that one. :wink:
Yes, that was the commit that caused the application to slow down, effectively disabling the block prefetch feature. That performance bug got fixed in the meantime, so it should all be fine now :smiley:
Out of curiosity, is your database file located on your tablet while you're editing it (eg connected through USB cable), or are you copying it to your computer first before editing?  Android has some reasonably well known problems with copying files around in some modes.  Some of the links in here might help, if this is what the problem is: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/476
Yeah, that's really, really not good. :frowning:
@cederom Hmmm, one thing that **might** fix the problem for you, is if you compile DB4S yourself (pretty easy), so that it uses the MacPorts dependencies instead of the bundled ones.
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
Do you have the time/interest to try that? (it should only take a few minutes)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9058169/sqlite-database-disk-image-is-malformed-on-windows-but-fine-on-android
As pointed out by @MKleusberg [earlier on in the year](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/476#issuecomment-168403277). Doh.  Damn, hoped we'd found the cause. :smile:
Oh well, hopefully we'll get it sorted one day. :wink: Yeah, concurrent access **may** have something to do with it.  But, that's just (a reasonable) guess. :smile:  Hmmm, that's not good.  Crashing is definitely not the correct behaviour there. :wink:
Can't reproduce this :frowning: Can you provide any extra information on this?
On OSX, we include the needed external libraries in the .app bundle.  The app bundle is created simply using macdeployqt though, which may or may not be fantastic.  It's possible there's a conflict with installed MacPorts packages/libraries. :frowning:
@cederom If you compile DB4S yourself (it's extremely easy), do the problems still happen?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
Thanks @lech that's really useful info.  Should help the guys debug this reasonably quickly, once they get the time. :smile:
Yeah, I don't think crash reports are going to help us at this stage. :frowning:
Cool, thanks for checking Andrew. :smile:
Thank you all for the combined debugging effort, @cederom, @lech and @AndrewADev :+1:
I think I managed to reproduce this. The problem occurs in version 3.8.0 when following the instruction provided by Lech. However, you must have the `View -> Edit cell` option activated, otherwise the application wouldn't crash.
But as Andrew said, this bug seems to be fixed in the current master. So, as the initial reporter, would you be able to try out the latest nightly build and check if the error is fixed for you, @cederom? For download locations check the main page of our repository :smiley:
The annoying opening of the Edit database cell window mentioned by @AndrewADev should be fixed, too, in the latest nightly build.
Closing this, as it's apparently fixed and we've not heard back.
You're welcome. :smile:
Awesome @lech, thanks for trying it out and letting us know. :smile:
No worries. :wink:
I work with an SQLite database encrypted with a password with different versions of it in different locations.
It gets annoying having to enter the same password over and over again (even with `ClipMenu`).
Is there any possibility to set a password, maybe in `Preferences > Database > Advanced` next to the new `SQL to execute after opening database`, and first try to use that password, and if it doesn't work (trying to open another database), show the enter password alert?
Hmmm, I can see arguments both for (convenience) and against (security) doing that.  However, PostgreSQL (another database product, kind of a big brother to this) has the ability to set default passwords.  The arguments for that doing so, are valid here too.
So... without thinking about it too deeply, this sounds like a decent idea. :smile:
Though, it may feel odd to try the same password for lets say 10 different databases, but only one  being the correct one.
```
Apply this password: <password>
for files with this format: <format>
```
There's no lockout of a database from failed attempts, so that kind of feels (to me) like overcomplicating things.
That being said, whoever end up implementing this... if they choose to do so, then great. :wink:
That's a bit confusing.  Are you meaning this is a regression in behaviour?  eg it used to do things ok, but now its not
Cool, thank you. :smile:
Interesting questions.  @rp- creates our Windows release builds using Visual Studio (I think, that's from memory).  Our nightly Windows builds use an older process, cross-compiling from Linux using [MXE](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#cross-compiling-for-windows).
From your error output above, it looks like you're using mingw32.  I'm unsure if anyone's tried that yet. :grin:
And yeah, lets discuss here.  It distributes the problem solving / knowledge wider. :wink:
Yeah, I'm not sure either.  I don't code C++ (at this point), I more help out this project with compiling on OSX and making packages there.
Is there any way you can add an #include (or C++ equivalent) or something for string_s.h, to see if that works?  Note - That's just me guessing. :grin:
I keep meaning to look Windows builds, so will try and get restarted on this
building sqlitebrowser itself is not much of a problem with cmake on windows.
Its more a problem of getting the dependencies correctly built, e.g. sqlite is a bit of a pitty because there are no build files for VS and you have to do them on your own with the correct .def file.
I don't build with qmake anymore and don't know how a mingw build will work out on windows.
No, MXE is for cross compiling from linux (for our nightly builds)
The installer .exe is created using VS2013 and cmake.
Yes you would need to set the paths to our install/library directories
yes it should be possible
those paths should point to foremost binaries
a directory structure like SQLITE3_PATH/lib, SQLITE3_PATH/include
this is how cmake will search for the includes and lib files
see also:
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.3/variable/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html
It looks like a define mismatch, someone(mingw or antlr) wants to call strcpy_s, but this function is only avialable I think on MS visual c compiler, it is some pseudo secure variant of strcpy.
http://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/mailman/message/25751607/
I'm trying to get this working with MSVC 2013 + CMake ([documenting the progress here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Notes-for-compiling-on-Windows)), but am hitting the same ANTLR error you show above.
Any ideas?
Managed to get past that error, and get CMake to generate the project files.  It seems like the project is being compiled in x86 mode though, not x64, as it then complains about a mismatch.
Does anyone know where to set that?  I was **very** careful to download the x64 versions of Qt, OpenSSL, etc, and I'm running Win 8.1 x64.  So, I'm unsure where it's getting x86 from. ???
Thanks @drescherjm I'll take a look at that again.  I was trying things from the command line, as the GUI didn't seem to have a way to "Open File" to select an existing project.
I'll take a look again. :smile:
Hmmm, that seems to have completed the build.  Ok, this might be worth putting more time into after all.
Thanks heaps @drescherjm, that seems to have solved that problem. :grin:
Now to see if I can get the "install" step working...
Holy crap.  It worked.
![first compile of db4s on windows](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/14868193/506c330c-0cc4-11e6-8bff-3e1a30df4d5e.png)
Tomorrow, I'm going to document the living stuffing out of the process to make that work. :smile:
Awesome, that's really, really helpful. :smile:
The target for building a package with NSIS is also working too.  Hmmm, it might be possible for us to get SQLCipher support working too.  Another thing to try tomorrow. :smile:
Update - I've gone through the process (from a newly installed Win 8.1 desktop) to compiled & packages 64-bit version on DB4S on Windows, taking 104 screenshots along the way.
Mentally brain fogged now, so the cropping and turning-them-into-useful-docs process is going to have to wait a few hours before starting, or perhaps tomorrow morning.
For anyone interested, the docs-in-development for compiling DB4S on Windows are here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S
They're in an ok state now.  Some fine tuning still needs to be done to make things prettier, but the content is workable as-is. :smile:
Now if I can just get SQLCipher to compile... :wink:
SQLCipher seems to compile ok, and DB4S seems to pretty much "just work" with it when the right includes/directory-paths/filenames are given to it.  Initial package here for testing, if anyone wants to give it a shot:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/sqlitebrowser-win64-with_sqlcipher-201605041823.exe
Which bits did you try, and what went wrong?  Screenshots of error messages and similar are helpful, so we can investigate and try to fix it.
As an extra thought, we've been putting time into making further instructions for compiling SQLCipher on Windows:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Win64-setup-—-Compiling-SQLCipher
They're also still a "work in progress", but might be useful depending on the problem you're hitting.
Anyway, if you're ok to let us know what broke when you tried things, that would help. :smile:
Oh, that's not good.  @MKleusberg, another one for you. :wink:
Thanks for continuing to test and report stuff @tonypdmtr. :smile:
Just tested this using the latest version and it seems to work. I think we've fixed this quite some time ago to be honest. Are we ok to close this issue? :smiley: Hmmm, not sure.  @tonypdmtr ? @tonypdmtr Thanks for checking. :smile:
We dropped the statically built window's nightlies a few months ago, when we switched to supporting Qt5 only.  The static builds relied on Qt4, so that approach no longer worked.
The build script we use for Windows is here, if that's useful:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://gist.github.com/justinclift/11cc926f214e882c8162f97c53929c07
If you have ideas on how to tweak/change it to make things better, we're open to improvements. :smile:
When running a SQL query in the "Execute SQL" tab on yesterdays's nightly OSX build, the results show up in the window pane below.  I didn't personally think the result pane was hooked up to the "Edit Database Cell" er.. dockable window thing :wink: at all, but you're right.  When I click on one of the results with the mouse, it shows up in the "Edit Database Cell" window:
![screen shot 2017-05-17 at 19 28 35](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/26169871/1d925568-3b37-11e7-91e5-c1775442ed37.png)
But, moving around the result pane cells with the keyboard doesn't change what's shown in the "Edit Database Cell".
I guess we need to think over whether things from the result pane should be shown in the "Edit Database Cell" or not, then either fully unhook things (eg so mouse click doesn't show results there), or properly-hook-things up (eg including the keyboard).
What're your thoughts on the direction we should go?  I'm trying to figure out how/where/why it'd be useful to have them editable. :smile: Ahhh, that makes good sense.  Hadn't thought of it that way at all.
Yeah, we should probably hook up the keyboard keys with the Edit Database Cell contents there too then. Thanks for the detailed explanation, @tonypdmtr :smile: I've just changed the code to allow include selection via keyboard, however it's not that easy as you can see [here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractitemview.html#activated). On some platforms you'll need to press Enter to trigger the action, i.e. first change the selection by using the arrow keys, then press Enter to show the contents. I'm not sure either what they mean by "depends on the platform"
Anyway, what do you reckon? Is the new approach (it'll be in the next nightly build) workable? Or should we add extra code to make it happen without the Enter key being needed? And if so, how should we handle multi-selection when multiple fields are selected?  Thanks for reporting this Chris. Just tried this out here on OSX, and you're right.  That looks like a bug in our older "Edit database cell" code.  Seems to only happen (for me), when the new "Edit cell" window is turned off. :frowning:
Hmmm, yeah there definitely seems to be some buggy interaction between the older "Edit database cell" window, and the new "Edit cell".  @MKleusberg wrote the code for this, so this Issue has been assigned to him. :grin:
It does sound like it will be an easy fix though. :grin:
Thanks, @chrisjlocke, for reporting this :smile: I've done most of my testing using the pane at the bottom instead of the dialog and didn't notice this annoying behaviour...
This bug should be fixed in the next nightly build (so no need to wait for a few weeks :wink:). Please let me know if the new version works for you.
As for the "Edit &cell" thing: this seems to work correctly on my system (i.e. underlining the 'c' and creating a Alt+C shortcut). Might be a Qt version thing or dependant on the OS. I'll have a closer look at this later.
Excellent stuff @MKleusberg. :smile:
@MKleusberg I've just been using DB4S for manually adding a few hundred fields of data in a database, which I need to do every few months.
Not at all a fan of the new Edit Cell window, as it's breaking my work flow pretty badly.  Previously, I could hit enter on a cell, edit the value in place there, hit tab to progress to the next cell (which would automatically be in editable mode), add the value there, hit tab, etc.
This no longer works, instead bringing up the Edit Cell window, where the TAB key makes a tab character instead.
To get around this I've reverted my version of DB4S back to commit e74645bb1f74395016bfda110dd4d996bb1d5cb1, which is prior to this Edit cell change.  That has let me continue being efficient.
We should probably either make the TAB key in the Edit cell move to the next cell value, or possibly rethink our Edit cell approach.  Thoughts? :wink:
@FreudGit Which OS are you on?  If it's OSX, I can whip up a one-off build for you which is reverted back to that commit, same as I'm using.
Sure, no worries at all. :smile:
Sure, no worries.  Just for OSX, or would a Win64 build be useful as well?
Btw - I fully intend to debug this and get it fixed for the next release.  Putting time into other stuff at the moment though, but can't imagine it taking more than a fortnight (roughly).
@FreudGit Just whipped up an OSX build using the commit mentioned above:
&bull; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx-onceoffs/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-issue480v1.dmg
Give that a shot for now.
In theory, a proper fix for this should be in the next release too.  *fingers crossed\* :wink:
@chrisjlocke @FreudGit I've been putting some time over the last few days, to understand the code around this part of things.
Just made some changes to the source code, which I **think** will have improved this a lot.
It might not be perfect yet, but I think it's on the way.
Would either of you have time to try out tomorrow's nightly build to see how well that works for you?
In theory, this should now be fully fixed.  Nightly builds (from tomorrow) will include the fix, so if someone can verify things are now good that would be fantastic. :smile:
I'll try it now.  :smile:
Edit: OOps.  Read the above message from 2 days ago saying try tomorrows build, and then your latest saying check tomorrows.... will check both! :wink:
The only issue I immediately see is that when updating a cell via the table, the 'edit cell' pane below is not updated.  However, editing the lower pane updates the grid.
I can do a 'movie' if that shows things better.
Ahhh, I think I understand already.
After a new value is put into a cell, the new value doesn't get propagated to the Edit Cell window automatically.  Is that what you're meaning?
Thanks Chris. :smile:
The fix is probably just figuring out the name of the event that fires when data is changed, and connecting that to the Edit Dock.  It'll likely be something straightforward such as... dataChanged().  Will investigate.
@chrisjlocke Fixed the problem with in-place edits not propagating to the Edit Database Cell: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/9fe42b1399658149cb02943e71b59902de3f8d1f
It'll be in the next nightly build. :smile:
\o/
Closing this now, as it's definitely fixed by the just merged code in #679. :smile:
@FreudGit @chrisjlocke If either of you have time/inclination to test this (eg from the nightly builds after tomorrow), that would be great. :smile:
Interesting.  It sounds like things are ok, but lets ask @MKleusberg, as he made some changes with that code a while back (likely the change in question). :smile:
Hmm, there's no 'not an error' string in our code and I can't seem to reproduce this :confused: Can you give us a more detailed description on how to reproduce this issue?
To me, it sounds like an output string from (say) SQLite after a successful statement execution.
Any updates on this? The "not an error" string is from SQLite but I don't see how it will be shown in the latest version of DB4S anymore. Closing this because it's a really old issue and I believe it is fixed. If you can still reproduce this in the latest version, please re-open this issue, @thetazzbot :smiley: Good news. Thanks to the same error message appearing in #957 and the comment by @chrisjlocke (which now seems to be deleted) I have managed to get a 'not an error' error message in the Execute SQL tab :smiley: I have fixed this particular case now, so I'm more or less confident that this is finally fixed entirely now. > and the comment by @chrisjlocke (which now seems to be deleted)
You stated you couldn't reproduce it, but I 'found a way' (nature always finds a way...) but I realised I was using v3.9.1.  As soon as I tested the latest nightly, I couldn't reproduce it, so deleted the comment..... :) ... as I was talking gibberish!  @chrisjlocke No worries :D It helped me somehow provoking a 'not an error' error, so it definitely helped me ;)  Oh that's interesting.  Which OS are you using?
Interesting.  Does the latest nightly build work for you?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx/sqlitebrowser_20160105.dmg
Cool, I'm going to rebuilt the release binaries for OSX tomorrow.  That should at least fix the crash problem for people. :smile:
@thetazzbot Do you have time to test the new 3.8.0 OSX release build, prior to it being officially published?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx-prerelease/
It "should be good", but it wouldn't hurt to have some more people test it (instead of just me), prior to updating the official release with it. :grin:
Just released updated downloads for 3.8.0 for OSX, that shouldn't crash for anyone. :smile:
Excellent, thanks for checking and letting us know @thetazzbot. :smile:
@pikeas I have loaded the database from the URL you specified on the 64-bit version of 3.8.0 (Qt 5.5.1, SQLite 3.9.2) on Windows 7 and Windows 10 without any issue. I am not sure how that helps though but I thought @justinclift might like to know.
@pikeas Do you have OSX Homebrew installed?  If so, would you have a few minutes to try compiling DB4S yourself?  It's extremely simple to do so (cut-n-paste instructions!), and only takes about 5-10 minutes:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
Not sure what @justinclift thinks but that sounds like an incompatibility with operating system functionality, which is not good, and ideally something we should cope with gracefully
Yeah, it does sound like it deserves more investigation. :wink:
I can't reproduce this either.
But I do encounter a crash quite often that I didn't have time to report. It happens only sometimes (yay) when opening a database while having another database opened already. Either by double clicking the file, either by opening from the app.
Closing this for now, as it's pretty old and we have tonnes of other things to fix. :wink:
I cannot open your database file using the SQLite command line tool either. So I think it's the file which causes the problems, not the SQLite editor.
I've done a bit of searching and it looks like this is a common problem for Android users: copying the database file to your computer may give you an incomplete file which then can't be opened: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9058169/sqlite-database-disk-image-is-malformed-on-windows-but-fine-on-android
This would explain why the file can be opened with an editor in the device - you don't need to copy it then.
If you want to do some more research, you can try searching for e.g. 'android "Error: database disk image is malformed"'.
Yes, sorry I can't help you any further. But if you have any other issues or questions later on feel free to open issues for them, too :smile:
Cool! :smile:
Would you be ok to squash both of those commits into a single one?  I can merge it after that. :grin:
Note - If you're not sure how to combine/squash both of those commits into a single one, I can do it for you.  Just let me know. :grin:
Heh Heh Heh.  It looks like you're still working on this.  Let me know when you feel it is ok to merge this, and I'll get it done.
It's now merged, with all of the commits combined into just one: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/c2f78b682cdce01d70832d63f0bd5a4e3627ae4a
Ahhh, that sounds useful.  @MKleusberg does this look good to merge?  It's a three-liner. :smile:
Thanks, @MyRoGeertGit for contributing this :smile:
I have one small suggestion before merging: can we change the datetime() function to just a date() call? Because as far as I see it's just the date which is stored in the number anyway, so the time part of the string would always be 00:00:00.
Oh I see. I missed the 'double' bit in your original post. Sorry! This way `datetime()` does seem like the correct function to use :smile: `date()` might not even be needed then...
Thanks a lot for your pull request and for the explanation - I haven't used this date format before but am happy to see that DB4S and the display format feature is used in all sorts of ways :smile:
Perfect.  That should put the info in the right place for people to find it easily.
Thanks @subdriven. :smile:
Ahhh, good catch.  Should be an easy fix too. :smile:
Should be fixed in the next nightly build :smile: The same problem applied for the edit dialog, too, by the way and is fixed there as well.
Excellent stuff Martin. :smile:
@tonypdmtr Would you be ok to try the next nightly build (tomorrow)?
Ha ha, this was broken again in the meantime ^^ Just pushed a new fix. Can somebody test this and confirm it's working now? Closing this because it's an old issue without many updates and I'm pretty sure it's fixed :smiley: If you feel like I've closed this issue too hastily please reopen it :smiley:  @tonypdmtr If you've the time/energy, would you be ok to check a recent nightly from your point of view? :smile: Awesome @tonypdmtr, thanks for taking the time. :smile:  Interesting, similar reports on OSX 10.10.5 (that specific version) too.  It seems to be a bug in the packaging I did. :frowning:  As a workaround for now, do you have Homebrew installed?
If you do, compiling it DB4S yourself is super easy and the program won't crash.  You can literally cut-n-paste the instructions here, and it takes ~5 minutes in total (including reading the instructions). :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
You're welcome. :smile:
Hmmm, thinking about this more, that info should probably be in the front page/README.md, not in BUILDING.md (which should have compilation instructions).  Any interest in making that change? :wink:
Thanks for the bug repot @progheal. :smile:
Are you able to provide the correct installer message(s)?  If so, our packager for Windows (@rp-) might be able to get them incorporated into the next release.
Personally, I'm not multi-lingual so that's just my guess for the correct approach to fixing this.  If you have suggestions for a better idea, we're happy to hear them. :smile:
well this is a bit out of my scope, as I just use the NSIS installer software and it might be a bug there.
I'll try to update it for the next release.
Wonder if there's an NSIS developer mailing list or something we could ask on?
If you do, would you be ok to compile DB4S and see if it still crashes for you?  That would help figure out if it's something wrong with our code, or instead if it's a packaging problem.
Compiling DB4S is very, very, very simple if you have Homebrew installed.  You can literally cut-n-paste the instructions here, and it takes ~5 minutes in total (including reading the instructions). :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
Ok, that sounds like the packaging I did might not like OSX 10.10 then. :frowning:
I should be able to get it running in a VM and test it sometime in the next few days.  In the meantime, it sounds like you're ok for now (with the self-compiled .app version).  That warning is new to me too... guessing it won't be important, but I won't really know for sure until I've had a chance to muck around with things on 10.10 to find out too. :wink:
Yeah, that's OSX 10.10 as well.  Looks like that's really not happy. :frowning:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/nightly/
That was built on a different system, and uses Qt4 instead of Qt5.  If that one works instead, it helps narrow down the cause of the problem. :wink:
If either of you have a chance to try this, that would be useful:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx/sqlitebrowser-sqlcipher_20160105.dmg
Interesting.  Do you have time to try the one from the day before it?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx/sqlitebrowser-sqlcipher_20160104.dmg
That was built with Qt5.  If that one crashes, then the problem is likely something to do with Qt5.
Ugh, nope.  The About dialog always reports the correct version, so I'm wrong somewhere. :frowning:
Hmmm, I'll check the versions here and see what's up. :wink:
Ahhh, found the problem.  The nightly build script wasn't removing Qt4 when it ran, so had both Qt4 + Qt5 installed when building.  The build seems to default to Qt4... so Qt5 was being left out.
I'll manually build a Qt5 one now for testing with.
Well, that's a bust.  The nightly build server literally cannot build anything with Qt5 installed + linked into the system.  Gives this bogus error (Xcode is fine):
```
Project ERROR: Xcode not set up properly. You may need to confirm the license agreement by running /usr/bin/xcodebuild.
```
Looks like the nightlies will only use Qt4 from here on.
Tomorrow I'll rebuild new binaries for 3.8.0 using Qt4.  That might fix the crashing problems on OSX. :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/osx-prerelease/
It "should be good", but it wouldn't hurt to have some more people test it (instead of just me), prior to updating the official release with it. :grin:
Thanks @pbtura.  Do you remember what the default font was for you?  I can look into it here and see if I can figure something out. :grin:
k, new 3.8.0 downloads are available for OSX now:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases
Hmmm, that's interesting.  I wonder if the new 3.8.0 package for Win32 was built without XP compatibility?  We'd better ask. :wink:
@rp- ?
As a thought, does the nightly build work for you? (download location is listed on our front project page)
Cool, that fixes the immediate problem.  It'll be useful to figure out the actual cause and get that looked at too. :wink:
I'll have a look as soon as I got some time
We might need to explicitly set the v110_xp target when compiling with MSVC?
yeah it was that, but I don't know exactly why, because I added an overwrite for that property.
I uploaded a new installer
Hmmm, that doesn't sound good.  Which version of DB4S is this for, and which OS are you on? :smile:
No worries, thanks for the bug report.  Hopefully someone (maybe @MKleusberg ?) has time to look at it in the near-ish future. :smile:
@iursevla and @peku33 Do you have the time to check if this solution https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/901#issuecomment-268693029 helps you? :) @peku33 @iursevla Ping? @iursevla Awesome, thanks for checking. :smile:  Ouch, that's not good.  Guess we might be making a 3.8.1 release in the very near future. :wink:
Thanks for reporting the problem. :smile:
Sorry for this hiccup.  Use the 3.7.0 release instead for now, and we'll try to figure out what's going wrong. :frowning:
Hmmm, I'll disable the 3.8.0 release for now, so people use the 3.7.0 one until we've figured this out.
@eikcam @chinhodado @javamap As a thought, it would be interesting to know if the nightly build has the same problem.  Anyone have time/interest to check? :smile:
If so, it's here for Windows (uncompress it with [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org)):
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz
Thanks guys, that's very helpfu! :smile: The automated nightly build system for Windows runs on a different system than the one used to create the Windows release builds.  It sounds like something's not quite right with the packaging/building done for this release on Windows, rather than a problem in the actual code itself.
It'll take some more investigation, but that gives us a bunch to go on.  I've emailed the main dev's to let them know, so hopefully @rp- has time to look into this in the near-ish future and figure out a solution. :smile:
No worries. :grin:
Fixed in 1c233de3b5166ecd9225d52f6985976f29a80729.
Rerelease should be published soon.
Just published the new release: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.8.0
Binaries on all platforms were rebuilt.  Used Qt5 on OSX this time too, just for the heck of it.  Hopefully that doesn't cause issues... :smiling_imp:
@rp- Would it be possible for you to update the SQLite library being used for the static nightly builds?
Closing this now, as we haven't had any further reports of this bug since releasing the new packages. :smile:
Thanks @PKEv. :smile:
Fixed it :smile:
Not sure if I understand what you mean :frowning: Can you give me an example maybe on how to reproduce this?
Ah, that's fixed too, I think. Step 3 is made impossible by this commit: b04d52b99c6ed9a93e5a0be250f00fb1b117dc14
But there won't be a duplicate Field3 :confused: I understand that it _would_ crash if there were two fields with the same name. But I don't see how you can make two fields with the same name after the latest commits?
Ok, I think I understand you :smile:
I've made two different commits. One (5af384f0a21c5dd2882ef51dcce5884b916225c7) is for the case when a new field is added. This is the one you mean. But there is a second commit (b04d52b99c6ed9a93e5a0be250f00fb1b117dc14) which verifies the field names after the user has changed them. This second commit should solve the bug you've mentioned. Correct?
Thanks @PKEv. :smile:
Makes sense to me. :smile:
Unsure if it'll get done for this release (likely tomorrow) though. :frowning:
Oh, that's interesting.  Which version of DB4S is this happening on, and which OS are you using? :smile:
Ahhh, makes sense.  It's more of a packaging issue on our end, needing a new release with the newer SQLite.
We're intending on getting a new release out reasonable shortly (likely days, not months).  Hopefully that's not too long a delay for you. :smile:
@springy76 The new release uses SQLite 3.9.2 for the Windows packages.  Have you had a chance to try it out yet and confirm it's now working? :smile:
Closing this now, as the new release bundles SQLite 3.9.2.  If it doesn't turn out to work for you after all, please feel welcome to reopen this issue and we'll investigate further. :smile:
Which version of DB4S are you trying with, and which Operating System is it on? :smile:
Ahhhh yeah, that makes sense.
We're looking to complete a new release done tomorrow, which on OSX should include SQLite 3.9.2.  I'm thinking this should fix the problem for you.
In the meantime, if you need things to work right away you can compile DB4S yourself.  On OSX is very, very easy, if you already have Homebrew installed.  You can literally cut-n-paste the commands from the instructions here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
Sound ok to you? :smile:
Thanks. :grin:
Btw, the new release (3.8.0) has been out for a few days now, so you should be good. :smile:
Hmmm, changing field names should work.  In the dialog for either creating a new table, or modifying an existing one, just double click on the name of the field you want to change.  eg Double click on "Field1".
In theory, that should let you then change it's name to whatever you want.  If that's not working, let us know as something's wrong. :wink:
For the field types, we list SQLite's in built types.
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html
(Please read that page, as it should help a lot :wink:)
The course material you're using might benefit from getting a note added about the various data types available across different databases, depending on which software they expect people to be using.
Is it practical for you to have a chat with your course instructor, or the creator of the course material, or ask about this? :smile:
You're welcome Sandra.  Are we ok to close this issue now? :smile:
:smile:
I'm not entirely sure on this but to be honest I think that's not possible nor is it possible for us to implement this feature. The reason is that each process has its own virtual memory which is invisible from within other processes. So if you have an in-memory database opened in one thread (which I assume you do when you say you created an in-memory shared-cache database) we can't inspect it from the separate sqlitebrowser process. There are way of interprocess communication, of course, but it doesn't seem like SQLite implements any of them:
https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html says:
```
Of course, all database connections sharing the in-memory database need to be in the same process.
```
And https://www.sqlite.org/sharedcache.html says:
```
Enabling shared-cache for an in-memory database allows two or more database connections in the same process to have access to the same in-memory database.
```
So it definitely sounds like you have to be in the same process but unfortunately we have no chance to do that :frowning:
Ahhh, understood.  Yeah, that makes sense.
@MKleusberg How much effort do you reckon this would take? :smile:
Going to close this, because we have another issue open for the same thing at #682.
But yeah... you did suggest it first. :wink:
Awesome. :smile:
@MKleusberg What do you reckon, is this good to merge?
1) Can you maybe squash the 4 commit into one (https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Merging-Commits) so we can have a nice commit history?
2) The erase part is superseded by now because I've implemented something similar for issue #443. I didn't see your PR back then :frowning: But I'd still like to merge the pasting code you've added :)
I had a closer look now and this looks really good :+1: Looks like you've really though of everything, @MilosSubotic . Nice work :smile: If you remove the erase code (or somehow merge it with the existing code from e74645bb1f74395016bfda110dd4d996bb1d5cb1) we can merge this :)
Awesome :smile: Thank you very much :+1:
Where is this error message happening for you, which version of DB4S are you running, and which version of Windows are you on? :smile:
Closing this due to lack of information. :frowning:
That's a good question.  Not something I know about personally, but it shouldn't be super hard to figure out a way to make it work.
By the way, which OS are you using it on? :smile:
I'll have to think about this issue a little more. But as a first question: would it be ok for you to have to configure the PRAGMAs using the GUI editor? Like having a default pragmas page somewhere? But this would mean that we ignore the sqliterc file. The reason for this is that the sqliterc doesn't contain standard SQL but only the commands starting with a dot which are specifically for the command line tool; and I want to avoid writing a parser for that since I'm not expecting that many users will even notice the feature :wink:
Ok, this might be a silly approach to your issue but I've just added a way which should work for you. If you rebuild the latest code this should do the trick:
- Click View -> Preferences
- You'll now see a SQL editor where you type in arbitrary SQL statements
- Type in your PRAGMAs in there, one per line, terminated by semicolons - just like you'd be executing them in the Execute SQL area of the program
Now these PRAGMAs will be executed whenever you open an existing database or create a new one. I hope this helps :smile:
@DevynCJohnson We released a new version (3.8.0) about a week ago, with some bits added for this as @MKleusberg describes above.  Do you have a few moments to try it out and let us know if this now works decently for you? :smile:
@DevynCJohnson Did you ever get around to trying this out?
Note - I'm just looking to close out old issues which have probably been taken care of.  If the fix for this isn't working as intended, and it's something you care about, definitely let us know. :smile:
Closing this due to lack of response.
@MKleusberg - Yours? :smile:
Heya. :smile:
I do the packaging for the OSX binaries.  I don't really know it in depth... it's more something I figured out after a bit of reading and has worked from that point forwards.
If it helps, this is the exact script used to build the nightly OSX binaries:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://gist.github.com/justinclift/38887c1cfe480adfb11b
They used to be built on an OSX 10.7 machine.  That machine was recently (2015-11-20) updated to running OSX 10.10.  The binaries generated are now a lot larger.  Not really thinking the upgrade was a win, personally. :frowning:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/nightly/
I haven't looked into why the binaries in the newer OS are larger.  If you want to though, please do.  The info might be interesting/useful to a lot of people. :smile:
Sounds like there's some dependencies between them or something then.
Um, do we still need to leave this issue open for you? :wink:
No worries at all.  Glad you got it figured out-ish. :smile:
Thanks Ralf, which OS are you on?
:frowning: Ugh, I do the OSX builds for this, not the Windows ones.  It's not something I have much capability to investigate properly personally.
@rp- Do you have time to look into this?
Yeah, I just build OSX binaries and help out here myself. :smile:
Hi Ralf,
I think the last commit fixes your issue. The problem was that the database actually _was_ saved but the state inside the application wasn't changed to reflect the saving. Anyway, let us know if tomorrow's nightly build fixes the issue for you :)
@zwrmueller Do you have a few minutes to try out the latest code, to see if this is fixed now for you? :smile:
@zwrmueller Thanks for verifying this, and letting us know. :smile:
@zwrmueller @tonypdmtr The nightly builds are created through cross-compilation from a Linux host, using Windows as the target.  It produces a "static build", where all of the libraries needed by the program get compiled into the end result.  So... much bigger output file.  It's also 32-bit only, so anyone needing to open really large database files (several GB's) can't use it.
Our older releases used to use this same approach too, but we changed it a few releases ago to a dynamic build approach.  This lets us create 64-bit releases for Windows (so people with large databases can use them).
... and it turns out the static 32-bit build approach is useful for some people still.  It might be useful if we figure out a way to create the releases for Windows using both approaches.
Hmmmm, good question.  I'm not running it on Windows personally, so I'm not real sure.
I guess... if it's still working, then it can't be too wrong. :grin:
Hmmm, that's unexpected.  Is there an error in the Windows system log or application log with more info?
It sounds like there's a bad .dll or something on your computer, making it crash.  That's a pure guess though, so we need to look for more accurate error info.
Well, we know for sure it works on other Windows 7 computers.  However, that doesn't help you. :wink:
As a thought, would you be ok to download and install this?  It **might** help.  At the very least, it shouldn't make things worse:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784
The only other thing I'm wondering is if your system has all of the latest Microsoft updates applied?  Do you keep it patched up to date? (eg: through Windows update)
Thanks @TrustyWolf . :)
@Bailey26 Have you had a chance to investigate this more?
Interesting.  There's a reasonable chance the Windows nightly build will work since it uses a different (static) build process.
@gauravkolekar Would you be ok to try it?  Download locations are on our front page, if that helps. :smile:
Awesome, definitely something unhappy with the .dll's then. :wink:
@Bailey26 Do you still need a solution for this?  If so, the nightly builds seem to work ok. :smile:
For example, using one dot isn't working here on OSX just now (using master branch):
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .
CMake Error: The source directory "/Users/jc/git_repos/sqlitebrowser/build" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.
Specify --help for usage, or press the help button on the CMake GUI.
$
```
But using two dots does:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..

The dots are the path to the CMakeLists.txt file, you might have done an in source build if you call cmake within the root directory.

@MKleusberg @rp- This looks good to me, are we ok to merge it? :smile:
Thanks
In the Browse Data tab, it would be useful to have a "Set as NULL" button next to the New Record and Delete Record button.
This new "Set as NULL" button would simply set whichever fields (including multiple) are presently selected to NULL.
At present it's possible to go into each individual field, double click on it to open the edit dialog, and set the field to NULL that way.  However, that's a real PITA when needing to set quite a lot of individual fields in a table (which aren't easily selectable via straight SQL).
Guessing this would be pretty easy to implement too. :smile:
I've added a keyboard shortcut for now (or actually two because the normal delete didn't work either). You can press delete now to set all selected cells to empty string and press Alt+Delete to set them to Null. No button yet because I wanted to hear whether people prefer a button here or a context menu. I feel like a button might be inconsistent when not adding a button for setting to empty string as well; and that's two buttons already for a feature I personally would be looking for in a context menu ;)
With the latest commit there's a new menu item "View->Edit Cell" which adds the Edit dialog to the main window area and keeps it opened. So that's a way to have the Clear Data button in the main window now :smile:
Cool.  Back home now, so I might get time to play with this later today.
With the keyboard shortcut approach, yeah that's probably good enough.  Hadn't thought of it when writing this Issue up, only thinking of "lets add a button". :wink:
Just tried this out with 3.8.0 (on OSX), and something doesn't seem right with the Alt-Delete approach for setting NULL.
When have multiple fields selected then press Alt-Delete, the values are cleared from the cells visually... but no "NULL" text appears in their place.
If I manually clear an individual cell through the "Edit data cell" dialog instead (eg binary mode → Clear → OK), then the cell value displayed as NULL.  So, at a guess either Alt-Delete isn't setting NULL properly, or it's not being displayed correctly afterwards.
As a side note, it would probably also be very useful to have Edit→Set NULL be an option from the main window menu too.  That way a person could select the multiple cells they want, and choose "Set NULL" from there instead.  It's shortcut key would be the Alt-Delete combo. :smile:
Closing this, as <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Delete</kbd> to set NULL definitely now works in recent nightly builds.  <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> (for the same effect) was added today too. :smile:
Hmm, I can't seem to reproduce this behaviour. So I think we have two options:
1) You could try the latest nightly build from here (https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser#windows). Maybe the new version already solves your problem.
2) If this doesn't work and there's no sensitive data inside your file you could mail us the file for further debugging. Also, if the issue remains after deleting some tables etc. (i.e. eliminating possible error sources) you can send us the smaller file.
@MrScorp Sorry for the delay.  Are you still needing assistance with this? :smile:
Closing this due to lack of feedback.
@MrScorp There's a pretty good chance this was fixed in our recent 3.8.0 release.  If you get a chance to try that and it still crashes for you, please feel welcome to either re-open this issue or create a new one (either is good). :smile:
There already should be an image viewer which gets opened when you double click the cell. We don't show the images in place because of performance reasons: checking if a cell value is an image we can open, then getting the dimensions, scaling it and rendering it in place is probably too costly for larger tables.
As for the crash: I think the application tries to open the image as a new database file. I fully agree her: This should be fixed as this behaviour makes no sense here at all.
Quick update regarding your main point, the image viewer. I've just pushed a new commit which you can try if you download tomorrow's nightly build. It adds a new option to the View menu called "Edit cell". If you enable this option the Edit dlalog which used to be opened by double clicking a cell is permanently opened and attached to the bottom of the main window (though it can be moved around). This way you can see a preview of at least the image stored in the current cell without extra clicks.
@tonypdmtr Do you have a few minutes to try this new code out, and let us know if the behaviour now is good from your point of view? :smile:
Makes sense. :smile:
@MKleusberg Thoughts? :wink:
Yep, makes sense. I've changed it to work better with the keyboard use case now. The focus stays on the table view where you can move the cursor using the arrow keys but the editor below is updated accordingly. And you can press Return or double click to move the focus down to the editor.
I haven't had the time yet to implement the drag and drop but it's definitely on my list :smile:
@tonypdmtr Just implemented the drag & drop functionality as well. So with the next nightly build you'll be able to drop image files onto a cell, too :smile:
Awesome Martin. :grinning:
@tonypdmtr Would you be ok to try the nightly build (tomorrow), and let us know what you reckon now? :smile:
Yep, that definitely sounds like a bug.  @MKleusberg ? :wink:
Noticed that yesterday, too, but didnt have the time to fix it :wink: But it should be fixed now (in the next nightly build).
Awesome. :grin:
@tonypdmtr You ok to test that too (tomorrow) and confirm back?
Yes, that's possible :smile: I've changed the code to update the editor even when being in a view. For everybody still using the old windowed mode without the dock it's now possible to open the editor window for views, too. Might be interesting when havin BLOBs or multi-line text in a cell. So (again :wink: ), the next nightly build should fix this issue.
You're quite a thorough tester by the way, @tonypdmtr :smile: Thank you for the time you're puttin into this! I'd be happy to hear about any other issues you stumble upon.
Awesome. :smile:  @tonypdmtr If you have time, please let us know if the new view display code bit Martin just added works well for you (tomorrow). :wink:
Fixed it :wink: Sorry for the all the delays but, again, it'll be in the next nightly build.
As for your P.S.
1. I think Ctrl+Z is difficult because I'd expect it to be an undo of the last action and not a revert of all my work. So, for reverting I'd prefer another shortcut, maybe more complicated to not press it accidentally.
2. This makes sense. And yet it looks strange for me when I change the fonts. Maybe it's just me because I got used to the fonts as they are, though... What do you think, @justinclift and others reading here? Make both fonts the same or both configurable? Currently the table grid font is configurable but the editor font is always set to Monospace.
Hmmmm, if it's not hard to do, make then both configurable? :smile:
@tonypdmtr Fixed that, too :wink: Thanks again for all your testing efforts!
Awesome. :grin:
Hmmm, we should probably close this issue, as it makes tracking things untidy having several bundled into one. :wink:
@tonypdmtr Can you try tomorrow's nightly build? I've added a new option to the View menu called "Edit cell" which basically takes the Edit dialog which used to be opened when double clicking a cell and turns it into a dock widget which is attached to the bottom of the main window. I hope this takes care of your issues :smile:
Yup, I somehow forgot the keyboard use case :wink: With the next nightly build you'll be able to navigate with the arrow keys and move the foucs down to the editor by pressing the Return key. It's still not perfect (for getting back to the table view you probably need the mouse) but I hope I'll be able to put some more time into this soon :smile:
In theory :smile: the two main things which can cause that error are either a file not really being in SQLite format, or not having write access to the file. That being said, theory doesn't always play ball. :wink:
Are you absolutely sure it's a SQLite format file?  Can you open the file with the SQLite cli?
Yep, that's a SQLite file then. :wink:
Ok, it looks like something unexpected is happening.  Out of curiosity, do you use Homebrew on your OSX box?  If so, would you be ok to try compiling our latest source code and see if that's work better?  We've fixed a large amount of bugs since the last release (and are very overdue for the next release).
It's very very easy to compile, if you're already using Homebrew.  You can literally cut-n-paste the instructions. :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
Yeah, I'm not sure which of those two options to try, as I've never hit the problem myself and don't really know what causes it.  So yeah, blow things away then try the other one I guess. :wink:
@textractor Did you get this working in the end? :smile:
Thanks Jacob, that's good info. :smile: Hmmm, I'm going to close this issue. It sounds like it probably something transient, and not really to do with DB4S (sqlitebrowser) itself.  @quantum-x Apologies, someone I missed this issue completely. :frowning:
```
... when trying to add / edit a column type, these types are not supported, even if I
type them in manually.
```
When you manually put in a data type, what happens?  I'm trying to understand the behaviour you're experiencing, that's lets you know it's unsupported.
(screenshots are really helpful, if that's workable :grin:)
Which extension did it save with?
@justinclift None, as far as I understood :frowning:
@cknystrom Which version are you using? Because the file extension ('.sqbpro') should be added automatically since version 3.4.0 which is from October 2014. Here's the commit where (hopefully) I've fixed your problem: 5d20d97e249a42d7dae1061d946c90c9c987d608
If you're using a version >= 3.4.0 we'll have to investigate further I'm afraid.
Closing this due to lack of response.
@cknystrom We've released a new version (3.8.0) just over a week ago.  That shouldn't have this problem.  If for some reason it does, you're welcome to reopen this issue so we can investigate. :smile:
Hmmm, that's not good.  I'm not sure how to diagnose this though.
@rp- @MKleusberg Any ideas?  Maybe we need to add some logging/checkpoint code so we can figure out where the problem lies?
I don't know what exactly it is, but it might be something like this described qt bugs:
https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-33119
https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-41416
Would either of you have time to try, and let us know if one of those approaches works for you? :smile:
Awesome!  Thanks for testing it and letting us know Michał. :grinning:
Interesting.  That's good info.  If you submit a PR, I can merge it. :smile:
Yep, it definitely builds with both (at least) Qt4.8 and Qt5.6.
My main dev desktop is OSX, and I'm compiling against Qt4.8 presently.  Was compiling (fine) against Qt 5.6 yesterday. :smile:
@peteristhegreat Any luck? :smile:
@peteristhegreat We're moving to be Qt5-only shortly, so I'm going to close this.  Qt4.6 is kinda not relevant to us any more. :smile:
@justinclift, Shouldn't we remove other checks for old Qt versions like [this](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/c5c8106c1caa204f1b897d589b3c9507e8e694bb/src/ColumnDisplayFormatDialog.cpp#L45), [this](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/c5c8106c1caa204f1b897d589b3c9507e8e694bb/src/ColumnDisplayFormatDialog.cpp#L57) and [this](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/f33a988530dae9bb6e6faa20b0d47c1c06c609c3/src/FilterLineEdit.cpp#L10)?
I don't think putting #ifdefs everywhere for compatibility with such _outdated_ Qt versions is of any good. This slows our dead Qt5 migration even more.
As a thought though, if there are version checks around code introducing recent Qt functions (maybe 5.6 onwards?), it's probably best to keep that around for a while.  Not every OS has the latest release of Qt in the 5.x series.
We should probably take a quick look around to see what's available in the major *nix distributions.  RHEL/CentOS and the Ubuntu LTS releases we should probably know about, as least so we can make an informed choice.
Sorry, I thought they were checking for Qt 4.5.*
No worries.  It's still a good point. :smile:
@depontius No worries.  When EL 6.9 is released there's roughly a 0% chance it'll come with a largely upgraded version of Qt.  Red Hat is pretty serious about not introducing major binary changes to their major releases, apart from stability and security fixes.  (I worked for Red Hat for a few years, so this isn't an unknown area to me. :wink:)
On a side note, we finished migrating our (DB Browser for SQLite) source code to need Qt 5.6 and above, a few months ago.  Technically, it can be made to work with Qt 5.5 (there's a patch we're discussing at the moment), but all things considered... Qt 5.7 is better anyway.  There are bugs in the earlier Qt 5.x releases which turn out to introduce some weirdness.  Not killer weirdness, just some graphical and speed-in-graphical-updates oddities.  Oh, that's not good. :frowning:
Is there any chance the program has already been uninstalled, and the listing for it is outdated?
Closing this due to lack of response.
Is this issue something that can be closed, or is there more we need to do? :smile:
Sounds like a good idea. :smile:
Thanks for the suggestion. Just implemented it, so it should be the next nightly build :wink:
@PKEv Do you have time to try out the next nightly build, and confirm back if it is/isn't working for you? :smile:
That's actually an old bug. So, nice catch, @PKEv :+1: Should be fixed by the latest commit.
Awesome.  @PKEv Do you have time to verify the fix is good from your point of view? :smile:
Thank you @PKEv. :smile:
Ouch, that's not good.  Which version are you using, and on which OS?
If you're on Windows, please try the latest nightly build.  There are a bunch of fixes it in. :smile:
(download locations are on the front page of this project repo, if that helps)
Thanks. :smile: That's the SQLite version number, not the version number for this software though. :wink:
Would you be ok to screenshot your Help → About dialog?  For example, this is mine:
![db4s about dialog 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/10558843/9099d8fc-74d6-11e5-9e61-74b5767f1230.png)
No problem.  Glad you got it working. :smile:
We have never released a version 3.8.10.2.  That's probably the SQLite version, not us. :wink:
You can check our version number in the About or Preferences dialog.  You should be using version 3.7.0, or a later nightly build.
Does that help? :smile:
Seems resolved, so closing this. :smile:
Looking back over this... we did some font handling improvements for our recent 3.8.0 release a week or so ago.  Is there any chance you could give that a shot and see if that's better? :smile:
Awesome!  Thanks @palmiche. :grin:
Oh, that's interesting.  We've done some font related adjustments in our latest development source.  Would you have time to compile it (very very easy if you use Homebrew!), and see if this was fixed on the way through?
Instructions for compiling on OSX using Homebrew:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
You can literally cut-n-paste those lines in, and out pops a working .app bundle. :wink:
Hmmm, I'm suspecting there's something not quite right in our latest development code.
Damn. :frowning:
@dannguyen In theory, this should be fixed.  Do you have a few moments to try the latest release (3.8.0) and let us know if that does or doesn't have the fonts working correctly for you? :smile:
They're interesting suggestions.  Would you be ok with putting them in a new issue, so we can track it?
If you're feeling lazy though, I can do it. :smile:
Hmmm, do we use qhexedit anywhere in our code?  If so, we're happy to add appropriate links/thanks/etc... :smile:
Asking this, because I don't **think** we do.  But I don't do coding in this project, so not familiar with the source so much... :wink:
k, we can add some "Links to friends and related projects" or similar.  Maybe in both README.md, and the About dialog?
Awesome stuff @PeterDaveHello, thank you! :smile:
This seems good to me.  Just merged it, so it gets into the nightly builds right away.  If problems show up they can be addressed later. :smile:
I've just tried to reproduce this with the database you've linked but I get to see all 134 records. This makes debugging way more difficult, so I'll need your support for this :smiley:
The first step would be to try the latest nightly build which you can download from here: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser#windows
If it still won't work with this version we'll need to further investigate. In this case I'd need you to provide some more information. Is the total number of rows shown correctly (arrow 2 in the screenshot)? Or is that one correct and the actual number of rows shown is wrong (arrow 1 in the screenshort)?
![4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/10289790/95b2c7a2-6ba0-11e5-8cb1-0b131f12b3c0.png)
No worries at all.  If it happens again, feel free to reopen this ticket. :smile:
Closing this, due to lack of information.
Good question.  I don't think there's a way yet, but it would make sense to add one. :smile:
No, there is no way to interrupt a query. And unfortunately it's not that easy to fix because of the way SQLite works. As far as I can see we'd have to put the query execution into a separate thread which we can kill from the UI thread at any time - but this requires too much code restructuring to have it happen soon. I'm also not sure if this can somehow cause data loss in the database, so I'm not sure if it's wise to add an easy option which might encourage users to cause unwanted damages.
So in short, I'm not sure on this. But let's keep the issue open as a reminder and maybe come back to it later :smiley:
Hmmmm, that's a situation I haven't hit before.  Looking at this page, it **kind of** says that doubling up the character might work:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#like
Maybe try using two underscore characters in a row to mean one literal one?  Note, I haven't tried this as I'm focused on some non DB4S stuff at the moment.
Sorry for the delay, I'm a bit short on time currently :frowning:
If it's exact matches you want (i.e. not use the LIKE operator with its escaping problems at all) you can start your query with a '=' character: '=exact_hit' only matches records which are equal to 'exact_hit' (case-sensitive and no wildcards).
If you need the features of the LIKE operator you'll have to wait for tomorrow's nightly build which includes escpaing of the wildcard characters in the filter queries. The default escape character will be the backslash, so 'exact_hit' will do the trick. If you prefer another character you'll be able to change it in the settings dialog.
Hope this helps :smiley:
Thanks Martin. :smile:
And yeah, I'm short on time for DB4S at the moment too. :frowning:
We released a new version (3.8.0) about a week ago, which includes the fix for this by @MKleusberg.  In theory it should be all good now.  Do you have a few moments to try it out and verify it from your point of view?
Closing this, as it "should be good".
Hmmm, trying to visualise that.  Would you be ok to add a screenshot in here? :smile:
Ahhh.  GitHub doesn't attach images sent via email.  You need to add them using the web based user interface. :frowning:
Sorry for the extra hassle. :innocent:
Thanks, that makes it clear.  @MKleusberg Is this your kind of thing to fix? :smile:
As a thought, what happens if you try the latest nightly build?  Does it work there? :smile:
Yeah, we haven't done't anything with the width of that drop down in the Browse Data tab yet.  But we did fix a bug related to character display, which is why I asked. :wink:
Your idea for adding an option to automatically open the last opened database sounds good.  Made a new Issue for it [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/479), so we can keep track of it.  (We like to keep each problem/enhancement/etc in it's own issue, for better tracking.) :grin:
You're welcome. Happy New Year to you too. :grin:
Hmmm, I think we've done some work with that already recently.  Which OS are you on?  If it's Windows, would you be ok to try the latest nightly build and see if that's better for you? :smile:
(download locations are listed on the front page of our repo, if that helps)
Sure, no worries at all. :smile:
I think what Justin remembered here is the new font size option which also affects the row height - one row is automatically resized to fit one line of text. Before just adding one more option I'd be curious to know what you want to achieve and if there's a way to avoid this option altogether. If there is a way to make it work out-of-the-box that's always better than making you reconfigure the whole thing, I think :smiley:
Makes sense.  @MKleusberg What do you reckon?  Do-able?
@bobatwhidbey, @vlakoff Can you try tomorrow's nightly build? I've tried adding some code in there that should help calculating a decent row height depending on the font size. Prior to this the default row height would be set by Qt to some value that might be platform dependent (= hard to predict). So maybe this already helps with your problem. If it doesn't can you include a screenshot of how it looks now vs. how you want it to look like? @vlakoff Awesome. :smile:
If so, and if you're still using Win32, the latest nightly builds are here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32/ The forward/backslashes thing has been around a while ... I raised it sometime ago! (#735).  Other operating systems (which the main programming dudes here use - Linux, OSX, chalkboards, etc) use forward slashes, so us Windows users have to suffer! ;)
As a workaround, if you're using Homebrew on OSX, compiling DB4S yourself is extremely easy and works:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
You can literally cut-n-paste those command lines in, and out will pop a .app you can run. :smile:
All is not lost though.  I've just gotten around to installing OSX 10.6.8 on our recently acquired Mac Mini.  I'll try creating a package for you on that shortly, and (likely tomorrow) see if we can get automatic nightly builds working for OSX 10.6 again. :smile:
Oops.  It's compiling Qt from source... that's going to take a few hours. :frowning:
I'll let it run overnight, and make a .app for you tomorrow instead.  Hope that's ok with you. :grinning:
It finished faster than expected.  Give this a go, and please let me know if it works ok for you:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/onceoffs/sqlitebrowser_201509260125.dmg
:smile:
Would you be ok to try compiling it yourself after all, and see if that .app also crashes?  That will help figure out where the crashing cause might lie.
Interesting.  So it's not something specific to the Mac Mini I was building stuff on then.  That's a relief (eg not a hardware problem).  I'll take a look into this further tomorrow.  I have some ideas of things I can look at first, to see if there's anything that jumps out at me. :smile:
@gtorges As a thought, @rp- fixed a crashing bug for the 3.8.0 release that sounded like it might be this one.  Do you have time to try compiling again, and see if things work for you now?
No worries.  :smile:
Grab our latest source code and try compiling it again:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
Remember to change to a directory with write access (eg not read only) before doing this. :smile:
It's a good idea (to get the latest version of sqlite), but it's not strictly necessary.  It's your choice, since your internet connection is being flaky. :wink:
Awesome!  You're welcome. :grin:
As a data point, I suspect the fix was this one [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/1c233de3b5166ecd9225d52f6985976f29a80729) (even though its title says it was for windows).  Thanks to @rp- for that. :smile:
@Z4us That's with the version you compiled yourself yeah?
Would you be ok to try compiling?  It should be very simple to do.  That's the theory anyway. :wink:
Oh, that's not good.  Which version are you running, and what OS is it on?
The other option would be to use another character like many text editors do when you "show hidden characters", that way we could show tabs and spaces as well
Yeah, "show hidden characters" sounds like a good idea. :smile:
As a data point, although not the same bug as #731, they're both semi-related.
I'm kind of unsure about this.  While that makes sense as a good default, what's a good approach for when someone needs there to be no '%' on the start or end?
A way to accomplish this isn't springing to mind at the moment. :frowning:
@tonypdmtr @justinclift I've just pushed a commit which adds the %% wildcards in filter queries. So this changes the default behaviour of our filters. Because I wanted to avoid yet another option in the preferences dialog or even the main window I've come up with the following solution to work around the problem mentioned by Justin: by default I add the %% wildcards making the _filter_ use more obvious. If you add your own % wildcards somewhere in the query I'll assume though that you know what you're doing and don't want us to mess up your query; so in this case we won't add any extra %% wildcards.
I hope this solution satifies everybody while keeping the UI simple and intuitive. What do you think?
@zwrmueller I've also implemented option 3 of your suggestion. I've set it to a timeout of 300ms but you can also hit Enter/Return or Tab for an immediate effect.
Both changes will be available in the next nightly build.
We'd also need to update our Wiki page on the filters. Any volunteers? @glawrence maybe? :smiley: But no worries if you don't have the time. Just wanted to drop this as a To Do somewhere.
Cool, good stuff @MKleusberg. :smile:
@tonypdmtr You can still type "=John". It's case-sensitive then but at least doesn't require an additional option. The reason I'm hesitating to add an extra option here is that the filters are meant to be a quick and easy search method which should "just work" for most people without having to think about it. We've implemented quite a complex rule system by now to achieve this (which still might be irritating sometimes) but adding an option would basically double the number of combinations.
As for the double '%%' thing: I think this shouldn't matter because either way '%' or '%%' the column is removed from the list of active filters by the statement a couple of lines further down. So as far as I see (though it's late alrady :wink: ) it should never reach SQLite or the user.
Are we ok to close the issue then? :smile:
Cool, closing this then :smile:
Definitely sounds like a bug.  You're using version 3.7.0 of DB4S yeah? :smile:
Btw - Your english is easy to understand.  No problems at all. :grin:
Hei Svein!
Thanks a lot for your report - we've always tried to keep the program UTF-8 only for simplicity but I understand your issue. Since it doesn't seem to difficult to add a function which should solve your problem  and which doesn't distract other users, I don't see any reason not to implement it :smiley:
Now, from the screenshot it looks like you're using MacOS X. Unfortunately our nightly builds currently aren't working for MacOS X but Justin (@justinclift) might be able to upload a build for you to test. For Windows (http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/) the nightly builds are running, though.
If you have a up-to-date build running you'll see a new option called 'Set encoding' added to the menu that appears when you right click the table header:
![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/9863501/f130e7e6-5b40-11e5-864a-ebe49e955c2c.png)
Click on it and you'll be asked to type in your encoding:
![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/9863511/092df69a-5b41-11e5-9f8d-add53821f737.png)
As soon as you click OK your new encoding will be applied:
![3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/9863520/18495156-5b41-11e5-904b-8537d21d5bf0.png)
A few more notes:
- This setting is per table. If you have multiple tables you'll need to change the encoding for all of them. You can change all your settings in a project file, however, so you'll only need to do this once.
- If you use the Execute SQL tab for quering or changing the database you'll still have encoding issues because this part of the application hasn't been changed.
- I've tested browsing, editing and using the filters. I think that's all there is but I might be missing something ;)
Let me know how this works for you!
Hi Svein!
Currently you can set it only for each table separately, so you'd have to change the encoding 120 times :frowning: But I've just added another menu option for changing the encoding of all tables. It's called 'Set encoding for all tables'. So with the next nightly build (tomorrow) you should be able to change the encoding for all tables at once. If you have multiple databases you'll still have to do this for each database, however. But I suppose this is do-able for two databases :smiley:
I hope this helps!
Sorry guys, I'm stuck on a Windows box for a few days. (groan)
@SveinBerger Do you use Homebrew on OSX?  If so, compiling our code is extremely simple.  You can cut-n-paste these commands to the command line, and out pops an .app you can run. :wink:
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
Awesome!  Great work @MKleusberg. :smile:
This might be a qt bug than, as the nightly builds use the old qt 4.8 and the release version are build on a windows machine using qt 5.4 or newer
I have this problem too on Mac OS X El Capitan.
Interesting.  @revolter Is this using version 3.8.0, and if so, is it one of the downloadable releases or was it compiled manually? :smile:
Asking because the downloadable releases for OSX (for 3.8.0) use Qt 5 instead of Qt4. (am actually considering going back to Qt4 for them :wink:)
Yes, 3.8.0, downloadable release with SQLCipher support. Is Qt 5 a beta release or something like that? I'm that kind of guy that likes to have the latest version to every thing and I find this possible downgrade to Qt 4 sad :( Or would it be temporarily until their bugs are fixed?
It was the first time I've built the release with Qt5. :wink:
We've had a few reports of bugs, that may or may not have anything to do with that bit (I'm not sure).  So I'm thinking of making a new release with Qt4 or something to see if that fixes the problem.
Actually, I should make the nightlies for OSX build with Qt4 again, and see if the problem disappears for people.  That would help figure things out. :smile:
Just tweaked the nightly build script for OSX.  It'll use Qt4 again from now on, until/if we change it back.  That should give us some more things to test, in order to figure out some of the reported OSX weirdness.
@xingped If you try our nightly build for Windows, does the problem go away? :smile:
Thanks for testing it @DelphiGit, that's useful info. :smile:
@DelphiGit Same thought with this.  Should it be closed now too?
Awesome, thanks. :smile:
That doesn't sound good.  Which OS are you using, and which version of DB4S?
Sorry for not looking into this properly yet. :frowning:
As a thought, we released a new version (3.8.0) just over a week ago, and it has a whole bunch of bug fixes in it.  I'm not sure if there's anything in there for transaction handling though, so I'm not sure if the behaviour you're reporting here is fixed or not.
Would you have a few minutes to try it out, and let us know? :smile:
Oh, that's not good.  Which version of DB4S are you using, and which OS are you on?
Can you maybe try the latest nightly build (see here: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser#windows) because we've made some changes in the meantime and at least for me your table statement gets parsed correctly :smiley:
As long as you're just inserting, updating, or deleting records there is no need to be concerned at all. This works just fine. You only get in trouble when editing the table using our Edit Table dialog. In this case the collation gets dropped. That issue is related to #741. I'll try to fix that, too, so there's no need to worry about collations here anymore :smiley: This should be working in the next nightly build. Do you have the time to check if it's fixing your problems, @mtissington, @slidertom and @chrisjlocke? You still can't edit collations in the Edit Table dialog but at least they shouldn't get lost when editing the table.  Not a bad idea. :smile:
Sorry for the extreme delay with this guys. 😦
This slowness in displaying blobs was only fixed recently (a few weeks ago).  The fix is in our recent "3.9.0 beta1" release (last weekend), and will be in the "3.9.0" proper release, which should be this weekend.
@MvGulik, the nightly build you grabbed um... yesterday has the fix in it too.  Just to double check, if that showing BLOB's decent quick now for you?
Closing this, as it's definitely fixed for everything except large size images.
Large images will likely be addressed in the next release anyway. :smile:
Are you able to share the database and slow query with us?  Emailing it to me directly (justin@postgresql.org) is workable, if that helps. :smile:
Received it.  Have now forwarded it onto @MKleusberg (CC-ing yourself), in the hope he has time to investigate. :smile:
Thanks for reminding me @sprintel and sorry for the delay! The main problem here is that we have to execute this query essentially twice. One time for getting the total row count like this:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (...);
```
And one time for actually getting the first block of data:
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE ... LIMIT 0,50000;
```
This explains why it's taking so much longer. The issue here is that we need to know the total row count before doing anything else to get the scrolling in the result view right. But this doesn't explain why it's taking 6 minutes for you. It should really "just" be 3 and a bit.
So out of curiosity, how long does it take on your system using the latest nightly build? Any improvement yet? If not, maybe we can provide you with a build that outputs some more debug information in order to find out where the extra time is coming from.
Another question would be if it might be a good idea to add a new option to the preferences dialog for disabling the ```COUNT(*)``` thing. The cost of this would be less information when browsing and very jumpy scrolling. @MKleusberg As a thought, if we add debugging output to the build maybe we should leave it in and have it toggled on/off by a command line switch or something? @MKleusberg As an "out there" idea, remember how we add a Qt regex function upon startup?  Don't suppose the presence of that might affect the communication path or something? @justinclift Nah, that only gets called when you're actually performing a regex operation, i.e. not when simply browsing a table. The problem seems to be that we're essentially performing each query twice.  Interesting question.  @MKleusberg, can it be done? :smile:
I think I need your help here...
It can be done and I've prepared a patch for this more than a week ago but it's still causing some trouble. I'm not sure what's going on there but I've just pushed it anyway. With the next nightly build there will bee an option for showing the rowid column if you right-click on the table header in the Browse Data tab. There you can click the new option to show the column.
That's the theory anyhow. On my system it simply doesn't work. There are two places where I have to decide whether to show the rowid column or hide it: when this new option is clicked and when changing the current table because in the latter case the previously set settings for the new table shall be loaded. Now, I've found a workaround to make it work when I click the new option but with this workaround enabled the latter case doesn't work. With the workaround disabled _only_ the latter case works (though you have to change the table twice before coming back to make this even weirder). This is especially troubling because it's the same code being executed, it's only called from different locations.
So this is where I need your help: I'm building this using Qt 5.4.2 (you can check this in the Help -> About menu). Assuming the Windows nightly build uses a different version I'd be interested to know how both described use-cases work for Windows users. The MacOS X nightlies still use Qt 4 as far as I know, so this would definitely be interesting to know. Maybe you can test this, @justinclift ? Currently the workaround is disabled by the way. If it works on e.g. MacOS with Qt4 I'll assume a Qt bug...
We're still waiting on @quaid for the Mac Mini build server, so we haven't had nightlies for quite some time now. :frowning:
But, I can do a compile test on my OSX desktop later on today. :smile:
```
~/Library/Preferences/com.sqlitebrowser.sqlitebrowser.plist
```
No guarantees, but it's worth a shot.  (back that up before deleting it, just in case :grin:)
I think the behaviour described by @chetan here is the same problem I was mentioning earlier. I finally got around to debug this properly and I've found my mistake. With the latest patch it's finally working now. So @chetan and @chinhodado can try the next nightly build to see if the new feature is properly working for them now. Let me know if there's still some problem left; and if it's working, too :wink:
Cool, thanks for letting us know. I'm glad I could help. :smile:
Cool. :smile:
Assuming you have a bunch of ram in your system, we've had reports of people using recent DB4S (the new name of SQLite Browser) on files of several GB's.
How big are the database file's you're thinking of using?
Guessing you've seen this already, but putting it here just in case it's helpful:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://sqlite.org/limits.html
In theory sqlitebrowser can open and handle all files you can open using the SQLite command line tool or any other application using the sqlite3 library (see Justin's link above for that). There are two things to consider, though:
- For browsing a table we have to issue two SQL statements instead of just one. This is because there doesn't seem to be a better way to tell the total amount of rows in a table, an information we need for the UI. Effectively this means these two statements are executed each time you open up the table browser, use the filters, change the sort order, etc. In the worst case this increases the loading time by quite a bit of time, though this should get better if your table has a primary key/unique index.
``` sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table;
SELECT * FROM table;
```
- The other thing is that while we do support loading the rows in chunks (you can set the size in the Preferences dialog), we don't unload them. This means that by simply scrolling down the table view more and more data is loaded into memory. But because no data is paged out again you could run out of memory (there's a slight overhead for the UI stuff, so it takes a little more memory than needed for the actual database content only). Changing the filters on a table purges this cache though, so working on a subset of the data should be a lot faster and more memory efficient.
But in the end, you'll probably have to simply try opening the files. It might take some seconds for something to happen but it'll still be faster than planning this out theoretically :smile: If you do, I'd be interested to hear your experiences.
@gbhiner1 Does that help enough? :smile:
Closing this, as it's not something we can do more with. :smile:
Unfortunately I can't reproduce this. Can you maybe provide some step by step instructions on how to trigger that error?
Sorry @rafalseamless, just noticed this (I'm focused on other stuff atm).  With GitHub, it drops attachments, so your attachment never made it to this issue.
If you want to email it to me (justin@postgresql.org), I can forward it to the other developers for investigation.
Good catch. :smile:
You actually can save the graph (if that's what you mean); just press the little button on the bottom right of the plot pane:
![5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/9479441/bd85c150-4b7d-11e5-8f82-e5b45a0f1c44.png)
Oh cool.  I didn't realise that. :wink:
@PKEv Does that help?
From what I read in a short google search key3.db is no sqlite database and there are other tools to recover or read the database.
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Password_Manager
Yeah, I think you need write access. From memory, SQLite itself makes some temporary files when it opens a database for any reason.
Not a bad suggestion.  It wouldn't hurt for us to detect this kind of error (if it's possible), and give a message about it.
The next nightly build will try to detect a read only database file as well as a read only parent directory. I don't show any message box in this case but only add a subtle note to the status bar of the main window. All the buttons for editing the database are disabled in this case, too. So unless you're typing in an SQL statement yourself you won't be able to trigger any errors :smiley:
Good thinking @MKleusberg. :smile:
@hurzl Have you had a chance to try the latest nightly build (or compile it yourself), to make 100% sure this is working well now from your point of view?
No worries.  Was just wondering if this had been tested/verified so we can close it.  Looks like I'll need to try it out later, and see how it goes. :smile:
@SharonD214 Hmmm, that's not good.  If you try with the latest nightly build (if you're on Windows), does it give a more informative error message or act like it's in read-only mode?
Closing this, as it was fixed ages ago. :smile:
@hurzl If for some reason this turns out to not work for you after all with our recent 3.8.0 release, please feel welcome to reopen this issue. :grin:
@MKleusberg Would you be ok to review this? :smile:
We still need someone to review this before we can merge it.  @rp- do you have the time?
Looks good for me and the renaming makes a lot of sense :smiley: There are two things though I'd like to point out:
1) There are two places where you execute COMMIT manually. The problem here is that this way the savepoint list doesn't get cleared. This will cause an error later when trying to revert to a savepoint which the application thinks exist but doesn't really. The other effect is that the database is still marked as dirty (see the `DBBrowserDB::getDirty()` method in file sqlitedb.cpp at line 81). This means the user thinks he still has the ability to save or revert when actually all the changes were already written to disk. So I think these two COMMIT calls should be replaced by releaseAllSavepoints(). We might want to run a COMMIT at the end of that function though, just to be safe.
2) Could you maybe squash those two commits into one so that we have a nice commit history? Like described here: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Merging-Commits)
Other than that this looks good to merge :smiley: Thanks a lot for your effort, @GeorgijK, and sorry for the late reply....
Just applied the changes myself because I think it's good to have this PR in there rather sooner than later :smiley: Thanks @GeorgijK for contributing them!
This should be fixed by the same patches used for dealing with issue #387 . This means I haven't disallowed the usage of backticks in column names but instead tried to fix the program when they are used. So in short, you're still allowed to use them but now the application will actually work fine even when they're used :smiley: At least I hope it does :smile:
If you want to test this you can download tomorrow's nightly build and have a try.
@PKEv That's a bit unclear to me.  Do you mean you have tested the latest build, and it's all working now?  eg Is this issue fixed now, so we can close it? :smile:
Thanks @PKEv. :smile:
When you say "assemble the project", are you meaning compile the project from source code?
If so, then yes.  There aren't good instructions written up for that yet though. :frowning:
I have some initial instructions which @schdub emailed us.  I can forward them on to you if you want to try them out.  Would that help? :smile: (my email address is justin@postgresql.org)
Did the emailed instructions help?
Yeah, I don't know either.  Maybe @MKleusberg could guess what might cause that?
Can't say without further information...
@PKEv There should be a filename and line number along with the error message. Can you provide that as well? Maybe the whole build output might contain some other valuable information, too.
@justinclift Can you mail me these build instructions, too? I don't think I have them here.
Sorry @PKEv, I completely forgot about this open issue. 😦
We've added very complete instructions for building on Windows, to the wiki:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S
Lots of screenshots, and plenty of details.  If you're still wanting to get this working, those instructions are known to be good. :smile:
Hmmm, by default it's set to automatically check (by reading this file: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/currentrelease on GitHub) if you're running the latest version.  You can turn that off in the preferences though, if that's what you want.
Lots of apps do this checking... so I'm kind of thinking it's not a bad thing.
Thinking this over more, it's not a bad idea to update the status bar when doing the check if there's a later version.  It might happen pretty quickly though (depending on speed of user's network to the GitHub server), so we might need to ensure it sticks around for at least some period of seconds (eg 5 seconds?) so it's not too easily missed. :smile:
I don't think so yet, but it's a decent idea if someone wants to pick up the task and write the code.
Are you any good with C++? :smile:
Cool. :smile:
Unfortunately this is going to be quite difficult :frowning: The reason for this is that we rely on the QCustomPlot library for plotting which itself only support 2D plots. So you're left with three options as far as I can tell:
- Finding a new open-source library to replace QCustomPlot and rewrite the sqlitebrowser to use that instead (I don't know of any such library...)
- Extending QCustomPlot and using the new features in sqlitebrowser (never looked into their source code, might be easy to to, might be next to impossible)
- Trying to fake it using colour gradients or what not (this might be interesting but probably will be very difficult to get right if it works at all)
Sorry for the delay, I was away for a few days. :wink:
Does this seem ok?  If so, we can add it to BUILDING.md. :smile:
### CentOS / Fedora Linux
**1**. Make sure the `qt-devel`, `ant-antlr`, and `antlr-C++` packages are installed.<br />
```
$ sudo yum install qt-devel ant-antlr antlr-C++
```
**2**. Download the DB Browser for SQLite source code.<br />
**3**. Open a terminal in the source code directory.<br />
**4**. Run these commands:<br />
``` bash
$ cmake . && make && sudo make install
```
**5**. This should complete without errors, and `sqlitebrowser` should now be launch-able from the command line.
Done. :)
Thanks Martin, just added them: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/8bfd2852ae4c39af7c095b39679da5d3dc7c1237 :smile:
Any interest in submitting a PR with the info update? :smile:
Awesome. :smile:
Hmmm, that doesn't sound good.  Do you have the (free) Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 installed, available [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784)?
Closing this due to lack of response.  We've also released a new version (3.8.0) about a week ago, which shouldn't have this crashing problem.
If this problem still keeps happening for you for some reason, you're welcome to re-open this issue so we can investigate. :smile:
Yeah, it's not good this is happening for some people.  It's also really hard to track down. 😦
Have you tried a recent nightly build instead?  They're generally more stable. :smile:
@mextedol If it helps, we have some steps shown here on ways to potentially track down the problem:
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/847#issuecomment-256713334
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/847#issuecomment-256763348
Are you ok to investigate using those?  Interesting thought.  I've noticed similar before too. :smile:
Personally I'm not sure what controls (by default) where new windows are positions, but at a guess we're probably not specifying any positioning options, and maybe we should be. :wink:
Personally, I don't experience this problem because on my (Linux) system the dialog is always centered above the main window. I've tried to implement the same behaviour for Windows now but can only assume it's working (because it looks the same as before to me). So with any luck this issue should be fixed for you in the next nightly build :smile: And please let me know if it doesn't work for you.
Yep it's good you mentioned it. :smile:
Yeah, start a new bug report :smile:
@DelphiGit Should this one be closed now that your fix for #633 is merged?
Closing this now, as @DelphiGit has fixed it in #633. :smile:
Hmmm... trying to imagine how that would work. :smile:
Are you ok to explain that in more detail, so we get a better understanding of what you mean?
Ahhh, you're meaning to just allow editing in the result widget yeah? Not meaning actually changing the database data when you edit the result?
Actually changing the database would be a part of this issue as far as I can see because @Volkanite mentions UPDATE statements (which would write to the database file).
This feature is definitely nice to have but unfortunately rather difficult to implement. The problem is that you can form quite complex SELECT statements for quering the database but you can't simply transform then into an UPDATE statement for modifying the database because SQLite doesn't support that complex UPDATE statements (no joins in them etc.). So we'd have to somehow transform the SELECT statement into an UPDATE statement by trying to interpret the SELECT statement and guessing which cell of the result view originates from which column of which table. We'd probably also have to modify each SELECT statement prior to execution to always include the primary key of each table (and then hide it in the view) because this is the only way I can think of which allows us to find out which row the edited cell belongs to.
So, in short, this is possible but would require a lot of work for parsing and understanding SELECT statements which we currently don't do at all. We could maybe try to support this for some SELECT statements and not all of them but it'd still require some effort :smiley: I'd suggest keeping this issue open but don't count on this being finished soon ;)
Good question. :smile:
SQLite can be compiled with plugins/extensions.  The plugin tab in the gui is a way to have them loaded, so you can use these extensions in your SQL queries.
Personally, I've not used them ever, but some of the other guys know more about it.
The best way to understand extensions is to not think of them extending our application (sqlitebrowser) but extending SQLite itself. SQLite extensions are just dynamic libraries (*.dll or *.so etc.) of a certain format which can be loaded by SQLite. After loading they provide additional functionality like extra SQL function (e.g. for doing maths or text operations) or collations (e.g. for special sort orders).
So, for example there is an extension for adding some functions for handling geo information. If you want to use these features for your database or if you want to open a database which was created using this extension, you have to load it too before proceeding.
But as long as you don't have a database which requires an extension to open (you usually get an error message when trying to open it) you probably won't need to load any extensions :smiley:
For some more technical background you can also have a look at this page: https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html
Seems sensible to me, though I'm not a coder on this project. :wink:
Any idea if it'll have any noticable performance impact?
Sounds good to me.  @rp- @MKleusberg Good to merge this? :smile:
Yep, looks good :)
Sounds like a bug, though I don't understand Russian personally so someone else will have to figure it out. :wink:
Thanks @GeorgijK.
@MKleusberg Any ideas?
I've looked into this and with any luck it should be fixed in the next nightly build :smiley: Let us know how if the fix works for you, @GeorgijK :smile:
Oops, I ment @PKEv of course. Let us know if the next nightly build fixes your problem, @PKEv :smiley:
@PKEv Do you have time to check the latest nightly build? :smile:
@PKEv Thanks for testing. :smile:
@MKleusberg Looks like we still have work to do. :frowning:
@PKEv Are you ok to test if the bug still occurs in the latest nightly build? To me it looks like it should be fixed by now :smile:
Awesome. :smile:
Oh, good catch.  Sounds like a bug. :smile:
Just tested this with version 3.8.0 in a Win 8.1 VM.  It's still occurring. :frowning:
Good news @PKEv, this has been fixed today by @schdub.
The fix will be in our new 3.9.1 release, which will be available later on today. :smile:
Should be do-able. :smile:
You already can press F5 for refreshing the view but I've just added Ctrl+R (or I guess Command-R on MacOS) as an extra shortcut. You can download tomorrow's nightly build to test it if you like :smiley:
The nightly builds aren't happening on OSX for now (waiting on the build box to be posted to me), so @kinghelix would have to compile it himself.
@kinghelix Compiling DB4S on OSX is really easy if you have Homebrew installed.  Is that your kind of thing? :smile:
@kinghelix Our nightly build for MacOS X are back up and running. So if you haven't had the chance to compile by yourself you should be able to test the change now :smile: Either way I'd be happy to hear about the results :smile:
@kinghelix Did you ever get around to trying this out?
Closing this due to lack of response. 😦
The fix was by @MKleusberg, not myself, but no worries.  Glad it's working better now. :smile:  Oh, that's interesting.  Sounds like our code for correctly escaping names isn't quite as good as it should be. :frowning:
@z-rui Martin has added an initial fix for this.  Would you be ok to test out our latest code, and let us know if it's working for you?
If you're using Windows, our latest nightly build has the code in it.  Download locations for the nightly builds are on our front page. :smile:
I've just pushed an additional commit which fixes some remaining issues with this (especially when quotes are used inside column names). The next nightly build hopefully works fine for you :smile:
Are we ok to close this issue? I'm pretty sure it's working now in the latest builds :smile:
Sure. :smile:
Oh, that's interesting.  I've just tried it on an OSX 10.7.5 VM here... and yeah, it's failing.
This is especially weird because it _should_ work.  The exact same system used for building version 3.6.0 was used to build version 3.7.0.  The only thing which should have changed on it, is having Apple supplied OS updates applied between the releases.
I don't have access to that particular system for a few more weeks though (could be up to 6 weeks), so its not really possible for me to diagnose fully at the moment. :frowning:
Let me see if I can compile a fresh version of our code in my 10.7.5 VM.  If that works, I'll make a one-off v3.7.0+ .dmg for you for now (eg 3.7.0 + our patches since). :smile:
Hmmmm, it looks like compiling Qt is going to run overnight. :frowning:
@stuartE9 Try this, it's our very latest code compiled for OSX 10.7.5:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/onceoffs/sqlitebrowser-3.7_dev-201507191105.dmg
Damn.  This exact download worked on my 10.7.5 VM.  I think the problem is that my VM here has too new of a cpu compared to yours. :frowning:
Ok, lets get a bit creative instead. :wink: Do you have OSX Homebrew installed?
Yeah, try and get Homebrew working.  If you can do that, then getting DB4S installed is pretty easy. :smile:
Awesome, from here on it should be easy.  Follow these instructions, and you should be all good:
&nbsp; nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#building-an-app-bundle
Literally, you should be able to cut and paste these (do it a line at a time):
```
$ brew install sqlite --with-functions --without-readline
$ brew install qt
$ brew link sqlite3 --force
$ brew install git
$ git clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.git
$ cd sqlitebrowser
$ qmake
$ make
$ brew unlink sqlite3
$ mv src/sqlitebrowser.app /Applications/
```
For me, the install of Qt (brew install git) took all night because it had to compile the whole thing.  You might want to kick that off before you hit the sack tonight or something. :wink:
Cool, good stuff Stu.  If Homebrew works on 10.5.8, would you be ok to see if compiling works on that?  If it does, we can adjust our README.md to mention 10.5 is known to work too. :smile:
No worries.  It was a thought... :smile:
I'll try to get it running in a VM later on today, verify this, then merge it. :smile:
(Sorry for the delay btw, have been unwell for a few days)
Yep, working well here on OSX 10.10.  The existing codebase (without this patch) barfs.
Thanks @jehoffmann! :grinning:
No worries. :smile:
Sorry, I'm a bit in a hurry right now but I've just pushed a commit for each of your issues. I'm quite confident this one will be fixed in the next nightly build :smiley: The code for #380 has been changed as well, but we'll have to see how it works for you.
Thanks. :smile:
Seems like an interesting idea.  I'm not sure how feasible it is though... one of the others - who knows Qt - will have to chime in. :smile:
I've added a new option to the Preferences dialog which, when activated, puts the result table view to the right side of the code editor. The success/error messages are still shown at the bottom, though, which looks a bit more aesthetic in my point of view. I've also (re-)introduced the possibility to resize the two panes.
If you want to check out the new feature, you'll have to wait for tomorrow's nightly build, download & install it and then click View -> Preferences, select the "SQL" tab and check the "Horizontal tiling" option at the bottom. Hope this helps :smile:
@MKleusberg You're a legend dude. :grin:
@pamtbaau Are you ok to try the nightly build (tomorrow), to see if the latest commits from @MKleusberg makes it better?
Cool! I'm glad I could help :smiley: And thanks a lot for the feedback!
The query gets repeated since the first version I've ever used, long before I've started helping out in development. So to be honest I've no idea why it was added to the message string. However, with the more recent version (3.0+) it kind of makes sense to repeat it because these versions allow you to execute multiple queries at once. Now, assuming you get an error or some query results, it might be unclear from which query they originate. This is at least why _I_ think it serves some purpose to have them in there.
Makes sense, and is probably quick/easy to implement. :smile:
I've just updated the code to check if a file still exists before adding it to the menu. There is no new menu option for it though, because I think it's not as important to most users to warrant the extra option. It's automatically executed whenever the menu is updated, i.e. upon start-up and when opening a file.
If you don't want to wait for the next release, you can download the nightly build and test the new feature :smile:
Awesome. :smile:
@finjulhich Do you have time to try out the latest nightly build (tomorrow), and let us know if the new code is working well from your point of view?  (the download locations are on our front page, if that helps)
@finjulhich Never heard back from you.  Any chance you can try the latest build (or even a nightly) and let us know if this is properly addressed for you?
Aaaarrrghh.  I forgot to email John, to let him know about the new release.  Just emailed him now.
Thanks for the reminder @divinity76. :smile:
It's available now:
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/v3.7.0/SQLiteDatabaseBrowserPortable_3.7.0_English.paf.exe
That makes sense. :smile:
Just pushed a commit for this, so it should be in the next nightly build :smiley:
@revolter Would you be ok to try our nightly build, and verify this is working for you now? :smile:
Hmmm, that's a bit vague.  The download locations for our nightly builds are on the front page of our project (this repo).  In theory, for OSX the nightly builds here should work for you:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/nightly/
Note - Someone mentioned not long ago they've stopped working for older OSX (10.6?) versions.  I haven't been able to investigate though (no access to that OSX build box) for probably another 6 weeks or so.  Still, since you're on new OSX, it's worth trying. :smile:
You're welcome. :smile:
Um... would you be ok to create a new issue for that?  It's better for us tracking-wise. :grin:
Oh, sorry!
No worries at all.  Thanks for getting making it happen. :smile:
Which OS are you using, and which version of DB4S? :smile:
@justinclift I don't think we have any real influence on this since it is a Qt thing. But I've just seen that we're still using Qt 4.8.7 for the Mac OS build. So I'm wondering if it's much work for you to change the build process to use Qt5 which brings a load of new features and bug fixes. This issue might be fixed this way. Maybe the open file dialog file name selector thing as well.
@MKleusberg Good idea.  I don't have access to the OSX build box for about another 6 weeks or so (needs to be packed up and posted to me), but I can definitely look into this once I get it. :smile:
Cool, sounds like a plan. :smile:
Oh, interesting.  Looks like we need to add a few more preference options for font colour.
@voidplayer, we've added extra color setting for displaying data in 'Browse Data'.
If it isn't to hard for you, please, test this feature.
@schdub Sounds like we have more work to do for this. :wink:
This sounds like it could be useful for people.  To clarify your suggestion, where are you wanting hex numbers to be displayed?  In the Browse Data tab, or in the Execute SQL tab, or somewhere else?
Also are you thinking it would be best as an option that can be turned on in the Preferences dialog, or something else? :smile:
Does that sound like the best approach?
If I may make this even more complex: I'd suggest making this a fully flexible thing. For a previous project some years ago I had to use Qt's Julian day date format (which works similar to Unix epoch), this made the date values as they are stored in the database really difficult to read and even more so to edit. So maybe we should add some option to specify short SQL fragments (or some other code) which convert between stored data format and display format - ideally in both directions.
@MKleusberg Interesting thought.  Maybe we should have a right click thing that lets people choose from various display options (binary, octal, decimal, hex?), but also allows defining custom ones too using (say) [QString string formatting](http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qstring.html#arg).  eg:
| Name | String |
| --- | --- |
| Decimal | "%d" |
That being said, it would be useful to have time/date elements available too (eg %Y for Year, %m for month, etc as per the CLI date command), and I'm not sure how to do that without over engineering things. :wink:
I've just made an initial effort in implementing this kind of thing. Here's how it's supposed to be used:
1. Right click the header of a column in the Browse Data tab and click the menu action
![df1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/8528001/68968948-2410-11e5-89ba-ed307acc141e.png)
2. Select an alternative display format from the list of available formats, e.g. all upper case
![df2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/8528016/852f5ec2-2410-11e5-8b8d-306a0dcb1e97.png)
3. Now the values of the column are shown in the new format (while still being saved in the old one)
![df3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/8528029/9d265cce-2410-11e5-910d-4c80402ad8bd.png)
This is far from being finished but should demonstrate how this feature may look like eventually. Hex numbers aren't supported yet by the way, because there's no SQLite function for converting between decimal and hex format. That means we'll have to implement a user function for conversion of this kind and the ones that Justin suggested.
Duh, I'm stupid. There _is_ a built-in way in SQLite to convert numbers to a hex representation. It's even a fairly obvious one... Just added an option for setting the display format to hex :smiley:
Awesome. :smile:
Yes, I have :smiley:
There are still a few problems though, most notably filters and editing isn't working as expected.
Well, we have a few weeks until the next release.  (I don't get my hands on our OSX build box for 6 weeks anyway). :wink:
@jflucc Do you have time to try the nightly build and let us know if this is working well enough for you now? (if it helps, download locations are listed on the front page for this project)
Already did that :wink:
But I've just added the '0x...' part like @jflucc suggested :smile:
Excellent! @jflucc Would you have a few minutes to try the next nightly build (tomorrow), and let us know if that change is working ok? :smile:
Do you have a name + email address we can use for the commit message? :smile:
No worries, I'll use a placeholder example.org address or something for that field. :wink:
Added here: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/21c708ab95b64d736764193cba399dbf9afb2262
And yeah... there's no "decimal" format option in the list (yet).  Hmmm, want to attempt adding one? :smile: (I would, but my headspace is in something else completely different at the moment. 😇 )
Interesting.  Is this stopping you from loading your database?
Also, which operating system are you using, and which version of DB4S are you using? :smile:
Hmmm, I think this is related to https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/54#issuecomment-49079283.
It sounds like we need to do something better, but it's not clear to me exactly what that is just yet. :frowning:
I believe we need a similar implementation of Android custom SQLite collation functions LOCALIZED and PHONEBOOK. When opening table with these collations we must ask user to enter locale.
@MKleusberg, @rp-, we have ICU library in dependencies (I think I saw them DLLs in our Windows build)? Somebody trying to solve the recent issues with collations? If not, I can try.
@schdub Go for it. :smile:
Also, is there any way you could screenshot it?  It might be helpful. :smile:
Is set default value in table schema for field 'locale'? Something like:
```
CREATE TABLE `android_metadata` (
`locale`    TEXT DEFAULT 'en-US'
);
```
(download locations are listed on the front page of this project, if that helps)
Awesome!  Good work @schdub. :smile:
@yaronbank do you click 'yes'? Try to click 'no' while loading database.
When you click 'yes' every collation works as BINARY collation and only for 8-bit encoding.
This sounded a bit familiar, so I went looking back through the old issues.  I think the warning message you're seeing was added for https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/54.
1) no need to register our collating function for standard collations like BINARY, NOCASE, RTRIM;
2) 16-bit encoding version of collCompare() function (sqlitedb.cpp).
@yaronbank, in your case safely select 'No'.
That all makes sense. :smile:
@schdub has added a fix for this bug to our code.  Would you have time to try our nightly build (tomorrow), to verify that works?  (if so, the download locations are on the front page of our repo)
Thanks for letting us know, good news and nice work
Thanks @SevenLines, that's excellent. :grinning:
I'm just going to merge this and hope for the best.  If it breaks things for people, I'm sure someone will file an issue. :smile:
Should be fine. I still think there's some bug in QScintilla because I see no other reasons why the middle part of the first line in the first picture of the original issue is highlighted differently. But at least we're now working successfully around it :smiley:
![screen shot 2015-06-22 at 14 33 03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/8283016/662f63a2-18ec-11e5-88dd-8d6eb36ebc76.png)
I think you are correct.  The grey text in the screenshot below is not the same size as the other text, and it should be: :frowning:
![screen shot 2015-06-22 at 14 33 06](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/8282956/02df9a38-18ec-11e5-88b5-20f7bb26389a.png)
Just for reference: The Qscintilla source code including the example application can be found here: http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/qscintilla/download
I've modified the QScintilla-gpl-2.9/example-Qt4Qt5/mainwindow.cpp file to enable UTF-8, include the lexer and use syntax highlighting; here's the new code: https://gist.github.com/MKleusberg/ceb2cf5f5ec84734b061
@MKleusberg Would you be ok to ask on the QScintilla mailing list about it?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/mailman/listinfo/qscintilla
So... what needs to happen next? :smile:
Want to make that a Pull Request? :smile:
Closing this, as @SevenLines fixed it in #365. :smile:
I guess you have data in table FileInfo and other table references (FK) primary key _ID.
In SQLite you can rename/delete field in existing table with algorithm something like:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/805363/how-do-i-rename-a-column-in-a-sqlite-database-table
I note separately: need to drop old table. Our application works in a similar way when renaming fields.
When application try to delete old table FileInfo it causes foreign constraint failed.
For example what going wrong:
```
-- 1) create two referenced tables
create table table1 (`_ID` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, `data` BLOB DEFAULT NULL);
create table table2 (`TABLE1$ID` INTEGER REFERENCES  table1(`_ID`));
-- 2) and add some data
insert into table1(`_ID`) values(1);
-- table2 references table1
insert into table2(`TABLE1$ID`) values(1);
-- 3) now try to remove field data in table1.
--    its failed because FK constraint while deleting old table1
-- 4) disable FK constraint (better use 'edit pragmas' and hit Save).
-- 5) now try step 3 again - and its succeeded.
```
WARNING: before do same thing on your db, backup first.
About 'string can not be logged, contains binary data' it was bug while logging
user input in multiline queries. But it already fixed recently.
@dbreslau Out of curiosity, apart from the "string can not be logged, contains binary data" (that should be fixed in our latest nightly builds), what would clearer messages/logs look like?  It's something we could consider. :smile:
@schdub Should we add some database calls to our Modify Table code, so it disables and re-enables the primary keys when renaming tables?  I'm guessing it might help in some situations, and we could still Rollback if an error is detected. (?)
Good thinking, both of those ideas make sense.  I'm personally not sure of their feasibility, but others will know more. :wink:
@dbreslau absoulutly agree that this error message should be more informative in this case.
@justinclift I have a look what I can do.
@schdub Excellent. :smile:
Should be fixed with #363.
Same issue: #329.
Error message will be something like:
![screenshot from 2015-06-20 225657](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1304776/8269139/cc38bfc4-17a5-11e5-95cd-f8b098dfbe21.png)
I think we should to create wiki page what should to do in case such error message (my first post in this thread about pragma foreign_key).
Excellent stuff @schdub. :grin:
@dbreslau Would you have time to grab our latest nightly build, and verify that it's working properly for you?  (95% chance it will, but it's always good to check just in case :wink:)
I've just pushed a small commit series which still needs more testing but in theory should improve the application's behaviour in two ways:
- If you try to change a column name of a column which is referenced in a foreign key this is impossible. Instead of just failing we'll now print an error message, explaining the problem.
- If you try to change a column in a table which is referenced in some foreign key, but it's another column that's being referenced, the application used to fail because of the way the renaming process was done. This is fixed now, so editing these columns should be possible now :smiley:
Awesome as well @MKleusberg.  Good team effort here. :grin:
@dbreslau Is the latest nightly build working for you? If so, we can close this issue :smile:
No worries.  I'll close this issue for now, but if you find it is still occurring please reopen it and let us know. :smile:
Interesting.  Just to check (to be safe)... you're using the 32-bit download, not the 64-bit one yeah? :wink:
If so, would you be ok to screenshot the error message and paste it into this issue?  It would be useful to know what the full error message is regarding Qt5Core.dll. :smile:
Interesting.  Have you tried older versions of our application?  (I'm wondering if the problem started with release 3.7.0, or if it's existed for older versions too).
If you just need "something to work", then try the latest nightly build here (uncompress it with [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org)):
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
That uses our old Windows build process, which is likely to avoid the problem you're hitting.
Cool. :smile:
Both 3.5.1 and our nightly Windows builds use a "static build" process.  The nightly build one should be better for you, since it's like 3.5.1 + lots of bug fixes. :grinning:
@justinclift do you think this means we still have Windows deploy/install issues?
@glawrence It's possible.  It could be a once-off too, but it's hard to tell.  The error message in the screenshot above didn't really show any smoking gun. :frowning:
I guess we'll just need to wait and see... :wink:
if this is the only case of such a problem, I would guess there is a problem with the users machine, but its not really possible to tell from the screenshots, maybe some wrong .dll gets loaded.
Which operating system, and which version of DB4S is this happening with? :smile:
Just testes it and It seems to work for me... The default filter behaviour is to only search for exact matches, so you probably need to put '%' characters around your search term but then it should work even for characters in a different form when they are connected:
Cool! Glad this works :smiley: By the way, if you want to read about the fancier filter operations, we have prepared a wiki page explaining them: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Using-the-Filters
When you say the only extension options are "HTML, PDF, JSON, SQL or XML", where are you seeing that?
In theory, you should be able to open the .db file directly in DB4S, then save back to it directly.  (does that help? :smile:)
Ahhhh, the screenshot you're showing is for SQLiteStudio, which is not us.  These are the people you want to ask questions about it: :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://sqlitestudio.pl/
"DB4S" is the acronym we use for our software - DB Browser for SQLite - as it's a pita to type out the full name each time. :wink:
Hi @idomintz12 if you want to try DB4S then I suggest you go to http://sqlitebrowser.org/ and download the installer. There is a nightly build but I would recommend starting with the 3.7.0 release which was done a few days ago. Alternatively go to https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases and download from there, same files just a different view.
Yeah.  Try this installer, as it's very likely to work for you:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/v3.7.0/sqlitebrowser-3.7.0-win32.exe
Interesting.  Do you know if the iOS app uses SQLCipher to do the encryption?
If it definitely does, then it's probably something to do with needing to figure out the matching page size.  If the page size doesn't match when opening the database, DB4S doesn't get a valid database to use so keeps prompting. (or it could be a bug in our SQLCipher handing or similar, which we'll need to investigate)
Ahhh, this shouldn't be too hard to figure out then. :smile:
What you should probably do is jump on the SQLCipher forum here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://discuss.zetetic.net/c/sqlcipher
Ask what the default page size would be when using their instructions.
The SQLCipher people are pretty responsive + helpful (we've asked questions there too :wink:), so it's very likely they'll get you up and running. :smile:
Hmmm, just noticed there's a newer version of SQLCipher out than what we included with our OSX builds.  Not sure if that's the cause of the problem, but it's worth keeping in mind.
I'll look into getting the newer SQLCipher release into OSX Homebrew, so we can use it in our nightly builds and future releases.
For reference, this is the PR for updating SQLCipher to v3.3.0 in OSX Homebrew: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/40841
@MaxPower9 Looking through this, the default page size seems to be 1024:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://discuss.zetetic.net/t/sqlcipher-support-added-to-db-browser-for-sqlite/243/11
If you're trying that and it isn't working... then lets see what happens with a version of DB4S using the latest SQLCipher (building one now).
This might help:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/onceoffs/sqlitebrowser-sqlcipher_201506172157.dmg
It's a build using our very latest code base, plus with SQLCipher 3.3.0.
You're welcome.  Glad it was a fairly easy fix (not everything is). :wink:
Ahhh, this sounds like the problem that happens when going from a 32-bit to 64-bit install.
Does the fix here work for you?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Windows-File-Associations
@LLambertRGi we're always happy to help! Thanks for using DB4S.
Interesting.  Changing field names works on other OS's, so it sounds like a bug affecting just the build you're using atm.
Did you compile DB4S yourself, or is there a repo you grabbed a prebuilt version from or ?
@justinclift I grabbed the very latest from GitHub and built this on my CentOS 7 VM so I could try this out. I did the following:
- create a new database
- create a new table
- click Add Field button
![stage_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1067355/8144735/c86925d6-11e3-11e5-9947-0bd689e16576.png)
- double-click the field name to edit [note cursor at end]
![stage_2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1067355/8144739/e2850b38-11e3-11e5-8566-a63066255f60.png)
![stage_3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1067355/8144743/f944b27e-11e3-11e5-85ca-1f203ace3bf7.png)
- press "Enter" and everything is fine
![stage_4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1067355/8144744/034175b4-11e4-11e5-8be4-2828aac8bbec.png)
So this would seem to be a draw/paint type bug that needs fixing, functionally DB4S works we just need to fix the UI so it is more obvious it is working.
Hope you like my screenshots, I think they help!
@glawrence Well done.  It seems like bug in maybe the Qt toolkit build on CentOS 7.x then.
Do you have the rpm versions handy?  We can ping the CentOS guys (on IRC and/or mailing list) to see if anyone is already aware of it.  If not, we can file a bug so it can be looked into. :smile:

Does that help? Not sure it is quite what you asked for but "feels" right.
Yep, that's what I asked for.  I'll ping the CentOS guys in a bit, to see if it's a known issue. :smile:
Great, thanks
Oops.  The first email I sent them, I did from the wrong email address and it never got through.  I've just emailed them from the correct email address, and it's on the centos-devel mailing list now:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-devel/2015-June/013551.html
Lets see if someone there has ideas...
@Sanpasqual123 @glawrence Looking back over some of our older issues which we've not followed up on... do either of you have a machine or VM handy you could test this on again with the later code?  Both us and Qt have had new releases since this was reported last year, so it's worth checking. :smile:
Any updates on this? From what I can tell this was tested using Qt4 and as it might be a Qt thing, it might be worth checking this out with Qt5. Closing this due to lack of response.  It's pretty likely (but not guaranteed) to not be a problem with our upcoming release due to Qt5.
If it does still happen, this issue is welcome to be reopened. :smile:  Interesting find. :wink:
@MKleusberg, any ideas?  As a thought, the StackOverflow link above helps frame it a bit better too.
This commit should fix your problem, effectively a NULL value is now treated as an empty string. Not sure, which operating system you're running but if it's MacOS or Windows you can wait for tomorrow's nightly build and see if the new code works better for you. The download links are on the main page of our repository.
Are we ok to close this issue? It's been some time since we fixed it and I'm pretty confident it's working as it should be now.
No worries.  Closing it. :smile:
Would you be ok to try out the latest nightly build? (download locations are listed on the front page of our repo)
To me, this sounds like a duplicate of a bug fixed yesterday: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/349.
If you try the latest nightly, and it still happens though... it's a new bug we need to look at. :wink:
You're welcome.  Thanks for taking the time to write up a bug report.  Without bug reports stuff just wouldn't get fixed. :wink:
Should be fixed in #350
@ant-on-io Would you be ok to try the latest nightly build (tomorrow), and verify back to us if it works or not? (just in case) :wink:
Awesome!  Thanks for testing and letting us know Anton. :smile:
(download locations are shown on the front page of this repo, if that helps)
Closing this, as we don't seem to be getting a response + the issue is already fixed in our codebase. :smile:
select \* from table_mst where names=??????  here my query showing question mark.On mac pc
Would you be ok to try our latest nightly build (download locations are on the front page of our repo)?
If the latest nightly build still doesn't work though... that's a new bug we should look into. :smile:
You're welcome. :smile:
Interesting thought.  It might also be useful to automate testing of GUI components in future too (though I suspect there are already Qt tools for that).
Download locations for our nightly builds are on the front page of our repo, if that helps. :wink:
I fixed the build process and did a fresh build
Awesome. :smile:
Thanks for the bug report. :smile:
We switched to a new build process for the Windows executables with the 3.6.x release, and we're still working out the kinks. :innocent:
The next release (3.7.0, soon) should automatically install that dependency.  Hopefully that works out in practise for everyone, but we'll see... :smile:
Thanks Eva.  Would you be ok to try our latest nightly build?  We've done some stuff with BLOB handing in the last few weeks, and there's a chance this has changed.  Would be good to know if it's something we still need to investigate or not. :smile:
(the download locations for our latest nightly builds are on the front page of this repo, if that helps)
Awesome! :grin:
What would you like it to do instead? :smile:
Personally, I don't experience this problem because on my (Linux) system the dialog is always centered above the main window. I've tried to implement the same behaviour for Windows now but can only assume it's working (because it looks the same as before to me). So with any luck this issue should be fixed for you in the next nightly build :smile: And please let me know if it doesn't work for you.
@DelphiGit did it for #633 (thanks!), so closing this now. :smile:
From a recently created ticket on the old SourceForge project page:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://sourceforge.net/p/sqlitebrowser/feature-requests/41/
```
Hello
please add a feature to show as well ciphertext in .dbs as plaintext.
e.g. the app web browser dooble.sf.net has all data stored encrypted, e.g. the file
shared.db (path in settings), which is filled with an url in case you press the first
button of the url bar. Also the app Spot-on.sf.net creates an url.db which can be filled
with an import from that share.db. It would be great, if the crypto credentials of this
crypto used in the browser and url search tool is implemented over a path to
dooble.ini or spot-on.ini so that the DBs can be shown in plaintext in your browser.
Thanks.
```
Yeah, I'm not totally sure.  I was hoping the reporter would jump in here.  Looks like not though... :frowning:
I'm going to close this, as there's not a lot we can do with it as-is.
Ahhh interesting.  I don't have a HiDPI display to test it on, but one of the other guys might (unsure).
Interesting idea.  Hadn't heard of the Windows Simulator, but doing some DuckDuckGo-ing shows it might do the trick. :smile:
The next Qt version will have improved High DPI support across different platform: http://blog.qt.io/blog/2015/12/18/qt-5-6-beta-released/
Maybe that will help, too?
@Rockvole Ahh, would you be ok to try a recent release?
The version you're using, 2.0.0-beta1, is literally about 10 years old.  We've made a few changes since then, including adding some support for High DPI & Retina (on OSX) displays.
If you need to compile things yourself, it's pretty easy.  There are cut-n-paste type of instructions here, if that's useful:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md
Does that help? :smile:
No worries at all.  For the Linux Mint repo version... yeah, I'm not sure why it's so old.  Hopefully someone out there (not me) has time/interest to look into it, and get that fixed. :smile:
Which version of DB4S are you using, and is it 32 or 64 bit?
@glawrence Do you have a Win8 VM handy you can try it out on?
When it stops working, does an error message get shown or something, or does the program just exit or ?
Thanks, that's helpful.  If you click Debug, what gets shown?  I'm hoping it'll have further information, to help us figure out what's going wrong. :smile:
@pbaker1977, do you open same database file on Win8 and Win7?
DB4S is 64 bit?
"0xC0000374: A heap has been corrupted" - it's really bad.
@pbaker1977 Yeah, as @schdub mentions... are you using the 32-bit or 64-bit version of DB4S?
With our recent 3.6.0 release, it's the first time we've had both 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Windows available.  Thinking maybe you might have the wrong one. (and kind of hoping it's that easy! :wink:)
Interesting.  It sounds like one of the 64-bit libraries installed on your system isn't happy.
If the 32-bit version works well for you, keep on using that. :smile:  If you need to use large databases though (eg 1GB+), you'll probably need the 64-bit version and we'll need to figure out what's wrong.
Oh, that doesn't sound good.  Which OS are you using, and which version of DB4S?
@ccw808, do you mean "Run DB Browser for SQLite" checkbox on "Complete DB Browser for SQLite Setup" page?
I think it is standard behaviour when you run the application from the NSIS installer.
New process inherits permissions from the parent process - in this case installer, which was elevated using Windows UAC.
Possible solution: get rid ability to run the app from installer.
Ahhh, that sounds like it might do the trick.  @rp- Sounds like an easy fix?
It would probably an easy fix if we had a standalon NSIS script, but our script is generated by CMAKE/CPACK and there are some settings and variables that can be tuned, but I didn't have time to look at them.
Posted this in #974, so a bit of cross-posting.... ;)
This might help.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16555625/how-to-launch-an-executable-on-the-end-of-installation-correctly
> Use `Exec '"$WINDIR\explorer.exe" "$TEMP\MyUnElevatedProcess.exe"'` In theory :wink:, that last commit should mean the installer launches DB4S in user mode, not admin mode.
In testing here in a local VM it seems to work ok, but it'd be useful to have other people test and confirm it before I'm confident about it.
@ccw808 @chrisjlocke Would either of you have the time/interest in trying tomorrow's nightly build (3rd May or later) to check? Will do.  😸  Now works fine.   🥇  Thanks @chrisjlocke, really appreciate you taking the time for this. :smile:  Which operating system are you using, and which version of DB4S? :smile:
@tbayart Out of curiosity, have you had a chance to try this with our recent 3.7.0 release?  I'm kind of wondering if this might have been fixed when we adjusted some of our other Unicode handling bits for the Execute SQL tab. :smile:
@MKleusberg, you began work on this task? Do you mind if I try to solve it?
I can reproduce this bug if query contains '\t' characters for example.
@tbayart A potential fix for this has just been added by @schdub.  Would you be ok to try the nightly build (tomorrow), and verify if it's working properly for you now? :smile:
@glawrence Let's wait for confirmation by the issue reporter that things are fixed before we close the issue.  90% of the time things work as intended, but there are the occasional times they don't, so we try to catch them up front. :wink:
@justinclift oh I agree, it is much better to get confirmation first
@tbayart about empty lines. This behaviour was previously. You don't see it under Windows because on windows each multi-line query considered to contain binary data, and of course, was truncated.
I agree with you (as I wrote in a commentary in the commit), it would be better to throw out from query meaningless extra characters like \r \n \t. If someone wants to improve this - you're welcome.
Ahhh.  We've been doing some initial work to get proper instructions written up for compiling on Windows.  I can forward the email to you with the initial write up that @schdub did.  We're planning on getting it formatted nicely and onto the wiki, but haven't done so yet.
If you want, email me (justin@postgresql.org), and I'll forward the instruction email to you. :smile:
I've just pushed a commit which trims the SQL strings before logging them. This removed the additional line break at the end of @tbayart 's statement. Empty lines in the middle of the statement are still logged but this makes kind of sense because they're really part of the query and get processed by SQLite, too.
Awesome @MKleusberg. :grinning:
@tbayart Do you have time to grab the nightly build (tomorrow), and let us know if it's working well now from your point of view? :smile:
Thanks @tbayart, that's awesome too. :smile:
Would you be ok to check if this happens with our latest nightly build?  We've been doing some stuff with not clearing various things at specific times, and there's a chance this one is already taken care of.
If it's still happening with our latest nightly build, then yeah, we can add this to the list of stuff to do.  It sounds both simple, and fairly easy to make configurable.  :smile:
Thanks @tbayart.  It doesn't sound like a hard thing to change.  @schdub Is this something you have time to fix? :smile:
I understand the advantages of in-memory databases, however you will notice on that web page that "all database connections sharing the in-memory database need to be in the same process". This means you could create a database in DB4S but it would not be available to any other process and DB4S could not open one belonging to another process. So adding this feature would seem to me to be of limited use. However if you can help explain a good use case or you want to add this yourself via a pull request then please, fire away.
Right, okay, I see what you mean now, thanks for explaining. Are you able to implement this yourself?
@tbayart There is https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md, which is supposed to have all of the building info in it.
I think it's out of date for Windows though, having only the previous approach listed (cross compiling from Linux using MXE).  @rp- has been working on a new build process using Visual Studio, but I don't think it's documented yet.  That being said, it may not be too hard to figure out (unsure).
@glawrence We should probably get the initial Windows building instructions onto the wiki, see if we can find people to test them out/fix/tweak/whatever as needed so they're correct, then possibly add them to BUILDING.md.
Any interest in getting that started, then making a call out through Twitter (main DB4S account) or similar for people to help with them? :smile:
As per my other recent comment, yes we should and I will have a go at this as soon as I get time, which I hope is actually soon!
Awesome.  Hoping so too. :wink:
@vaidasB, thanks for reporting but this issue is already fixed in #282.
You should use our nightly build (http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/) or wait until version 3.7.0 is finally will be aired.
```
CREATE TABLE Testing ([id_@] text, name text, adress text);
INSERT INTO Testing ([id_@], name, adress) VALUES(1, "test", "test");
SELECT [id_@] FROM Testing;
```
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2901453/sql-standard-to-escape-column-names
Awesome @schdub.  I just learned something new too. :smile:
Ahhhh, interesting thought.  I guess we could put something in the Release Notes page.  Does that sound like a decent spot to you which people would generally see?
@ronCYA Would you have a few moments to check if our [new 3.9.0 release](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.0) (which came out today) still has the problem?
The installer code for that, generated by NSIS, is supposed to detect any previously installed version and offer to remove it, regardless of 32 or 64-bit.  But, having someone verify that makes sense.  I just kept testing it against itself, and didn't bother to try older ones.
Closing this due to lack of response. 😦   Hmmm, I have no strong objection to adding a Close database" button.  It would be useful for people.
The idea of having a list (in Preferences area?) to allow customisation of buttons does sound really good though. :smile:
Out of curiosity, do you have skill with C++ and/or Qt? :smile:
That would be great. :grinning:
You should use our nightly build (http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/) or wait until version 3.7.0 is finally will be aired.
See: #282.
@AnthonyUccello, hello. Thank you for reporting.
Which OS do you use? Win8?
Please attach or send me (see my email in my profile) database file for testing purposes.
@AnthonyUccello, in SQLite you can rename field in existing table with algorithm something like:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/805363/how-do-i-rename-a-column-in-a-sqlite-database-table
I note separately: need to drop old table. Our application works in a similar way when renaming fields.
Table 'armor' have PK and table 'grrbls' references this table as FK. If you have data in table 'grrbls' then you can't rename fields in 'armor' table because dropping old table causes foreign key constraint failed.
To rename fields in 'armor' you should:
- export data from table 'grrbls' into external .sql file;
- execute 'delete from grrbls';
- rename fields;
- import data into 'grrbls' back.
@AnthonyUccello Does the latest nightly build fix this issue for you? It should work by now :smile:
@AnthonyUccello Last ping... :smile:
No worries.  Thanks @AnthonyUccello. :smile:
This isn't a Python program though... are you sure you want to include it?
Going to close this for now, as it's a fairly old issue and @mvt91 has been contributing the French translation bits.
In theory (!), that should work already. :smile:  Which operating system are you using, and which version of our application?
Yeah, that's a combination that is "known to be good".  I'll close this issue for now, but if you see the behaviour happening again, please re-open it so we can investigate (and figure out how to as well). :smile:
Hmmmm, I'm not sure if this would be easy/hard/etc. :wink:
Some databases technically change files even just to "open the database" - even if there is no real change in the data contained.
I'm personally unsure about SQLite3 for that, but if it has to change the database file just to open it, it could be difficult.  The other guys here would probably know for sure. :grinning:
Ahhh, good thinking. :smile:
@JoeErsatz Just to check... which operating system are you using? :smile:
No worries.  As a thought, maybe it needs to be marked Read Only on the server where it's stored?
That being said, something in our UI and code to do things for a Read Only option isn't a bad idea. :smile:
Sorry, this took a while :wink:
With the next nightly build there will be a menu item to open a database in read only mode. With this all editing options in the GUI will be disabled and no SQL statements that make changes to the database will be allowed. Are you still interested in this, @JoeErsatz? If so you can try out tomorrow's nightly build :smiley: @JoeErsatz Ahhh... there's a minor drawback to that approach.  We do our very best to make things work properly, but it's an 80/20 thing.  80% of the time everything works out well, and there aren't any hidden surprises.  20% of the time though... things turn out to need a bit of kicking into shape. 😀
Thus our general request for feedback, to help catch those 20%-ers. :wink: No worries :smiley: I'll close this issue for now because I'm pretty sure it should be working with the next release. If it doesn't work as you expected, feel free to re-open it anytime, @JoeErsatz. Should we update this issue as soon as the new release is out to remind you of this issue/fix?  Hi! You're lucky we've already fixed this issue some days ago. You can download the latest build from here http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz (use 7-zip to unpack) and use that. With this file the Russian symbols will work again :smiley:
Thanks for spotting this! :)
I've just noticed another typo in the same line: 'encrpytion'. Do you mind changing that as well and put it into the same commit? Either way I'll be happy to merge this :)
I'm happy to merge this now, but can leave it alone for a while if you want to keep looking for more.
Let me know what you want. :smile:
I think the 'provde' can be deleted entirely. But probably the entire sentence should be rewritten to something like 'This is an abstract class, an implementation of which you can pass to the CSVParser to get progress updates.' or so.
@igozhenko, thanks for reporting, but this issue already fixed and were discussed in #313.
@igozhenko Ironically, the bug which causes this is fixed in 3.6.0.  Are you ok to upgrade to that?
@kropochev That's kind of unclear.  Do you have time to make that clearer?  Maybe a picture/graphic to show what you mean? (it does not have to be a high quality picture.  Even Microsoft Paint would be ok. :smile:)
![plot only points](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1304776/7705684/5dfb0b40-fe4e-11e4-88db-6b837fff5b1b.png)

@justinclift, we can add two ComboBoxes, 'Line type' and 'Point shape', when first item is 'None', for example. What do you think?
![screenshot from 2015-05-19 18 08 40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1304776/7706475/51037b16-fe53-11e4-836c-463c8aab6d62.png)
@schdub That sounds like a really, really good idea.  Are you ok to commit it? :smile:
@justinclift, done.
Please somebody review #317.
@kropochev The code to make this happen has been reviewed and added to the project.  Would you be ok to try the latest code to verify it works how you want?
If you're using Windows or MacOS X, there will be a new "nightly" build you can try tomorrow.  Download locations are shown on our front page. :smile:
@kropochev, are you sure data set on windows and mac is equal (it appears on the image there are gray dots)?
What happens if you choose point shape Disk on windows build?
Could you please send me the database to test?
It looks like troubles with drawing ssDot scatter shape in qcustomplot library on Linux and Windows platforms.
Wrote to the author with proposal how to fix it.
@schdub Is there a PR for it which we can watch? (if the qcustomplot stuff is on GitHub)
maybe its already fixed? we don't use the latest version
@rp-, I've already check, but not. Btw, can I add new version (1.3.1) this library into our repo?
@justinclift, no, only support email.
sure, but maybe wait a few days, if the guy from qcustomplot can fix it quick, he might release a new version.
@rp-, he told me that this isn't a problem in his library, but the problem in some versions Qt.
Problem code, I think is:
```
case ssDot:
{
painter->drawLine(QPointF(x, y), QPointF(x+0.0001, y));
break;
}
```
If replace it with something like:
```
case ssDot:
{
painter->drawPoint(QPointF(x, y));
break;
}
```
everything is fine.
I think the easiest way to deal with this problem is to delete ssDot from list of supported point shape.
Previously, all points on Plot draw with shape ssDisс and size 5.
ssDot - is shape with width and height of pixel, is still not discernible on graph, imho.
sounds good enough for me
Yep, sounds like a good plan @schdub. :smile:
ssDot displaying problems have been solved in #324.
I think we can close this issue.
@justinclift, can we?
Sure. :smile:
@rickshory The directory which is opened can be set in the Preferences.  But yeah, it's a popular request, and one we're considering how best to do. :smile:
For further reference, please see: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/281, https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/276, https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/224.
This should be fixed in the 3.7.0 release where we've introduced a new option to the Preferences dialog to change this behaviour. This way everybody should be happy :smiley:
![lastlocation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/8273318/9c697f04-1868-11e5-9791-7dce9ff25cfe.png)
If there are no objections I think we can close these issue soon.
Good thinking @MKleusberg. :smile:
@rickshory Have you had a chance to try out the new behaviours in our recent 3.7.0 release? :smile:
Closing this as it's been reported to work in issue #276. If there still should be any problems with this feel free to re-open the issue or open a new one.
@markg85, hello. Thank you for your post.
Please show what values you have in the registry key:
HKCU/Software/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/checkversion
Oh, that's weird.  It sounds like there's a bug in our version setting bits on windows. :frowning:
We've changed the automatic update check recently because it contained several bugs. The major/minor/patch keys aren't used anymore in the current version (changed in commit da6d8ba385d18a2d9f5eafa3d0f2b9153e880d49), so they shouldn't cause any trouble... I think...
The reason for the 3.6.6 value is that one of the bugs was a typo where the value of the minor part was accidentally written into the patch key, this was fixed in 2c25b7ecb52944db225516a9b41c9f6c1860e74.
So what this means is that, in theory, the bug which is causing all this trouble should be fixed. And because the registry keys were renamed, the bad values you observed shouldn't be used anymore in version 3.6.0. I'm not sure if you're already using this version, but if you do it seems like we're definitely having more bugs to fix here...
Cool. :smile:
Oh, that's not good.  Do you have the (64-bit) version of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 installed? ([download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784))
Cool. :smile:
@mgrandi Yep.  This is a bug on our side from switching to a new build process, and not having things completely worked out yet.  We should have this automaticly installed from the next release onwards.
Out of curiosity, do you have skills with Visual Studio and/or NSIS?  (just asking because it would be really useful here :smile:)
next release will fix this.
d99d83f269e4f942e9e3dddba5b417005e4191b7
Ahhhh, I think this is a bug we fixed a few days ago: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/282
Would you be ok to try out our latest nightly build (locations are listed on our front page), and see if that works?
Oh that's interesting.  Sounds like we have a bit more stuff to do for this, to properly complete it.
If that doesn't work, then let us know. :smile:
@schdub @MKleusberg Any interest in looking at this? :wink:
Oops, somehow missed this. 😦
If this is still happening with our latest nightly builds, then changing the dialog text is very easy to do.
Um... if you're still interested in this, would you be ok to check if this still happens with our latest nightly build?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest/
If it still happens, I'll update the dialog text. :smile:
Yep, looking at it now, it's still there:
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/7ad80352616df1b185ab87f989cb7c2fd6c784c5/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L48
Just to confirm, "NOCASE collation does not handle multi-byte characters.  Proceed?" would be better?
If so, I'll change it immediately.  Better wording suggestions are welcome too of course. :smile: Ahhh, yeah.  I'm not sure what those effects are either.  We'll have to ask someone who knows this part of things better. 😕   Yeah, it turns out we forgot to enable UTF support by default in our new Execute SQL code. :frowning:
It is fixed in our nighly builds though.  Are you ok to download and use that? (the download locations are on the front page of our repo)
Ahhhh, no.  GitHub doesn't attach files.
You can try sending the file to my personal email address (justin@postgresql.org) though.  Hopefully it's not too big for my mail server. :smile:
I'll forward the file to the other guys, so they can look into it.
@lifedomy I have forwarded the .mp4 file to the main developers.  Hopefully they'll know what the problem is.
Have you tried version 3.6.0?
@lifedomy Do you have time to try our latest nightly builds?  There is a decent chance this is fixed in that. :smile:
Awesome!  Thanks for testing and letting us know. :smile:
Interesting, that definitely looks like a bug of some sort.  Do you have time to check if it happens on our 3.6.0 release as well?
@kaldown This looks like a Qt bug to me... Do you have time to test with our latest release? We're using a newer Qt version in there which might fix this issue for you without any extra work :smile:
Hmmm, in theory it should be possible to compile with Qt5 on FreeBSD, rather than Qt4.  @kaldown If you have an idea how to get that happening (I don't :wink:), it would be worth trying out.
No worries at all.  If it turns out the problem is fixed, please remember to close this issue. :grin:
No worries. :smile:
We released version 3.8.0 a few days ago.  I do the packaging for MacOS X, and for this release I used Qt5 instead of Qt4.  It was very simple to change - I just needed to make sure I had the Qt5 development pieces installed instead of Qt4.
I kind of wonder if it might be that simple for FreeBSD as well.  I'm not sure... the maintainer might have better idea if it's easy to try that. :wink:
Any update on this, @kaldown? We're Qt5-only by now and chances are that the issue is fixed simply by using the new Qt version :smiley: Do you have the time and the interest to do a quick test? Interesting, our servers for dbhub.io are running on FreeBSD.
I might as well try spinning up a desktop sometime next week, and take a look into the state of the DB4S port there. No worries, @kaldown :smiley:
@justinclift We could just close this issue then. I'd guess it's solved by now and if anybody else should encounter the same issue they can just open a new one or reopen this one. No worries.  I'll get to the FreeBSD port of DB4S at some point anyway.  Ahhh. Which operating system is this happening on?
Thanks @gasinvein. :smile:
@deepsidhu1313 Are you ok to look into this?
Its ok, whenever you have time. :smile:
@gasinvein schdub has added a fix for this.  Would you be ok to try out our latest code and report back if it works for you as needed? :smile:
Awesome @gasinvein, thanks for letting us know. :smile:
Sure.  Please email the details to justin@postgresql.org.  I'll forward them to the main developers, and we'll keep the query + database details in confidence (but fix the bug). :smile:
You're welcome, just forwarded it on. (and going to bed, so response speed won't be great now :wink:)
@palmiche, do you press 'Yes' in the 'Collation needed! Proceed?' message box while loading database file? Please try to click 'No' and test again, your query working for me in this case.
Troubles with applying NOCASE collation. It seems that we only have collation implementation (sqlitedb.cpp, collCompare()) for char strings (8-bit) and if used our collation function for compare wide strings (16-bit) it compares only one character.
@palmiche Yep, are you ok to create another issue for it?
It sounds like we should change the description for this issue to something like "NOCASE collation does not handle multi-byte characters".  @schdub Is that a more accurate title?
Ahhh, gotcha, closing then then. :smile: (if that's wrong, feel free to reopen it)
Hmmm, that doesn't sound good.
Which OS are you using?
Cool, that's known to work.  As a first thought, when you grabbed the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784), did you grab both 32 and 64 bit or just one?
I'm kind of thinking if you don't have both installed, it's probably worth installing whichever one is missing, just to see if that solves it.
Is that workable?
Hmmm, so you already have it installed, and it's still not working?
Ok, lets try a different approach.  Would you be ok to try our latest nightly build (location on the front page), and see if that works?
It uses a different (older) build process that I'm thinking will probably work for you right away.  It's worth a shot. :smile:
Ahhh, all good then. :smile:
Oh, that's strange.  In theory that shouldn't be needed... but theory obviously isn't working as expected here.  Personally, I have no idea how to diagnose this in more depth... @schdub, any ideas?
Interesting.  Which OS and version are you using?
Ok.  We released a new version a few days ago, so try that and see if it's better?  (it may or may not be, but it's worth a shot :smile:)
Btw, I'm trying our new 3.6.0 release here now on OSX 10.9.  In the Browse Data tab I have a field in a column selected.  When I scroll down using the scroll wheel, the PgUp/PgDn keys, or using the mouse on the scrollbar, the field that is selected isn't lost.
Just so I understand better... what are you using to scroll?
Also, my sample table is only a few columns wide.  Is the database table that's doing this for you very wide? (I'm trying to narrow down what could be the cause, but I'm sleepy so my wording might not be clear :frowning:)
Cool.  Please let us know how it goes. :smile:
No worries at all. :smiley:
Just checked, and you're right.  I hadn't realised our Preferences dialog doesn't allow a choice of font, it only allows size.
This sounds like a worthwhile enhancement. :smile:
I was looking at GitHub anyway for other stuff. :smile:
This is kind of odd because we're still setting the font to Monospace. No idea why this doesn't get accepted on your system... It would be interesting to know which OS you're using and how exactly the font looks like on your system.
But either way, I've added a new option for setting the editor font to the Preferences Dialog. You'll find the new option in tomorrow's nightly build (see front page of the repository). Maybe manually setting the font already does the trick for you. Let us know if this works for you :)
Saludos a Chile! :smiley:
Wow.  Now **that's** a good response time @MKleusberg. :grin:
Hmmm, you might need to wait until the automatic build tonight?
Yes, you'll need to wait for the nightly build. See details here: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser#windows
The build should be there in ~6h. If you use the binary from that link you can click View->Preferences, then click the SQL tab, and edit the 'SQL editor font' option.
![font](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/7500605/e9734b94-f42e-11e4-906c-88060b1ace13.png)
Awesome. :grinning:
Thanks for checking and letting us know, it really helps. :wink:
Yeah, it's one of the tradeoff's that have come with using a new build process so we get 64-bit capable binaries on Windows.
If it helps, our nightly builds are still created using the old process.  So if you grab a nightly build it will have the latest source code and still be just one .exe. :smile:
@mvrhov This is probably not going to happen.
We're moving towards using Qt5 only, and at least for Windows it seems statically building with Qt5 is a pain, and may not even work properly. (eg lack of image plugins) 😦
Does this mean the nightlies won't be one .exe?
Yep. :wink:
Guess thats good in one way .... without all the Qt DLLs, the .exe is 2 MB rather than 32 MB...  The .exe should get updated but the DLLs won't change as often, so should just be a matter of downloading a smaller .exe and overwriting it.
This sounds like a duplicate of https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/279.
Does the solution at the bottom of that work for you?
Cool. :smile:
More about comparison DB data types:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1942586/comparison-of-database-column-types-in-mysql-postgresql-and-sqlite-cross-map
This should be fixed by now :smiley: Any recent release should definitely work. Sorry for the late reply :frowning: I'm going to close this issue but if any issues with this happen to come up feel free to reopen it or open a new one any time :smiley:  It is in MacOS, and if you compile it yourself on Linux, FreeBSD, etc.
It's not yet supported on Windows, though it likely will be in a future release (unsure when).
Which OS are you using?
Ahhhh, no worries. :smile:
There are two possible downloads for MacOS X.  One with SQLCipher support, and one without it.
Here is the direct link for the one with SQLCipher support, if that helps:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/v3.6.0/sqlitebrowser-with_sqlcipher_support-3.6.0.dmg
You can tell which version you have, by going to the menu bar → About DB Browser for SQLite.

Does that help?
@79144876 Encrypting databases is done in two steps: first creating an unencrypted database and then encrypting it.  After you've created a new database file (or opened an existing one), you can click the File -> Set Encryption menu option (only available in the sqlitebrowser version built with SQLCipher support) to set a password for your database. The old, unencrypted file then gets replaced by an encrypted version. I hope this helps a bit :smiley: Let me know if you have any further questions or problems.
Awesome Geoff.  Just added an entry for the wiki tracking issue about this too. :grinning:
@liufsd Did you ever manage to get this working? :smile:
Thanks so far, just do me a little favor and replace the empty
```
else()
...
```
with
```
...
```
then I'm happy to merge it
Thanks @rp- and @pinotree, that's awesome. :grinning:
@Nisto This may be a side effect of our new build process.  Does v3.5.1 work?
We can probably still create a WinXP compatible build using the old cross-compiler process if that's the case. :smile:
Good idea.  That's probably using the old build process... I didn't think of that... but yeah, give that a shot. :smile:
Well, the "nightly builds" at the moment are using the very latest source code... so it's already "what will become version 3.7.0".  It sounds like we should create a 3.6.0 release for WinXP using the old process (to keep people on XP happy), and also look into updating our nightly builds to generate things with the new build process as well.  I have no idea when any of that will happen though.
Are you both ok to just use that nightly build for the moment?
VS2013 has as default the toolset > winxp set and I didn't check that or even think about it.
I may rebuilt the whole thing with the winxp toolset, or have it at least changed for the next release.
@rp- Cool.  Btw, from email with John Haller (Portable Apps), we can probably bundle the MS dependency legally-ok, then have NSIS check if it's needed and auto-install it.  We'll need to look over the license text for the dependency first, just in case though.
Initial response from @richardfontana indicates bundling doesn't seem to be allowed by the MSVC2013 runtime license text.  Going to dig a bit deeper though, to see what can be done. :smile:
@nickdesaulniers has helpfully pointed this out:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235299.aspx
I'm too sleepy atm to grok it, but I'm betting the info is there for us to find. :smile:
I uploaded new builds (v3) which should work on win xp again
Have you tried the nightlies?  These use a slightly different build process, and searching through this group, appears to be more XP friendly....
http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32/
or
http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/
Ahhh yeah.  We dropped support for Windows XP with our version 3.9.0 release.
Version 3.8.0 will still work though. :smile:
Looking at this:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://travis-ci.org/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/jobs/60943535
It seems like the errors are more of a build problem than a compiling problem:
```
The command "cd tests/build" exited with 0.
0.04s$ cmake ..
CMake Error: The source directory "/home/travis/build/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/tests" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.

The command "./sqlb-unittests" exited with 127.

```
I'm not sure of the right approach here, so will defer to the main coders. :wink:
Sorry, I only took a closer look at your commit now, after I've changed the cmake files a bit... Can you maybe rabase them and add the FileDialog.cpp/FileDialog.h files to the src/tests/CMakeLists.txt file, so the tests build again? As soon as that's done I'll merge the commits.
Nice work by the way :smiley: Thanks for the nice commit structure and documentation, too :+1:
Awesome! Again, thanks a lot for this PR :smiley:
Would you be ok to squash these two commits into a single one?
Looks good! :+1: Thanks a lot :)
@pinotree Awesome.  Thanks for squashing them into one commit too.  It helps keeps the repo history neat. :smile:
Yes, this should be a duplicate of #282, so the current nightly build (https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser#windows) should fix this problem for you :)
I'm not sure about the first bit, but the 512 → 1024 change for SQLCipher sounds like a bug. :wink:
@rp- @MKleusberg Need reviewers for this.
@schdub What's your opinion on this too, in case Rene or Martin aren't around in the next few days? :smile:
Guys?
@justinclift, its good solution imho. My first trying to fix #239 was something like this.
But also need to get rid dead code related to SqliteTableModel::m_vDataTypes
So, merge this one now, and we can change SqliteTableModel::m_vDataTypes in a new PR?
I see two problems here:
The minor one is in [EditTable.cpp](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/286/files#diff-f307c53f8f195837664d83775f85c2a5R135) where the test for the Binary option should be language independent. The easiest way would be to put tr("...") around the 'Binary' string.
The major one is that it breaks the in-place editing in the Browse Data tab. If you don't open the Edit dialog for editing a cell content but just typing in the table view directly the changes aren't saved anymore. This is because in this case the SqliteTableModel::setData(const QModelIndex&, const QVariant&, int role) method is called which [in practice](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/286/files#diff-1652727a9b5725cb5275a9270349896cR22) is just the parent implementation which does nothing. If there is any solution to this which doesn't require us to overload the setData method that would probably be the most elegant one. If there isn't any, the setData method with three arguments at least needs to be re-implemented to call the one with four.
Cool. Sounds like you guys are on it. :smile:
That would be awesome. :smile:
**_reminder nudge**_ :smiley_cat:
Oh, that's excellent.  @rp- @MKleusberg ping! :grin:
@gimKondo Hmmm, would you be ok to merge those 3 commits into a single one?  It's better for the git history when PR's are just one commit. :smile:
If you're not sure how to do it, I can give you the exact instructions. :grin:
Perfect, thanks. :smile:
Doesn't look like @rp- or @MKleusberg will have time to look at this in the near future, so I've proactively merged it.
If people could test the nightly builds and let us know if this code adds any problems, that would be great. :grin:
#278
In my opinion we can merge this as it makes a lot of sense in a SQLite environment: with this the behaviour when displaying the content of a cell depends on the actual content and not on the data type which fits well into SQLite's pragmatic handling of data types. The only thing I'm thinking of is that it might be a good idea to improve the binary test made here while being on it. Maybe check for more than the null character but still in an efficient manner?
@MKleusberg k, so merge this one now, and we can tweak it later?
Sounds reasonable :)
> Eg someone makes there own executable and then find a way to uploads it to the official website
Can you please check the SHASUM of the executables you're seeing this on, with the one in the release notes?  Just to be 100% certain it isn't a compromised one.
If it's not a compromised one... then I guess we can ping the Symantec people to figure out if they can fix their end.
Depends where the .exe has been downloaded from.  If it's been downloaded from here on GitHub then sure, that's a _really big deal_.  But it's not clear that's definitely the case, thus the wanting to check things. :smile:
@glawrence Yep, please do.  I think my wording towards Symantec would be very unkind.  Probably not productive. :wink:
Might as well do it here. :smile:
@glawrence Yep, please do that.
Oh yeah, good point about the v2 files.  I'll fix that right now.
Fixed.  It's now pointing at the v3. :smile:
@glawrence For that ISV upload page, it has an item about:
```
For identity verification, a corporate email address is mandatory. Requests from
free email domains will be denied.
```
If that causes any hassle, we might be able to get @sqlitebrowser.org addresses happening.  Would that be useful?
Yep, for sure. :smile:
Cool. :smile:
Wondering if a "class 3 digital certificate" is something we need to pay them for. (hoping not)  Would you be ok to look into what our options are, and figure out a good way forward?
@glawrence How's this going? :smile:
No worries, I'm kind of expecting that by now they would have enough positive reports for the immediate problem to be over.  Figuring out the future solution though would be kinda useful. :smile:
@justinclift I am sorry but have to confess I never got round to submitting these files to Symantec. I am  not aware of any issues with the 3.7.0 release, so that's good. However as far as code signing goes I have found https://www.certum.eu/certum/cert,offer_en_open_source_cs.xml or rather a colleague pointed me to it. Could you take a look and let me know what you think please.
- Secured by the SHA1 function   ← SHA1 is widely regarded as broken, and shouldn't be used in things any more.  (kind of ironic, as git still uses it for core functionality.  No idea if that's being looked at... :wink:)
I don't believe the SHA1 issue is such a concern for signing, however I agree it is broken for encryption. You have read more than me but I don't think any of us would want to send ID to an unknown 3rd party. I might try and look into that and see. How about we close this issue?
Sure.  If it happens again for future releases, then we know it wasn't just a once off thing, and we'd better look into it in depth. :smile:
Fortunately there already is a solution to your problem :smile: You can tick the 'Remove line breaks in schema view' checkbox in the 'Database' tab of the Preferences Dialog. Let us know if this works for you :)
@MKleusberg, btw, why this option removes only \n? I think best way to reduce length of Schema column also remove extra spaces and tabs by using QString::simplified()
@schdub From memory, the "\n" thing is because someone asked us to add it.  Your suggestion might be an improvement on top of it too. :smile:
Hmmmm, that might be a better way of doing things.  Someone would need to code up the new approach, and then we could do some before/after type screenshots and make a decision.
I think the main reason why we still have the CREATE TABLE statement in there is that some people use it for copy & paste. I can't find the issue right now but somebody was explicitly asking for that feature... So I think we should leave it in there but this doesn't mean we can't improve the information in the tree structure :smiley: The Schema column is the last one anyways, so it probably isn't too much in anybody's way.
Oh interesting.  That does sound like a bug.
Do you have some example text which we can verify with?
Enable UTF-8 in Scintilla Document ctor by default:
libs/qscintilla/src/Document.cpp, line 94
-       dbcsCodePage = 0;
+       dbcsCodePage = SC_CP_UTF8;
works for me.
Ahhh, good thinking.  Want to submit a Pull Request with that?  If not, I can do it. :smile:
@justinclift, I don't have much experience with Scintilla, so I think is better to wait answer from @MKleusberg or @rp-.
Yeah, good point. :grin:
Thanks for reporting this :smile: I've just pushed a fix for this issue, so in the next nightly build your problem should be solved.
@AlbertIslamov Would you have time to try the new nightly build, tomorrow? (if so, download locations are on the front page of our repo)
Excellent.  Thanks for letting us know @AlbertIslamov. :smile:
This sounds like a duplicate of https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/276 to me.  Also https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/224.
@AlbertIslamov Do they sound the same to you?
@AlbertIslamov Would you be ok to test the latest nightly build (tomorrow)?  We've changed the behaviour a bit for this, so feedback would be useful. :smile:
Going to close this, as we only really need one issue for this to be open (until we figure out a full solution and get it done). :smile:
This should be fixed in the 3.7.0 release where we've introduced a new option to the Preferences dialog to change this behaviour. This way everybody should be happy :smiley:
![lastlocation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/8273318/9c697f04-1868-11e5-9791-7dce9ff25cfe.png)
The foreign key column in the dialog is on the very right of the grid view so you probably have to use the scroll bar to see it (I've resized the other columns for the screenshot). Just type in the foreign key as you need it :smiley: Let me know if I misunderstood you or if there are any other issues.
Can you give us the layout of the other two tables (Orders and Products)? There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with your foreign keys as far as I can see. I assume your Orders and Products table have a column called order_id or product_id? And you have foreign keys enabled (click the View -> Preferences menu item, then open the Database tab, and check the Foreign Keys checkbox)?
Can you maybe post all the version numbers shown in the About dialog (menu: Help -> About)? Especially the SQLite version could be interesting.
Closing this due to lack of response. 😦
Oh interesting.  I'll setup a Win7 vm after work tomorrow and see if I can figure out what's wrong.
Which method(s) did you try for doing the file association?
Thanks @hko-gh. I hadn't gotten around to look at this yet after all. :wink:
With that registry key... it doesn't seem to be in CMakeLists.txt, so I'm wondering where in our source it comes from so we can update it.  Can't see it though. :frowning:
Sounds like a wiki page with instructions would be useful.  Is anyone up for knocking one together (even very basic)?
Cool, that looks like a good start. :smile:
Would you be ok to create it in the main wiki, and add a link to it from the main wiki page so people can see it?
Yeah... I'm just wondering if we can put some kind of info somewhere for people to easily find about this.
Maybe we should update the Release Note info to mention something like "If you're upgrading from the 32-bit to 64-bit release on Windows, you may need to change a registry entry so file association works.  Details [here]." with [here] being a link to the wiki page.
That's the best approach that I'm thinking of atm... anything better spring to mind for you?
Good thinking.  They're definitely both suitable for a future version.  I'm wondering more about what to do with the current one though, so people know. :smile:
Good idea.  Let's do that. :smile:
Yeah, we should add an option for setting file associations for the next release.
Especially considering the 3.9.0 release changed the install path again.
/me completely forgot about potential impact of that on file associations
Looking into this a bit, it seems like we could add an option to our installer for people to choose whether to "Associate file extensions?" or not.
There's no direct support for doing so in CMake's "CPack" (which controls the NSIS packaging process), but it should be feasible using some of the "extra install" commands.
- https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2009-January/026252.html
- https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CPackNSIS.html?highlight=cpack_nsis_extra_install_commands#variable:CPACK_NSIS_EXTRA_INSTALL_COMMANDS
- https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackNSISAdvancedTips
Adding "options" to the generated installer might be done through components:
- https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:Component_Install_With_CPack
This may turn out to be useful as well:
- https://github.com/toeb/cmakepp#feature-overview
Good thinking @AdamPS. That does look like a useful source of info on commonly used file extensions. :smile:
Just tried this on my Windows 10 machine, and some useful 'quick' command line tools.
So, from an administrative command prompt (not just a command prompt when logged in as a user with admin rights, but right click the 'cmd' shortcut and 'run as admin') type these commands:
`assoc .db=sqlite3Database`
`ftype sqlite3Database="C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite\bin\DB Browser for SQLite.exe"`
Obviously, change your paths / file extensions as required.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17974778/4e497e76-6adf-11e6-8e30-7195e288e8bd.png)
To add another extension, just repeat the 'assoc' command, but not the ftype...
`assoc .db3=sqlite3Database`
etc.
Obviously, the right click 'Open With...' dialog is also good, but it has its quirks....
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/17974912/d45e30a6-6adf-11e6-851c-9666f8495efd.png)
Doh!
@chrisjlocke Cool, those `assoc` and `ftype` commands look useful. :smile:
With the `3.9.0` release, it installs into ... `\DB Browser for SQLite\3.9.0\` with the `bin` directory + files inside that.  So, the paths will be slightly different than shown.
Yes, I removed the '3.9.0' from my install, and added the 'change your paths / file extensions as required' to the above instructions!  Just my personal preference, but on my main machine, I don't install into separate directories.
I've used Inno Setup in the past to create Windows installs.  That does optional (ie, via checkboxes) file associations, but a user preference in the program is always welcome... I assume the current setup routine is chosen for a reason, so don't want to break that by suggesting something different...
Makes sense.  I'll look into doing it via the installer.  But, probably won't investigate today.
Feeling a bit burnt out from the hectic last few days getting the release ready.  Ironically... I need a holiday. 😁
Realised something important.  We don't really **need** to use CMake for creating the installer.  The way things are configured now, CMake drives the NSIS packaging program, but doesn't make easy the wide variety of things that NSIS allows.
If we just use NSIS directly, it shouldn't be too hard to make an installer which does what we want, including optional creation of file associations.
Note - This wouldn't be my first time around with NSIS either.  I've used it occasionally on an off over the years (eg creating the first OpenOffice.org .exe installer, the [Libvirt installer for Windows](https://github.com/justinclift/nsis_libvirt_installer), and others).
So... I'll give this a go shortly and see if the result is decent. :smile:
Other Open Source projects have their NSIS scripts online too, and some of the pieces in them we can probably copy/adapt.  eg from VLC:
- https://github.com/videolan/vlc/blob/master/extras/package/win32/NSIS/vlc.win32.nsi.in#L224-L230
- https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/4323
This will probably fix #742 on the way through too.
Aha, this looks like the thing we want:
- https://github.com/videolan/vlc/blob/master/extras/package/win32/NSIS/helpers/extensions.nsh
@AdamPS That makes good sense.  While looking into "how to set up file associations with NSIS?", several other posts on the topic (for other applications) have mentioned that exact same thing. :smile:
It's probably going to be faster (for now) to add the file extension support into our "Preferences" dialog somewhere.  It would mean they're not set during installation (yet), but instead you can enable them when you want in the running program.
That's the theory anyway. :wink:  More detail than that is probably a bit hard to do right now.  We'll need to write some code to get a better practical understanding of things first. 😁
Nice info for Windows 10 with assoc and fstype @chrisjlocke any chance you could add this to https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Windows-File-Associations please?
@chrisjlocke (and others): What would the "optimal" directory layout be?
- Maybe having everything (except plugins/platform) in "C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite"? eg:
- "C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite\DB Browser for SQLite.exe"
- "C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite*.dll"
- "C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite\uninstall.exe"
Asking because I've just now managed to get the installer doing that properly, instead of using a "bin" subdirectory.
(no progress with the shortcuts yet though)
Note - When implementing this in the Preferences window, it would make sense to have it work well with #659 too.
For Windows, there is no 'benefit' of having a 'bin' directory - its soley a cosmetic thing.  Does the plugins directory sit in the root, or under the 'bin' directory? (I don't have a 'plugins' on my install...)
If in the 'bin' directory, then there is no benefit of a 'bin' directory.
Yeah.  I **suspect** the "bin" directory is just a historical accident. (I didn't write the initial CMake stuff)
With CMake, it's `INSTALL` command has a **required** parameter called `DESTINATION`.  That parameter gives a subdirectory name (under "C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite") to install into.  eg: `bin`, `docs` or whatever (it's free form text)
- Leaving out that parameter doesn't work - CMake errors out
- Giving a blank string (eg "") doesn't work - CMake errors out
- The [CMake docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.6/command/install.html) seem to very wrong about some important stuff. 😦   For example, the docs say full paths are used directly (eg "C:\foo") but after experimenting a lot yesterday, that's not the case.
One (probably dodgy) workaround is to use "/" as the destination parameter.  If the docs were correct, it would mean the files were installed in the root directory of the OS.  But the docs aren't correct, so they just get installed into "C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite" instead.  Which is what we want.
Thus the commit yesterday with several changes of "bin" to "/": https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/8a9130883b9e89d57d33b6c3a0ee8ee59ce9957b#diff-af3b638bc2a3e6c650974192a53c7291L337
The plugins directory will be straight under "DB Browser for SQLite" too.  No "bin" needed any more.
The plugins directory is a Qt5 only thing, and will need to have stuff in there giving support for various image file formats. (eg .jpg, etc).  I haven't attacked that particular problem just yet, but will get around to it. :smile:
@justinclift I just realised that @chrisjlocke makes a good point. By default Windows searches for DLLs in the same directory as the .exe so putting *.exe and *.dll in the same directory is a good thing.
Good point, it might work out totally fine.  I just haven't investigated the plugins stuff yet, so am not sure. :smile:
It's definitely after #256.
@igozhenko, спасибо за баг-репорт.
> Click on BLOB field show nothing
Пожалуйста проверьте, действительно ли значение поля json для строки doc_id=1, revid=1-39757369ecc4... не равно NULL? Так же попробуйте открыть для редактирования значение поля json для строки doc_id=103, revid=1-4991b88e971f... (первая строка на первом скриншоте), так же в "Edit database cell" будет пусто? Если пусто, то пожалуйста сообщите как вставляются данные в эту таблицу (чтобы воспроизвести проблему). У меня, при редактировании BLOB-значения окно "Edit database cell" остаётся пустым только если значение данного поля равно NULL, о чем свидетельствует надпись "Typе of data currently in cell: Null".
По поводу того, что в 3.6.0 отображается надпись BLOB вместо текста самого BLOB-значения - это ожидаемое поведение после приведённого выше фикса, если бы тип колонки был TEXT, то все бы отображалось верно.
Somebody trying to fix this issue?
If not, #285 returns display blob text fields as in version 3.5.1
@igozhenko, we've added the code that was supposed to solve the problem with displaying of text BLOB. Could you test tomorrow build?
@igozhenko, changes will apply in tomorrow build.
Nightly builds (uncompress them with 7-Zip) are available at:
http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
Awesome. :grinning:
Thanks for testing this and letting us know @igozhenko. :smile:
Yeah, you need to install the (free) Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013, available here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784
It's pretty easy.  And yeah, if we can figure out how to bundle this dependency with future releases, that'd be better. :wink:
Yeah, there seem to be two main ways of thinking about this.  One is that the "last opened folder" should be opened... and the other is that the folder defined in Preferences should always be used.
At the moment, it always opens the folder defined in Preferences.  We get asked often enough though, that we should probably make this behaviour changeable (so you can choose which approach to use).
Aha, found one of the previous Issues about this: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/224
Decent thoughts.  I kind of remember we've had some discussion about it in our early issues as well, which is probably worth digging through to make a proper proposal with (which covers all bases).
I'm kinda busy on some other stuff (not related to DB4S) for the next 2-3 weeks, so I have no idea if I'll get to look at it before then. You're definitely welcome to if you want. :smile:
I think the approach suggested by @glawrence should make everybody happy. So I've just pushed an implementation of this which should work for all file dialogs. The default settings is now set to the 'same as last but default for new session' option which seems to be the best compromise for new users and those upgrading to a new version.
@xjpmauricio Would you be ok to test the latest nightly build too (tomorrow), and let us know if it's working better for you with the new approach? :smile:
This should be fixed in the 3.7.0 release where we've introduced a new option to the Preferences dialog to change this behaviour. This way everybody should be happy :smiley:
![lastlocation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/8273318/9c697f04-1868-11e5-9791-7dce9ff25cfe.png)
If there are no objections I think we can close these issue soon.
@xjpmauricio Any interest in try our latest release, and letting us know if the new behaviour is better for you? :smile:
Great, thanks @xjpmauricio for testing and letting us know
1. what version are you talking about?
2. what "edit table" do you exactly mean?
@AnthonyUccello Have you tried our newest release? It has a lot of updates in it, including some foreign key stuff.
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.6.0
If you've already tried that though, no worries. :smile:
our installer doesn't set any file associations
I have the NSIS icon on both installers
Cool.  This sounds like it would work:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7431039/how-to-replace-the-default-logo-in-nsis-installer
In theory they should be ok, but verifying doesn't hurt. :smile:
Thanks @cnromaine. :smile:
For me, when I checked here they're both using the same icon.  That was on Win 7 x64.
@cnromaine We're just about to release 3.9.0, so I'll close this.  If it turns out that the icons for 3.9.0 are different for you, feel free to reopen this and we can look back into it for the next release. :smile:
Thanks @ticktock12.  This one's already reported [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/269).
Sounds like we're better pulling the windows binaries for now, until we figure out what's wrong. :frowning:
Done it, pulled them.  Hope we get this fixed soon. :wink:
@ticktock12 New downloads for windows are available now:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.6.0
Sorry for the initial hassle. :frowning:
Ahhh, interesting.  Thanks for pointing this out.
I'd missed updating our master branch to 3.6.99 (not 3.6.0).  It's 3.6.99 to indicate "the development version of 3.6.x".  Want to update your commit with that, and then I'll merge it?
Thank you @mcprentiss, it's all good.  Every bit helps. :grin:
@cnromaine Thanks for pointing this out.  We could be releasing 3.6.1 tomorrow or so. :wink:
@rp- Any ideas?
Some Google turns up these:
- http://falsinsoft.blogspot.ch/2013/09/qt-5-and-failed-to-load-platform-plugin.html
- https://forum.qt.io/topic/40656/solved-qt-this-application-failed-to-start-because-it-could-not-find-or-load-the-qt-platform-plugin-windows/18
- http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html
Also received email about this same issue, so it's not limited to @cnromaine. :frowning:
I've just pulled the windows binaries, updated the website about it, and reverted currentrelease (which the update checker relies on) to 3.5.1.
Hopefully we get this solved in a day or two, so we can put up good v3.6.0 binaries for Windows. :wink:
There seems to be dll's missing in the installer.
I didn't have this problem, I guess because I hade the qt development libs installed on my system.
Will fix it today.
I added new windows installers with the missing .dll, please someone else also test them.
Also keep in mind that your system needs to have the MSVC2013 .dll installed.
You get a MSVC120.dll missing error on start if thats the case, the installer for them can be downloaded here:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784
I have a Win8.1 VM I can test.  Trying stuff out now.
@rp- Cool, the new ones work. :smile:
The MSVCP120.dll error message did happen too, and the download at the link you gave fixed that.
I'll update the release page with the new dependency info, new shasums, and update currentrelease.
Oh... should I hold off until new icons?  @rp- Is it possible to get our proper icon into that?
Yeah, my VM is close to a fresh install of Win 8.1.
k, updated things so now 3.6.0v2 is live. :wink:
Thanks for your assistance with this @cnromaine, it's helping a lot. :grinning:
Well... displaying the data type that's going to be used for any particular column probably isn't going to work.  SQLite 3 doesn't really seem to enforce data types the same way that other databases do.
Further info, in case it's helpful: https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html
As a thought, which OS are you using, and which version of DB4S and the SpatiaLite extension?  (not sure if it makes a difference, but it's helpful to know)
Hmmm yeah, I'm not sure either.  @MKleusberg or @rp- may know more... :smile:
No guarantees, but it's worth a shot. :smile:
Thanks @jimothyr.  It sounds like we should investigate this properly after the 3.9.0 release (which is due any day now).
@zhm That's pretty awesome. :smile:
Any interest in cutting-n-pasting that into a wiki page, for better visibility of the info?  It's seems like pretty arcane knowledge that others would definitely benefit from. Fantastic!  Added a link on the front page of the wiki pointing at it, so it should be much easier for people to find now.  Thank you heaps Zac. :smile:  Which operating system are you using? :smile:
If you are using MacOS X, this is a known problem. :anguished:
We did have filters, but they don't work with Qt on OSX (a Qt bug).  So we made it do *.* instead. :frowning:
If you're not using OSX though.. this is a new bug and we should investigate it. :smile:
That'll need fixing then. :smile:
k, what do you want/need me to test? (kind of hard to tell atm) :wink:
@samir-aguiar Thanks Samir.  Just tried it here on OSX 10.9.5... and no change.  Still busted here for older OSX releases. :frowning:
Maybe change the conditional to allow filters on OSX 10.10 and above?
Query from Twitter:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://twitter.com/niall111/status/589078702132166656
> Tried app [with cipher support here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/v3.5.1/sqlitebrowser-with_sqlcipher_support-3.5.1.dmg) … but we use a pragma key and want to browse DB with it, possible?
and:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://twitter.com/niall111/status/589119373006213120
> We use a pre-generated hex pragma key to encrypt the DB in Unity, and want to be able to view it without requiring Unity.
Any ideas?  @MKleusberg ? :smile:
It would be good to have, but we're low on developer time at the moment.  If you have the skill to get it working, your assistance would be welcome. :smile:
From what I understand this is an issue with the key formats we support. SQLCipher allows text key (like 'my passphrase') as well as raw keys (like '0xabcdef0123456789'). Since we only support the text key format all databases encrypted using the raw key format can't be opened. At least that's how I understand the issue, and either way: this definitely needs to be fixed :smiley:
I've just added some code for this, so the next nightly build will have support for the raw key format. So please give that new version a test :smiley: Chances are that it's working when changing the format to 'Raw key' in the cipher dialog and then enter the key in the '0x...' format.
Hopefully we get a response back, and they use SQLCipher.  If they do, this might all be workable. :wink: Hmmm, looking at discussions about that Unity plugin... it seems like it's not actively developed any more. 😦  Oh :frowning: But well, the hex input is definitely an improvement in DB4S anyway :wink: Good point. :smile:
In the meantime I've added the `response requested` label, so we come back to this issue in a few days time if I don't get a response to the email first.  As mentioned in #206 by @sergbus:
> Another useful thing might be to not close "Execute SQL" tabs when closing connection to the

Thanks, that definitely sounds like a bug. :wink:
Haha nice find :+1: Thanks for reporting!
This should be fixed in the next nightly build.
@EArmour Would you be ok to try out the next nightly build (tomorrow), and let us know if it's working like it should now? :smile:
Awesome!  Thanks for letting us know @EArmour. :grin:
This adds the QScintilla library to our project. I've changed the SqlTextEdit class to use the QScintilla editor instead of depending on a plain Qt widget and trying to improve it for code editing. This should build  fine on Qt4 and Qt5 using either cmake or qmake - so everybody should have the chance to test this (and give feedback) :)
Most of the time the new code behaves just like the old one but a few things changed. Right now these features are missing:
- No separate syntax highlighting colours for functions and tables
- No auto completion for table fields
- Better auto completion for keywords, functions and tables (icons, help texts, ...)
- Shift+Tab works as expected
- Brace matching
- Auto indentation
The main thing however is that this saves us from adding more and more code for all sorts of things (search & replace, error highlighting, ...) which has already been written by other people.
As mentioned in #258 I don't see any license issues and especially none which we wouldn't have had anyway because of the plotting library...
Squash them into one commit? :smile:
Yep, but because I'm still working on it I feel like it's better to wait because this way I can always go back to e.g. yesterday's version if something breaks. As soon as I'm happy with the changes I can out them into one commit :wink:
Ahh yeah, makes sense.  Didn't think of that. :grinning:
"... because of the plotting library."
Uh oh... ?
@justinclift
See https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/libs/qcustomplot-source/GPL.txt or http://www.qcustomplot.com/ for example - they are using the GPL as well. But as I said: it's an external library which we can always link dynamically if it _should_ be required. Then it's like we're not touching it at all; if that was a problem the Apple Store would probably be empty :wink:
k, no worries then. :smile:
Just did a bit of additional code cleanup, rebased the entire branch to the current master and fixed syntax highlighting in the Edit Table dialog -> Progress :)
Is it easy to strip the unused qscintilla sources? I guess we could spare all the python stuff. I see you already removed the qt3 support.
Yes, I've removed Qt3 code, documentation, examples, and the Qt Creator plugin. Now I've also removed the Python stuff (which wasn't used anywhere), the API definitions for Python code (not used anywhere), and all the lexers except for the SQL one. Removing the lexers required a bit more work, making it necessary to edit both build files as well as the libs/qscintilla/src/Catalogue.cpp file. But man, this saves us a lot of code in the repository! Thanks for drawing my attention to this :)
After removing the QScintilla files we don't need I merged all the commit so far into one to make the diff of this entire pull request much smaller.
Since then I've done a bit of restructuring in the code to make it easier to understand and compile faster. Then I've added the own syntax highlighting styles for SQLite function names and table names from the database and finally I've restored the auto completion feature for column names. It's so much simpler with QScintilla than it used to be with our original code :smile:
So I think everything in this branch is working more or less as before now. So I think it's ready for testing now! If there are no remaining major bugs (like no building on some platforms, etc.) I would suggest merging this in a couple of days to avoid a lot of rabasing and have it tested by more people than when doing separate builds.

Just did a git pull from this branch and it compiled without error this time. ***whew**\* :wink:
Trying this new QtScintilla thing out, it seems pretty nice.  The tab and shift-tab thing are working, and better code completion already:
![qtscin1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/7206893/89c06f8e-e52d-11e4-868e-a51df56bae8e.png)

Note - I'm going to adjust the expected date for the next release to be one week from now instead of this weekend.
I definitely don't have time to do stuff for a release this weekend.  Need to get an upgrade done for Gluster + Jenkins, now that Google is shutting off their OpenID 2.0 support. :frowning:
Cool! Glad to hear it's finally working :)
As far as I see this branch has all the features of master in it now, plus adding a few new ones like these:
- Try typing 'substr(' (or any other function name) and it should show you a short explanation of the parameters and the function's purpose
![help](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/7207143/96f66f6e-e537-11e4-8e0b-24bc72126883.png)
- Code folding to allow folding of multi-line statements
![code_folding](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/7207150/9d2bb68c-e537-11e4-8bb8-acfab7cc672d.png)
- Errors in the Execute SQL tabs are highlighted (sometimes because SQLite won't recognise completely invalid statements)
![error_highlighting](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/7207154/a35368fc-e537-11e4-9b18-951c0a93e87e.png)
Do changes in the font selector in the Preferences dialog correctly update stuff in the new widget?
I tested quickly and it didn't seem like it. :wink:
![qtscin3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/7207384/f4f895b2-e530-11e4-9c9d-682d4c83e6be.png)
works pretty good, I just have 2 small issues.
1. Could we bring the auto completion popup only after 3? entered characters?
2. It seems the sqlite datatypes are missing in the autocompletion list, maybe were already missing before.
The changes in the preferences dialog only affected the editor after restarting the application... This is fixed now, so you get an immediate effect! Thanks for reminding me of that :) The small arrow indeed indicates a drop down menu but you have to hold your mouse button down for some time to have it opened. A single click performs the default operation (Save As when not saved yet, and Save when already saved).
As @rp- suggested I've also changed the auto completion to start only after three characters and include some SQLite datatypes.
Does regex still work? (as per https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/215)
I'm trying to think of how to test it myself, but my brain is not clicking for it (focused on other stuff atm :wink:).
Gah yeah... you're right.  It's been a long day. :wink:
Yes, this is a frontend-only change (or at least it should be), things like the regular expressions are not affected. So this means we should test the following:
- Does it build well? (an entire library has been added...)
- Typing, scrolling, Tab, etc. (i.e. basic text editor features)
- Syntax highlighting
- Auto completion (keywords, functions, tables, columns)
- Other code editing features (brace matching, help texts, code folding...) [these are mostly new, so there's no comparison to the master branch possible here]
- Accessing the contents correctly (the execute current line button and the execute selected SQL only feature!!)
- All this should work for all SQL editor widgets in the application. Besides the Execute SQL tabs, these are the SQL log views and the SQL preview in the Create/Edit Table dialog.
Just reorganised the pull request: The actual transition to the new widget is done in one commit now (the first one) while the other commits add new features or make improvements, so they can be viewed separately. I've also updated the QScintilla source code to the newly released version 2.9.
As I haven't heard of any objections I'll merge this now and see what happens :)
Excellent.  Lets get some people to test this. :smile:
Hmmmm, just noticed an interesting behaviour with this.  When compiling this on OSX single threaded (eg "make") it's compiling fine.  But when compiling multi-threaded (eg "make -j9") it's sometimes barfing:
```
[sqlitebrowser (master)]$ qmake

```
Any ideas what could cause that?
Hmmmm, in theory (!) if the first command line argument you pass is a database file name... it should open it.  Isn't that what Automator should be doing?
Yeah, I'm not sure how to change that.  Sounds like we need someone with good Automator understanding to look into it (might be possible).  If it means we need to change something in our OSX builds, we can definitely consider it. :smile:
Good stuff. Although I wonder why it's needed for you (on my OSX 10.9 system it "just works") it's good that your workaround does the job. :smile:
Interesting idea.  It should not be too hard to add this. :smile:
@rp- Any idea if creating a zip from the contents of an installed version will work ok? (I can prob try it tomorrow, I just need sleep atm)
yes should work
Cool, I'll make .zip files tonight for the windows binaries.
@jonorozcoc Would you be willing to create the .zip files instead?
Is it small enough to email?  If so, try emailing it to me at justin@postgresql.org.  I'll try it out. :smile:
Oh, we should not include VC2013 yet.  We need to understand the license terms for that bit first. :wink:
Yep, this sounds useful. :smile:
@schdub wrote code to make this happen, and it's merged into our main code base a few minutes ago. :smile:
In my quick testing here, it seems to work well. :grin:
@JC3 Would you be ok to try it out and confirm it's working the way you want?
I'm not sure which OS you're using, but if it's Windows or MacOS then tomorrow's "nightly build" will include it.  (download locations for our nightly builds are on the front page of our repo)
@JC3 Do you have time to try our latest nightly build? We've [updated the code](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/260) we use for the Execute SQL tab, and it now supports Tab for multi-line indent (plus more).
This is definitely fixed now in the new 3.6.0 release. :smile:
[Example here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/234#issuecomment-84955263), if that helps.
> Adding "END TRANSACTION" can have catastrophic consequences if my main app is running at the same time which sadly is how I found this problem in the first place.
How is that possible? different database connections cannot interfere each other?
But option1 with sqlite3_stmt_readonly sounds reasonable.
@lridgard Any interest in submitting a pull request with the change? :smile:
Oh wow.  Yeah, all of that sounds good. :grin:
With the situation you mention of the main app complaining... I suspect it might be something to do with the way SQLite locks tables to do writes.  It's been ages since I looked at the fine details though, so that's a rough guess thing. :wink:
Hmmmm... a thought just occurred...
How about in the "Execute SQL" window, we have a line with a checkbox somewhere like:
&nbsp; &nbsp; [✓] Run inside transaction
We leave it on by default, but that would let people turn it off as needed.
?
@lridgard I already did the msvc stuff in https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/8cbc13a106a680e7e1ce97e2e49bb85eb80e9d8f so if you have the dependencies and the paths correctly set in cmake it should work.
Yeah, this makes sense. :smile:
well, there is a difference between NULL and empty string, that's why there is a clear button.
maybe a key like shift-(delete, backspace) make it faster to edit such columns
For me, on OSX, the delete and backspace keys don't do anything at present.  Are they supposed to already be the equivalent of making a null string? (just checking)
It does sound reasonable to have something like delete / backspace be the "make an empty string" keystroke, with shift-delete / shift-backspace being the "make a NULL" key combination.
Can we close this now that for issue #443 we've implemented the Delete and Alt+Delete shortcuts?
Good point, lets do that. :smile:
A bug report is fine. :smile:
I had a similar question not long ago too... and it turns out there's a bug in the current release which makes it hard.
First you'll probably want to grab the latest nightly build (has the bug fixed).
Then, to set a null value you edit the cell in question, then "clear" the field (there's a button).
![01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/7099960/2687dc24-dffe-11e4-93f9-140f38a0282c.png)

The result should be a NULL field:
![screen shot 2015-04-11 at 03 51 48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/7099963/2f26fce8-dffe-11e4-887a-fb237d8552ca.png)
Let me know if that doesn't work for you? :smile:
Hmmm, it's similar to that, so it might be the same thing.
Would you be ok to try the latest nightly build and see if it still happens wrongly there?
Awesome.  Thanks for trying it out to be sure. :grin:
ADD:
- export SQL options dialog (referenced in issue #242);
- option: Keep column names in INSERT INTO (false by default, store in settings);
- option: New INSERT INTO SQLite 3.7.11 syntax (false by default, store in settings);
- select table(s) to export.
FIX:
- Export sql doesn't name insert columns #242.
@schdub This is failing on the Travis test.  Are you ok to investigate? :smile:
Also, with this Pull Request, would you be ok to squash all of those several commits into one?
Ok. I'm newbie on github: sorry about this.
It's no problem at all.  We all started out doing this same thing too. :wink:
The error info is here, if that helps: :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://travis-ci.org/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/jobs/58024669
@glawrence Awesome. :grimacing:
Just scanned over it, and adjusted the wording slightly for (I think) slightly better readability.  Does it still sound ok to you now? :smile:
Yep, fully agreed.  Btw, on that note, is [this](https://github.com/nickdesaulniers/What-Open-Source-Means-To-Me/issues/20) your kind of thing? :smile:
@glawrence and @justinclift thank you guys for help.
@schdub To me, this code seems well structured, and has a reasonable amount of comments.  I haven't yet compiled the code to try it out (I will tonight), but it seems ok.
The hard coded strings in English I'm unsure about though.  It would be good if we can make them translated strings instead.
@justinclift not sure I complete understend your point about hardcoded english strings. See file ExprortCsvDialog.ui for example, there are also present "hardcoded" strings like:
<string>&amp;Column names in first line</string>
<string>Field &amp;separator</string>
Its standard practique in Qt to write in .ui files text in English.
To add translation for new strings we need to regenerate *.ts files
for every translations. Stardart Qt-way to it - is lupdate command,
but your project build by CMake:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24095800/qt-internationalization-and-cmake-how-to-update-ts-and-dont-lose-them
in Qt Linguist open updated .ts files and add translations for new
Next we need to regenerate .qm (lrelease). Not sure how it's works
on Travis.
You are correct about the hardcoded strings in the other files.  I didn't know about them before this, so this was a new thing for me. :smile:  (I am not a coder :wink:)
I'm looking through the links you gave, to better understand this.
@rp- Do you have a few minutes to look over the code for this PR?  To my non-C++ mind it looks ok. :smile:
@schdub I've just tried this code out... and I really like this.  It even has a progress bar. :grinning:
Hmmm, I'm just going to merge it.  We can fix any issues with it up later. :smile:
This is very welcome @schdub. :smile:
Btw, I fixed the "Multiply" → "Multiple" typo here: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/8a9380ef41b496a51822b54d6ec7d9fb29854dab
Seems to work still. :grinning:
celloman, please provide your table schema to reproduce this issue.
I kind of suspect it's because we're compiling using 32 bit on Windows (win32), and not 64 bit.
@schdub Would you happen to have any skill with Windows compilers?  eg Visual Studio or anything :smile:
@celloman Would you be ok to try this again with our new release from a few hours ago?  We have a 64-bit windows version, which (in theory) should open larger database files now like yours.
Awesome!
@rp- Looks like it was the 32-vs-64 bit builds.  Thanks for working on that. :smile:
Hmmmm, kinda thinking that forcing /usr at the start of the install path isn't the correct approach.  Wouldn't the right approach be for the installer to not put things under /usr/local?  If so, that sounds like an install time option thing doesn't it?
@lbartoletti This PR will affect the FreeBSD packaging won't it?  If so, any thoughts? :smile:
@DiegoQueiroz Oh, just to double check... this problem is with the current git master head isn't it?  You're not meaning this problem is with a packaged version from a .ppa or something? :smile:
Thanks for investigating guys.  This does sound like a Mint issue.  Lets leave this open for now, and see what happens with https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/4026. :smile:
@glawrence Yeah, but this particular change is hard coding a base path.  That will break anything which DOES use /usr/local.  eg the BSDs
Sure.  The bug is likely in our version of a Makefile, where's it's setting the path wrongly in some variable.  If we can figure out which one we should be good. :smile:
@schdub @rp- Do you guys have thoughts about this?  I'm thinking that hard coding the / in the path isn't really correct.  There might be some environment variable or similar that needs to be set instead.
?
I'm thinking there should be something in our build process which detects the correct path, and that's what needs fixing.  Hard coding / at the start is a workaround.
If that's the only way to do things though, then yeah, I'm ok with it.  @deepsidhu1313 is our official packager for .deb's, so might have some insight/thoughts on this. :smile:
Closing this, as we'll need to figure out a better solution instead of hard coding the root directory location.  The install location needs to be relocatable, not hard coded.
I closed the pull request, as it's not the correct approach.  There's also been no further development on this in many months... so I'm calling time on it for now. :wink:
Just to be super clear, when you say a licence header file, are you meaning the project GPL/MPL licensing info? :smile:
If so, I'm not sure that needed.  Our repository has a license info pretty clearly included, and the [bundled libraries](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/tree/master/libs) also have their own licence files included in their individual directories.  I could be wrong though. :wink:
@richardfontana - Is this needed?  Looking at our [GPL licence here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/LICENSE#L639-L640) it does have:
```
... and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the
full notice is found.
```
... and that seems pretty clear that we should.  The Mozilla license though does state it's ok to just include itself in a likely spot (such as a main. LICENSE file).
Thanks Richard. :grinning:
@dridk Closing this, as it looks like it's unnecessary.  Thanks for taking the time to open the issue, and get us to look into it though.  Hopefully cuterest goes really well. :smile:
Well, it pretty much means when you're creating something from this project, you can choose whichever of the two licenses best suits you, OR you can use both of them.
eg, if you're creating something to put in (say) the Apple Store - which forbids GPL usage I think - you'd want to use the Mozilla license for that.  You're obliged to only follow the Mozilla license terms then.
Conversely, you can do the same thing, but using the GPL license version instead.
Or, you could do what we do, and just do both. :smile:
It's really up to you. :grinning:
Does that help?
Hmmm yeah, that doesn't sound good. :frowning:
Awesome!  Thank you @schdub for this, and thank you @DongilKim for checking and letting us know. :grinning:
Hmmmm, needing to import columns in a different order than defined in a csv file is pretty unusual (I think anyway).  I doubt we'll do this... but if someone sends in a patch to make it happen we'll happily merge it. :smile:
I think I'm mistaken.
I think what I was saying is that within a table I can change the column order, but I cannot change a table order of an import. Sorry about that.
best,
jb  Yeah, that makes sense.  We'll probably need some kind of dialog so people can choose their preferred options too. :smile:
Do you want to take a look and make sure it would work for your situation?  The nightly build (tomorrow) would have the changes included, if that helps. :smile:
Closing this as it was fixed ages ago. :smile:
@schdub This sounds like the kind of thing you would know how to do.
Do you have any interest in doing this? :smile:
@justinclift, ок. Waiting when my previous pull-request will be merged.
@schdub Done. :smile:
Can we close this issue? The feature should be in the code since v 3.6.0 :smile:
Sure. :smile:
should be fixed:
cecf681620e4911a70e02884fe03fea15b73b558
Cool. :smile:
@rp- Thoughts? :smile:
> I am usung now SQLiteStudio since two weeks (sorry guys :)) and works like a charm :)
That's no worries.  When there's a problem that needs solving I often use whatever works first too. :wink:
@rp- Sounds like the fix really didn't work. :wink:
well, all i did was enabling to have tables without rowid and pks of any type, as allowed by sqlite3.
I think we still don't really support editing tables without rowid, because most of our code depends on it.
``` sql
CREATE TABLE `test` (
`Field1`    TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
`Field2`    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
PRIMARY KEY(Field1)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```
In the latest development version of SQLite, however, I couldn't reproduce this anymore.
Ok.  What's the right way forward here?  Should we go back to having "without rowid" only for numeric columns?
Ok, to quickly summarise the situation:
- The UNIQUE TEXT primary key thing is a SQLite bug which seems to be fixed in the latest version. So I suggest ignoring this one.
- Without Rowid table are more or less supported, so editing, deleting, adding, etc. of rows works most of the times. I don't think there's any code left which really depends on the rowid column, the only remaining issues may occur because we don't handle some situations not entirely correct yet.
- One of this was the text primary key thing. The SQLite documentation says the primary key column in a without rowid table must be numeric but apparently this isn't the case. @fu-hsi is right that most of our code assumed the primary key was numeric which caused a lot of trouble when it wasn't. The commit I've just pushed _should_ fix these issues, so we handle non-numeric primary keys correctly.
So I think we don't need to go back because it as easy enough to fix the problematic parts. The new code needs a bit of testing (in a scenario like the one described in this issue as well as under normal circumstances) but should fix all the problems described in this issue (except for the SQLite bug that is of course).
Cool. :smile:
Is this something we should ask @fu-hsi to test again in the next nightly build?
Yes definitely, if he has the time and motivation :smile:
Somebody willing to test this? If not I'd suggest closing this issue and if there should be any more problems with this it can always be reopened.
Definitely sounds like a bug. :smile:
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/229 may be the same thing too.
@justinclift, on my local repo I've fix to this bug.
long story short: in SqliteTableModel when setTable() is called need to fetch and store data types of each field of DB.
next, in  DBbrowserDB::updateRecord() append argument - bool isBlob.
and then in code this function:
//...
```
if (isBlob) {
sqlite3_bind_blob(...)
} else {
sqlite3_bind_text(...)
}
//...
```
and we can rewrite "Cheap BLOB test here..." function to:
```
bool SqliteTableModel::isBinary(const QModelIndex& index) const
{
return m_vDataTypes.at(index.column()) == SQLITE_BLOB;
}
```
PS: this solution will be work incorrect if need DB with values of multiple data types in one field.
PPS: waiting to resolve situation with my last pull-request.
In theory it should be now, due to the fix by @schdub.  But, it's always good to verify. :smile:
Interesting. :smile:
@gimKondo Would you have time to check if this is fixed in [our new 3.9.0 release](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.9.0)?
I **think** it is, because the new release checks the data type for each cell, instead of only checking the column.  So, this new release should be more accurate. :smile:
Closing this due to lack of response. 😦
We support Linux already.  Some distributions already package us, though maybe not the very latest version.
Which Linux distribution are you using?  If a package for us doesn't exist, would you be interested in creating/maintaining one? :smile:
Btw - Instructions to compile on Linux are in [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md).  It's pretty easy. :wink:
Sure.  If you can put together an initial PPA for Mint, we can add it to the download locations on the front page.  We can also include you in the release process (eg emails :smile:), so that Mint has packages ready for people at release time.
How does that sound? :smile:
Awesome. We're planning on releasing v3.6.0 in a few weeks, on 18th April (roughly):
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/milestones
So, you have some time. :smile:
for reference there is an PPAR for an older version. As I don't have really the time and motivation to keep the PPA up to date:
Cool. :smile:
Thanks for the report Jay.  This is fixed in the nightly builds already.  Well, in theory it is. :smile:
Are you ok to grab the latest nightly build and try that, just to make sure? (locations are listed on the front page of this repo)
I think this is the bug where it's identified and fixed, if that helps: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/203
If it turns out this is not the same bug, and you hit it with our latest code, then yeah, it's a real bug that needs fixing still. :smile:
It's no worries at all. :grin:
If something else weird/not-great turns up, please report that too. (really) :smile:
Yeah, lets omit it. :smile:
Excellent. Yep, the licensing info is fine. :smile:
Now, lets see if @hughsie can look it over and approve.  @hughsie ?
@hughsie What's the vertical / horizontal padding warning about?
Gotcha.  How important is it?
Preferably, I'd strongly like to be able to ignore those two warnings.  Bulking out our git repo just to fix these warnings... not really a fan of that idea.
?
Hmmmm, if we can have the screenshots in a different repo, that might be the solution.  That would avoid bulking out our main source repo.
k, I'll create a "screenshots" repo here and we can have them in there.  That'll avoid bulking out the repo size for 99.9% of people using the source. :smile:
k, new repo created here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/db4s-screenshots
We can add screenshots in there (Pull Requests accepted btw), and then choose a suitable one for the AppData file.
I'll get some updated screenshots into the repo in a few hours.  I have some that @MKleusberg @rp- and @piacentini (I think) emailed to me a while ago, which I never got around to committing.  If @samir-aguiar or anyone else wants to directly commit some or do a PR on the screenshot repo with new ones, that's good too.
@glawrence If the screenshots aren't ready by the end of tonight (unlikely, but could happen), then I'll just merge this change as-is and we can do the screenshot update later. :smile:
@glawrence Did them right away instead.  They're for v3.3 (interface is pretty much the same).
Are any of them suitable, with the 16:9 restriction?  If so, pick one.  Your choice. :smile:
@glawrence Cool.  Btw, would you be ok to merge the commits into a single one?  Makes it better/easier for the repo history that way. :smile:
Sure, there are a few ways to do it.  This way (below) is the way I generally do it, out of bad habit. :wink: (but it works)
So, first jump into your git repo directory, and do a git log to see what's what:

sqlitetablemodel: Don't apply NULL fields colours to BLOB fields
```
This shows the commits you've added since Samir's last one.  What we want to do is rewind the commit log back to Samirs commit, then add your new files in one brand new commit.
So, using the id for Samir's commit - c3c8f8ce568114d7aae1ae263e03390617c7c878 - do this:
```
$ git reset c3c8f8ce568114d7aae1ae263e03390617c7c878
Unstaged changes after reset:
M   CMakeLists.txt
$ git add CMakeLists.txt
$ git commit
```
It will ask you for the new commit message, and will do a new commit right after Samir's.  Do a git log again, to verify it seems sane:
```

```
Except it will have your new commit in there instead of my bogus example one. :smile:
Then push it back here to GitHub, which should automagically :wink: update this issue with it.
Workable?
Thanks @glawrence, that's Awesome. :grin:
The [wiki needs helping along](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/226), if you're up for it? :smile:
Yeah, that doesn't sound good.
Which version are you using, and on which OS?
Hmmm, it happens here on OSX 10.9.5 too, using our latest code:
![screen shot 2015-03-20 at 18 53 36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6758762/951c77ee-cf32-11e4-9e2b-9726e2607ab5.png)
@yura371 File → Compact Database works for me though.  Is that good enough for you for now?
![screen shot 2015-03-20 at 19 07 10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6758990/62322494-cf34-11e4-883e-baf80c10fc96.png)
this doesn't work, because internally we create a transaction around all statements in the execute sql editor. And VACUUM can't be run within an transaction.
As a workaround use the "compact Database", from the menu as suggested.
@rp- Interesting.  This seems to work if someone **really** needs a way to run vacuum instead of doing the Compact Database option for some reason:
![screen shot 2015-03-23 at 11 17 56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6778882/8bddb972-d14e-11e4-95d8-c9aff2323ad1.png)
Closing this for now, as it seems like something we're not going to change.
"Compact database" is hopefully a workable alternative instead. :smile:
The 'Compact database' is just a GUI element for calling the vacuum function, so it's not even really a workaround in a technical sense but just exactly the required function here :)
Excellent. :smile:
Yep, just confirmed it on OSX 10.9 with our latest code. :wink:
Thanks for pointing it out. :smile:
Thanks @samir-aguiar, tried it here and it seems good to me as well. :smile:
@AndreasMartin72 Do you have a few minutes to try the latest nightly build (tomorrow), and verify if it's working properly for you? :smile:
Oops yeah, you'd need to wait until tomorrow because the nightly build process hasn't run yet. :smile:
Awesome.  Thanks for testing it and getting back to us Andreas. :smile:
Interesting.  I'll try this out after work to get a better idea what you mean, although I kind of think I know already. :smile:
Which version of DB4S and OS are you using btw?
Cool. :smile:
On OSX 10.9 here, and I'm trying it out now.  It seems to be **trying** to page through results by 100 at a time, but getting it wrong for the first page worth.  Here's an example... I've resized the window to just show the first 10 results:
![screen shot 2015-03-19 at 23 31 43](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6743317/258c7d72-ce90-11e4-97b0-b17ab6efab07.png)
Now I click the single > right arrow:
![screen shot 2015-03-19 at 23 32 37](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6743326/45b9dedc-ce90-11e4-80e6-fdf4959d9e42.png)
Then I click it again:
![screen shot 2015-03-19 at 23 33 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6743335/5b8c9bc8-ce90-11e4-987f-3fe791331e57.png)
And again:
![screen shot 2015-03-19 at 23 34 16](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6743345/7bbd6940-ce90-11e4-832c-a6fe02097e4f.png)
Next I make the window a bit bigger, and click the single > again:
![screen shot 2015-03-19 at 23 34 58](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6743360/a02162fa-ce90-11e4-8f87-7e7de583706a.png)
Interestingly, the cursor is (I guess correctly) placed on row 1, then 101, then 201, then 301, then 401.  I think it's just the window positioning (eg not 101-110, 201-210), which is making it look really inconsistent.
Thoughts?
Are we able to control the positioning of the cursor in the window, so the cursor keeps it's current position in the window?  eg if it's on the first row when the arrow is pressed, the new window still has it on the first row
Kinda thinking it might be tricky, but then again I don't know Qt. :wink:
Ahhh, so the correct approach here is probably to determine how many rows are visible in the Browse Data tab, then have the next/previous pagination buttons move by that value.
Changing the size of the window would change that too of course. Just tried to implement the pagewise scrolling. But I think it needs some more testing.
Also, the code for calculating the number of currently visible rows if off by one for me, and thus is the page-wise scrolling. Does anybody else have this issue, too? You can check by looking at the row numbers at the bottom of the window and comparing them to the row numbers in the table view. Trying this out here on OSX, and it's a lot better now than the previous step-by-100 behaviour. :smile:

Wonder if this is a Qt bug more than a DB4S bug? Actually, it looks a lot better on your system than on mine. In your case it's (as far as I can see) just that we're counting the last "visible" row even if it's just one pixel high. That doesn't make a lot of sense but there's not that much we can do about it because only counting fully visible rows is no alternative either. And only counting rows that are more than x % visible will always be messy because all possible values for x are arbitrary. On the other hand we can play around with this and test it. But...
Hmmmm, on OSX 10.9 here, and it doesn't seem to be wrong for me.  For example, the sort column here is the "hour" column.  The little arrow is pointing downward which should mean biggest to smallest, and the sort order is doing that:
![screen shot 2015-03-19 at 23 53 55](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6743547/3c5c720c-ce93-11e4-850d-cd15d9c57855.png)
It seems to be correct in the other direction too:
![screen shot 2015-03-19 at 23 55 18](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6743565/6bd9c21e-ce93-11e4-8026-cf22326e145c.png)
If it's not doing this for you, are you ok to screenshot the problem?
Interesting.  What data type is the parent_list_id field defined with there?
Just tried out the behaviour for this before-vs-after, and yeah, you guys are right.  Here's a sort showing the wrong order (from the commit right before this one):
![screen shot 2015-03-22 at 20 49 40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6771413/0ebb98e8-d0d5-11e4-850a-b852a90b2d5c.png)

Here's the same thing, but compiled with the fix:
![screen shot 2015-03-22 at 20 54 26](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6771439/ab0639d8-d0d5-11e4-8eb2-1e6e664bfa96.png)

Seems good now. :grinning:
@harrisrap Would you have a few minutes to try out the nightly build (tomorrow), and let us know if that works properly for you? :smile:
No worries. :smile:
**1**. Remove the existing DB4S / SQLite Browser application from your /Applications list.
**2**. Grab the .dmg here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/nightly/sqlitebrowser_20150325.dmg
**3**. Open that dmg file (double click on it in Finder), then drag-n-drop the sqlitebrowser.app file to your /Applications folder.
In theory, that should install the latest nightly build.  If it doesn't for some reason, let us know. :smile:
Awesome. You've nailed another one perfectly @samir-aguiar. :grin:
@harrisrap Thank you very much for reporting the problem, and verifying the fix.  It really helps. :smile:
Just tried importing an image file into a database field, but the file selector isn't working correctly.
![screen shot 2015-03-18 at 19 54 10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6718086/0178777a-cda9-11e4-8cca-bf670016667e.png)
The "image" and "all" selectors aren't letting me select the .jpg files in the folder, as shown.
Hmmm, looks like it's been sitting there unfixed for about a year. :frowning:
As a workaround for us for now, maybe we should make the "All files (*)" filter the default?  That way people can at least select stuff.
I had to rename the file I wanted to use (an image) to .txt, just so I could recognise it.  Doesn't seem fantastic. :wink:
How about we #ifdef the other filters on OSX, so only the All Files one is there?  That should be a "it just works" solution for users shouldn't it, and a bunch less effort than subclassing? :smile:
Thanks, that's working perfectly. :smile:
Which version is it happening for, and on which OS?
I've just tried it here on my desktop (OSX 10.9) using our latest nightly build.  For me it worked fine, with the export file being the exact same size as the imported file.
This is what I did to import it:
1. Open a database (a test one I often use)
2. Edited a field (type "REAL", but it should not matter)
3. Changed the type to "binary" (I do not know if that is important)
4. Imported original.jpg
5. "Write Changes" to the database, then quit
To export it, this is what I did:
1. Open the database
2. Edit the field
3. "Export" button.  Saved the image.
The exported image is the same size as original.jpg for me.
Does that help at all?
@Z4us Well, by "edited a field" I mean I double clicked on it in the Browse Data tab, so it brought up the dialog with the import and export buttons.
@yura371 Would you be ok to try our latest nightly build, and let us know if the problem is completely fixed for you?
In theory it should be now, due to the fix by @schdub.  But, it's always good to verify. :smile:
I've just tried to reproduce this but weren't successful. The exported file with twice the size looks like it's been treated as a Unicode text file during export. But I have no idea how to make DB4S doing this...
The only thing I noticed is that importing an image into a field and then editing the table schema destroyed the image data (but by deleting bytes rather than adding bytes).
So _I think_ we can close this issue and assume it's fixed in the latest build if there's no follow-up information on this coming.
Edit: Now I'm taking back the data corruption from table schema editing, too. This probably happened because I single clicked into the cell first, thus opening the inline editor which doesn't handle binary data correctly.
What do we need to do, to make it handle binary data correctly? :smile:
@MKleusberg Any idea what the status of this one is?
Closing this due to lack of response.
``` sql
CREATE TABLE orders(
id INTEGER,
customerID INTEGER,
date TEXT,
);
```
Of course this should work anyway and a crash is a bit of a overdramatic reaction :smile: I've just pushed a fix for this issue. If you want to try out the latest version with the fix applied you have to use our nightly builds from http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/ Luckily, because it's already night here in Europe, the new version should be there in half an hour or so.
@lallousx86 Reminder ping... :smile:
Awesome.  Thanks for checking and confirming back to us @lallousx86. :smile:
Placeholder issue for wiki pages we should add:
- ~~[How to use regular expressions in the Execute SQL tab](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Regular-Expressions), as [added here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/6d1a874f8077b859bee2dd9d4031f242cfa1e807) by~~ @MKleusberg. - [Done](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Regular-Expressions) by @glawrence :)
- How to translate language files, as [added here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/182#issuecomment-70413095) by @MKleusberg.
- How SQLCipher encryption works
- ~~How to [Squash several commits into one, ready for merging](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Merging-Commits)~~ - [Done](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Merging-Commits) by @glawrence :)
- Purpose/description info on what our project files do
- How to create an encrypted database (and/or encrypt an existing one)
- How to build on Windows, including SQLCipher support (assigned to @glawrence)
Anyone wanting to help out is definitely welcome (and encouraged!) to begin or improve any of these pages [in the wiki](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki)! :grinning:
Good thinking.  And yeah, we should add stuff here as we think of it. :smile:
Just added one more, too :)
@glawrence You really are pretty amazing.  That's truly awesome.  Thank you. :grinning:
I've just tweaked the wording a bit, and added a screenshot for clarity too.  (turns out adding screenshots isn't straightforward, but it is possible)
Added an item for making a wiki page to explain what our project files are for.  As I don't seem to have gotten around to it in https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/35. :wink:
Added an item for "How to create an encrypted database (and/or encrypt an existing one)".  @glawrence Any interest in that? :smile:
@glawrence Definitely needs some screenshots added.  Do you have something that runs the SQLCipher versions and can do them with?
Ahhh, the soft borders is an automatic thing done by the inbuilt OSX screenshot key combo.  :wink:
I'll get some screenshots done for the SQLCipher stuff done at some point, as I think it'll help. :grin:
I agree, it would help. To be fair images have always been an Apple strong point.
I am working on documenting the Windows build process, which will start as a Wiki page. Some issues to refer to are as follows:
[Complete quoting for parameters of some CMake commands #58](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/58)
[Build sqllitebrowser from source, sqlcipher support (Windows) #482](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/482)
[ Autocomplete table name on export #484 ](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/484)
[Build fails on Windows 10 with Qt 5.6 #525](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/525)
Any update on the build wiki? Also, will it apply to OSX too? I want to contribute but I'm not able to build and run the project. And I don't know how to use Qt creator. I would want to know how to open an IDE and view the source code, build it and run it. I created a Qt project from the `CMakeLists.txt` file but didn't see any source code.
One more thing: We need to update the wiki page on using the filters. There are two things that changed in the meantime:
1) We've added a range operator (```1~5```). See #939.
2) We've changed the default behaviour when no operator is specified. In the Wiki it says that for text a case-independent exact search is performed by default. But that isn't true anymore. What we do now is add ```%``` in the front and at the end of the search string. So filtering for ```b``` actually queries ```%b%```. To override this you have to use the ```=``` operator (```=b```) or manually add ```%``` characters: ```b%``` doesn't expand to ```%b%%`. Just added a new wiki page listing the more hidden keyboard shortcuts that I know of: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Keyboard-shortcuts Feel free to extend it :smiley:  Couple of questions.. :smile:
- Which version of DB4S (new acronym for SQLite Browser) are you trying with?
- Which Operating system are you using?
If the file is not too big (eg couple of MB's), and the info in it isn't confidential, you can email it to me directly (justin@postgresql.org) and I'll see if I can figure it out.
Just took a look through them, and they don't appear to be with SQLite version 3, nor SQLite version 2 database files.
There's definitely data of some sort in them, as using "vi -b" or even "strings" on them shows bits of text in them.
Sorry to say, but I have no idea what you can open them with. :frowning:
Good luck. :smile:
Btw - Don't get stressed about the "Invalid".  It's just so I can scan down the closed bug list quickly when preparing our next release. :smile:
Yeah, I tend to agree with this.  Had the same thought the other day, but didn't get around to turning it into a proper issue here.
Thanks for doing so. :smile:
Hmmm... actually no, I've just remembered we've had discussion about this before and it turns out there are several viewpoints on it.  (it's in previous issues here if you want to investigate)
There is a way forward, but I'd need to go and dig through the issues again myself to refresh my memory first... :wink:
This should be fixed in the 3.7.0 release where we've introduced a new option to the Preferences dialog to change this behaviour. This way everybody should be happy :smiley:
![lastlocation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/8273318/9c697f04-1868-11e5-9791-7dce9ff25cfe.png)
If there are no objections I think we can close these issue soon.
Good thinking @MKleusberg. :smile:
Closing this as it's been reported to work in issue #276. If there still should be any problems with this feel free to re-open the issue or open a new one.
Interesting.  I'll take a look after work today. :smile:
Just took a look now instead, and yep, you're right.  This is what's showing for me on OSX 10.9.5:
![screen shot 2015-03-11 at 14 15 26](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6598089/297766ba-c7f9-11e4-8dcb-1e4017d599dc.png)
The same thing is on Linux and even on the commandline client.
So my guess is that the database didn't get correctly converted to a UTF16 sqlite3 db or the strings are not correctly converted to UTF8 strings
You're completely welcome to re-open this though, if you find out the original data really is ok somehow. :smile:
Hmmm... thinking it through more... it doesn't appear to be something wrong with the data.  Here's what it looks like in Navicat for SQLite (just grabbed their trial):
![screen shot 2015-03-11 at 16 16 07](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6600864/fcd02fa0-c809-11e4-8e74-22a3a665bce4.png)
Awesome, thanks for looking into it @samir-aguiar.
Is this something we should try to recognise and work around (similar to Navicat), or are we good as-is?
Kind of wondering if there's a way to detect bad data, so we could at least warn the user.  No idea how feasible that really is though. :wink:  If it's a major undertaking, then lets not bother. :smile:
k.  Sounds like we should mark this off as "won't fix", because although technically possible to deal with... it's an edge case for dealing with bad data and is likely a lot of effort.
Although, if someone does come along and contribute a fix/patch to address the problem, we'll happily merge it. :smile:
Sounds useful. :smile:
Thanks Martin. :smile: Seems to work well here for the standard SQLite build:
![screen shot 2015-03-11 at 20 32 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6606220/d9a8c414-c82d-11e4-8a2f-9eb9606b08ab.png)
I haven't tried with the SQLCipher build yet.  Having some issues on my local system after a recent Xcode software update. :innocent:
It's exactly the same in the SQLCipher version. However, I haven't added the OpenSSL version (though that would be nice to have) because SQLCipher doesn't seem to report it anywhere and I can't think of a sane way of getting it from somewhere else.
k, lets ask the SQLCipher people if there's already a way, or if they think it's a good idea to add in their future releases. :smile:
Just asked on the SQLCipher forum:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://discuss.zetetic.net/t/how-to-retrieve-the-openssl-version-in-use-by-sqlcipher/466
Lets see what happens. :smile:
Cool, looks like it'll be available in future SQLCipher versions.  We might want to keep this issue open until then, when we can add the relevant bits.
@MKleusberg Would it be feasible to add the git Commit ID in the About dialog, when DB4S is compiled from git manually?
&nbsp; &nbsp; eg same thing that detects master_git, but puts something like "git master commit c3c8f8ce568114d7aae1ae263e03390617c7c878" instead
Ooohhh, just noticed GitHub turned that full Commit ID in my example above into a URL link to the direct commit in the source.  That would be cool in our About dialog... just saying. :grinning:
Strange, I can't reproduce this... Are you sure you're using the latest version? You can check this by clicking on the Help->About menu item; it should be 3.5.1.
Closing this issue as we haven't had any updates on this for some time now. If the problem still pesists please feel free to reopen this issue, @grahamlabdon :smile:
At the moment, the default background colour for NULL fields is a very strong red.  It makes things seem like there's an error, when there's not:
![screen shot 2015-03-09 at 13 37 50](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6555908/8287b6ae-c661-11e4-96d3-94a9feda660a.png)

Even lighter might be better too (unsure).  It depends on how the colour displays across a wide selection of monitors...
[side question - how does a person reset an existing field with a value to NULL?  I just tried and didn't find a reliable method. :frowning: In the edit dialog for a field, changing to "binary" then clicking "clear" and exiting works initially, but then the table goes white/non-NULL again after changing to the Database Structure tab and back again (sounds like a bug really) :wink:]
Yep, looks workable to me too.  Clean look, clear info.  Pretty good. :smile:
Actually, is it easy to have the "NULL fields" title at the top of the containing box be a bit more um... stand out?  Bolder or underlined or errr... something?
Not at all critical, but I'm just thinking "it's the heading for the stuff below" and it's not really standing out as a heading that much.  Yet. :wink:
Looking good.  Is there a way to horizontally centre the "NULL" string in the field?
Hmmmm, just tried it.  It's showing centred in the Preferences dialog, but not for the fields themselves in the Browse Data tab?

Is it showing centred in the Browse Data tab fields for you?
Then again... I'm kind of wondering if centering the NULL text in the Browse Data tab will actually look ok when the data-filled fields themselves are left aligned... :wink:
Um, try it out, see what you think, and let us know?
Hmmm yeah.  I think you're right.  It looks good centred in the Preferences dialog bit, but in the Browse Data tab... not so much.  Leave it left aligned. :smile:
Awesome.  Just tried it out, and NULL values are now kept correctly.  No more reverting back to blank spaces at every opportunity.
They're written out to disk correctly now too, so things set to NULL **keep** as NULL.  Until changed on purpose of course.
Thanks @samir-aguiar I think this is an important fix.  Kinda feels like we'd been missing foundational data handling, having this busted. :wink:
When you say "misaligned", would you be ok to screenshot it and add it here?  (dragging and dropping images into these comment fields works)
It's kind of hard to visualise the problem without a screenshot.  Not impossible... but a screenshot would really help. :smile:
@Z4us Thanks.  Looking now... incredibly slow web server though (27KB/s). :frowning:
@Z4us They're both SQLite database files.
@atoregozh I've downloaded example.db and exported the result table to a .csv file.  The file is hugely wide though, so can't be sensibly viewed in my OSX Terminal window.  How are you viewing it? (a screenshot really would be helpful btw :smile:)
Excellent.  Thanks for verifying and letting us know @atoregozh. :smile:
Interesting, that seems to have loaded it ok.  I wonder why our latest code isn't working with it. :frowning:
Um, how big is that database file?  If it's not too big, are you ok to email it to me or something (justin@postgresql.org)?  I'll see if I can figure out what's wrong with it, and if not, I'll forward it to our main developers for having a look.
the file didn't load, check the output, the directory doesn't even exists:
if sqlite3 is called with a non existent file, it will just create a new database.
@rp- Yeah, saw that.  Am figuring the only way to be sure is to take a look at it and see what's what. :wink:
In theory, there shouldn't be anything that can stop it from getting through this time. :smile:
Yep, got it this time.  It's definitely a SQLite3 database file, and DB4S opened it ok on my system.
Now, we just need to figure out why recent versions of DB4S aren't working on yours.
As a first thought, which version of DB4S have you downloaded to try?  If you're not sure, would you be ok to grab the latest version **without encryption** and try that?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/v3.5.1/sqlitebrowser-3.5.1.dmg
Your Cache.db file isn't encrypted, so you don't need the encryption version. :smile:
If it doesn't work, can you screenshot it, and add the screenshot(s) here?
@Oldimac10yrsold Ahhh, I just thought of something.  I kind of suspect your iMac might not be using an Intel processor, which is what our OSX downloads have been made with (so far).
Would you be ok to screenshot your "About this Mac" dialog?  The one that shows the overall system info, from the Apple menu?  For example, this is what mine looks like:
![screen shot 2015-03-09 at 13 07 54](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6555383/5947d80e-c65d-11e4-8f96-796508018fa1.png)
32 bit OS/CPU?
@Oldimac10yrsold In theory, you should be able to compile this on your Mac and it would work.
I'm just trying to think of an easy way for you to do that, as it's normally done from the command line.  There's probably a GUI way to compile it, but it's not coming to mind. (it's very late here, and I'm very tired, so might be able to remember it tomorrow) :wink:
As a side thought, how often do you need to modify the integers?  There's only a few rows, so I can probably just modify them for you and email back the file (this time).  Not right now though. :smile:
@Oldimac10yrsold Is this the model of Mac you're using? :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac_cd_2.0_20.html
I don't have access to any 32-bit OSX systems, and the virtualisation stuff I have either won't run OSX or won't present a 32-bit Intel cpu to it. :frowning:
@Oldimac10yrsold If we can't get this figured out, you may need to use something like [Navicat for SQLite](http://www.navicat.com/products/navicat-for-sqlite).  Their product page says it supports OSX 10.6, and is a 32-bit/64-bit version.  It's a commercial product though. :frowning:
Note - we have no association to the Navicat people.  I was just looking at it earlier today for another bug. :wink:
Out of curiosity, do you have Xcode installed on your iMac?
We might be able to write some clear instructions for you to compile things yourself... but I suspect you might not have the software needed to compile it.
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/onceoffs/sqlitebrowser_32bits.dmg
Oops, that'll be a problem on my end.  I must have gotten the permissions wrong on the server directory...  gimme a minute. :anguished:
Should be good now.  Sorry about that.  I rarely make that kind of dumb mistake, but it does still happen. :smiling_imp:
k.  Next version to try: :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/onceoffs/sqlitebrowser_32bit_20150313.dmg
@Z4us Hmmm, not yet.  It's a good idea though.  We should add something to the About dialog to show the git commit id it was compiled with, if it's on master_git.
Just asked [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/222#issuecomment-81000342), as there's already an open issue being worked on for stuff in the About dialog box.
I think I'll ask my work colleagues at Red Hat if someone has a 32-bit OSX box hanging around, preferably with OSX 10.6.  There's a decent chance... :smile:
Potential way forward.  @CBredesen (colleague at Red Hat) has a suitable OSX box, and we're working on getting the right development bits installed on it. :grin:
Hopefully this works out. :wink:
@cbredesen No worries.  As a first step, run this to get Homebrew to check it's environment for gotchas:
```
$ brew doctor
```
Ideally, it should come back like this:
```
$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.
$
```
Guessing it won't, so we'll need to see what's wrong and address that first.
@Oldimac10yrsold How big is the file?  If it's only a few MB, then maybe email it to me?  I can get it to @samir-aguiar from there. :smile:
Hmmm.  That's a bit big for an email.
Do you have an FTP or SFTP program you're comfortable with?  If you do, I can create an account for you to upload the file somewhere. :smile:
Btw - Sorry this is dragging out so long.  It turns out this is more complicated than it seemed... :frowning:
@cbredesen btw ping... just in case. :smile:
That's Fantastic @cbredesen. :grinning:
Just tried it here on 64-bit OSX 10.9.5 out of curiosity, and it works here too.  Don't really need it myself, but it's interesting to note. :wink:
@Oldimac10yrsold FINALLY! :dancers: Awesome that it works. :grinning:  Hopefully you figure out the data fields you need at some point... :wink:
@cbredesen Thank you, you're a legend. :smile:
Team - we should probably add this specific .dmg file to our Releases page, so anyone else using a 32-bit Mac can also benefit.  It'd be interesting to see the download #'s for it over time too, in case it's not just a very small #.
Not sure how to make it not appear right at the top of our releases list though which probably isn't the right place for it (could confuse people?)... :confused:  Ideas welcome. :smile:
This is a duplicate of #203 and should already be fixed in the nightly build.
@nuzvid Have you had a chance to try out the nightly build, to see if it's fixed for you there? (it should be)
Closing this.
@nuzvid If the latest nightly build doesn't have this fixed for you, please reopen this. :smile:
Query via Twitter:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://twitter.com/BryanMcConkey/status/573115725595844608
```
Any plans to support REGEXP in the Execute SQL tab? I would find this very useful
in testing queries.
```
Thoughts? :smile:
Thinking about this more... we pretty much rely on SQLite to provide the SQL processing part of things.  @BryanMcConkey (hoping that's is the correct GitHub user account :wink:), what's a good example of what you're looking for?
Depending on what/where it may or may not be possible, and we may need to suggest it to upstream SQLite developers first...
Just a bit of background:
SQLite syntax includes the REGEXP keyword but SQLite lacks an implementation of an regular expression algorithm. Instead it tries to call a user-defined function and just errors out if it can't find one: https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#regexp
I have no idea why they do it this way - maybe fore more flexibility or simply to avoid adding dependencies to any other libraries. Either way, they're probably not going to change this :)
Anyway, Qt implements a regex algorithm which is easy enough for us to connect to SQLite. This is done in 6d1a874f8077b859bee2dd9d4031f242cfa1e807. I've also added an option to disable this feature just in case somebody prefers to load their own extension implementing a different algorithm.
@BryanMcConkey You can download the next nightly build (though you'll have to wait till tomorrow) or build the latest code yourself and test this feature. Any feedback is welcome and if you have any further questions feel free to ask us :)
Fantastic news.  Thanks for testing and confirming it @bryanmcconkey. :grinning:
Trying out the new NULL background colour thing, and discovered a minor bug.
1) In the Browse Data tab, with a table open that has NULL values shown correctly (using the colour from preferences)
2) I then go into the Preferences dialog and change the colour.  When I exit the dialog, the fields with NULL values change to (blank) white, instead of the new colour chosen.
Clicking the "New record" button helps, with the new line being the correct colour, and the previously blank fields now also changing to the right colour.
Can provide screenshots if that's needed. :smile:
Sure. :smile:
So, starting with this table:
![start](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6472491/d522f0fc-c1ea-11e4-936b-fc39b9fa2037.png)
I then click the "New Record" button to create a new row:
![new row created](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6472493/da109646-c1ea-11e4-87be-0a0653f25c39.png)
(yeah, it's green - that's just the NULL colour value setting at the time of doing these screenshots)
Not liking the green as NULL, I go into the preferences.  Here you can see the preferences (unchanged):
![pref dialog opened - colour unchanged](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6472505/f9c610ce-c1ea-11e4-8455-758c6657683a.png)
I change the NULL colour to a strong red:
![pref dialog opened - colour changed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6472528/143b333a-c1eb-11e4-8e24-06af5cc46f0a.png)
And now exit the Preferences dialog.  The Browse Data rows have slightly moved up 1/2 a row (23 is only 1/2 visible now - wasn't me doing that), and the cell colour that was green has now gone blank:
![pref dialog closed - last row has gone blank](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6472550/35fbe884-c1eb-11e4-95e2-b822a38b8e5d.png)
When creating new rows though, the displayed NULL colour is using the updated value correctly:
![new rows have the updated colour though](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6472559/4fa529bc-c1eb-11e4-9d6a-0cf67b145739.png)
Kind of suspecting there's something in the "exit the preferences dialog" code that refreshes the view, and it doesn't know about null values having a background colour yet.
I can email you the database if you want.  It's only a couple of kB. :smile:
[edit - typo fix]
Tried it, and no change.  I'll email the database to you. :wink:
Just tried it... not sure if it's fixed or not... :wink:
With that database, I removed the "NOT NULL" constraint for both fields in the table ("Database Structure" tab → modify "Modify Table..."), then went to the Browse Data tab.  Clicked the "New Record" button to add a row, then clicked off of it to un-highlight it.  And got this:
![screen shot 2015-03-06 at 00 26 37](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6517886/88facfde-c397-11e4-9211-14153d1405d4.png)
Doesn't seem right?  Tried it all over again, and it happened both times, so it's consistent...
Ideas? :smile:
We're going to have to do something about the default NULL colour too (need to make a new CR).  It's a super strong red by default, and made me think there was something wrong... :wink:
Hard to tell without the CSV file... - are you, by any chance, able to provide us the file which is causing you trouble? You can also send it by email. Maybe the first 3 lines or so will already suffice for reproducing the problem, so you could check that beforehand if you want to reduce the amount of data.
I've also improved the error messages. They won't be much more detailed in your case but if you're unable to provide the CSV file you can retry the import with tomorrow's nightly build (http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/) and we might be able to narrow down the error source.
@ircer Is this problem still happening for you?
Closing this due to lack of response. Just a nod that if you have a blank CR on the end of a SQL statement, DB4S throws up this 'error'.
Appreciate this is now closed, but if it ever gets reopened and this is referred to, this note'll be found! ;)  This sounds as your used Mac editor wrote Mac line endings CR.
The CSV RFC (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt) specifies CRLF (windows line endings) as line separators.
Interesting.  Guess I've only ever exported CSV files instead of importing them. :wink:
Wonder if it's possible to reliably detect all of the common line endings (*nix, OSX, Windows) and not have to make it an option?
I agree that we should add 'silent' support for CR line endings, so just treat them as LFs and not having a checkbox in the dialog for it. In my opinion we should support as many broken CSV variations as possible (as most CSV files are broken in one way or another according to the RFC).
@samir-aguiar Feel free to change the csvparser code. Maybe adding some more tests before changing it just to make sure it doesn't break anything else.
@atoregozh We have a script which runs every night, compiling the very latest code on MacOSX and leaving it's results here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/nightly/
It's a way for people to test the very latest changes, without needing to wait for an official release.
Please try out the latest build (in a few hours), to verify things are working for you now.  If they're not, it's important to let us know so we can investigate + figure out what else we need to do.
Workable? :smile:
@atoregozh They're both very similar (same GUI), but the -sqlcipher one supports full database encryption as well.  Pick whichever one best meets your needs. :smile:
there is no statement separator after the SAVEPOINT pre.
you need a ';' or sqlite will see this as ONE statement
Not sure if this is a bug in our program?  Does the statement (including the IF NOT EXISTS) work with the standard sqlite3 command line too?  If it doesn't there either, then it sounds like a limitation of SQLite itself (for now anyway).
Thanks @Z4us.  Closing this now. :smile:
@jon80 It's probably best to ask on the SQLite Users mailing list:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mailinglists.sqlite.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/sqlite-users
:smile:
When inputting a bunch of data today, it became a real pain having to click on "New Record" to create each new line.  It would be a bunch more user-friendly for this scenario, if pressing "TAB" when on the very last field of the last record in a table, automatically started a new record and placed the cursor in the first
field of it.
In theory, this should be pretty easy to implement too. :wink:
Oops, missing word.  "became a real pain having to click...".  Fixed.
Thanks for pointing it out. :smile:
Done :smile: Good idea, by the way!
Thanks Martin, trying this out now. :smile:
Yep, well done.  This is a lot nicer to use now, and a lot faster for inputing multiple rows of data. :grinning:
Hmmm, that does sound like a bug which needs fixing.
And yeah, using the registry may not the most portable approach.  Using a .ini file or similar is probably a suitable alternative. :smile:
I've just added a new option to the settings dialog which lets you disable the update check altogether. If you don't want to wait for the next version to have this included, you can wait for the next nightly build (see download links in the README.md file). Either way, all you need to do is removing the tick from the Automatic updates enabled check box in the settings dialog.
As for the registry/INI discussion: This is a bit more complicated than it might seem because loading and writing settings is entirely done by Qt which stores it in a different locations depending on your platform (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsettings.html#platform-specific-notes). Now, it is possible to implement this by ourselves but honestly I don't see a huge benefit. On the other hand this means more work than it looks like at first because we'd have to implement reading and writing of multiple data types, tons of error checking for the reading part, etc. I'm not sure what you want to do with your INI file but if it's just for backups a small batch script exporting the registry keys (maybe of all installed applications) might be a solution. If it's for copying settings between systems, the Portable Apps version of DB4S might be something for you.
@MKleusberg switching to ini file might not be that complicated. We can specify on every platform if you want to store settings in native style(registry on win) or with an ini file. The problem is just, that we would need a proper upgrade mechanism for windows users, so they don't lose their settings. And I'm not sure if this is worth the work.
@MKleusberg What's the right way for us to verify this is working correctly, before our next release?
I'm thinking maybe building a release from latest source, but modify the source to have an older version number in it, so it should notice the update.  And then see if the on/off toggle works.
Sound about right?
@justinclift Yes, that's one possible approach. Maybe it's a bit easier to leave the version number as it is but change the link in [MainWindow.cpp, line 182](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/MainWindow.cpp#L182) to point to a copy of the file in some other place. Then you could change the currentrelease file and test this option as well as the notifications in general (like the patch variable thing from 2c25b7ecb52944db225516a9b41c9f6c1860e749) without recompiling all the time.
But in the end it probably makes no difference which way you choose. Shouldn't take too much time either way :)
The version checking code, and the Preference toggle to disable it, definitely works in the 3.6.0 release.  Tried it earlier. :smile:
Shouldn't be too hard. :smile:
By the way, are you using "Close File" then the recent files list at the moment?
eg:
- File &rarr; Close
- File &rarr; 1
?
All good. :smile:
You don't even have to close the database when reopening it using the history. DB4S does that automatically for you :smile:
Hmmm yeah, both sounds useful.  A "_History Browser_" (that saves between sessions), and a "_Snippet Manager_" to organise often used SQL er... snippets, would be cool.
@sergbus That should be do-able.  We should open a brand new issue here for that though, as the code to make it happen would be tracked separately from @hko-gh's idea. :smile:
@sergbus As an thought, do you have the skill (or desire to learn) to do the implementation for this?
Aha, sounds like a bug.  Which OS, and which version of DB4S (our acronym) are you using? :smile:
@MKleusberg @rp- Any idea how easy a fix this would be?  It sounds like a function call needs to be run after each Execute SQL command.  ?
shouldn't be to hard, just a call to update the stored tables/columns in the texteditor widget after a execute sql was done
@MKleusberg This should be fixed now yeah?
Just tested this with the latest version and it seems to be fixed. No idea when the fix was pushed, sorry for the waiting time :frowning: I'm going to close this issue since it's really old and everything seems to work as expected now. But if any further problems should arise, feel free to reopen this issue :smiley:  @hko-gh Do you have a few minutes to try this out with our latest nightly version, to double check it from your point of view? :smile: You need to download one of the nightly builds (usually version 3.9.99) from here:
https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/
eg:
https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-2017-01-09-win64.exe
v3.9.1 is our 'last release' which doesn't get automatically updated with fixes, etc.
You can install v3.9.99 in its own directory (separate from v3.9.1), and you don't have to uninstall v3.9.1 first... multiple copies/versions of DB4S can co-exist on the same PC. @hko-gh Did you have a chance to try a recent nightly build?  A lot of improvements have happened since our 3.9.1 release. 😄   Installed DB4S 3.5.1 on Windows 7, then looked at the languages available in the Preferences dialog.  It only has "English (United States)" available in the drop down.  Also tried the latest nightly, which has @samir-aguiar's latest code in it, and that has the same limitation.
Wondering if this could be a packaging problem on Windows or something?
Should be fixed after #310.
![screenshot from 2015-05-20 02 10 32](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1304776/7715979/15cdcebe-fe96-11e4-8c3e-c5471c7c7ef9.png)
You must wait for 3.7.0 version or use our Nightly build:
http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
@justinclift, can we close this issue? On screenshot above is .exe from Nightly build.
Yep, lets close it. :smile:
Ouch, that doesn't sound good.  Um, hopefully one of the guys has time to look into it in the next couple of days.
Yep, sounds like a definite bug then.
@StormTrooper Excellent, thanks for testing and confirming back. :smile:
A user on Twitter mentioned that 3.5.0 is crashing on Windows when trying to open an 11GB SQLite database file.
The thought occurred to me that maybe if we can provide a 64-bit windows version (instead of Win32), maybe that would work.
Though, I have absolutely no idea where to even start.  Maybe we need to look into the "free" version of Visual Studio that (from dodgy memory) Microsoft started making available a while back?
Anyone have ideas/thoughts/etc? :smile:
For reference, the problem report on Twitter is here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://twitter.com/MikeSchwert/status/564645625547870208
I'm pretty sure he's not using FAT32.  He wouldn't have an 11GB file to open if he was. :wink:
@glawrence Thanks yeah, that's probably it. :smile:
We now provide a 64-bit windows build (thanks @rp-), so closing this. :smile:
No worries at all. :grinning:
When testing #189, it turns out some of the translations have their Preferences dialog turn up in the wrong menu under OSX.
Hi Justin, can you test this with the commit I've just made? If I understood the Qt documentation correctly it might work this way but I've no chance to actually test it...
Sure, I'll give it a shot tomorrow.  Need sleep atm. :wink:
Tested this just now (OSX 10.9.5) instead, and yep, it works:
- Compiling the v3.5.1 version &rarr; Preferences entry is in the wrong menu
Awesome stuff Martin. :grinning:
Thank you both :smiley:
We don't have a funky project name for our 3.6.0 release yet.
Anyone have suggetions?
They started out with sunlight/light based names, then I ran out of ideas and just picked interesting word sets.  So, pretty much anything that sounds interesting is a valid suggestion. :grinning:
Heh, that's two decent thoughts... keep them coming. :grinning:
Personally, I'm kinda against using letters of the alphabet.  (Due to Canonical doing that, and I'm no fan of theirs. :wink:)... and place names is kinda boring.
eg "Space Pizza Express" does sound more interesting... and could lead to nifty release-logos :grinning:
??? Not really.  China didn't really spring to mind at all.  Just been watching anime today tho, while doing other stuff. :grinning:
March 1st is our next tentative release date, so lets look for some March 1st people for that. :smile:
Maybe name it after "Gioachino Rossini"?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.thefamouspeople.com/march-1st.php
Naming it after some event that happened on this particular date kind of forces us to stick exactly to the planned release date. Don't know if that's a good or a bad thing... - but it definitely might make releases more stressful ;)
Anyway, I'm looking at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1 at the moment... How about Beer Day? Or Justin Bieber? :wink: Or, more seriously, Naomi Anderson.
Naomi Anderson seems like a decent figure.  Now, how to turn that into an interesting project name... :grin:
Not that I care too much about release names, actually I hate the debian/ubuntu naming, because I never really know which name belongs to which release.
I don't think using names of real characters is a good idea, I would rather use fictional characters or something completely different.
But again release names don't really add anything useful, until they are funny. (e.g. grml release names if you know german)
Hmmmm....
Cool.  There have been a few suggestions, so lets put them together in a list and vote here for them +1/-1 style.
I'll get the list assembled later on today (after work), unless someone has time to do it sooner. :smile:
Yep, that fixes it. :grinning:
As reported here (and confirmed by myself just now), the "Default Location" preference value can't be changed.  The text field can't be typed into, and the "clickable" button doesn't open a dialog.
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://twitter.com/umeya_mann/status/562772757021491201
We may want to do a 3.5.1 or 3.6.0 shortly after fixing this. :wink:
Thanks. :smile:
@MKleusberg @rp- I'd like to get this fix into a main release very quickly.  @rp- Do you have time to build a new windows release in the next few days?  I can do the OSX bits, release notes, etc. :smile:
We might want to merge a few more bug fixes into 3.5.1 (csv import, ...)
But yeah I can build a windows version tomorrow.
@rp- Yeah, I reckon we should include all of the bug fixes since release. eg the CSV import off-by-one bug, the support for empty table names, 64-bit primary key support, both of @samir-aguiar's PR's, etc
draft is up.
@rp- Thanks, that's Awesome. :grinning:
3.5.1 is released: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.5.1
Well I can live with the argument that an empty: ',,' column should NULL and if you want a empty string the CSV data should be ',"",'.
But to get default values for columns is a bit more tricky and maybe not always what a user would expect or want. And usually it shouldn't be such a problem to get default values you want into the csv data. e.g. with libreoffice calc or excel.
Thinking through this a bit, its pretty straightforward (to me atm :wink:), that a field consisting of only two single quotes, should be an empty string.  eg:
- '','other stuff'
- 1,'',13
- 1,2,''
Also, a field with only NULL in it (unquoted) is very likely meant to be a NULL.  eg:
- NULL,1,2
- 1,NULL,2
- 3,4,NULL
Though section 2.6 of [RFC 4180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt) does indicate it could also be considered a string value of "NULL". :frowning:
A field without a value though...yeah, that's interesting.  NULL or "default field value" are both possibilities.
At the risk of making things more complicated, we may need another option added to our cvs import dialog. ..._sigh_...
Just tested CSV import with our new 3.8.0 release.  We still need to add that extra option to the CSV import dialog, to specify what happens to fields without values.
It should be a very simple bit of coding, if someone has time to get it done.  @MKleusberg maybe? :smile:
@revolter This "adding an extra option to the CSV import dialog" seems like it might be your kind of thing.  Want to take a look at it?
@justinclift, If only I would know how to branch based on the setting.
The database interaction bit could be tricky at the moment, yeah. 😦
This is an interesting catch ;) I wasn't aware at all that SQLite would allow you to do this. Anyway, the problem should be fixed in the next nightly build, so you can use the database and the table just like any other - that's if I didn't miss anything while testing the patch, of course :smiley:
Hi!
Can you provide such a CSV file? Maybe as real download, pasting it somewhere might ruin the linebreaks.
Thanks, I think I got it, looks like a stupid mistaken variable.
should be fixed: 8d55fd5c48ef9ac5f94edfbe0af463dacf071593
Awesome. :grinning:
We could parse the foreign key constraints in a table definition to understand which column links to which column of a different table and then use that information in the Browse Data tab: When hovering over a cell with a foreign key constraint and some data in it, we could show a tooltip telling the user to what table is linked here. And when holding Ctrl and then clicking the cell (or some similar combination) we could jump there directly.
Sounds like a really good idea.  Please make it so. :grin:
As for the original issue described here: With commit 39a49e33c2e48f0b389ad9681998d7ac1588e2ef I try to add exactly that feature. There's a tooltip now appearing for cells with a foreign key set which tells you the name of the referenced table and when you hold Ctrl+Shift and click on the cell it jumps to the referenced row. Anyone willing to test this? :smile:
@MKleusberg With the latest commits, is this now fixed? No, not yet. The last commits only fixed some bug I've introduced during my code refactoring. This means we're in a much better position now to start working on this but it's not yet implemented. No worries. :smile: #614 seems related to this too.  It'd be nice to have the option to search for texts or patterns in the SQL code in the Execute SQL tab. Some people keep all their SQL queries as some sort of history (I don't), but this would also be useful when opening a database dump or some similarly large SQL file. A find & replace function makes it even more useful.
I would suggest implementing this as one of these search bars modern application like to have, instead of adding a new dialog for it. The search bar is a bit more difficult to implement but easier to use and, when added to the SqlTextEdit class, would also work for all the other places where this class is used (like the SQL log).
Here's a mockup of what I mean - "something you'd expect to open when you press Ctrl+F" might've been a better description :)
![find_mockup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/5962376/c61a3ef6-a7e3-11e4-95c8-c7c4c0394f36.png)
Ahhh, ok.  In the example above, would it then reduce the output to show only rows with 'example' in them?
What do you mean with 'nothing happened'? It should ask you for a name to attach the database under and - if the attach operation performed successfully - won't show any message, the new database is just there and can be accessed by SQL, eg:
``` sql
INSERT INTO main.destinationtable SELECT * FROM attacheddb.sourcetable;
```
Of course, the attached DB should be shown somewhere in the UI but either way, it should be attached. But maybe even that's not working for you - that's why I'm asking :)
Hmmm, going to close this for now.
@ashishkumartiwari If this is still not working for you and you still need assistance, you're welcome to reopen it. :smile:
Hi @DAOWAce I have had a look at this and did the following:
- Create a new database file with TableOne in
- Create another new database file with TableTwo in
- Create a third database file with nothing in
- Attach (File -> Attach Database) first database file, naming it "One"
- Attach (File -> Attach Database) second database file, naming it "Two"
- You will note that the "Database Structure" and "Browse Data" tables are empty
- In "Execute SQL" you can use "select \* from One.TableOne" and see the table
So, I believe this works. @MKleusberg I assume there is a reason why the Structure and Browse tabs don't show attached database
Opening this for now, as there is still activity here after all.  @DAOWAce / @glawrence Feel free to close this again when it's taken care of. :smile:
I am happy this is all working as it should, up to @DAOWAce really unless @MKleusberg thinks something is wrong
I'm in Brussels for FOSDEM 2015 (conference), and don't have access to an OSX box until I get back on the 4th Feb.  I think we'll need to wait until then before I can test this then merge it.  (sorry) :/
Cool, this works properly. :smile:
Tested on OSX 10.9.5.
Interesting.  Just created an issue for it, so we can track it properly and fix it. :smile:
The 2000 columns limit is set by SQLite itself, so unfortunately we have no influence on that. There is a way of increasing the limit, however. You'd need to compile SQLite by yourself with the SQLITE_MAX_COLUMN setting changed to 8000 (see https://www.sqlite.org/limits.html#max_column). After that you need to compile SQLiteBrowser, too, using the modified SQLite library you just compiled. If you need any help with this feel free to post any questions here. We'd only need to know which operating system you're using. Either way, a good starting point should be these links:
https://www.sqlite.org/limits.html#max_column
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md
This would need to be done for each application using the database file.
That said, if you're only about to design a database file and not trying to open an existing one you really should consider some alternative layouts. I just can't imagine a table that should have as many as 8000 columns. Maybe an EAV model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model) is a better approach in your case? The only drawback is that it's not very efficient with SQL databases; but 8000-column-tables are neither :smile:
So, you can change the parameter in that tarball + update the md5sum of the sqlite Homebrew formula to match it.  That way, if you tell Homebrew to recompile the formula it will get your updated code.
@asanchez75 How did this go? :smile:
@asanchez75 ping?
(note - I'll close this in a day or two if no response...)
Closing this as there's not really anything we can do for it.
Seems to work quite good, just a question as I'm not really into the code here. Can we have also an combobox entry to "revert" back to the system locale detected language?
Ok, kinda makes sense to me, just wanted to have something to go back to the default language.
I would go with the native version. You wouldn't select it if you don't understand it.
Interesting stuff.  I guess we'll find out how well it fits real world usage... by getting people to use it, then lets tweak from there if needed? :smile:
I agree with @justinclift to get this to real world usage and, besides, the code quality is very good - so I really don't see any objections not to merge this :) Nice work, @samir-aguiar :+1: If you're interested in doing more coding work you're absolutely welcome to - if you should need any assistance or inspiration on which areas to work on, feel free to ask us any time!
Regarding the default language option: Maybe a compromise would be to keep the list as it is, but append the string ' (system language)' to the list entry corresponding to the detected system language, or the string ' (fallback language)' to the list item for the English language when there is no translation available for the system language. Maybe one could even move this marked item to the top of the list or so to make it even clearer.
@MKleusberg Ahh yeah, those sound like good ways to indicate when a language is the system one, fall back one, and that kind of thing. :smile:
@samir-aguiar Awesome :smile: I'll just open new issues with suggestions as soon as I remember them. But pick any issue you like to work on :)
@vassileiosdermentzis Did you get this figured out?
Ok, I will try to help. :smile:
For me, using our 3.5.1 release, I can go to the 'Execute SQL' tab and type in a query.  Like this:
![screenshot1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6206041/4dc9c956-b578-11e4-9850-93a3b069c244.png)
It opens up a file dialog, so I can choose a location to save the file.  I give it a filename ('myquery.sql'), then click 'Save'.  Like this:
![screenshot2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6206069/1d7f1b74-b579-11e4-9ccf-721a50c478e9.png)
That creates a text file - myquery.sql - with the SQL query in it.  Opening that in a text editor shows this:
![screenshot3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6206096/0414dc54-b57a-11e4-80d2-26ce925865b5.png)
Is this what you are doing, and it isn't working?
@vassileiosdermentzis How did you go with this?
Thank you very much for that pull request! Nice work tracking that error messages down to these lines of code :+1:
You can just type your own datatypes into the data type field. The INTEGER/TEXT/BLOB/REAL/NUMERIC drop down box is just a list of suggestions and the text field next to the button opening it is a free-type input field.
@jvonmitchell Thoughts? (wondering if we can close this :wink:)
Closing this, as it's not really anything we can do something with.
there was some kind of small bug in our parsing grammar, because it wasn't really covered in the sqlite3 documentation.
Should be fixed with next nightly build.

Re "After "compact database" the button "write changes" is disabled.":
This is actually supposed to happen. The reason is that SQLite requires us to commit all changes before compacting the database, so this is what SQLiteBrowser does. There's also a warning at the top of the Compact Database dialog telling you about the fact that all changes are going to be written to disk before the database is compacted.
@SIRprise Reading through this again, this confuses me:
```
Writing the changes is ok, but if you open a db-file and compress it you need to
change anything in db to be able to save the compressed one.
```
Do you mean that changes are NOT being saved when the database is compressed?
I just tested it with our latest code, and it **seems** to be saving things when compressing.  Am I not seeing something important? :smile:
Cool.  :smile:
As far as I know there is no way to not automatically save your database after doing a VACUUM in SQLite. https://sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html says that a VACUUM writes all the data into a new database and then replaces the old one; to me this sounds like there's no way to do this without having it written to disk. So unfortunately there is no way for us to let you save the changes manually. Not sure why you couldn't see any file size changes earlier, though. Our vacuum code hasn't been changed for quite some however - so maybe it was a problem in the bundled SQLite version or just some random coincidence.
Interesting idea.  On Linux and OSX it's not too difficult to change the language for a program prior to launch (change the LANG environment variable, then launch).  But that's not the case for every OS (eg windows), so this is probably a useful enhancement.
If you wanted to work on this that'd be awesome :smile: As for the question of where to put the new option in the preferences dialog I think it might be best to create a new tab (called 'Application' or 'Interface' or similar) for this. If you move the 'Default Location' option to that tab as well, the language option wouldn't even be the only field in there.
@Z4us There's a tool included in the Qt framework for this: Qt Linguist (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtlinguist-index.html). The basic translation process is to add a new entry to the TRANSLATIONS part in the src/src.pro file (currently around line 90), then re-build the project. Now, the build system will collect all the strings to translate in the entire application and put them in the file you just added. This newly created ts file can than be opened in Qt Linguist and using Qt Linguist you can translate all the strings. After saving and rebuilding the translation should be in the application.
By the way, if somebody, probably someone who already made a translation, wanted to write a more detailed Wiki page about this process, that would be fantastic :)
Hmmmm, thinking about where to put a "change language" user interface element... shouldn't that go on the main window somewhere (unobtrusive)?
Does this make sense?
@samir-aguiar @glawrence No worries at all, I was just kinda idly thinking out loud. :wink:
eg whatever you guys come up with is all good.  If it turns out to be non-optimal in practise, someone will probably create an issue about it then. :grinning:
Are we ok to close this one now, as #187 is merged?
Sure, no worries at all. :smile:
Heh, nah that length is fine.  Feel free to widen out the combo box as needed for it. :smile:
Flags aren't a bad idea, but some people can have a problem with them. eg where there are conflicts over national boundaries
That being said, if it's easy to include them, maybe lets do that anyway... we can adjust later if people have a serious issue with them. :grinning:
... they do add some nice colour... :innocent:
Hmmm, yeah, lets add them.  Does this look useful?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/iso-country-flags-svg-collection
Forked that to our own org repo, so it doesn't go away or disappear mysteriously. We can delete it if it turns out not to be useful.
Just tried the latest nightly on Win7, and the combo box width looks really good.  Good stuff! :grinning:
Interestingly, only "English (United States) [System Language]" is available in the drop down box.  I'll create a new issue for that in a minute (guessing its a packaging problem on Windows).
Just updated the README.md file with the port info.  Is there anything else we should do?
Is "quiterss" the correct package name there?
Thanks, updated the installation info. :smile:
Btw, we'll probably be releasing v3.5.0 in the next few days.  Would you be ok to update the FreeBSD port when that happens?
Thanks.  It'll probably be this weekend. :smile:
@lbartoletti 3.5.0 is out now. :smile:
Thanks, that's awesome. :grinning:
Out of curiosity, the port seems to be carrying some patches (as below), should we merge these into the main codebase?

@lbartoletti It turns out there were a few important bugs in 3.5.0, so v3.5.1 has just been released (if you want to update the port?). :smile:
@MKleusberg Hmmm, any ideas? :smile:
Thank you. :grinning:
@lbartoletti We've just released v3.6.0.  Would you be ok to update the port with it? :smile:
Would you be ok to try the latest nightly build?  There's been a lot of bug fixing since the 3.4.0 release, including with constraints. (download locations are listed on the front page of the repo)
Hopefully it's already fixed :smile:, though if it's not we'll need to look into it. :wink:
Hello Andrea!
Cool. :smile:
This isn't something I'm personally interested in doing (not a fan of Gnome, and I don't use KDE).  However if someone does a pull request with the right bits, we'll happily merge it. :grinning:
@glawrence Any interest in picking this up?  If you're willing to, we might as well get it done... :wink:
Yep, April 18th. :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/milestones
Awesome stuff @glawrence. :smile:
Yeah, it's a known bug in the current release.  It's fixed in the latest nightly builds (and our source code too), if that helps.
If you're on OSX or Windows, would you be ok to try the latest nightly build and try that out? (download locations are on the front page of this repo)
Thanks for telling us about this! The problem should be fixed in the next nightly build (see Readme.md) :)
@malitech Out of curiosity, have you had a chance to try out the latest nightly build?
Wondering if this is working well for you now or not. :wink:
Excellent.  Thanks for verifying. :grinning:
I can see no reason why this shouldn't work on any system. The OUT_PWD variable is a standard qmake feature since a long time. So it really will work on any system and for any Qt version (any version we support anyways). Just to be sure, I tested it on my system and it didn't break anything.
Thanks again for your effort! :+1: I've just merged your pull request. I suggest leaving this issue open for another week or so, just in case this does cause problems for somebody, though I'm pretty confident that won't happen :)
Ahhh, interesting.  That definitely sounds like a bug.
Thanks for noticing this! This issue should be fixed by commit f63b11925df2f7b538ef0f9f7da975e875aa5289 which, however, probably needs a bit more testing.
Thanks for the kind words, @Z4us :smiley: Not sure if we're going to release a 3.5.1 but I hope 3.6 won't take that long :)
Thanks guys, that's awesome. :grin:
Any idea what's in the phone home transfer?
At first guess, I'd think this is just the check to see if it's running the latest version.  If that's the case, then the 5monkeys thing is probably just co-incidence.
Sqlitebrowser itself just does 1 connection (if enabled, default on windows) to github to check a file for the current version number. Any other connection shouldn't be opened.
To be honest I would remove all downloads except maybe for source form sourceforge as it is known that they patch installers and maybe also executables to add adware and other sh***.
http://blog.gluster.org/2013/08/how-far-the-once-mighty-sourceforge-has-fallen/
k, for the next release (3.5), we'll only put the binaries on GitHub.  I'll also remove all of the existing binaries from SourceForge, and point people at the GitHub download location.
@bonerfart Btw, which OS did you find this behaviour on?
A 'whois' on the IP you reported says, it's owned by Fastly. That's a company which hosts all sort of websites and web applications, including Github. So I'm not that sure this connection is opened by some code added by Sourceforge - it might just be our update code connecting to Github. But without any information on the transferred data we can't really be sure.
Either way, maybe we should add an option for disabling the auto update feature on Windows. Or at least not query Github after each start if the user has clicked the Don't-show-again-option.
@MKleusberg Yeah, that's probably a decent preference thing to add.
Just added that option: In the preferences dialog you can now disable the automatic update check and I'm pretty confident that this will lead to no network connections being opened. If this should still be the case with any version from now on, we know the source code has been changed before compilation.
Closing this issue as it is quite old and we have a fix applied some time ago.
Hmmm, I think I need to test this on OSX too, just to verify it's good all round.  I'll try to get it done tomorrow.
Oh interesting.  Martin/Rene what do you think?
Hard to follow this report, if we have no information what "this entry" means, nor is there any delete statement in the log.
the sorting reset might be actually an issue.
Can you tell me the exact database/table/row?
Sorry I can't follow you, I just opened the database_{main,user}.s3db and I don't have blank only rows nor were there any problems deleting any of the rows, that where there.
Version 3.4.0
But I have to admit the sorting is reset.
So, I could track down the issue to the very large primary key values used in the database which wouldn't fit in the int datatype we were using at some places. This should be fixed in the next nightly build.
Excellent, thanks for confirming back. :smile:
In addition to that, I also removed the default "Null" text.
Let me know your comments or suggestions of what I should change.
Thanks :smile:
Hmm. I should of read the building.md and actually build using cmake instead of just through the Qt Creator.
Will review to make sure it passes build correctly and run the unit tests.
Building this with cmake/make worked fine. However the below when I try and make the unit tests
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
"PreferencesDialog::getSettingsValue(QString const&, QString const&)", referenced from:
SqliteTableModel::data(QModelIndex const&, int) const in sqlitetablemodel.cpp.o
Would anyone mind looking over what I need to add or change? :smile:
@MKleusberg / @rp- Do you have a few minutes to look into this? :smile:
I appreciate the feedback. I haven't touched this in a while nor will I be able to for a while. So if anyone would like to take over, please feel free to do so. No hard feelings. Otherwise I will try and jump back on this in a couple of weeks.
@samir-aguiar Any interest in picking this up and getting it finished?  Kinda thinking it should be pretty straightforward. :smile:
Heh Heh Heh, I guess that's a "yes" then. :wink:
No worries at all. :smile:
Is the failure in Travis something to be worried about?
Looks like it passing again now. :smile:
I appreciate you taking this over for me!  :smile:  Sorry I couldn't finish what I started.
@Chuongv No worries at all.  It's good you got it started, and you're welcome to keep being involved and do more stuff as you have time. :smile:
Interesting.  Which OS are you on?
As a first thought, if you're on Windows or MacOS X would you be ok to try out the latest nightly build and see if that works better for you? (download locations are shown on the front page of the repo)
As a next thought, I'm looking at the above example and trying to figure out what the wrong bit(s) you're meaning are.  The carriage returns in the above example are quoted properly with ' characters aren't they?
And yeah, I'm expecting I'm not seeing something obvious... :wink:
No worries at all. :grinning:
Cool, good idea. :smile:
I'm not technical enough to review the code for this, but Martin and Rene are so they should have feedback in the near future.  (hopefully this weekend) :grinning:
thanks
@MKleusberg @rp- This confuses me a bit.  Google Translate has this as the first part of the translation:
```
hello,
Is there any way to introduce features like DEFAULT value for a field?
What I need is the UTC time value as an integer with this scheme:
`` `sql
`INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT timestamp` strftime ('% s', 'now')
`` `
```
But we do support default values on fields already, don't we?
Ahhh yeah, that's clear.  By the way, your English is fine. :smile:
Gracias por esta idea. Con el próximo 'nightly build' podrás usar la expresión '=(...)' así como sugeriste.
A propósito, podés escribirnos en Inglés o Casellano - como vos (tú :grinning: ) prefieras. Yo entiendo un poco (pero hablo muy mal :grinning: ).
If so, the download locations are in the README.md file (and front page of our project). :grin:
Sounds like good progress, but not quite finished yet.
@MKleusberg Is it workable to have the '=' sign be included?
Casi olvidí este problema... :frowning: Pero ahora, si se abra una tabla para modificarla ponemos el signo '=' en el campo default. Si todavía tienes tiempo y ganas a probarlo puedes descargar el próximo nightly build (pero espera hasta mañana): https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser#windows
@justinclift Finally, fixed the '=' sign to be included. So this should be fixed now, so we might be able to close this issue soon :)
@MKleusberg Awesome. :grin:
Excellent!  Thanks for checking and letting us know @aMarCruz. :smile:
Great work again @MKleusberg. :grinning:
what version are you using?
I'm getting correct syntax errors
Ahhh yeah.  The 2.x series was released a bit over 8 years ago.  So, really, really, really out of date. :wink:
The present series is much better put together.  Our latest release (3.4.0) was only a few weeks ago.
It looks like you'll need to compile it yourself, but that's not hard.  Instructions for compiling on Ubuntu are here if it helps (under the "Ubuntu Linux" heading):
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md
I'll try to create a ppa for the latest LTS.
@rp- Cool. :smile:
@rob-hills If you can locate the person who built the package in 14.04 (the info is probably in Launchpad somewhere), it probably wouldn't hurt to ask them about an updated package.  There's a chance they're already working on it (or least aware of new versions), and just need a bit of encouragement. :grinning:
After a few hours fighting with debian packages I think I managed to get a ppa for trusty.
Note to myself: I'll never become a debian maintainer
Yeah.  Of all the packaging systems I've ever tried building for over the years, .deb's are the worst by far.  OSX Homebrew is easy.  The BSD's and Solaris (of a decade ago) wasn't too bad.  Native NSIS is ok.  rpm's aren't great, but are workable.  .deb's however are crazy (for me anyway). :grin:
@rp- Is the ppa built using 3.4.0 release, or latest master?
If it does, we can Tweet about it so others with Ubuntu 14.04LTS can use it.  And we should probably add that ppa location to the website and README too.
Thanks @rob-hills.  Lets leave it open for a bit longer.  We should adjust the README.md file and website to point people at the ppa for Ubuntu first.  Then we can close it in the knowledge we've done all we can that's in our control. :grinning:
@AndroidGecko Are you using ubuntu 14.04 LTS with that ppa?  I think that's the specific version it's been compiled for so far, and not other ubuntu releases.
You can compile DB Browser for SQLite pretty easily yourself though.  Exact steps are here under the "Ubuntu Linux" section, and it's pretty quick:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md
Cool. :smile:
Hmmmm, we could probably put a call out through Twitter, to see if someone wants to create a PPA for our releases on an ongoing basis.  Pretty sure @rp- is busy with other stuff atm.
Guessing no objections? :smile:
Yep, we're looking forward to having this too.
@deepsidhu1313 volunteered in https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/238 to do the Ubuntu packaging for the next release, which should flow into at least Mint + (I'm guessing) Elementary too. :smile:
@rob-hills @Jerome67000 Would you have time to try out an initial test build?
If so, @deepsidhu1313 created one here a few hours ago:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser-testing
Cool. :smile:
@deepsidhu1313 3.6.0 is released.  You ok to update your ppa?
We should add it to the front page when that's done too. :smile:
@rob-hills @AndroidGecko @Jerome67000 Would you have a few minutes to try out the new PPA above (if it suits your Ubuntu version)? :wink:
Ahhhh, @deepsidhu1313... it sounds like you packaged master branch and not the v3.6.x branch?
I should probably have [pointed you to this](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Release-process) before, but I didn't think of it until now. :anguished:  Sorry about that.
We can update that info in the wiki, if there's anything special that's needed for the Ubuntu builds btw.  That page is a work in progress. :wink:
@Jerome67000 Thank you, it's good you checked. :smile:
No worries. The "master" bit on the end of "https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/tarball/master" is the branch name.  "master" in this case is our active development branch, not the 3.6.x stuff.
Here's the link you want: :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/archive/v3.6.0.tar.gz
Excellent.  Just added pointers about it to the front page.  Please let me know when the PPA location changes (eg moves out of the -testing one), so it can be updated.  Or submit a Pull Request with the updated info, whatever works. :smile:
Excellent.  URL on the front page now updated.
Oh, I need to update the website "Linux" bit too.  I'll do it after work tonight (if I forget, pls remind me!). :wink:
@rob-hills Already taken care of.  Thanks for responding.  Maybe try stuff out when back from your cruise (I'm jealous :wink:), and see if everything works as you expect then? :smile:
Awesome. :grinning:
I'm having a bit of trouble visualising the problem.  When you say NULL field values aren't highlighted, in which of the interface are you meaning, and how do you reckon they should look?
As a thought, are you ok to do a screenshot?  That generally helps make things clearer. :smile:
valid request, its hard to impossible to see if the field is NULL or empty string
@77tb Thanks, that's a lot clearer. :smile:
And yeah, that's not a bad idea. :grin:
This should be fixed with the next nightly build!
@77tb Do you have time to try out the nightly build (from today onwards), and report back if this problem is fixed ok for you now?
We like to double check, just in case. :grinning:
I just downloaded both the nightly builds for December 2nd. I am not seeing a change yet.
Also are we supposed to be using Qt Creator for this project if we want to make changes/explore the code?
Thanks
Yeah, I went for a more subtle style there because changing the background colour of the cell (even to light grey) looked kind of awkward and was a bit too attention-grabbing for my taste...
If you're still interested in making changes/exploring the code that's awesome! We always like getting feedback or pull requests. Both, Rene and I, are using Qt Creator for development, so while you can use any IDE you'd like, Qt Creator is probably the recommended choice. With it it's really just a matter of opening the sqlitebrowser.pro file and start browsing and building the code :)
Do you want to implement that, then maybe do some comparison screenshots in this ticket so we can discuss (as a group) whether to incorporate it or not?  I'm generally in favour of the concept, but would like to see how it looks in reality first. :grinning:
@justinclift I am still pretty new at C++ right now so I don't feel confident hacking away at anything yet. Currently taking an intro to C++ class. I'll take a look this weekend but I can't guarantee anything. :smile:
So no personal information is being exposed.
![nullredtext](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5170710/5277377/4c14f9f6-7a80-11e4-96d5-86d14aaf140e.png)
Seemed a little too red for me so I opted to turn down the opacity.
![255redopaq180](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5170710/5277367/287cb498-7a80-11e4-9202-6959ff16307d.png)
Still didn't like it so I went and remove the null text and opted for a background color change like suggested from @77tb
![backgroundopacity90](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5170710/5277386/6d8910d6-7a80-11e4-9bd4-d26f5b8e8d2f.png)
Turned down the opacity here a bit. Which I liked a little bit better
![backgroundopacity20](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5170710/5277389/75f0640e-7a80-11e4-97b4-7d530230cc19.png)
I am still pretty new to the codebase so I will probably need someone to review to make sure I didn't break anything.
Let me know your thoughts.
Thanks
Cool, well done. :grinning:
Although, I don't mind the lighter red background (no text) version either.
As a thought, what does it look like with the light red/pink background + using NULL (text word) inside at the same time?
Hmmm, I can see we'll probably need to make this a config option or we'll be bike shedding it all day. :smile:
If I would have to pick one, I would also stick to the second version.
Awesome.  That's all good input. :smile:
How about if we add a field to the preferences dialog (SQL tab), called something like "NULL values".  In the value for that field, people can set a text string (including blank) along with changing the foreground + background colour for the field.
The contents of that field (background, foreground, text) is used as the value for NULL fields in the Browse Data tab?
Sure thing! I would love to give it a try. It won't be perfect, but I'll try my best :smile: Not sure if you guys have a deadline for this, but if so feel free to take over if I take too long. :hourglass:
Cool. :smile:
Our next release (3.5) is due on 14th December.  Do you reckon you could get it done a day or two before that, so people can test it and comment?
That's only about a week away though... :wink:
@justinclift
Once I'll get home, I'll sift through the code to see how viable I can do this. The biggest hurdle for me will be understanding the qt framework. I'll try and get you an answer by tomorrow.
Again if anyone wants to take over, feel free to do so. I won't get upset 😄.
@justinclift
After spending a couple of hours looking over the code, I have no idea on how to proceed with this. So feel free to assign this to someone else.
I was only able to add NULL to the preference table, but I do not understand Qt enough to link the view to the action of popping up the color picker.
Anyways, I'll be following this project and I appreciated the offer in letting me take a stab at it :sweat_smile:
Thanks
Are you ok to push your code to GitHub where it adds NULL to the preference table?  Martin or Rene should be able to look over it, then guide you on the bit after that which you're having trouble with. :grinning:
Sure thing, here it is https://github.com/Chuongv/sqlitebrowser/commit/82ac2fa9ebb48ef6ff7866aff49952faf7db6928
I didn't add much :disappointed:
edit: Figured out how to make it so the user can change the background color of the NULL fields.
Also I did not realize that Github would automatically link my issues. That is pretty cool :grinning:
Anyways, comments are appreciated.
Btw, if anyone has time to check, the code for this is in our latest nightlies.  Feedback (prior to next release) would be awesome. :smile:
Closing this as we have configurable NULL value highlighting for some time now. It should be well tested and any new errors should probably be reported in a separate issue.
Yeah, that's a good idea.  Probably not hard to implement it for windows at least.
Not sure if the current installer code automatically removes the previous version though, which is probably a requirement too.  Will need to check. :wink:
Yeah, that sounds like the right approach for Windows.  For OSX, it **might** not be that straightforward.  DB Browser 4 SQLite (we really need to think of an acronym for this program :wink:) can be installed using one of the OSX package managers (eg Homebrew).  So using a solution blindly on that platform probably isn't the right approach.  [Sparkle](http://sparkle-project.org) does sound worth investigating though, for the "updating manually installed OSX binaries" use case. :smile:
Hoping your next Pull Request will be for this auto-updating stuff? :grinning:
Looking at the Sparkle instructions, this seems doable:
&nbsp;&nbsp;  https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/wiki
Sounds like it's mostly a packaging approach, and won't really touch the executable code itself.  This would probably work well for our existing .dmg/.app bundle downloads, without conflicting with the Homebrew installed versions.
If it helps, I can provide the cronjob script used for the nightly builds of D2B4S (acronym test 1 :wink:) for OSX.  Probably chuck it in a gist or something.  Want it?
With Homebrew, I don't _think_ it has an auto-update capability yet (unless recently added).  So yeah, people need to manually update when they're using that.
Cool.  This is the script that generates the nightlies:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://gist.github.com/justinclift/38887c1cfe480adfb11b
It's not at all elegant, and could be improved a lot (eg checking return codes for failures and similar)... but it works.
Btw, I'm kinda thinking "DB4S" is the shortest potential acronym we could use...
Cool.  All good progress.  Pleae keep it up. :grinning:
As useful reference info, @revolter pointed out [fervor](https://github.com/pypt/fervor).  That project itself appears to have died, but it may be worth looking over its code if we need to make our own system.
Yep.  Our ideal solution on Windows and OSX would probably be to copy the approach of modern browsers. eg download updates automatically in the background, and install them when the application is next used.  The BSD's and Linux distro's have their own update mechanisms already, so it wouldn't need to run on those.
Parsing version numbers is a pain.  v3.9 is always written as 3.9 instead of 3.09, which it is technically.  Applications see a new version of v3.10 not 'higher' than 3.9 (which in maths terms is 3.90, so higher than 3.10).  Argh.  You have to break each part of the number down rather than treating it as a 'number'.
I'm sure this is like the advice they give for logins on websites - always take someone elses code and never roll your own! :wink:
Personally, I prefer the option to have a notification of a newer version rather than the program 'auto update' only because (no offense!) newer versions tend to break things, so when you just have to get something done, you don't want the program going, "hang on, just download the newer version.  Oh, hang on.  I've uninstalled the old one, but before I install the new one, it needs these runtimes, so go to this site, download this pack, click that link...no that other one....download the relevant 32/64bit, unpack it, but don't install the other DLL which has known issues....oh too late, you've installed it....aah, so now you need........._pop_
Hmmm, version number parsing for semantic versions major.minor.patch is pretty easy.  But yeah, it has to be broken into the separate parts first. :wink:
Auto-updating... yeah... we're need to have more confidence in our releases being very stable before we start doing that for everyone.  Optionally enabled (defaulting to off) code, for the brave few, is a reasonable idea to get things started with though. :smile:
@chrisjlocke, https://regex101.com/r/bB0hB2/1.
Added `v3.9.0-beta1`: https://regex101.com/r/bB0hB2/2
v3.9.0.-1 :wink:
Edit: I was joking.  That won't work... don't try it.  No, don't.  Step away.
😏
_Edit:_
Or a simpler solution: https://regex101.com/r/bB0hB2/4
Too bad Qt doesn't support look behinds :(
@revolter it is supported. In QRegularExpression.
Searching for `behind` in the [`QRegularExpression`](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qregularexpression.html) documentation yields nothing :| Can you point me where is it mentioned?
If it is supported, [this regex](https://regex101.com/r/bB0hB2/5) works too.
@revolter I got this information [here](https://dangelog.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/qregularexpression/), it's peppe's blog, who is Qt developer. Ctrl+F `lookbehind`, further investigations are up to you :)
Thinking about this, I suspect the right way to present it would be a pop up dialog showing progress.
Something like this:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ![progress bar 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/6651687/f2e2822e-ca46-11e4-8485-f3ce09abffcb.png)
Qt provides [a "progress bar" widget already](http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qprogressbar.html), so that's probably the thing to use for the display.
Collecting the info to use with it is likely harder.  For (say) a CSV import it would probably be something like:
1. Do an initial row count for the input file.  This is so we can know how far we've progressed through the total file, during the import.
2. Figure out how often to update the progress bar
- Maybe figure out how wide the progress bar is in pixels (if there's a way). Divide total rows / # pixels
- If figuring out the # of pixels for the progress bar isn't easy, then go with a percentage approach instead.  eg Divide total row / 100
3. Now run a loop to import the CSV data, updating the progress bar every x lines (as worked out in previous step), and checking for a press of the Cancel button
That's without error handling though, and I have no solid idea on the correct behaviour if the user hits the Cancel button (eg doesn't want to wait further).  Keep the data successfully imported so far?
Hmmmm, as a first thought, can Excel be made to put quote marks around those hex numbers?  eg "000000"
That (in theory :wink:) should get them to be treated as strings, which then should "just work".
Reality might have other ideas, but it's worth a shot. :grinning:
your last marked line isn't the same as in your excel file.
But apart from that, until we implement some kind of pre/post detection of datatypes you better should stick with telling excel to export that field as string.
@rallyRays Looking back through our older issues atm.  Did putting quotation marks around the hex numbers get it to work? (wondering if it did, and if this issue can be closed :wink:)
Yeah, that sounds like a workable approach.  Closing this issue for now.  If you reckon it's worth opening again for further investigation, feel free to. :smile:
?
No worries at all.  Was just hoping. :grinning:
hm what version did you try?
I have no crash, neither on master branch or 3.4.0.
Even the 3.4.0 windows version doesn't crash.
I copy/pasted your samples from above, and than looked at the schema tab and browse tab
For more reference also see #51.
@Lukas-W Do you have an example database that crashes for you, that we can get a hold of somehow?  That might help (unsure).
Oh, I wonder.... I'm pretty sure the examples of table structure above were a bit different when you first pasted them in (eg you neatened them up afterwards).  I'll see if I still have the email GitHub sent out with the original structure in it.
Nope, I was misremembering.  It was a different issue I was thinking of.  Sorry for the noise. :wink:
confirmed and identified.
will commit a fix later today.
crash should be fixed. 16b8428b66b6e002054cd1a6ff5700fb2ee9cca2
Awesome. :grinning:
@Lukas-W Do you have a few minutes to try with the latest code (using master branch) and let us know it it's all fixed now?
Excellent.  Thanks for testing and letting us know. :smile:
That'd be useful, though I suspect it could be a bunch of work. :smile:
With the error you're getting, it looks like you've pasted the wrong bit maybe.  The one you pasted was a warning message, so it probably means the error was further back in the output.
Maybe paste the whole log output in here so we can see it, or in a gist? :smile:
Hi!
To compile the current sqlitebrowser you need at least qt 4.8.
only way is to rewrite the parts that don't work.
For your error above a simple copy into a QString will do it I guess, but I'm sure that won't be the last error.
@rp- If @TeLLie does manage to get it working properly with Qt 4.7.x (cleanly), should we merge the changes into the main DB Browser for SQLite repo here?
I'm kinda thinking we probably should... :wink:
@TeLLie Will you be adjusting the code to make it work with Qt 4.7.3, or should we close this issue for now? :smile:
Cool. :smile:
That's pretty awesome. :grinning:
Do you want to contribute the patches here, so we can merge them into our code?
Cool. :smile:
With that failing test, it looks like something's not quite right yet with the conversion to Qt 4.7.3.  Hopefully it's something simple.
Hmmm, not sure if that diff is really correct here.  GitHub doesn't have good tools for attaching files directly to issues. :frowning:
Are you skilled enough with using git, that you could submit a GitHub Pull Request?
If not, then maybe email the diff to me directly? (justin@postgresql.org)  I can turn that into a GitHub Pull Request, which will show the diff visually and stuff. :smile:
@TeLLie Does this look correct?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/165/files
Created that by cutting and pasting from the .diff you emailed (and I was pretty careful).  So in theory I didn't miss bits. :wink:
Note - I haven't tried compiling this on Linux or OSX yet, so that needs to be done first.
Cool.  Please do. :smile:
You'll need to email them to me directly (justin@postgresql.org).  GitHub doesn't seem to attach files to issues correctly. :wink:
Btw, what name do you want on the commit message?  At the moment it's:
```
Elbert & Nicole Pol <elbert.pol@gmail.com>
```
@TeLLie Do you have time to try compiling our latest source code?  Rene added the initial code for Qt 4.7 compatibility.
We'll still need to follow up with the OS2 rc and icon file anyway though. :wink:
@TeLLie Did you still want the OS2 ico and .rc file included?
If so :smile:, are you ok to email them to me (justin@postgresql.org)?
Thanks. :smile:
Something seems to be going weird with my email occasionally, so they didn't get through to me. :frowning:
So, in theory the icon and resource file should be in the latest code now.
@TeLLie Do you have some time to try compiling with the latest code, and report back if it works?  If it does, we can probably close this issue. :smile:
You're completely welcome.  Thanks for sharing your changes with us. :grinning:
Sounds possibly useful, but not sure what that is?
Is it for the newly resurrected OS/2? :wink:
Out of curiosity, do you know if Qt5 support is being added to Blue Lion?
That's good news.  We've been [thinking of going to moving to Qt5 only](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/603), so I'd been concerned we'd have to drop OS/2 support. :smile:
Cool. Co-incidentally, we're releasing version 3.9.1 today too. 😁
Excellent. :smile:
Should we add that to the README.md file, or will OS/2 users already know where to look?
Awesome. :smile:
Hmmm, the 1st one (additional space) shouldn't be a problem.
The 2nd one could be more interesting.  If the .sql file is for importing back into SQLite, then it probably doesn't matter.  But... if the .sql file is for importing into some other database (with strong data types), then yeah, that could a problem.
Martin/Rene, what do you guys think?
Should be fixed: 85578bd9b6db336e3b7c5a456db347f628f72d8d
The download locations for our nightly builds are on the front page of this project repository (if that helps). :smile:
Oh wow.  Yeah, that's not good.
@rp- One for you? :wink:
issue should be fixed. e814fa2a03327b3306ebea72381cf37d6f220165
Awesome.  Thanks for testing it and letting us know. :grinning:
With the SQLite database you created using the password 'abcd', was that created by our program too?
I'm trying to understand if our program isn't opening a file it created itself, or if it's not opening a file created by a different program. :wink:
By the way, which operating system and version of DB Browser for SQLite are you using? :wink:
Martin/Rene any ideas?
From a very quick look at the System.Data.SQLite code it seems they use sqlcipher in the background, but Martin might know more.
Oh interesting.  This might work with our latest code then.
@chucklu Do you have access to an Apple Mac or a Linux computer?  We recently added support for SQLCipher to our code.  It's only working for MacOS X and Linux so far, not Windows.  We're investigating getting it working on Windows too, but it's not there yet. :wink:
Interesting info from [Ulrich Telle](http://www.telle-online.de/wxwidgets/wxsqlite3.html) on the sqlite-users mailing list, about the encryption algorithm used in System.Data.SQLite:
> At least the _original_ component System.Data.SQLite, available from
>
> &nbsp; &nbsp; https://system.data.sqlite.org
>
> uses its own encryption implementation based on a 128-bit RSA cipher (using the Windows Crypto API), while SQLCipher uses a 256-bit AES cipher (using the OpenSSL library). SQLCipher provides a .Net interface (SQLCipher for ADO.NET), which is _based on System.Data.SQLite_, that is, the SQLCipher guys used the .Net wrapper part of System.Data.SQLite, but replaced the internal implementation of the encryption algorithm by their own implementation.
>
> The page
>
> &nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-ado/
>
> explains how to use SQLCipherfor ADO.Net together with Visual Studio.
>
> Unfortunately the various encryption extensions for SQLite are not compatible, so the developer has to take care that the development environment and the database management tools intended to be used support the same encryption extension.
Hmmmm, thinking this specific issue through, it seems like it's not really a problem with DB4S, nor something we can really do anything with.
Going to close it as "invalid" for now, as it's most likely a file created using an encryption method we don't support yet (nor plan to, unless someone wants to take up the task :wink:).
If that doesn't seem right, feel free to reopen this. :smile:
Hmmm, that sounds more like the kind of thing you'd create using a form in (say) LibreOffice or similar.
With LibreOffice, you can create forms that do things like that, tying them to a backend database like PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.
Have you looked at doing that yet?
@AAverin It's been years since I used LibreOffice (or OpenOffice) in depth, so I'm really not the right guy to help you with that.
In theory (:wink:), there should be guides and tutorials around for doing this.  I haven't checked though, so it may take some time and research.
As @Z4us suggested, asking on the SQLite Users mailing list is a good idea too.  There's a decent chance someone has already created something like this, or at least knows in good depth how to do it. :smile:
@Z4us LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice created after Oracle were dicks (my wording :wink:) to the OpenOffice developer Community.  The **vast** majority (but not all) of the OpenOffice developers moved there, and the pace of development + engagement there seems to be much, much higher than in OpenOffice.  (that's a very, very rough explanation, from someone not directly involved :grin:)
@MKleusberg @rp- Any ideas?  This is an area of things I have no clue about. :frowning:
was waiting for Martin, he did the fancy hex and blob edit input stuff ;)
A few other people have also asked for "remember the path from the last time X was done" recently.  eg https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/149#issuecomment-62305299
Some people prefer a behaviour of always starting in the default directly though.  eg https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/115
I guess we could have a preference checkbox along the lines of "[ ] Remember last location in file dialogs?", which lets people choose their preferred approach.
I don't think that would be hard to do, just a bit time consuming to write the code.  It'll probably need each type of file dialog (eg SQL export) to have it's own path variable which gets updated, and saved/loaded across sessions.
---
```
when I press save it does not remember that I opened a sql file in the first place so I have to find the file.
```
With the "Save Project" dialog, it also does that for me.  I'm not sure you need to actually do that though when you want to just save your changes.  You might be able to use the "Write Changes" button in the top bar for that.  Lets ask Martin and Rene, just to confirm. :wink: @MKleusberg @rp- Thoughts on that?
---
With the "execute currently selected text" idea, for me it already does this:
![2014-11-13-execute-sql-result](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/5034992/78eddb6a-6b6b-11e4-9164-c6ecc0cce70a.png)
Gotcha, I get it now. :smile:  Yeah, that should be doable.  Doesn't sound like a huge amount of effort either. That being said, I'm not sure when we'll have time to add it.  We kind of have a pretty extensive list of existing stuff to get through already.  Guess we'll need to prioritise and stuff.
Don't suppose you're interested in learning C++ and Qt programming?  If so, this is a very good project to start out on. :grinning:
No worries, it didn't take that much time. Should be fixed in the next nightly build :)
@spassvogel Which operating system are you using?  If it's Windows or MacOS X, would you be ok to try the next nightly build (tomorrow), and let us know if the Save/Save-As bit is working well for you for .sql files now? :smile:
Hmmm, we haven't really thought about donations or that kind of thing (yet).
We probably should though, just in case it turns out to be a useful stream of $ to do stuff with. :grin:
@MKleusberg @rp- Any objections into us looking into Gittip or something? (I have no preferences towards one service over another atm, this isn't something I know much about yet)
No experience, except that I got once a donation via paypal for another project.
But I'm not sure the gittip(gratipay) is the thing we are looking for with weekly payments.
Yeah, good point.  It doesn't hurt to look into for awareness, but it's not a high priority. :wink:
Thanks @spassvogel, that's awesome. :smile:
Btw, everything in the nightlies becomes part of the next major release, so all good there too. :grinning:
With this, are you meaning the bottom-most pane? :smile:
I've just checked the current behaviour, and I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not. :wink:
At the moment, this is what's shown when there is a result:
![2014-11-10-sqlitebrowser_1_result](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4980376/c330e096-68ff-11e4-9075-037512749ae1.png)
And this is shown when there isn't:
![2014-11-10-sqlitebrowser_0_results](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4980391/d8af7874-68ff-11e4-8aa2-52cb035113c0.png)
I kind of think having the bottom pane showing "0 Rows returned from: [query] (query time)" is a lot more informative than clearing that bottom pane.
What're your thoughts? :smile:
Ahhh yeah, that makes sense now.  That's probably doable without heaps of effort too. :smile:
Thanks for pointing this out! It should be fixed in the next nightly build.
@reverendhomer Would you be ok to try the next nightly build (tomorrow), and let us know if it's working well for you now? :smile:
The download locations for the nightly builds are on the front page, if that helps.
Awesome!  Thanks for verifying it @reverendhomer. :grin:
Frankly, your SQL statement _is_ wrong. There are no 'FROM's in an update statement. But even if you fix that it won't work because SQLite doesn't support joins in an update statement. There is nothing we can do about that, it's just how SQLite works. There is a workaround though: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/773441/how-do-i-make-an-update-while-joining-tables-on-sqlite
The same applies for the error message by the way. This is the message SQLite returns, the only way to improve it is parse the entire statement by ourselves (which we might want to do in the future but unfortunately is quite complex and currently of little use...).
@dylan666 No worries. :wink:
@dylan666 You're welcome - glad we could help :smiley:
Ahhh, this is probably a good idea and not hard to do.  We already save some info into project files and similar.
This sounds more like it should be saved into the same spot as our general program wide preferences though, as it's not likely project file specific.
This should be fixed in the latest nightly builds :)
@kannes Would you be ok to try out the latest code, and let us know if this works well for you now? :smile:
Ahhh yeah, that sounds both simple enough to implement + useful too.
A bit of background information here: All our file dialogs are opened always showing the same directory which can be configured in the Preferences dialog. So it's used for all dialogs (no matter whether you're opening a DB, exporting a CSV, ...) and it's used all the time (the application doesn't remember the most recently used directory at any point).
Personally, I think this behaviour is stupid and annoying. But looking at issue #115 I can see that other people actually expect this very behaviour when using the application. So I'm not sure what to do here... Maybe we can have a little poll ;) I'd vote for remembering the latest path.
So for opening/saving db's we have directory and for cvs import/export.
Something like that
@rp- Even better :) I fully agree.
Yep, that sounds like the right approach. :smile:
Please check if your distribution provides a newer version, or compile it yourself.
See BUILDING.md for instructions.
@reeshkov Out of curiosity, which operating system are you using? :smile:
Cool.  That should be pretty easy for you to compile our latest code on.
At a guess, the instructions for Ubuntu [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md) are probably what you want.
If they don't work for some reason, please let us know (with as much information as possible), so we can try to fix the problem. :smile:
The download location for our most recent release (version 3.4.0) is here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.4.0
No worries. :smile:
@reeshkov Is the latest version working better for you? :grinning:
We haven't heard back from @reeshkov, so I'm closing this now.
@reeshkov If the same problem still happens in the new releases, you're completely welcome to re-open this issue and we'll investigate. :smile:
It's a random thought, but one workaround might be to export all of the item tables to csv files (yeah, slow atm, sorry).  Then see if there's some other program (like LibreOffice Calc) which can search through all of them at once (after it's loaded them).
@Tythesly, I don't know how would this work. Should it search a string in all the columns of all the tables?
Good point.  Some kind of dialog with checkboxes - listing the tables, should work, and it shouldn't be too hard to implement.
Hi!
With 1ce33792c534f7228fd888d0b27f5abdc51c8c28 multiple tables can be selected to be exported into an selected folder.
That's awesome Rene! :grinning:
@Tythesly Would you be ok to try tomorrow's automatic nightly build?  That will have this feature in it, and we'd like to know if it works well for you. :smile:
Awesome. :grinning:
If other stuff turns up, yep, please report it. :wink:
Hmmm, this sounds like it may be a bug with the NSIS installer part of things we're using.
@rp- Any ideas?
Ahhh, cool.  Thanks. :smile:
That's probably enough of a hint for us to figure it out.  Let's see...
@timrae In theory (!), this should be fixed a while ago.  Do you have a few moments to download our recent 3.8.0 release, and test this out just to be sure? :smile:
Cool, it's all good. :smile:
Interesting. :wink:
Also (if our code seems to be the problem), which version of DB Browser for SQLite are you using, and how did you export the table? (eg which options, etc) :smile:
Doing some Googling, this looks like the solution (step 7 in particular):
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://support.mobileapptracking.com/entries/27347804-How-To-Import-a-Unicode-CSV-to-Excel
Give that a shot and see what happens. :smile:
Hmmmm, that's not good. I'm not sure of the solution for this.  It seems our export is working ok, but Excel isn't doing the import properly. :frowning:
Keep researching this and trying stuff I guess.  If there's something we can tweak on our end so that Excel imports better, let us know.  We'll definitely consider it (if the amount of effort needed isn't too overboard of course). :wink:
Yep, that's already possible.  Kind of surprised you didn't notice it already (it's not hidden). :wink:
In the "Export data as CSV" dialog, there's a "Field separator" line with a drop down box.  This lets you choose what to use for separating the fields.  The pipe character is one of the common options, and there's a "Other" option too, for specifying less common stuff if needed as well.
Now this is interesting.  I don't have MS Office, so I exported the items table to a .csv file then imported it into [Libreoffice Calc](http://libreoffice.org) instead (a free equivalent to Excel).
![2014-11-07-dbbrowser_original_item_table-specific_rows_highlighted](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4959340/7b46706a-66b7-11e4-8e99-4a07f92fdbe1.png)
At first I thought it worked 100% perfectly, but then I noticed **some** of the rows (not many) aren't importing quite right.  For two lines (id values 150 & 155), their description field value is being broken up into three columns (E, F, G) on the import:
![2014-11-07-libreoffice_calc_text_import_result-slightly_broken](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4959332/70f32798-66b7-11e4-8a50-670b3c2ba1bb.png)
And looking at the .csv file, it seems the problem is in there.
![2014-11-07-csv_file_shown_in_vi](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4959346/83d6151e-66b7-11e4-8094-942d55acbe21.png)
So it looks like our csv export code has a bug in it somewhere. :wink:
For reference, these are the import settings I used:
![2014-11-07-libreoffice_calc_text_import_settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4959349/90a0e0f8-66b7-11e4-9c2c-584d00642b85.png)
@MKleusberg @rp- Any ideas?  If it helps, I've uploaded the .sqlite3 file, the .csv file, and the LibreOffice calc .ods file here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/issue144/
Heh heh, I've just done exactly the same, Justin (also wanting to be worshipped for months) ^^
But I have to admit I didn't see the problems you found. The fix for this was trivial though - the next nightly build will export it correctly.
@MKleusberg Heh Heh Heh, awesome.  :grinning:
@Tythesly Have you downloaded LibreOffice? (www.libreoffice.org)  The LibreOffice Calc program will open .ods files, which are its equivalent of MS Excel files.  Libreoffice is completely free, so you're 100% ok to download/install/use it, etc without hassle.
To make things a bit easier, here's the .csv and .ods file again, but this time exported using Martin's fix. :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/issue144/compact_decrypt-fixed_version.csv
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/issue144/compact_decrypt-fixed_version.ods
If you grab tomorrow's nightly build of DB Browser for SQLite (from the download location on our front page), you'll be able to export them correctly yourself too. :grin:
Ahhh gotcha.  The "native" file format for LibreOffice Calc is .ods.  In the same way that the "native" file format for Excel is .xls.
So, I imported the .csv file into LibreOffice Calc, then saved it out as .ods.
Is that the bit you were unsure of? :smile:
Awesome, I think you're all set to get stuff done now. :grin:
Ahhh, didn't think of that.  Yeah no worries.  Gimme a few minutes.
Hmmmm, it's possible we've found a bug in LibreOffice Calc.  I can export and import the .csv file ok, but Calc is having problems saving to .ods.  eg it uses 100% of a cpu core (hasn't finished yet), and doesn't create the .ods file.
Here is the .csv if it helps:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/issue144/localized_texts.csv
Heh Heh Heh.  Try opening this with Excel:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/issue144/localized_texts.xlsx
I'd forgotten that Calc can also save in some MS Excel formats.  The old .xls format isn't good enough (65535 row maximum), but the newer .xlsx format seems to have all of the information.  And Calc seemed to save that without too much problem (unlike .ods). :grin:
You're welcome.  Good luck. :smile:
@Tythesly It's already available in our nightly builds (download location for the nightly builds is on the front page). :wink: :
Are you able to put the file online somewhere, so we can try it out?
Or, if you don't want it accessible to the public, are you able to email it to me (justin@postgresql.org)?  I can then forward it to Martin and Rene (the technical guys). :smile:
As a second thought, does the sqlite3 command line client open the file ok?
Hmmm, that file doesn't seem to be showing up in a way I can get it.
Emailing it to me might actually be the easiest approach. :grin:
sorry but I get this even with the sqlite3 commandline client:
`sqlite> .schema`
`Error: file is encrypted or is not a database`
The file looks encrypted to me since there is no readable text in it whatsoever if you open it in a hex editor. Unfortunately we don't support encrypted databases (yet) but even if we did support the encryptions algorithm used in this particular file you'd still need the passphrase...
Now, after some googling, I suppose you got that file from ArcheAge? If this is the case, there's still some hope. On [this Russian site](http://allcheats.ru/t220061/) there's a description of a tool which extracts the passphrase and decrypts the database. You should then be able to open and edit the decrypted database.
Good luck.  Hope it works out for you.  Once you get it unencrypted, it should work with DB Browser for SQLite. :smile:
(feel free to re-open this issue, if it doesn't work after being decrypted)
Oh wow, yeah.  If you cut-n-paste the data out of the "name" and "description" fields into Google Translate, does that work? (guessing that's the first thing you tried :grinning: )
Hmmmm, maybe there are separate files in the program, that just have the english translated strings?
With computer software (by English-speaking authors), it's very common to have all of the program in English, but also include a file with translated text strings.  When the program starts up, it detects the computer is in (say) French, and loads the French language file.  For every bit of text to display, it loads the French text string from that file, instead of displaying the English version.
DB Browser for SQLite does this too.  Here's our French translation file as an example:
Hope that helps. :smile:
Yep, that sounds like the right kind of file.
What turned out to be the problem? :smile:
Yeah, not sure about this.  Martin/Rene?
We might want to reject this for now, but consider it again at some future point?
It's pretty likely we'll support them at some point.  But it's not likely for the upcoming release (3.10.0), and we still a fair amount we need to get done for that. 😕  This takes you through the complete developer environment setup process for Windows, along with getting DB4S built and running:
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S
Does that help? :smile: If you're up for getting it done (takes a few hours, though that's mostly downloading and waiting for installs to finish), be aware that some of the paths in the setup guide no longer match the ones hard coded in the source.  They're not far off, and it's easy to fix if you know to watch out for it. :wink:
The paths used in the source at the moment are: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L18-L30
(that's for compiling on 64 bit windows)
Notice the "5.7" in the Qt path?  That'd likely need updating to "5.8".  Similar for the OpenSSL and SQLite paths in that highlighted section too, just make sure they match the directory structure you create when you go through the guide. :smile: @nowox Working on this now. Turns out to be trickier than expected but I might be able to push a first version this evening. Progress:
- [X] Update
- [ ] Insert
- [x] Delete
Delete seems easy enough, insert however more tricky.
By default, views are still locked from editing because most databases don't have triggers in place for editing views. This means you have to enable editing for a view by browsing it, right clicking on the column headers, and clicking "Unlock view editing". You'll then be asked for the name of a unique column in that view. That's because we somehow have to decide how to address rows in the view and there doesn't seem to be any good way to find out a suitable column automatically.  Interesting.  I didn't realise this had changed.  May have been an oversight.
Martin/Rene, thoughts?
This is actually an interesting issue you're raising here. To be quite honest I didn't even know that you could copy the create statement of a view ;)
So here's what I found out: If you look at the tree view in the Database Structure tab (or the DB Schema pane) as a table, what is being copied depends on where you click. If you click on the name of a view and press Ctrl+C the name gets copied but if you click on the create statement and press Ctrl+C that one gets copied which I guess is what you wanted.
Now, we could change that behaviour to always copy the create statement no matter on what column you clicked but this _might_ conflict #119 where the suggestion is to make it easier to copy the name only. But maybe this already helps you; if not we can still add a context menu or so.
I've just added a new action called 'Copy Create statement' to the right-click menu of the Database Structure tab which copies the CREATE statement to the clipboard. From there it can be put in a file or in a SQL editor tab. I hope this makes it more obvious how to access the CREATE statement.
There is no editor window for creating views and therefore we don't support editing them in a graphical way neither. I can't imagine any way of implementing such a dialog, too, because the create statements of views can be incredibly complex... But maybe (hopefully) making it easier to copy the statement to an SQL editor tab already does the trick :)
Thanks @MKleusberg, that's excellent. :smile:
@MarcoTroester @Greg-Roberts Would either of you have time to try out our latest nightly build, and let us know if the new 'Copy Create Statement' approach is workable from your points of view?
You're in luck. :smile:
We automatically compile a build each night from our latest source code (it's scripted), and make that available for download here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
The .xz file there is the compressed version of the program.  Use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org) to uncompress it, and you should be right to go. :grinning:
@MarcoTroester It's @MKleusberg's work. :smile:
It sounds like this issue is pretty much resolved now, so I'm going to close it.  If that's not the case, feel free to reopen it. :wink:
Would you be ok to try the latest nightly build (download locations are on the front page), and see if the problem is fixed there?
We've made a few minor adjustments to things recently to make this better, so your feedback on whether it's good enough now or now would be great. :smile:
By "tooltip", are you meaning the text information pop ups that appear over the icons?
I'm trying to visualise the problem in my head, to better understand it. :smile:
Should be fixed in the next nightly build. I slightly modified your suggestion in order to not remove any line breaks from the tooltip text even if they are removed in the display role (there's a new option in the preferences dialog which makes all create statements one-liners).
Awesome Martin. :grin:
Wow, that's awesome! :grinning:
Thanks!!
@efreeking Would you have the time + interest to update this translation?
We have (mostly) frozen the strings for our upcoming 3.9.0 release, and
generated new .ts files using lupdate.  So... they are in a good state for
translating now, if you have the time. :smile:
I'm ok with the g++ part, but why would I step out of the build directory?
This will not work
Ahhh.  Would you be ok to update this pull request, with the new fixes? :smile:
No worries at all.  We're glad you're trying to help and improve things.  Please keep doing so.  Really. :smile:
Thanks
Confirmed and I also noticed that we suffer the same memory problem as in the csv export before the rewrite.
So while fixing this bug I will also change the export to be streaming like.
Should be working now with 8c5dfbb9779023f315c4801c27c21ad04b852680
Would you be ok to try it out again, using the latest source, and confirm back if the bug is fixed now or not? :wink:
Closing this for now, as it **should** be fixed.  @roehrip If it turns out not to be, please let us know/reopen this, etc. :smile:
Thanks, that's excellent. :smile:
Thanks Jade, this sounds like good brainstorming. :grinning:
Thanks for spotting this! And my bad - totally forgot about this option :grinning:
I've just pushed a commit which fixes it this way: If you delete your default value the entire DEFAULT clause gets removed, just like it was before. I think that's the most intuitive approach and also what I originally intended. If somebody wants to have an empty string as default value they can do so by typing in "''" (<- that's two single quotes). The dialog won't touch your default value if it is quoted already.
Cool. :smile:
Ouch, that doesn't sound great. :frowning:
As a thought, which OS are you using?  If it's Windows or OSX, would you be ok to try out our latest nightly build? (download locations are on the front page of this repo)
We've been adjusting our CSV import code recently, so there's a decent chance the new builds will "just work" for you. :smile:
xz is a lossless data compression program and file format which incorporates the LZMA compression algorithm.
One can think of xz as a stripped-down version of the 7-Zip program. xz has its own file format rather than the .7z format used by 7-Zip (which lacks support for Unix-like file system metadata).
Heh yeah.  .xz just means it's compressed.  Use [7zip](http://www.7zip.org) to uncompress it.
Cool. :smile:
I'll close this issue.  The fix will be in our next release (very soon), and has been in our nightly builds for a while.  Thanks for double checking this. :wink:
If you change the size in the Preferences dialog, does it work?
k, that's weird.  I noticed someone similar temporarily a few versions ago, but it seemed to er... "magically" go away. (eg it just started working again)
I'll have to try this out on my OSX desktop later today or next week after I return (travelling), to see if I can figure out what's going wrong. Sorry for the inconvenience. :frowning:
Just as a thought, would you be ok to try the latest nightly build and see if the behaviour is the same there?  Guessing it will be, but it's worth a shot just in case. :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/nightly/
Oh interesting.  This probably won't be too hard to fix.
@MKleusberg Your kind of thing?  Notice the small font size in the bottom left pane.  It should have the font from "SQL log font size" preference applied to it as well.
Yes, I can do that - in fact, I just did :wink: For the log in the Execute SQL tab we're now using the same font size as for the SQL log pane on the right. Previously it was set to a fixed value of 8.
The fix should be in there in tomorrow's nightly build and should work automatically without you being required to change any settings.
Awesome. :smile:
@elton12345 Would you be ok to try out this onceoff build, which has the new code, and confirm back whether it works or not?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/onceoffs/sqlitebrowser_201410151310.dmg
Heh heh heh, sounds like it worked then. :wink:
Hmmmm, also interesting.  Did it crash immediately, or did it take a bit of time before crashing?  eg to run out of memory first
@rp- Should we stream statements into the Execute SQL dialog too? (remembering your recent streaming patch)
Hmmm, doesn't sound like a memory exhaustion problem then.  Maybe we need to batch inserts into 'X number of inserts per transaction' or something... I guess Rene or Martin will have better ideas. :smile:
This could be related to #95, so trying the nightly build is worth a shot.
Good thinking. :smile:
Awesome.  Closing this Issue report then, as it's a duplicate of the one in #95 and the fix will be in the next release. :smile:
Interesting.  Good catch. :smile:
Okay, the actual problem here is the default value for the fourth field. It doesn't get handled correctly and this causes most other features of that dialog to break. Luckily I've put some effort into solving this issue today (commit c29702a1b97e6fcc30651973591b7b565746a90d). So just like with your font size issue this should be resolved in tomorrow's nightly build :)
Thanks guys.  Closing this Issue now, as Martin's fix will be in the next release (soon) and will be in the nightlies until then. :smile:
Not a bad thought at all.  Do you have design or coding skills, and some time to help? :smile:
Thinking it would be easier to begin progressing this with some concept diagrams / screenshot-type-things.  Helps work out features, clarify / prioritise things, and so on. :wink:
Cool, please do. :smile:
Thanks, downloading that now.  Is it ok if I insert those pictures into this Issue, so others can see them?
Cool.  It looks like you've spent a lot of time and effort thinking this through, so I hope someone picks up this Issue + implements it. :grinning:

I guess there would need to be a "form designer" part, and a "form viewer" part (eg for displaying data and/or data entry).
No worries Steve.  As a thought, which version of SQLite Browser / DB Browser for SQLite are you using? (same program, we've just recently done a bit of renaming :wink:)  Also, which OS are you using?
Just to point out, we have nightly builds available for both Windows and MacOS X.  Probably best to try out the one for your OS (or compile your own if on Linux), to see if the problem still happens with our latest code.  Locations for the nightly builds are on the front page of this repo (and on the sqlitebrowser.org website). :smile:
Ahhh sorry, I worded that a bit unclearly.  There's no need to learn linux or use a dev environment, since you're on windows. :smile:  The windows executable here is updated every night (automatically) using our very latest code:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz
So, it'd be nifty if you download it again and see if the problem still happens.  That will let us know if it's something still needing fixing, or if it's already been fixed. (we've done a bunch of fixing recently) :smile:
Does that make sense?
Yeah, probably good to update it, to try and keep it clear. :smile:
This issue seems to be related to #64. I've just pushed a commit which (with any luck) fixes both of them.
Excellent. :smile:
@stevefalzon Would you be ok to try tomorrow's nightly build, to check if this new code fixes the problem for you?
Hmmm, I'm wondering if this new problem is the same as https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/133?  If it sounds like it, would you be ok to check the new nightly build tomorrow (Friday), which has Martin's initial code for fixing that in it. :smile:
@stevefalzon Reminder ping.  @jadeade in Issue #133 says the problem is now fixed for her.  Just wanting to confirm it's now fixed for you as well. :wink:
Hopefully that title change is correct (just noticed the updated OP). :wink:
Pretty sure this is all fixed now, so closing it.  @stevefalzon If it does turn out to still be a problem, please reopen this. :smile:
What version are you using?
@DSLituiev Would you be ok to include a screenshot as well?  I'm finding it hard to visualise the problem. :frowning:
Hmmm, those images aren't showing up for me.  If you're ok to email them, send them to me directly at justin@postgresql.org.  I'll figure out how to get them into this issue report properly.:smile:
I don't know why, but those screenshots aren't showing up in the issue for me in Dmytro's comment above, even when I manually paste them in.
But they are showing up in my comment (markdown related?), so I'll include them below. (weird)

@DSLituiev If you change the font in the Preferences menu, does this problem still happen?
Please try a newer build.
Oh, good point.  That's from the old pre-3.x releases.  Several years old. :dizzy_face:
@DSLituiev It should be fairly easy to compile our newest code on Ubuntu.  There are [instructions for Ubuntu in BUILDING.md](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md), if that helps. :smile:
@DSLituiev How'd you go with this? :smile:
No worries.  Thanks for testing @DSLituiev. :smile:
I guess Ubuntu 12.0x LTS will keep using the ancient version forever, and only some newer versions of Ubuntu have our latest releases.  Not much we can do about that. :frowning:
What build version are you using?
Can you give a nightly build a try:
http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
I added dummy collation support in there. see #54
Thanks for checking, that's really good news.  The fix will be in our next release (soon) as well, so I'll close this issue. :smile:
As reported by @beyonav in https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/107#issuecomment-57966995, it looks like our quote character handling still needs a bit more tweaking.
With reference to the spec at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180:
> 1. Double quotes issue:
>
> The spec says double quotes are optional as long as no special chars are in the field. So the current version is strictly correct, yet it creates trouble with Excel (it prevents automatic field type detection). Since Excel is a widely used tool AND avoiding unnecessary double quotes creates smaller files I would recommend removing them.
>
> >    "5."  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however

> >

>

Ahh, good thinking. :smile:
Hmmmm, if the Excel version of csv is consistent (I haven't read csv.html yet), then we might be able to add an "MS Excel compatible?" checkbox to the dialog or something, with corresponding code bits to make it work.
With latest master it should new produce more RFC like CSV files.
Closing this for now.  @beyonav If the newest code doesn't turn out to work well enough for you, please let us know. :smile:
Hmmm, I'm not sure I'm understanding the problem.  Is it the "0 - 0 of 0" line in the bottom left corner?
Thanks for reminding me of that issue with the wrong row numbers - I noticed that some time ago but completely forgot about it ;) Anyway, this should be fixed now by commit ae19911.
Regarding the '<' & '>' operators: You're right that they probably make no sense in this specific context but then again, this is valid SQL and exactly what SQLite returns when executing a query like that. In other cases they might even make sense, e.g. when there are mixed types in a column (some numeric rows, some text rows).
@rp- @MKleusberg Looks like a decent idea to me.  What do you guys reckon?
@mcirsta Thanks btw. :smile:
thanks
Hello,
When running the DB browser for SQLite version 999.0.0 under Kubuntu 13.04, I get my menu bar, dialog buttons and tab headers in a different - and wrong - language (specifically German) from my locale settings (Country: United States of America, Preferred Language: American English). Seems like everything explicitly KDE-related is being mistranslated. All of the rest looks correct. Screenshots for verification attached below.
Relevant details:
OS: Kubuntu 13.04
DB Browser for SQLite version: 999.0.0
QT Version: 4.8.4
KDE version: 4.10.5
Kind Regards,
David

Was DB Browser from source, or was it installed from a package in the Kubuntu repos?
In theory (!), the language you're seeing should be controllable by environment variables.
Try setting this environment variable first from the command line, then starting the application again right after that (from the same command shell):
```
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```
If that works, then it's _probably_ something in your environment that's not quite right.  That being said, DB Browser should at least be consistent in it's language choice, even when it gets things a bit wrong... so something's not 100% in the code. :wink:

Tough luck I'm afraid... that's already what it is (ref. attachment) :-(.

Was a thought. :wink:
Would you be ok to list the complete output of our environment here (or in a gist, or maybe fpaste.org)?
I'll try and replicate it here and see what happens.

close the issue.
Sincere thanks for the very prompt assistance!
You're completely welcome. :smile:
Sorry, I was planning to do that myself but RL issues came in between I'm afraid.
No worries at all. :smile:
It's just a placeholder version number in the development code.  It's replaced in the released versions with the release number.  eg 3.3.1, 3.4.0, etc. :smile:
Interesting idea. Could be the start of a visual query builder. :wink:
Tab completion of variable names and keywords in the Execute SQL window would be nice too.  Unsure what it would take to implement though...
Buena pregunta. Yo no creo que vaya a funcionar. Podemos preguntarnos los principales desarrolladores (René y Martin), sin embargo, para estar seguro.
@rp- @MKleusberg Any ideas?  Have we tried compiling with sqlite2.x to see if it would work?
:frowning:
the last sqlite 2.x release is from 2005.
I think even the "old" sqlitebrowser only had sqlite3 support (at least the later versions)
And definitely no support for sqlite2 as it has completely different API calls.
@jonorozco2013 Lo sentimos, pero DB Browser para SQLite no soporta SQLite 2.x de ninguna manera.
No puede ser compilado para usarlo y no abrira ficheros de base de datos de SQLite 2.x.
Simplemente SQLite 2.x es demasiado antiguo :frowning:
(thanks to Francisco Fuente Diez again for translating :smile:)
@Z4us Not sure if it would work in this instance though, as @jonorozco2013 mentioned his team work with SQLite 2.x for their web development.  So it sounds like an ongoing usage of SQLite 2.x, rather than a once off thing.
Updating their usage to be all SQLite 3.x would obviously be an improvement from our point of view, but I have no idea what other constraints they're working with keepinng them to the old version.
---
I'm going to close this issue, as I doubt we'll ever introduce SQLite 2.x compatibility.
NOTA - Esto es de Google Translate. Sólo me hablo Inglés nativa. :wink:
Si es así, entonces usted puede desactivarlo mediante View → "DB Schema". En el menú superior.
¿Eso ayuda?
También puede arrastrar la vista "DB Schema" de la interfaz principal. Entonces será en su propia ventana. :smile:
Lo siento mucho, pero estoy teniendo problemas para entender. Voy a pedir un compañero de trabajo de traducir para mí, pero será mañana.
Espero que está bien. :smile:
from what i filtered out, this is related to #79
Translations from a work colleague (thanks Francisco Fuente Diez!):
> Hi, the problem is that you show the scheme of a table inside Treeview,
> the size changes considerably damaging the entire interface of your program."
Just after screenshot he also said:
> I reccomend you the scheme of the table is shown in a messagebox or in
> a form in order to don't damage program interface"
In the next comment, he said:
> No, but DB Schema is useful to him to know the elements of a table. What
> I mean is into the data structure"
And finally he remarks in two red circles the area he suggest it would be nice to put into a messagebox or in a form.

Closing this as the issue is quite old and should be solved. I hope this is fine for everybody :)
Interesting.  I wonder if the project rename broke the save preferences or something.  Would you be ok to try the 20th September nightly build, and see if that works as expected?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/nightly/sqlitebrowser_20140920.dmg
Figured it out?
Interestingly, @MKleusberg added https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/5d20d97e249a42d7dae1061d946c90c9c987d608 earlier today.  Kind of wondering if that might fix this problem for you on 10.6.  Want to try tomorrow's nightly build and check?
Found one more place where we didn't use the default location from the preferences dialog and fixed it (280d5c17737f3f380b98c6d952441ded1f900d07) but I don't think this latest commit changes something about this issue.
@Z4us Out of curiosity, have you tried any of the recent nightly builds? It'd be interesting to know if this works 100% on OSX 10.6 now. :smile:
Yeah, not sure.  Guess we'll need to keep an eye out for it. ;)
This may be related to https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/107.
Unsure how to approach this though for such large file sizes.
Does the command line version of sqlite open this database ok?
if the command line utility can open it, I see no real reason why sqlitebrowser shouldn't be able to.
Until of course there is some sort of bug or we run out of memory while we generate additional table information
But for example the row size shouldn't really hit us, as since 3.0 we added partial table retrieve to not fill up the memory with huge tables.
If so, would you have time to try opening the database file with the command line client, to see if that works?
@serden84 @renkun-ken Our new release from a few days ago has a 64-bit Windows build.  Would you have a few minutes to try it out with your larger data set files?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.6.0
We're hoping the 64-bit builds work better for large data sets now... :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.7.0
The 32 bit version is unlikely to ever load large database files.  To load large ones, you must use the 64 bit version.  And yeah, I understand that might not be easy. :frowning:
Closing this as we introduced large database support on Windows with version 3.6.0 64-bit.
Yes, the 64 bit version sounds like the right approach here.
But let's not forget the 'x rows affected' thing @ogloo mentioned above as this makes a lot of sense (even though it's a bit off topic in this issue :smiley: ). With the latest commit I've just added this feature. Now, it's a bit awkward to say but it'll be available in the next nightly build which - unfortunately - is only available as a 32bit executable...
@ogloo Would you be ok to try tomorrow's nightly build, and let us know if the new UPDATE output is working well for you? (download locations are on the front page of this repo if that helps)
Bug reported via private email:
```
I have a small issue. On the screen “Database Structure” it’s great to see the
Schema but I cannot see the whole line as it is too long. Unfortunately, it’s not
possible to scroll or copy. It would be great if you could add one or both
functionalities to be able to see the whole line.
```
I've just pushed a commit which resized the Schema column to fit its contents; if it's too long a horizontal scroll bar will be shown.
A minor problem with this approach is that this overrides any custom column widths on each reload. However, I think that this doesn't really matter as it's the last column anyway and the other two remain untouched.
Thanks Martin.  I'll ask the original reporter to try out the latest nightly build, and see what they reckon. :smile:
Closing this issue as it is quite old and we have a fix applied some time ago.
Thanks for testing this @glawrence. :smile:
Hmmm, I'm pretty sure that standard SQL wildcards work (eg the '%' character), though I'm unsure about quotes.  Does this page on the wiki help?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Using-the-Filters
Closing this, as I'm guessing it was a non-issue and the "Using-the-Filters" page probably covered the wildcards.
Good point.  Linux is fully supported, so we should add instructions for building on it.
On a side thought, the README page is starting to get pretty long so we might want to start migrating instructions into separate BUILDING doc per OS, or maybe onto pages in the wiki.
There is a BUILDING.md file, I would rather move the macos compiling from readme there.
And maybe make the support for Linux a bit mor prominent, but as a developer for me that is pretty clear after seeing the cmake stuff :)
Well yes and no. :wink:
BUILDING.md doesn't explicitly have a "Linux" heading anywhere, so the "BUILD INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS" bit doesn't really jump out as applying.
And yeah, we should probably move the OSX stuff into there too.  Probably need to add heading for Linux and OSX, just to make it super obvious.  And put some kind of pointer in the README file, to direct people there.
I can get around to it later. :smile:
How does BUILDING.md look now?
Just added Linux build instructions with https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/59a9e0bc6aca437fd378e999798e10add9cbb161 and https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/9c00bd9965e37c29cadd80cf4a74e8970617d694. :smile:
Closing this now as it's pretty definitely fixed (and Garrett is away sick).
Get better Garrett. :grin:
Thanks.  I'm not technical enough to look into this, but the guys (Rene and Martin), should be able to figure out what's wrong. :smile:
Thanks, should be fixed. 594ea3842024f69d2966302d8b8690acd582f4c2
Closing this, as it **should** be fixed, although we haven't yet had confirmation back from @ToniTaste.
With the next nightly build editing foreign keys will be possible. I'm updating this issue because the other constraints mentioned in #81 are still missing but at least foreign keys are implemented now :grinning:
Thinking this over, I can't see any reason **not** to do it.  It's up to Rene and Martin though, as they're the actual developers. :wink:
That being said, you're also completely welcome to submit a pull request to address this, if you want to add it yourself. :smile:
Don't worry i have it nearly finished.
Just a few remaining bugs and i'm pretty busy right now.but i guess its in
next week

Should be working now, 5713bc9a0762a9640a5d3d42646f60176ac5a8d4
Thanks @jadeade, sounds good. :smile:
Ahhhh yeah, sounds like this code still needs a bit of work.  Good thing we like people to verify stuff. :smile:
Thanks for noticing, now only on enter a update is triggered.
017715510f8e55
@rp- Thoughts? :smile:
I would and will for now stick with the enter default, as this is also the default key to really add the value to the combobox.
Also it's a bit more work to implement this, as we either have to subclass the combobox or handle the QApplication::focuschanged SIGNAL and keep track of our created comboboxes.
k, we'll keep with just using the Enter key then.  If other people open future issues about this, we can look into in the subclass or signal handling approach. :smile:
You are right, for streaming our sqltablemodel is not really useful as it will not free any unused data.
But doing real streaming for import and export shouldn't be to hard to implement and was on my list anyway.
csv data is now streamed out and shouldn't fill up memory.
50731cd73010053bd43b4dc3ade70a43ce5044b1
Oops, I should have mentioned. :smile:
You can download the nightly windows builds from here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz
.xz is a compressed file file, you can use [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to uncompress it before installing.
Thanks for testing Jens. :smile: I'll close this issue here, because the original reported problem is fixed.
With the quote characters, they're supposed to be optional.  Testing here just now, in Export → "Table as CSV file" dialog there is a "Quote character" option.  Change that from the default of ", to the third line down (no character).  That seemed to work for me, although I don't have a lot of data in the example database I just tried it on.  Does that work for you?
Is this the right spec? https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180
We had some discussion about CSV handing in https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/84.  I guess we need to tweak things further still. :smile:
Hmmm, we should probably turn this into a new Issue, for better tracking.
Are you ok to do that?  If not, just say so and I'll create one. :smile:
Yeah, this sounds like a good idea. :smile:
Should be fixed now - with the latest build you can press Tab or Shift+Tab to jump between the filters.
@maxslimmer Would you have a few minutes to try the latest nightly build (tomorrow), to verify this works properly for you now? :smile:
Not sure which OS you're on, so Windows nightly builds are here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
OSX nightly builds are here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/nightly/
Thanks Geoff, I forgot to mention it needs uncompressing first. :smile:
@maxslimmer No worries, thanks for testing. :smile:
@MKleusberg Should we do something with the enter key for this?  eg same behaviour as tab, or maybe it also moves the cursor to the start of next line or something?
I haven't done anything with the enter key yet because personally I'd expect it to perform some real action and not just move the cursor. So what I thought was that if we're ever going to add some other feature and bind it to the enter key, we don't break any workflows when we don't use it now ;) It wouldn't be difficult however to support the enter key as well if people would like.
Yeah, I guess the question is "what do we want enter to do?".
I'm thinking the equivalent of the tab key sounds ok... but yeah, that could just be my limited imagination atm, and someone might have a better idea. :wink:
@maxslimmer @glawrence @Z4us Any thoughts on this? :smile:
Cool, no worries.  We'll leave Enter alone for now, until someone comes up with a Nifty use for it. :wink:
Closing this issue now too, as the tab key binding bit is resolved. :smile:
Hmmm, I'm more inclined to think it's a bug, and the refresh button shouldn't clear the filters.
Lets see what Rene and Martin think. :smile:
thanks, fixed 57d086fbf2697f40857236d7c1a8bf351035e258
Was in a hurry and missed to commit a file :/
now it should be good. c615e9ac46c30bc3f6d79512484ade3506d3ff5e
@mikeee324 Would you be ok to try out the latest nightly build for your OS, to verify this is fixed? :smile:
@mikeee324 You're welcome. :smile:
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.  At the moment it does the whole database to a .sql file, which can then have the INSERT statements stripped out.  But a schema only export would be useful to some people too.
@MarkyMar We've added code for this today (written by @schdub).  Would you be ok to try our latest nightly build (tomorrow), to check that it's working the way you meant it? :smile:
Closing this as it has been fixed quite a while ago and nobody reported issues since. If there any problems left with this let's just open a new issue :smiley:
Just noticed these. :wink:
```
sqlitedb.cpp:13:23: warning: unused parameter 'pArg' [-Wunused-parameter]

4 warnings generated.
```
@Z4us Completely agree.  They're mostly harmless.
That being said, we managed to get rid of all the warnings a while ago, so we kind of try to keep that way now.  It helps demonstrate that our code is cared about. :smile:
Yep, it's best to avoid warnings whenever we can, in my opinion, just to make sure, warnings which point out actual problems are more salient.
You missed the [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) file ;)
Oops.  Will fix later today. :smile:
Found out why.  Bad grep on my part.  I used this:
```
$ grep -ri "database browser" *| grep -v .ts
```
When I should have used this:
```
$ grep -ri "database browser" *| grep -v "\.ts"
```
Now, the next question is... do we want to make the change right away with a 3.3.2 release, or should we just do it with the next (3.4.0) release?
I'm kind of tempted to be lazy, and do it with the 3.4.0 release... :smile:
Sorry that I only noticed now but in the [distri/sqlitebrowser.desktop](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/distri/sqlitebrowser.desktop) file it still says "SQLiteBrowser". Maybe we should change that as well, for consistency's sake.
I'd also opt for making this part of the 3.4.0 release. This time the change is so subtle that it's probably not really worth the annoyance for anybody ;)
Ahhh, well spotted.  Fix coming up.
@MKleusberg With the "Name=" field in that file, does it have to be a 1 word name (eg DBBrowser4SQLite) or can we use the long version? eg DB Browser for SQLite
Now I'm looking closer, there are other places I missed as well.  Fixing them too...
@justinclift You're definitely allowed to have spaces in there. That's the text that shows up in the application menu of your Linux desktop.
When you guys reckon this is good, please merge it. :smile:
Heh, and it's saying merge conflict now... I'll fix it later. :wink:
Yeah, we could do that.  We're trying to avoid changing the project URL, registering new domain names, and so on though. :wink:
Should be ready to merge now. :smile:
With the commit I've just made you should be able to attach other databases using the new menu item. Because of a SQLite restriction this is only possible when you're not in a transaction - that is when you haven't made any changes since the last save, i.e. the 'Write changes' button is disabled.
Maybe this commit solves your problem already but as I said in the commit message there is some more work to be done. I'll be on holiday soon but would continue working on this in October - unless it's already done by then of course ;)
Good point.  Just added it to the milestone list for 3.4. :smile:
We don't have one at the moment.
I can create an updated build for you using the latest code though if you want?
Is this workable?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/stuff/sqlitebrowser-3.4dev-201409071420.dmg
The thought of a nightly build for OSX is a good one btw.  Will think it over and see if we can make it fully automated. :wink:
Thinking about this, compiling the .dmg file itself each night shouldn't be too difficult.
@rp- With a nightly .dmg for OSX, should we put it in the same location as the Windows nightlies?  Guessing it could be auto-uploaded using rsync with ssh public key authentication or similar?
:smile:
Initial automatic nightly builds for for OSX here:
&nbsp; &nbsp;  http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/nightly/
"Initial" because they're created by a hastily made script which has no real error checking in it (yet).  We can improve that over time, if it turns out to be needed. :smile:
@Z4us As a thought, you can always download a tarball of the latest source code here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/tarball/master
Does that help?
Ahhh 10.6, cool.  Just added that to the list of versions known to work.  Wasn't sure before. :smile:
Thanks, fixed 9682d34ca7a46d227a0
@mattn Would you be ok to try our latest nightly build, to confirm the problem is fixed for you? :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz
.xz is a type of compression.  It can be uncompressed using [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html).
Awesome. :smile:
Ahhh, interesting.  There was another .csv file bug reported recently too (https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/84), so it sounds like our .csv code needs some adjustment.
Without knowing the code involved, I'm suspecting this doesn't sound like a hard bug to fix. :smile:
Rene added a "Trim fields?" option to the import dialog today, so it's controllable now:
![screen shot 2014-09-03 at 11 51 09 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4142666/028ec212-33bd-11e4-9eba-d3128374a3ea.png)
That'll be in the next release in ~5-6 weeks. :smile:
the new cvs parser already supports line breaks in quoted text, trimming and is a bit faster.
Good point. :smile:

@nielscup The next nightly will auto add missing columns (with NULL values) on import.
What step is slow? There are 2 steps involved:
1. parsing of the CSV file (1. progress bar)
2. inserting parsed data into sqlite table
Maybe you could provide your slow csv file, or a sample file that is slow also in your case?
I did test with CSV files up to 100 000 records and didn't have any speed problems.
I'm sorry, but I can't really reproduce this slow import behavior, even on windows.
I just tried a 86mb csv file with 1.4 mio records and it is reasonable fast (19s for decoding).
http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/
hail-2002.csv sample(first 2 lines removed)
Also the 3.3.1 version takes nearly the same time, just memory consumption is a bit lower.
Could you check your memory consumption while importing? Maybe you run out of memory and windows starts swapping, if so we could do some kind of stream-writing of data and we would only need one record in memory at a time.
btw. file attaching doesn't work here.
@nielscup If there's any kind of file you can generate (and share with us) which gives the same slowdown problem, you're welcome to email it to me directly (justin@postgresql.org).  I'll forward it to Rene and Martin. :smile:
created a 104k record file ~ 120mb and I have no different behavior than with the hail file.
same speed as with 3.3.1. the only thing is that the new parser takes more memory.
So I still guess you run out of memory in your scenario, I can't think of anything else.
@nielscup ping.  Any chance you can test out the new 3.4.0 release, and let us know if the problem is fixed or not? :smile:
Thanks Niels.  I'll close this now then. :smile:
Hopefully the performance is workable on at least some of your computers. :wink:  If not, feel free to open a bug about that and we can look into that aspect of things as time permits.
Just tested this on OSX 10.7.5, and it's still compiling + running fine.  So, no breakage from this patch.
Rene/Martin, is it ok to merge it?
@hurzl Thanks for this.  Wasn't sure if it runs on FreeBSD, so now we know. :smile:
thanks
Our rough aim for 3.4 is October 5th. :smile:
Thanks, fixed 1f6fe115602bf790e5180
@diego0020 Would you be ok to try out the latest code (which includes this fix), to confirm it works for you now?
Not sure which operating system you're on... if it's Windows, there are nightly builds available here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz
.xz is a type of compression.  It can be uncompressed using [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html).
You're welcome. :smile:
Best would be if you do a pull request with your translation file.
@mvt91 Ahhh, file attaching generally doesn't work in these issues.
You're welcome to email the file to me though (justin@postgresql.org).  If it's something that just needs to be dropped in the right place, I should be able to figure that out. :smile:
@mvt91 The pull request seems happy, though I'm not sure how to actually test it:  https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/92
What author info do you want on it?
@mvt91 Would you be interested in updating the translation for our next release (in a few weeks)? :smile:
Cool.  I think I'll need to generate it first, which I don't remember how to do off the top of my head.  I'll look at it tonight. (I really should write down instructions for myself eh? :wink:)
Awesome.  Would you be ok to email it to me (justin@postgresql.org)? :smile:
GitHub just drops email attachments. :frowning:
No worries at all.  I had a similar problem ages ago when I first tried out SQLite Database Browser too. :smile:
How did you install v3.3.1?  It's possible I included an older version of SQLite accidentally. (!)
Ahhh yeah.  I've just looked at the SQLite version in the .dmg file, and it's indeed 3.7.12.
I'll get this fixed in the next day or two.  Sorry about this. :frowning:
Probably not.  We generally compile against the latest released version of SQLite, which is then picked up and included in the .dmg file.
In this instance, I think what happened is I missed a setup step in the compiling procedure and instead compiled against the old OSX provided version of SQLite.  So that got picked up and included instead. :frowning:
The OSX machine I compile releases on isn't accessible until tomorrow (routing issue that needs fixing), so we're kind of stuck until then. _sigh_
Just added a v2 .dmg to the releases page:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/v3.3.1/sqlitebrowser-3.3.1v2.dmg
I'll remove the older .dmg in a while.  Just need to update a few links that point to it first.
k, all the links and various sources for the .dmg now have the v2 one, so I've nuked the first version.
I'll close this issue for you but I think you shouldn't need any special permissions for that. There's a 'Close issue' buttons below the text field for writing comments on GitHub.
I've put some effort into this lately and it's more or less functional now - the only thing missing is an option for converting between w/o rowid tables and normal tables, and maybe some testing. So the next release will definitely support tables without rowid. If you really need that feature sooner you could try compiling the current development version yourself or maybe ask Justin to do so :)
> BTW: you could avoid above bug by recognizing the 'C' in the Deming-circle
Definitely.  It's hugely ironic for me that I'm very big on verifying work that's done, and here I didn't.
I've just added a step to our Release Process for manually verifying this, to stop this particular problem happening again.  https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Release-process
- Install the new OSX .app from the .dmg, start it, and check the SQLite version in the About dialog.  If this isn't at least 3.8.6 then something has gone wrong and needs to be fixed.
What version are you using?
this sounds like a pre 3.3.0 bug, btw. couldn't reproduce with master branch.
@cbigsby Interesting.  Would you be ok to email the sample database to me (justin@postgresql.org), and I'll forward it directly to Martin and Rene. :smile:
hm works here
@cbigsby No worries at all. :smile:
Interesting.  I'm not in-depth enough to answer this intelligently, but Martin or Rene should know. :smile:
Hi!
The [REGEXP](http://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#regexp) function needs to be defined(mapped) by the application, which leads to certian problem for our use case:
What regexp library should we use? there are certian regexp libraries around and I think the std::regexp just made it in gcc 4.9, but with c++11 standard. A logical choice for us would be to use the [QRegExp](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qregexp.html), but I think this syntax doesn't really match POSIX standard. Or probably the regexp syntax you would expect.
So no, right now we don't support the REGEXP operator.
That should already work. :smile:
Have you tried it, and it's not working?
I just tried it here on OSX 10.7.5 and it worked.  Tested with the command line compiled version of sqlitebrowser, not the .app bundle version.  No idea (yet) if it'd work on OSX with the .app bundle version. :smile:
Ahhh yeah, that makes sense. :smile:
Oh, that doesn't sound good.  Do you have a part of the csv file you could share with us, so we can figure out what's going wrong?  eg first few lines or something (they need to trigger the problem too :smile:)
If you do, you're welcome to email it to me (justin@postgresql.org), and I'll forward it to Martin and Rene for investigating. :smile:
Right now I can only give you 2 workarounds, until those bugs are fixed.
1. save your CSV file in the UTF-8 encoding, e..g with libreoffice calc (character encoding can be set on export)
2. Quote all your strings with whitespaces in it, I don't know if there is a CSV rfc or how strings in fields should really be handled, but i guess we shouldn't throw away whitespace between field separaters if they don't mess up the file format.
Fix list for us:
- Add a text encoding combox in the import dialog, so the user can select the correct character encoding, I think right now we only support UTF8/Unicode
- Fix the whitespace skipping
If the bug is something to do with us stripping whitespace around field separators, maybe we should add a checkbox to the import dialog about "preserve whitespace"?
for some reason we don't add any spaces add all if they are not quoted see:
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L948
and since we do line based parsing now, we should never get 0x10 or 0x13 characters (else if above)
The behaviour regarding spaces goes back to commit 37e195ad6fed542e8373368096c6d1d578762866 - I can kind of see the point of that commit as well but, at the moment, would tend to remove lines 946-952. Any objections or better ideas? Maybe adding a checkbox for trimming the field contents would be a good compromise?
checkbox sounds reasonable, I would save the content of a field in a separate buffer to allow post processing as soon as we hit a new field.
It would also be nice to save the last used settings in the main config or per project.
I can do that if you are busy Martin.
Yes, feel free to do that :smiley: Remembering the settings sounds good as well. I also though about extending the list in the encoding combobox automatically whenever a custom codec was used - e.g. user uses "ISO-8859-15", so it's safe to assume that this encoding might be used again. This maybe makes selecting encodings easier without having that endless list of never used formats in there.
Maybe the whole decode csv algorithm needs a rewrite, for example we don't support new lines in field data (if quoted), did this work with the old version?
And I too don't think the sqlitedb.cpp is a good place for this routine.
Cool @Z4us, that's potentially useful.  At the very least it gives us a minimum reference spec to follow.  And it's only about 4 pages long of content. (unless other RFC's I've seen) :smile:
@deichbilder This should now be fixed in the latest code.  Would you be ok to try it, to confirm it works for you now?  Not sure which operating system you're on... if it's Windows, there are nightly builds available here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz
.xz is a type of compression.  It can be uncompressed using [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html).
Awesome, thanks for confirming. :smile:
Oh interesting.  We'll need to wait for Rene or Martin to merge this, but I think it looks good. :smile:
Thank you! Looks good :+1:
While testing your changes I also noticed that one of our tests is failing because of an error in our actual program code - probably wouldn't have noticed that without this PR :)
From @TWiStErRob:
> I see all the schemas listed, however I can't edit (don't even want to, see my comment on #78) nearly any of them because it would remove all the foreign keys and constraints and cascades. See Category_Descendant in http://temp.twisterrob.net/share/MagicHomeInventory.sqlite
This is following on from https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/77.
> Do you have any idea how to approach this?
Not so much, as I'm not that in depth with the programming side of SQLite Browser.  Rene and Martin are though, so they may come up with ideas.  Suggestions and pull requests from other people are welcome too of course. :smile:
It's not a complete fix, but we're making progress. :smile:
All table statements in the sample database are now parsed correctly. This means no foreign keys, constraints, and cascades should be removed when editing those tables. Furthermore, if there *is* a table which isn't fully supported yet you'll see a warning when editing that table.
There are more missing details in the grammar parser but I think we should collect those in issue #741. So I'd suggest closing this issue as all problems mentioned in here should be fixed and for further issues we have a separate issue already. Can somebody, @justinclift maybe :smiley:, double check it's working with the MagicHomeInventory.sqlite database before closing this issue? Just tried to download the database, but the link is 404-ing.
@TWiStErRob Do you still have a copy of it handy? @justinclift Luckily I had still a copy on my disk. Just emailed it to you :smiley:  Thanks, added a ToDo item to try this out tomorrow. :smile: @MKleusberg Is this warning on the virtual table 'Search' expected?
![screen shot 2017-01-06 at 22 52 36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/21735580/d8ad16b2-d462-11e6-8223-667e62f4b508.png)
"USING USING" seems like an error (causing the warning?), though I'm not sure where it's originating from.  Haven't attached a debugger. :smile:
On a side note, choosing that virtual table (no defined fields) in the Browse Data tab displays strangely.  No filters row, probably because no fields.  But the background colouring for the filter row is there.  Not real high urgency to fix though I reckon... :wink:
![screen shot 2017-01-06 at 22 59 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/21735711/d4a11f36-d463-11e6-8cd3-ed69e6192593.png) Thanks @TWiStErRob.  I was definitely taking the lazy approach. :wink: @justinclift Just fixed the double 'USING' bit. Thanks for pointing this out :smiley:
The warning is still showing up but that's expected. You'll see it for all tables that aren't fully parsed by our grammar parser yet. This is true for all virtual tables. Because of this the Browse Data tab stays empty, too. See issue #917 as well. Virtual tables are a going to be a whole new problem for us :frowning:
@TWiStErRob Thanks for commenting back :smiley: I'm going to close this issue since we have #741 for further parsing problems and #917 for all the virtual table stuff. If you find any other parsing issues in your databases feel free to comment in one of these issues or open a new one :smiley:   The crash is already fixed in master branch.
I'll commit some kind of bad workaround for inserting/updating rows, today.
But this kinda goes on par with the issue with the new WITHOUT rowid features. #51
@MKleusberg sorry Martin have to reopen, just try to insert new rows in such a table or update on of them :)
Mhh, works for me :confused:
It's not working for WITHOUT rowid tables but this isn't one of them. At least the sample file by @manisandro is working now :)
try a table where rowid is not the PK
but I have already some quick workaround in the pipe, so you don't need to fix it.
Ok, i see now ;) An actual, proper fix for this will be awkward though, I imagine...
workaround is commited: 55678bb9450a0546835b2d86f5124e7efb0a1109
it basically just shifts the issue from rowid to '_rowid_', but that should be very rare.
@manisandro Do you have a few minutes to try out the latest nightly build, and see if that works for you?
Download locations are listed on the front page of this repo, if that helps. :smile:
Excellent, thanks for verifying. :smiley:
> On the 'Database Structure' tab, could the schema be made to collapse along with the field list? As it is, the benefit of collapsing is rather lost when the schema is long and you can only see a few (or only one) tables on your window anyway.
makes sense to remove newlines while collapsed.
> On the results from running an SQL query, long fields (varchar and friends) should only be displayed up to some maximum length. Otherwise you have to do massive horizontal scrolling to see all your fields.
Maybe we can add saving of column width like we do for the browse table, but there is no easy general solution for this.
> On SQL query results and table browsing, how about a right-click option to copy the value of the field into the copy buffer. At the moment you can accomplish this with browse data by double-clicking and copying from the 'Edit database cell' window, but you can't do it at all with query results.
whats wrong with `CTRL+C`?
I'm not able to create such a table.
```
sqlite> create table test;
Error: near ";": syntax error
```
thanks, got it.
I'll commit a a fix for the warning and empty table definition in dialog today.
But keep in mind that we don't support setting of primary key ordering in the edit table dialog and this is somewhat related to issue #77
It should always be possible to browse the table data and with (e9fc2229c200940a21b0245d636a7e4bde6aa172 and 2cadb387199bfa6a395b7496e0430fccb7ccd08b) this should now always work.
If our parser fails for any reason we will get column names from sqlite directly.
We have no full engine, but right now a parser for create table statements to get information for edit table dialog and it was also to have more information for additions to the auto completion.
And the warning should also be gone, for your create table statement. 6d47c749f8cdc60bc38b6ac14ad96b85826f0b8f
@jschultz Do you have time to test the new changes to confirm things are now working for you like they should? :smile:
I'm not sure which OS you're using.  If it's Windows, the latest nightly build should have these changes in it:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz
.xz is a file compression type, you can open it with 7zip.
hi!
Yeah your table has a _nice_ thing not covered by the sqlite3 create table documentation:
```
PRIMARY KEY(_id AUTOINCREMENT),
```
Additionally, we shouldn't allow to modify tables with constraints on columns, as if the user would rename the table, we would completely remove those constraints, as we can't edit them.
I have a local fix for the crash and will test it more tomorrow and commit a fix.
yes, this is the culprit.
yeah if we just do a simple `alter table .. rename to` then yes sqlite3 will do the right thing, but I'm not sure if we really keep all constraints if you modify a field. Have to check that.
the crash should be solved with this commit: 9fdc71be2ccbfc416d3adfd7f990a829afe2171f
I'm still worried about the modify table dialog, I'm not sure it if is useful to create a full featured create/modify table dialog with all sqlite3 features. if a user want's to create so much fancy stuff he should stick to SQL grammar imho, but of course we shouldn't destroy or remove features from such tables if a user would try to edit them.
> I'm not sure it if is useful to create a full featured create/modify table dialog with all sqlite3 features.
Hmmm, I kind of think it is.  On the other hand, we're definitely aiming at "keeping things simple and not scary" for novice users too.  Having too many options in a dialog could just scare novice SQL users away.
Maybe n "Novice mode" option set in preferences, would let us keep stuff simple for novices.  When it's turned off we can present every option that SQLite supports?
@TWiStErRob Would you be ok to try out the latest nightly build (tomorrow), to verify it doesn't crash any more when opening your database?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz

Ahhh yeah, that looks non-optimal.  Maybe an obvious slider or something like this instead (to pursue this line of thought for a moment more)?
![sqlitebrowser_advanced_mode_screenshot_exploration1b](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/3965436/d2e22978-2796-11e4-892a-366b50bdcc40.png)
Yeah, good point.  Simple + plain + in-sight in context sounds like a better approach in the short term, without a complete UI rethink. :smile:
Going to close this issue as the initially reported problem is fixed, and we're putting out a new release with it.  Let's get this follow on bit into a new issue instead:

Interesting catch. :smile:

thanks for the report
If you're on Windows, the next nightly build (tomorrow) will have this fix in it:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz
&nbsp; &nbsp; (.xz is a type of compression, you can use 7-zip to uncompress it)
This is interesting.  I'm kinda wondering if making the "Database Structure" and other tabs detachable, would be a useful approach.  That way it would be possible to have both that and the "Execute SQL" tabs be open and displayed at the same time.
Thoughts?
I've just pushed a commit which adds a basic DB schema panel. You can't do a whole lot with it except for looking at the schema, but it might help you. Making all tabs detachable looks more complicated to me but could be possible as well at a later point.
@MKleusberg Just tried it out.  Looks pretty workable.  As a thought, how easy is it to make the vertical centering (as shown below) be at the top of the space instead of in the middle?  I'm not 100% sure it would look better... but if it's easy to try we might as well do some screenshot comparisons and find out. :smile:
![sqlitebrowser_db_schema_fix_vertical_centering](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4022498/93a0ce6c-2b3e-11e4-8ad4-706529349d6e.png)
Good news: It's quite easy to move the texts to the top.
See this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4403704/qt-qtableview-alignment-of-checkbox-when-using-isusercheckable) for some more details.
Ahhh, interesting.  Should we re-open this bug in upstream Qt about it, and provide them the needed info?  https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-9047
Maybe put the icon + text in some kind of invisible container, and make the whole container itself go to the top?
@Tmdean Is this issue resolved enough for us to close this? :smile:
You're welcome.  Very good work on @MKleusberg's part there. :smile:
yes, this is missing

ohh I missed composite unique keys, we already have the functionality for primary keys.
@rp- Should we close this Issue for now, or is it better to leave it open until composite keys are added as well?
:smile:
Unfortunately the building instructions are slightly different for each Linux distribution. But for Ubuntu 14.04 this should work:
1. Make sure the build-essentials, cmake, libqt4-dev and libsqlite3-dev packages are installed.
2. Download the SQLiteBrowser source code.
3. Open a terminal in the code directory.
4. Run
``` bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
1. Now it should generate you a binary file called 'sqlitebrowser'.
By the way, just a few days ago the Debian package has been updated to a fairly recent version of SQLiteBrowser which apparently is also available in [Utopic Unicorn as well now](http://packages.ubuntu.com/de/utopic/sqlitebrowser). So alternatively you could try downloading and installing that package. But then again, we've made some improvements since this release which you'll only get by compiling it yourself.
Either way: Let me know if you have any further difficulties and I'll try my best to aid you through the building process :)
Cool - glad I could help :smile:
I'll add these to the BUILDING.md file as well in a bit, under an Ubuntu heading.
Just did this with https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/59a9e0bc6aca437fd378e999798e10add9cbb161 and https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/9c00bd9965e37c29cadd80cf4a74e8970617d694. :smile:
Ahhh cool.  I'll fix it now. :smile:
Thanks Tobias. Done in https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/e93392c4364a5da4048662f53d3679cf757c39e2 :smile:
Good point.  This seems to be needed on at least Fedora 19 as well.  Haven't tried OSX yet.
Thanks Tim. :grinning:
This problem is confirmed on both Fedora and OSX 10.8, so this patch has been merged as https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/2e5405a60b392155756dcaf58bb6ea77883dd360.
Now merged as https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/262612928d1cf2543596e20fd700931ca68ff6d7.
Running this should do the trick:
```
$ sudo aptitude install libsqlite3-dev
```
Alternatively you can search & install the libsqlite3-dev package using whatever package manager Ubuntu uses these days :)
Cool.  Are we ok to close this? :smile:
@rp- @MKleusberg Does this look ok to merge?
It fixes the following compile warning for me on OSX 10.7.5:
```

Thanks!
Want to make a pull request to fix it? :smile:
@achpile Should we close this?  If you're wanting to fix more of the compilation warnings, we should leave it open. :smile:
As a data point, here on OSX 10.7.5 these ones show up as well:

Any idea how to fix those? :smile:
Commit e43f43a3f8a5da65c8e31d11a179a01a059d4376 fixes them. I'm not sure if it makes sense to update to a newer version of antlr sometime but either way, (until then) the warnings are gone now.
@MKleusberg Thanks, that works. :smile:
Compiles with no warnings at all now.  This is good.
Interesting.  The guys recently did some stuff to improve the handling of default values.
Not sure if it would have any affect on this, but it might.
Would you have time to try the latest "night build", to see if the problem still occurs for you?  If so, it's always here (generated automatically):
The .xz file is a type of compression.  I think you can uncompress it using 7-Zip (www.7-zip.org, also open source).  Hopefully it all "just works". :smile:
Thanks for trying, it was worth a shot. :smile:
We'll definitely need to look into this then, since the problem's obviously not fixed yet.  It'll have to be Marrtin or Rene who do that though, as I'm not technical enough with the code bits. :wink:
This issue seems to be related to #126. I've just pushed a commit which (with any luck) fixes both of them.
@jadeade @nealpaze Would you have time to try the nightly build (tomorrow), to check if the problem is now fixed?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz
The .xz file is a type of compression.  You can uncompress it using 7-Zip (www.7-zip.org, also open source).  Hopefully it all "just works". :smile:
Awesome. :smile:
Ahhh, that's interesting.  We had a few reports of something like this just after the v3.2 release, but no resolution yet.
A first thing to try, to see if it's the same thing, is creating a brand new database (any name, tables, etc).  Once that's created, without quitting the program, try then loading the database that's crashing for you.  Please let us know if that does/doesn't work, so we can try and figure out what the problem is from there. :smile:
Also, which operating system are you using, in case we need to create a special Debug version just for you with extreme logging or something added. :wink:
Yeah, fully agree.  It'll be good to figure out wtf is going wrong and get it fixed.
I'm not personally technical enough to be able to help with the debugging for this, we'll have to wait for Martin or Rene.  They're both pretty responsive though, so they'll probably jump on this before tomorrow. :smile:
As a thought in the meantime, would you be ok to try the older 3.1.0 release of SQLite Database Browser?
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/sqlb-3.1.0
That will determine if the problem is a new one added in the last release, or if it's been around for a while.
Hmmm.  Are you comfortable emailing the file to my personal address (justin AT postgresql DOT org)?  I can forward it on to Martin and Rene.  Having the file in hand would really help. :smile:
Understood.  Is it workable to delete all of the data (just leaving the table/field structure) and email that?
Note - It's completely ok if that's also unworkable.  Am just trying to think up possible ways to figure out wtf is going wrong with it. :smile:
With any luck this is the same issue as #56. If this is the case the tomorrow's nightly build from http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/ should work.
Thank you, @EoD, for providing this horrible, horrible database :smiley: As you can see it revealed a number of issues, two of which made the application crash. Tomorrow a new nightly build will be prepared which includes these fixes. Here's the link: http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
I'd love to hear your feedback on any problems you encounter while working with the database - it's not unlikely that there are some more problems. You should also note that adding new rows to a table often won't work because most of the triggers depend on a function called 'trigger_rowid' which has got to be defined in some SQLite extension. If you manage to find that DLL you can try loading it though by clicking View->Preferences -> Extensions and adding it there.
@rp- It's probably best if you could double check my commits. The fact that that sots2 database works is a good test case I think, but I'm not entirely sure this didn't break anything.
@MKleusberg Back from holiday, apart from 8d23c7757820a16b260faec81ab5fe30a62535c8 I give green light, I would need to check that specific commit a bit more, as there are also additions with the no rowid stuff, that I didn't really look into.
Thinking out loud here... is there any way to make the application display a warning message when it can't open the database, instead of crashing?  Maybe something like:
```
Failed to open database [path here] with error [something].
Please create an issue about this at https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues
```
?
@EoD Do you have a few minutes to try out the latest nightly build, just to confirm it works for you now?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz
The .xz file is a type of compression.  I think you can uncompress it using 7-Zip (www.7-zip.org, also open source).  In theory it should all "just work". :smile:
@richardwiden If you have time too, would you be ok to try the latest nightly build as well?
@rp- Do you reckon this issue can be closed?  (there's mention of you wanting to review some bits first)
The changes are fine.
Hi,
this is an issue which was fixed by @TheVanDoom some time ago, so the problem will be solved in the next version. For the time being you can use the nightly build from http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/ (assuming you're using Windows). If your CSV file doesn't use quotes you should wait until tomorrow, however, to include an additional bug fix.
@error505 Out of curiosity, which operating system are you running on?  If it's OSX, I can create a new  .app bundle for you with our latest development code.  That has the fix for this problem.
@error505 Would you have a few moments to try out the latest nightly build, to confirm whether it fixes the problem you reported? :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz
&nbsp; &nbsp; (.xz is a compressed file, you can use [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to uncompress it)
And yeah, I understand you've already figured it out with other software.  Just wanting to make sure it's also fixed in our latest code too, if you have the time to check. :smile:
Thanks @error505, that's awesome. :grinning:
and our internal grammar parser will 99% fail on them i guess.
How did you create the table?
maybe you can paste the table schema, if you use the sqlite3 commandline tool
```
sqlite3 databasefile.db
.schema
```
What I did notice while looking at this is that SQLite allows a whole bunch of UTF8 chars in column and table names, including the '♪' character. But our grammar parser only covers the range '\u0080'..'\u02B8' which excludes basically all writing systems except Latin script. This is accepted by SQLite but not by us:
``` sql
♪♪♪ int,
ΣΣΣ int,
ддд int,
れれれ int
);
```
@rp- What do you think? Is it safe to increase the range up to \uFFFE? Or are there any special chars in there which might cause trouble?
@MKleusberg kinda missed that issue, well if sqlite "supports"/handle them, we should also try to do it as good as we can.
Provided with the antlr source code there is a UTF-8 example which I've adapted for our purposes and maybe it would work but the input reader class they've written doesn't support case-insensitive literals which makes it useless for SQL.
I'm going to take a break from this issue; but I've pushed my latest version to the [utf8grammar branch](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/tree/utf8grammar).
Would a newer version of antlr address this issue better?  We're a couple of major versions behind aren't we?
We could also ask the upstream antlr Community what they're recommend in this situation.  Seems like they have a Google Groups based mailing list (and an old presence on Stack Overflow):
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.antlr.org/support.html
The thing is, antlr 2 is the only parser version of antlr with a good c/c++ interface. All other version are either not very good documented or buggy and not complete at all. At least when I started to write the parser.
Maybe the improved the antrl3 c++ target and a switch might be relative simple to that version, if it fix our issues. We might review that for version 3.4. Or maybe there is a better parser generator I missed completely.
No worries.  Googling around to get a better idea of antlr stuff shows that v4 probably isn't going to turn up any time soon either.  Oh well.

Doesn't sound usable yet, but it's slowing happening.
Thanks a lot! I have played around with translating the application into German and can therefore imagine the amount of work you had to put into this. Creating the qm files at compile time also makes a lot of sense - awesome that you did this for the qmake and the cmake project files :smiley:
You're welcome to make more contributions any time if you'd like to :smile:
@VanDerSam Would you be interested in updating the translation for our next release (in a few weeks)? :smile:
Interesting.  Does the 3.2 version crash as well?
Mhh, the reason for the version 3.1 thing could be that we forgot to increase the number when packaging the MacOS build :sweat: This should have been done in the [src/app.plist](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/app.plist) file.
Anyway, the interesting thing here is that the crash happens in sqlb::CreateTableWalker::parsecolumn(). This means that there is a table definition in your database that our SQL parser doesn't understand yet. For fixing this we'd need the table definition which causes the problem. Because the entire application crashes you probably have to try another SQLite frontend or download version 2.0 of SQLiteBrowser from the SourceForge page to get the definitions. In either case, it's the output of this SQL statement which we'd need to fix the issue:
``` sql
SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master;
```
If you can bother to provide us this information, that'd be a huge help :)
@loeschg As a thought, you can email the output to me directly (eg non-public) if that's better.  I'll forward it via email to Martin and Rene.  My personal email address is justin AT postgresql DOT org.
@MKleusberg Yep, you're correct about the wrong version number being in our src/app.plist file.  Issue created for that here: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/62
@loeschg Thank you very much for your effort, Greg!
This is a minimal example of a table which leads to this crash:
``` sql
CREATE TABLE x(x INT REFERENCES reftab(id) ON UPDATE NO ACTION);
```
The problem was indeed a bug in our SQL grammar rules - simply a missing definition for the 'NO' string. This is fixed in the commit mentioned above.
Maybe Justin will even provide you a new MacOS package, so you won't have to wait for the new version :)
Yep, I can do that.  Coming up. :smile:
@loeschg k, this is a brand new build based on our latest development code:
Would you be ok to try it out, and let us know if that fixes the problem?
Awesome. :smiley_cat:
Yeah, I've thought about this, but decided against it.  The Homebrew version produces a binary that's only really usable from the command line.
eg: not a .app bundle suitable for going in the /Applications folder, which is useful for more people
I suppose we could update the instructions to mention both...
Thoughts?
No worries.  I'll think it over, and see if there's a good way to mention both approaches. :smile:
@martinlindhe I've updated the instructions to include both approaches.  Do you reckon it sounds ok?
Awesome, thanks. :smile:
Interesting.  Thanks for the heads up. :smile:
yes this is an android feature:
> In addition to SQLite's default BINARY collator, Android supplies two more, LOCALIZED, which changes with the system's current locale, and UNICODE, which is the Unicode Collation Algorithm and not tailored to the current locale.
see: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html
sqlite defines some functions to add your own collations: http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/create_collation.html
In respect of sqlitebrowser, I'm not sure how we could handle this in a prober way, we can't implement unknown collation functions for frameworks/apps like android.
We might be able to use some fallback for unknown collation sequences, as far as I understand the collations are just used for sorting.
http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#collation
I'll try to get to it this week
Do you know where i can obtain such a database file? or can you upload such a test db somewhere?
@tprochazka You're welcome to email a database file to me (justin@postgresql.org), and I'll forward to Rene and Martin as needed. :smile:
Thanks got it!
We should now(cf33f3054e613f0a7ac20c5edf4c35ffe994e2bf) support opening of database with unknown collations, for now a messagebox will always open if you are working with such a table of the database.
Check tomorrows windows nightly build (if you are on windows)
@tprochazka Which operating system are you using?  Would you have time to check if this is now working for you, in the latest nightly build?
@tprochazka It should be in our nightly OSX builds already. :smile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/nightly/
@tprochazka You've completely ok to close this issue when you're happy it's resolved btw. :smile:
i'll drop the sqlb- in the next release
Would you be ok to rebase this on the HEAD of master branch, and squash to one commit?
?
It sort of looks like we have a bug in our CSV import code at the moment.  The bug is stopping multi-byte characters from working. :frowning:
A fix for the problem is being worked on (https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/47), though it could be a few more days until it's ready.
Sorry I don't have better news.
Would you be ok to test the next nightly build?  It will be available here:
http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
(wait until tomorrow's one though, for the new version to be created)
:smile:
Closing this as we're **pretty sure** this is fixed, and the original reporter seems to have lost contact so isn't able to confirm. :frowning:
We(sqlite3) will use your DEFAULT values, the problem was more that we didn't sync the view with the real data, after inserting a new row.
Commit 6705e8c9f23845a826019347b6bdbd5c030cb913 will fix the not synced view, and hopefully give a better view what was inserted by DEFAULT.
I don't think we have the same user experience for adding rows as SQLiteManager, so a preview of what would be inserted isn't really possible, after hitting the "insert row" button the insert statement was already executed and only a revert will undo your action.
This was a bug in the parser grammar, thanks!
should be working with f3a2a7495374128a268da4eebda2ea7c5fadb3cc
@jzsoftware Would you be ok to try the next automatic nightly build, to verify this is working for you?
http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
(you'd need to wait until tomorrow, for the next build to be made)
@jzsoftware When you say you removed the .xz extension, did you do that by renaming it, or by decompressing it?
In theory, 7-zip should be able to decompress .xz files:
http://www.7-zip.org
I haven't personally tested it, but I'm 80% sure. :smile:
Cool. :smile:
Agreed.  John created the PortableApps version for 3.1.0.  I've emailed him a few days ago, to mention that 3.2.0 is out.  Haven't heard back from him yet.
Maybe if you ping him via the PortableApps forums?
Thanks Steve. :smile:
v3.2 PortableApp version is now online:
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/sqlb-3.2.0/SQLiteDatabaseBrowserPortable_3.2.0_English.paf.exe
Hope it works well. :smile:
This sounds cool.  I'm not technical enough to review it (Rene or Martin will), but thanks. :smile:
I'll leave this one to Martin, as he did more on csv import/export.
Just a thing i noted on looking at it, the
```
while (!inStream.atEnd()) {
```
should be changed to a do .. while loop, otherwise I think we do nothing if the import file is just one line.
Thanks for finding and fixing this bug :+1:
I'd actually merge this even without applying the change Rene suggested as the old code didn't handle this any better. And it does work as long as the file ends with a line break - which all CSV files should. But of course you're free to change the code to handle those files correctly as well.
The one thing I'd suggest to change before merging is moving the 'current' variable definition inside the body of the outer loop in order to reduce its scope and make the code a bit easier to read. But other than that the change looks pretty good :)
Had a look at the docs, which confused me a bit more :)
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtextstream.html#operator-gt-gt-4
"inStream >> QString" works on words and not on lines, which makes me suspicions how this line based loop will work with that?
@MKleusberg We should probably setup some unittests for the csv parsing.
I've tested this with every configuration I could come up with and it always yielded the expected results. CSV files without trailing line break are now fully imported as well, so another issue we had is fixed as well.
Thanks again for putting your time into this - it was a big help! If you feel like fixing other problems or the like you're always welcome to send in your commits :)
@rp- Good idea! I'll try to write some unit tests today or tomorrow.
And the unit tests are written. Here's the commit which adds tests for all the cases I could come up with - they all pass: e7924f3739218575b6d06795787b0dd85e8c5b6a
Hmmm, wonder if this is related to https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/45 ?
If you try to create a new database file first, **then** open the existing database file you want to use, does that work?
As a thought, would you be ok to try our previous release to see if that works?
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/sqlb-3.1.0
If that release does, it will help us figure out what is going wrong so we can fix it. :smile:
I'm closing this for now, as we don't seem to be getting further info about this.
Hmmm, does it work with SQLite Database Browser 3.1.0? (the previous release)
... wondering if the newly bundled SQLite version in 3.2.0 is busted somehow.
Just to make absolutely sure: You're using the "Open Database" command and not the "Open Project" one?
If this is the case this is definitely a bug. The cause would be that the application fails to load your database and then tries to parse the file as project file which then leads to your error message. The question then is why it fails to open the database even though the load code hasn't really changed :confused: I guess we'd need to step through the load process together, checking that everything works as expected... As a first step you can make sure that the database file you're trying to open starts with "SQLite format 3" when opening it in a text editor.
Or, as Justin just pointed out, a problem in the SQLite version bundled with the Windows release could be a cause as well :)
Hmmm, if you completely restart the application, does it still fail to open the database if that's the first thing you do?
Taking advantage of the fact that I'm having a Windows 8.1 laptop available at the moment, I tried to open a whole bunch of databases on that system and didn't encounter any problems. These are the checks done when opening a database:
1. See if the file actually exists (which I assume it does in your case)
2. Check if the file content starts with "SQLite format 3"
3. Giving the file to SQLite
4. Executing two pragmas
One of these fails and causes the error message - my guess would be number 2 or 3. That could also explain why a newly created file works. Still, looking at the code the only difference between the old and the new version should be the error message it gives you...
@browserboy ping?
@browserboy ping # 2.
Closing this, as we're not getting the needed follow up info from the original reporter. :frowning:
Honestly, I'd given this some more time. As we have two reports of this issue I think something actually is going on here even though it's only happening for very few people. Then again the problem is not that easy to track down at the moment and might just disappear in the next version or a nightly build using another version of SQLite or so.
Sure, this could very well be a real issue we need to resolve.  But without further communication from someone experiencing it, I can't see how we'll do it. :frowning:
Feel free to reopen this if desired though. :smile:
I checked this issue:
- create a new DB
- cancel the table dialog
Then we have a database with a size of 0 bytes and no explicit commit will change anything.
When we try t open that file then, sqlite3 fails as it is no database and we try to open it as a project file, which of course it isn't.
Imho we could only try to check for empty(0 byte) files and ask the user if we should create a new db.
As an alternative idea, would it be better to not create the new file on disk until the "Edit table definition" dialog has been successfully completed?  That would avoid the 0 byte file problem wouldn't it?
we can't, sqlite will create the db file as soon as we call the _open API call, and we need that call to get a valid handle to do anything with it.
Hmmm, thinking about this more, do we really need to do the _open API call before the dialog completes?
actually found a cheap workaround for this. 32ef063d111305e44d83aa39fc4dcf2dc60f88a1
Yeah, good approach. :smile:
Hi!
Could you try a nightly build?
http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
This seems to be already fixed in master branch
This was indeed missing in our SQL parser. Thanks for telling us!
I've added support for the 'NOT LIKE' operator in check constraints in the commit mentioned above. Tomorrow a new build including this fix should be available via the same link (http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz).
@dgeelen Have you had a chance to try this out?
I'm wondering if we can consider this issue as closed or not. :smile:
yes this needs a more proper fix
You're right of course :)
I've extended the fix to also work with IN, GLOB, MATCH and REGEXP. The documentation also mentions the EXISTS constraint but I already utterly failed in creating a test table in the first place, getting a "subqueries prohibited in CHECK constraints" error. I might have another go at it later though.
btw. not exists works.
I think it's fine to close this one
Cool. :smile:
Interesting question from Twitter:
```
Opening and closing database with journal mode Wal it deletes the shm and wal files.
How do I keep them?
```
Any ideas?
I think this is a SQLite thing. We have no code regarding these files, it all happens in SQLite. On https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html it says that "the wal-index backing file is deleted when the last database connection disconnects" which is exactly what happens on my system: If I have multiple instances of our application with the same file opened, I can close any of them and the files stay where they are. If I close the last one though, they are deleted.
Thanks for the feedback. Glad I could help :smiley:
.db-wal is a temporary file created by the sqlite3 code/library, you cannot directly open such file.
There should be a corresponding sqlite3 db file.
well, kinda. I don't know the implementation details, but I think this WAL file has checkpoints and uncommitted data.
But for details you should read the sqlite3 documentation:
https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html
Which operating system are you using?
Interesting.  Homebrew is installed, and both qt and sqlite installed from it fine?
Also, can you show the output of `ls -la` in your sqlitebrowser directory?  That'll probably help. :smile:
k.  Looking at that, your "qmake" isn't generating the Makefile (which it should be).
Try running "qmake -d".  That '''should''' spit out a bunch of information to say what it's doing.  Are you able to cut-n-paste that here (in monospace for readability), or email it to me?  (justin@postgresql.org)
Or maybe put it in a GitHub gist if you're more comfortable with that.  eg whatever works :smile:
Lastly, what did you use to install Qt and SQLite3?
Here's the output of qmake -d for me (with a fresh git clone of the sqlitebrowser repo):
https://gist.github.com/justinclift/8b71f6dde186150b616f
It looks like your system is using gcc to compile with, and mine is using clang.
Ummm... would it be feasible for you to install Qt and sqlite3 using Homebrew, as that's known to work?
I can only grope about in the dark as well here as I don't have a macOS system available. However, the interesting information seems to be in line 8 where it says 'MAKEFILE_GENERATOR: :=: (XCODE)'. According to [1] this is a qmake internal variable which defines the tool used for generating the makefiles, in your case Xcode which also explains the missing xcodeproj extension.
On my system it's set to 'UNIX' and you seem to be able to override the qmake configuration file which defines this variable. Provided you have the g++ compiler installed you could try this:
```
qmake -spec macx-g++
make
```
If you use LLVM/Clang try this:
```
qmake -spec macx-llvm
make
```
If you have neither of them installed (and don't want to) manipulating line 7 of your /usr/local/Qt4.8/mkspecs/default/qmake.conf file, changing it from XCODE to UNIX, might work but will probably cause problems later on.

Thanks @metalrecker, that's really good info. :smile:
:smile:
@kytekoz Do you have a few minutes to try out @metalrecker's suggestions?
Just added this workaround info in https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/dea0a653850bbe766ce3c90d8e2900e4be361b44.  Guessing we can close this issue now?
Closing this now, as the new instructions seem to be working for everyone. :smile:
Can you post the create table statement of your table, or a simple version of it were you can reproduce it?
I tried on one of my tables, but rows are saved
Closing this as it's been almost a year now without any response. It this error still occurs everybody's welcome to reopen this issue.
We'll need to add description/info stuff about project files to the wiki, so people know what they do.
Before I do this, I want to check if our project files should be getting added to the "Recent Files" list.
I think they should be (not just database files themselves), but on OSX they're not.  Unsure about other platforms.
No, they weren't added to the Recent Files list - instead the database file mentioned inside them was added. I've changed this to the exact opposite behaviour with commit ff5cf3e63d3ebe0974fc19b84d4cb7afbf174a45. Feels much more reasonable now :)
In 5d20d97e249a42d7dae1061d946c90c9c987d608 I've made some more (minor!) changes, especially when it comes to saving project files.
Awesome. :smile:
So, "auto open last project" would be a preferences setting, that when enabled tells the program to load the last project when it starts up?
I'm having trouble imagining what the "open project from command line" item should do though.  What's your concept for it? :smile:
Moved this to our overall "Wiki pages we should have" Issue.
I'm working on this and fixed the basic issue, but encountered another small issue with the resulting CHECK value
@dgeelen Would you be ok to try out the new nightly build that includes this, and confirm back to us whether it's working or not?  Just in case. :smile:
Well, there are two sides to look at this issue:
On the one hand your SQL probably doesn't do what you want it to do and would quite likely raise an error when given to other database engines. The problem here is the 'no null' (note the missing 't' to make it 'not null') constraint. Apparently SQLite parses this column definition in a way that 'episodenb' is the column name, 'integer no' the data type and 'null' the constraint. Now, as SQLite doesn't care about data types anyway the awkward data type is accepted just fine and the null constraint might be redundant (null values are allowed by default) but valid. By the way, you can check how SQLite actually interprets your table definition by executing
``` sql
PRAGMA table_info(`episode`);
```
``` sql
CREATE TABLE test(a int null, b int null);
```
would result in TEXT columns as well. This is fixed by commit 6e5c98b653bb6ed00807e7e2f95eb5bdfb66b50e which also fixes your table definition. Thank you for pointing this out!! That said, you still might want to fix your table definition :wink: Maybe you can also double check that the fix really does solve the problem as you expected it.
Ahhh, like the divider between the field definitions and the SQL is too far down, and should be higher up to display the whole SQL statement?
@MKleusberg @rp- Is that workable to do automatically?  With GTK (heh) it used to be possible to query the inside dimensions of a widget, then ensure the container for it is large enough.  Not being Qt guy though I don't know the details of how Qt does this stuff (yet).
I added a splitter between the table and create table statement and set better expanding rules.
651e3bf1466cdd6afd9af422e9791fba611252b5
Sounds like a good idea.
the nightly build uses the latest sqlite lib now.
the next release will also get an upgrade of sqlite.
@marfire Would you be able to check the nightly build, and see if that works for you?
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz
That's excellent.  I'll close this bug for now as it seems fixed properly.
The next full release of SQLite Browser is version 3.2 - likely around the end of this month - which will include this fix.
Heh, none of that.  It's because I'm the only person on the team with OSX, and I don't know how to generate a self contained .app yet.  My only experience so far is getting things compiled using Homebrew (shared libs, not self contained).
If you know how to do it, your assistance would be **very** welcome! :smile:
Interesting.  I was expecting we'd need to compile everything statically or something.
If it's just a matter of copying the Qt framework files (and sqlite lib) into the app bundle, it sounds workable without a huge learning curve.
Sweet, I've been meaning to look into this.  That's exactly the right link to clue me in.
Thanks Mauricio. :+1:
Yeah, I tried out your package before.  It works if I have qt4 and sqlite3 shared libs already on my system (eg installed through Homebrew).
Without those already present, it doesn't start.  An OSX dialog comes up complaining about an error with the application.
Which version of OSX are you using, and what happens when you run "brew doctor"?
Does anyone have time to try out this?
That's SQLite Database Browser v3.1, packaged into a .app using the Qt4 "macdeployqt" tool.

It seems ok in quick testing here, but I'd like confirmation from other people before I add this to the "releases" page. :smile:
If not, then I have another idea (build on a core 2 duo processor).  There's one here I can try on, but it's not available atm. (one of my team mates is upgrading ram in it)
Created it on my local desktop, running OSX 10.7.5.
I'm kind of wondering if the problem might be that my Mac Mini has a new processor than yours, so it might have been compiled using cpu specific instructions that won't work on yours.
This bit of your crash report is kind of making me think that:
```
```
We have a box here that has a Core 2 duo in it, so I'll make a new app.dmg using that.  Lets see if that works. :smile:
I compiled the sqlite3 using Homebrew.
Hmmm, we specifically build sqlite3 because we need it compiled using --with-functions.  The system provided one doesn't have that, so doesn't work (I'm told).
I can do a build using the system sqlite3 easily.  Do you want me to make an app.dmg using that, and see if it works for you?
Yeah, compiling fails using the system provided version of sqlite3:
```
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:

DBBrowserDB::open(QString const&) in sqlitedb.o

```
@piacentini  Just on the off chance this works, would you be ok to try this:
(this one was compiled on OSX 10.8, so that might also help too)
Thanks. :smiley: It'll probably either be a) compiling on 10.8 made the difference, or b) cpu architecture thing.
Either way, I'll create a v3.1 archive and add it to the releases page.  And we can make v3.2 on the same box as well when it's ready.
Done.
- Added the .dmg to the Releases page, and SourceForge (ugh)
- Added a button for it to the website
- Tweeted about it
You're using qmake, I suppose? Because we had some difficulties when it came to using extended features with qmake we've made the decision to move to cmake. We try to keep qmake support but only for a quick build; when it comes to a release build or things like make install I'd suggest using cmake. I hope this is an option for you :)
(Disclaimer: I'm assuming here that we have install support when using cmake but never tried it myself, maybe Rene can confirm this...)
I didn't come around to add a useful install target to cmake.
Right now we only have the binary as output file, no docs, no translations(yet) to install.
This will get mandatory as soon as we have more additional runtime files.
Sounds like we should add build instructions for Linux too.
Good point. :smile:
Which distribution/version of Linux are you using?

Are you sure the Makefile was there after cloning the repository? Because as far as I see there is none checked in now. It might have been automatically created by Qt Creator, however, and Qt Creator relies on qmake by default.
You are definitely right though in pointing out that the building instructions are wrong in asking to use qmake rather than cmake - especially after suggesting cmake to be installed. Good job in noticing this :) I've fixed it in the commit mentioned above.
just checked again, there is a install rule for cmake.
It doesn't do much(copy sqlitebrowser to /usr/local/bin, but its there ;)
@Heart1010 Do the instructions in the BUILDING.md file work for you?
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md
In theory, 'make install' should be working now.
Does anyone have a few minutes to test and confirm success/failure? :smile:
Closing this now, as "make install" is generally known to work ok.
If for some reason it doesn't, please feel welcome to re-open this issue or create a new one (either is good). :smile:
There is no way to convert an integer into a date string built into SQLIteBrowser. This is mainly because there is no way for us to tell whether a value is to be converted or not. It's made even worse by SQLite allowing all sorts of data types to be mixed even in the same column (i.e. the same column may contain an integer for one row and e.g. a string for the next row, so these column-depending actions require us to do _a lot_ of data checks).
What you can do though - and what I do for one database I have with epoch dates - is using the native 'datetime()' SQLite function by executing this in the Execute SQL tab of SQLiteBrowser:
``` sql
SELECT *,datetime(date_column, 'unixepoch') AS date_column_string FROM table_name;
```
You could also create a view of this by clicking the button next to the result view and then on "Save as view".
For more details and examples on this you may want to check https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html
I hope this helps you a bit!
There's no User Interface documentation yet. :frowning:
Yeah, we understand this sucks.  We've been putting a lot of time into getting bugs fixed, updating compiling instructions, and working on other non-UI documentation stuff.  We'll get to the UI docs over the next few weeks.
For the Filter buttons, are you meaning the "Filter" fields in the Browse Data tab?
If so, they're a place for tying in basic SQL 'where' clause filter.  For example, putting 'a%' in the filter for a text field will then only show stuff starting with the 'a' character.  '%' is the wild card in SQL.  (things like '%foo%' and '%bar' will work in similar way)
Does that help at all?
I've just written a bit of documentation regarding the filters. I case I didn't cover all questions in there, please let me know. Here's the link: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Using-the-Filters
@MKleusberg Good stuff.  Screenshot/pics + explanation is a very good approach. :+1:
Since nobody complained about missing details in the wiki page I guess it's safe to close this issue.
Interesting.  The old SourceForge page does already point to this website (eg the Web Site link on the front page), but I guess we could make it even more obvious (eg add info to description).
The new website was appearing in Google too until yesterday, but seems to have dropped out of results.  Not sure how to fix that yet.
I have the new page as 2nd result on google and 7th on duckduckgo
Cool, it's showing up similarly for me now on Google too.
After work tonight, I'll change the source on sourceforge.net to point to the new website, and also do something with the description there as well.  That should help make things more obvious.
@Jonrysh I've updated the SourceForge page's description, and replaced the git source with a README.md pointing here.
Do you reckon the GitHub address stands out better now?
You're welcome.  Thanks for pointing out it needed to be clearer. :smile:
Excellent.  I don't have a High DPI display, so haven't been able to test it.
Yep, this is a good idea.
I'd suggest extending this idea into adding an option for saving the entire current session (including path to the DB file, window, table and plot settings and content of the SQL tabs) in a file. The idea is to have a single file containing all the information to continue work wherever it was interrupted.
If there are no objections to this idea I'd start implementing it next weekend or so.
@stevehodgett
this can also be handled within this session file
@stevehodgett I have prepared two commits for you:
5e1169b43db79d2d8fc8659bafb9c67787bc8720 saves the column widths for each table independently. Before this the column widths stayed the same when changing from table 1 to table 2 and vice versa.
62622ae8e8bc916982ca2eae9d3d79364a5f53d9 adds two menu entries (File/{Load,Save} Project) which allow you to (re)store this information along with some other data in a project file. As long as the path to your database doesn't change you can just open the project file instead of the database and have the database opened automatically with the correct column widths set.
I hope this solves your issue :) If you encounter any problems let me know.
Excellent!  Good stuff Martin. :smile:
As a thought, should the project files be added to the "Recent Files" list?
This is a difficult one because of Qt doing much UTF-8 converting automatically. What I could do is showing the full data in the text editor and keeping the dialog away from changing back to the hex editor all the time.
However, once you change a BLOB which contains a non-UTF-8 character it is replaced by the UTF-8 replacement character (EF BF BD) and thus rendered useless... This happens somewhere in QTextEdit or QTextDocument. NULL characters work though :)
Thanks for the hint - commit 41296e3ac0859d560b15a0c51c0a7a3ad2282047 incereases the size of that dialog to fit the entire hex editor widget (at least on my system, that is).
In commit ae4d04f9b1c6149c89ebcd81d9d0aac298cedd8a I've also added a warning which appears when the user attempts to change binary data in text mode.
I think these changes make the dialog a lot more user friendly but I'd still like to keep Qt away from inserting replacement characters. We'll have to see if that's even possible though :unamused: Still, looking forward to your feedback on the new version tomorrow :smile:
Don't worry, I do care about this level of detail and all input is welcome :)
1. This might be because of your font or so. I get at least some sort of representation on my system and if you don't have a similar result on yours we might be able to fix it.
![5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3153504/3206339/69210448-edc4-11e3-8041-28b64b9dcca6.png)
2. Hmm, I can reproduce this. The problem here is that this bug lies somewhere in the Qt code. While it's possible to rewrite that code inside the application I'm not sure if it's worth the effort to be honest. I think the better approach might be to make editing binary data as comfortable as possible without usage of the text editor. If you haven't noticed them you might want to try the Export and Import buttons. And I'll check if it's feasible to extend the hex editor widget to allow input on the right side where the text representation is. I'd also be interested in any other suggestions!
As a side thought, is there a difference in the way Qt4 vs Qt5 do this?  At the moment we can compile against either, but if Qt5 is better then we could potentially move to Qt5 specific?
You are right this should be improved and is kinda already stated in the code:
```
bool SqliteTableModel::isBinary(const QModelIndex& index) const
{
QByteArray val = m_data.at(index.row()).at(index.column());
return val.size() > 1024 || val.contains('\0');     // Cheap BLOB test here...
}
```
We have to improve the isBinary() function
I also noticed that if you change the type to "TEXT" in the EditDialog, as soon as you edit something it will change back to binary mode, which is a pain and unusable.

Looks good to me. Especially for the isBinary function we might need to come up with an even better version since this function is called quite often and left()+contains() probably isn't the fastest way to check this - but it's definitely an improvement this way!
Just commited the patch. The problem should be fixed now - thanks Steve for pointing this out!
Should we make a 3.1.1 with this fix in say a week (and whatever else turns up in the meantime)?
Hmmm, thinking about this more, it's a bit iffy to close this without confirmation from the reporter that the problem is solved.  It probably **is** solved, but just in case... :smile:
@rp- Your nightly build - non-portable version - will have the fix in it won't it?
If that's the case, @stevehodgett would you be able to test it?  Even though it's the non-portable version.  http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz   (but wait until tomorrow, when its freshly regenerated)
yes the build tomorrow should have the fix, if there is no build error.
so before downloading check the file date or build log:
http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
@MKleusberg How did you commit this patch as me? :)
@rp- Here is what I did:
git apply yourpatch.diff
This leads to a commit where committer!=author just like when applying changes from a foreign repository. Hope you didn't mind :grinning:
na it's cool, just thought there is some hidden github button for that :)
Although this one could be a bit of a pain to initially implement, it would be useful to have the UI text strings be internationalised.
This way we can enable translations of the UI to other languages.
Getting the UI translated would rely on something like Ubuntu Launchpad, Transifex, or whatever else is suitable.
We're already "kind of" in Launchpad already, so we may be able to leverage that for translations:
- https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+package/sqlitebrowser
As we are consistently use tr() in our code (at least I think so) it shouldn't be to hard to do translation.
Actually that was one of my next "feature" ideas
As Rene and Mauricio already said, the application is basically ready for translations. I just fixed a minor bug in the code that loads the translation files (see commits 51be349c748e11868ae948b81d659025151a593d and dac1ed1fdbe3cf354416b7ec5f80c9be635c45c8). It now tries to load a translation according to the current locale settings of the user which I think is enough for now (and what the average user is expecting anyway).
The actual translation work is done by using lupdate to create a ts file which is then opened and edited in Qt Linguist. As a last step it needs to be converted to a qm file using qrelease. If this qm file is called something like 'tr_{locale}.qm' and is placed in the translations directory it'll be used automatically. I just started this process for a German translation but probably won't finish it (soon), this really is a lot of work :unamused:
Cool, not one of my crap ideas then. :smiley:
Thanks @VanDerSam, that's awesome.  :smile:
Closing this, as translations are up and running (just need more of them).
Btw @VanDerSam is the Russian translation still completely in sync with all of our text strings?  The project rename might mean some adjustment is needed.  Unsure. :wink:
For Linux/MacOSX and the mentioned see extension this should already be possible if you build the shared sqlite library(with see) yourself and get it loaded before the default system sqlite lib.
For Windows you would need to build sqlitebrowser by yourself as the current builds are fully statically linked.
If you mean a different kind of encrypted sqlite database you would need to further explain.
As a data point, SQLCipher might be useful to investigate:
https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher
... and if there are clear steps that can be scripted, I can probably add nightly builds on OSX including it. :smile:
Awesome! Martin's code for SQLCipher is working (very easily too).  Here is an initial "once off" build for OSX with SQLCipher support enabled:
&nbsp; &nbsp;  http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/onceoffs/sqlitebrowser_201411051855.dmg
That successfully opened a simple test database, allowing me to see the data structures and browse the test data in there.
Everyone that can, please try it out and report back success/failure/etc for this! :grinning:

Apologies for the rough screenshots.  I'm screenshoting them through a remote session to an OSX box, then cutting out the appropriate window pieces using the Gimp.  Not fast, and it's been ages since I used the Gimp. :wink:
New build for OSX available:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/onceoffs/sqlitebrowser-sqlcipher_201411101930.dmg
This one changes the default page size to 1024 (as recommended by the SQLCipher dev's), and also (should) fix a weird inconsistency of (previously) not always opening encrypted files properly.
Please try it out, and let us know how it goes. :)
Btw, this is being discussed and tried out by the SQLCipher devs+users on their upstream Forum here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://discuss.zetetic.net/t/sqlcipher-support-being-added-to-db-browser-for-sqlite/243
Not for Windows yet.  We build the Windows binaries by cross-compiling from a Linux system using [MXE](http://mxe.cc)  SQLCipher doesn't seem to be available in MXE yet, so we're not sure of the right approach to take.
We may need to get SQLCipher into MXE first, and then build our Windows binaries with SQLCipher support using that.
Thanks to @MKleusberg, our SQLCipher on *nix based platforms is up and running. :smile:
Our OSX nightly builds also include a SQLCipher enabled version now.  For example, today's builds:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/nightly/sqlitebrowser-sqlcipher_20141114.dmg
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/nightly/sqlitebrowser_20141114.dmg
Next, we need to figure out the Windows side of things.  Anyone have ideas? :question:
So then, I've tried my luck creating a sqlcipher package for mxe. I'm not really sure how to test this in a not insanely large amount of time because mxe doesn't support my operating system version and installing an older one in a virtual machine and then compiling gcc and all these dependencies in there would take forever.
But if someone is willing to try it (@rp- maybe?), here's the mxe package: https://github.com/MKleusberg/mxe/tree/add-sqlcipher
If it turns out to be working we can open a pull request at mxe and have nightly builds for Windows :)
Hey, that's cool. :grin:
@rp- Do you have time to try out the SQLCipher package?  Also, which version of Arch are you using?  We might be able to get build VM's for that online (eg the Rackspace sponsorship thing), so we can all access it and try stuff out on it.
maybe tomorrow, pretty busy right now.
k, no worries.  Which version of Arch are you running, that MXE is known to work on for cross-compiling for us?  I won't have time to look at it this weekend, but it's a useful data point in case someone does have time in the future. :smile:
Arch has no version, It's a rolling release distribution.
But mxe is not tied to a distribution anyway, it compiles its own cross compiler and so on...
http://mxe.cc/#requirements
Ahhh, I'd forgotten that about Arch.  Installed it in a VM one time, then haven't touched it since.  One day... :wink:
@MKleusberg cherry-picked your sqlcipher.mk but couldn't get it compiled.
I'm using the stable branch of mxe.

So maybe this new version will work. I hope.
We'll get there.  Persistence is awesome. :grinning:
Hmmm, that's a good question.  If it's a normal SQLite database file (not encrypted), it should open the file (as per normal) when it's given on the command line.  If the file is an encrypted one though, I'm unsure what it'll do.  Hopefully it'll attempt opening it, and then pop up a dialog asking for a password.
We should probably add command line switches for giving the page size and password on the command line or something though.
Hmmm, password on the command line might be a security risk.  That could probably let other users on the computer see it.  eg by anyone running (say) 'ps -ef' to get a process list.  We'll probably need to think of a better approach.  Suggestions welcome. :wink:
```
$ ./sqlitebrowser path/to/encrypted.db
```
At the moment it's not possible to specify the password or the page size using a command line argument though; so it'll just show you the standard encryption dialog in this case.
@Z4us Any idea if this happens with the SQLite version too (not just SQLCipher version)?
If it's for both, lets create a brand new bug report for it. :smile:
Wondering if our new build system for windows would let us add SQLCiper support there...? :smile:
Hmmmm, it might be possible to make work, now that we're using a new build system.
Someone would have to go through the effort of figuring out how to compile SQLCipher with our source on Windows though.  Do you happen to have skill with C++/Qt on Windows? :smile:
Ideally, we should get the exact requirements + steps for doing so added to our BUILDING.md file.  It may make sense to do it directly in there, or it may be better to assemble something in the wiki.  No real preference at the moment... though using the wiki would allow for including screenshots.  The level of detail needed is probably something like:
- Install Microsoft Visual C++ (which version? Is the free one ok? Include URL to the direct download page if possible)
- Install SQLCipher (which version?, etc, as above)
- Update the hard coded paths in [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L15-L23) to match your installation:
- QT5_PATH
- SQLITE3_PATH
- OPENSSL_PATH
- VSREDIST
- Instructions on how to compile?  (GUI? Command line?)
We just need a (even rough) initial set of steps that work.  It can be refined & made to look pretty after that. :smile:
I am working on getting a good and accurate set of steps with what version of what I got from where and exactly what I did. Using a VM means I can go back and repeat, I just need more time but it is coming together, slowly and will be on the wiki when I am done
If anyone on 64-bit windows wants to try out an initial version of DB4S with SQLCipher support added in, there's a once-off package built with it here:
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/sqlitebrowser-win64-with_sqlcipher-201605041823.exe
Feedback very much welcome. :smile:
Note - I'm still working on smoothing out the integration bits, so hard coding override values in our files isn't needed for SQLCipher to be found. The actual SQLCipher code in the above package should be good as-is though.
Yeah, sorry the server hosting for it is presently at Linode.  And they really, really suck.  (eg the server flatlined, and didn't get reported)
Rackspace have offered us hosting, I just need to get around to setting it up. :smile:
In the meantime, the 64-bit Windows version with SQLCipher in it is back online.
Yeah, SQLCipher support definitely works for *nix based OS's (eg Ubuntu).
Closing this, as we've definitely figured out SQLCipher support on Windows too, and it'll be in the upcoming release. :smile:
A database is encrypted with a password. You have to know that password when trying to open an encrypted database.
Aah, an .sql file is a series of SQL commands to _recreate_ a database, rather than the _actual_ database.  You can open the .sql file in Notepad, or its equivelant (depending on your operating system).
While its human readable text, it might not make much sense to you... (ie, full of gobbledegook! :wink: )
@ligadata-alison If that's a backup of a Wordpress website, then a text editor should let you see part of the contents, as @chrisjlocke pointed out.
The file itself probably has internal formatting / structure purely for Wordpress to understand though.  So it's very likely not going to be super readable.
All of the text strings from the Wordpress site should be present in it, if you're wanting to just verify the backup worked at all.
If the data itself is super important to you, you should try restoring that data to a blank new Wordpress setup, to verify that works.
It might be time consuming to learn how, but it's the only way to know "for sure" you have everything needed. :smile:
Does that help at all?
> without know the password?
There's no practical way to do this. If there was, there would be no benefit to encrypting it... You can brute force the password with every possible combination, but even with 7 bytes, you're looking at 7.20e16 possible combinations.  Good luck with that.  😆  With using a brute force solution... if you used several rooms filled the very best computer equipment existing right now, it would probably take you several ***centuries*** to get the solution.  For just one encrypted database.  In reality, it would probably a lot longer though.
But, you're welcome to try.  Nothing is stopping you. :smile: > because always door have a backdoor
That is only the case where someone has made a mistake, or where someone (government?) has added a weakness on purpose and hopes no-one else finds out about it.
If the encryption we use, called SQLCipher, has this problem, we don't know about it.  If you do find a backdoor in it, please let us know. :smile: > Or where someone has added a weakness on purpose

If you hack into the DB4S servers and you get an option to play Global Thermonuclear War, look for 'chess' instead...  The above mentioned commit should fix the issue. But if you could double check that would be great.
By the way, you can also use cmake for compilation, that's our preferred way of building the application but feel free to use qmake if you prefer that :)
@sqlcipherdd ping?
Ahhh, that looks more like your system doesn't have the SQLite 3 development bits installed.  Which distribution & version of Linux are you using?
Btw, asking so I can install the same distribution+version into a VM here.  That'll let me try the compile out in a similar environment, so I can figure out why it's acting up for you. :smile:
Just switched to Qt5 for compiling SQLiteBrowser; as I didn't encounter any problems I think it's safe to close this issue.
For future reference: If the sqlite3.h file couldn't be found, the SQLite dev package needs to be installed. For all Debian and Ubuntu Linuxes this should be libsqlite3-dev.
Hi!
I would stick with 'sqlitebrowser', thats how I named my AUR(arch linux) packages and also debian has that package name.
Just got this when trying to compile:

Seems to have been introduced by https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/da9f24836aa6c31cff129b84a581c923d5fc6b6e.
Maybe it's due to my Qt version?  I have 4.8.6 installed.  Can try 5.x if that would be better.
@sarbogast If you need this to compile, then you can roll the cloned repo back a few commits and things should "just work" when you try to compile. eg:
```
$ git reset --hard 75b519df3764618c98ac9dca894f4fd7e70f8a20
HEAD is now at 75b519d plot: no selection for tree plot columns widget
```

Just noticed the old logo is still being used in the OSX Applications menu.
Probably not hard to change, I'll look into it tomorrow.  It could even turn out to be something caching on my system, needing a force refresh. :smile:
Thanks, found it.  It's src/macapp.icns.  I'll generate a new one after getting some sleep in a bit.
Added an initial one, created using the 256x256 png John gave us.  I've also emailed John to see if he still has the source .svg handy.  If he does, I should be able to create a proper multi-resolution icns file that works for people with high-dpi screens.
Fixed in https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/fa1f154e6473b672c271e31d67f588740b8b1f0e.
/n  ### Details for the issue
I tried downloading the nightly windows installer (64 and 32 bit) so that I could get json support that is not currently available in the release version.  When I double click the executable in windows explorer (or choose open from the context menu), nothing happens.  If I run the executable from the command line, the installer runs and the nightly build is correctly installed.   I'm not entirely sure why the executable will not launch.  I do not get any kind of indication that the process started, nor do I see anything in process explorer that indicates that the installer started.

I "unblocked" the app in the properties pane and it's working.  I didn't even think about digital signatures.  Sorry about that.  I so appreciate the help.  I guess windows 10 must not show that dialog that it does on windows 7, or I have some setting that suppresses those things.  On the Browse Data tab.  I have a table with 80 rows.  When I scroll to the bottom it reports "65-0 of 0"
2 pictures are the same table but the top is not scrolled to the end.

Further comment;  the button "Jump 100 rows", I would have it expected to jump only a page, so 16 rows.  If not for the tool tip I would have called it a bug on this 80 row database because it jumped to the end. Hi.

Oh right, I forgot.  At work I'm on the last release.  At home I have a
night release.  I'll take a look later when I get home.  :)  ### Details for the issue
If there is a way to set all selected field to null (in brownse data), I did not find it. I have seen that I could delete all the entry in once, but I'm not shure it's the same as setting these field as NULL. So I did it one by one manually using the buttons "set as null" and "apply", which was quite a job.
It would be intuitive to have a right click option : "set as null"
thanks for your awesome job!
PS: " fill out the correct check boxes": I don't see any checkbox , just raw text.

By the way it would even better to implement a "replace all fields by", so you could set to NULL or whatever.
ps: I'm impressed you already looked at it. Thanks a lot for all you have done (even if you don't implement that!)  ### Details for the issue
I often use a db instead of a spreadsheet, and I would use the possibility to hide columns in order to focus only on certain fields. Views don't seem a solution to this because they cannot edit data.

How would one go about showing back the hidden column, do we want to selectively hide columns and then have a mass show all hidden? Or maybe put them in a list? Mass show works for me, if you want to make it simple.
For hiding, would be good if one could select several columns, and hide all at once.   ### Details for the issue
Not possible in the editor write special chars from char over 128 - 255 or unicode ....

Qt Version 5.4.1
Sqlite 3.8.9
Windows 7 Sorry my fault, after update to 3.9.1 sw worked fine.
Thx.  ### Details for the issue
I have a table with lots and lots of columns and when browsing data it's very difficult to see column names that are on the longer side, so I've been double clicking the spacer between columns, which adjusts the column width to the name.  Is there any way to do this across all columns without having to manually double click each spacer?
If not, is that something you'd consider adding in a future update?
Thanks.

@justinclift Exactly! :)  I don't like the selection model available for tables, it doesn't respect `Ctrl` and `Shift` as one would expect and instead treats everything as a `Shift` selection. @justinclift Sure, when I get the time if someone hasn't done it yet. To clarify, I'm talking about the edit multiple cells feature, the underlying column selection is an issue to itself and would require some non-trivial structural changes.  Changing the page size has no effect when done either in the GUI or in SQL query window. Database is brand new, no tables yet. Have tried with all different journal modes too, no change.

Allow for batch importing multiple CSV files at once using the import CSV dialog
- You can choose to import to separate tables using the filename
- Interactively pick which files you want to import
- Match similar files that share the same columns to import into one table
Fixes #1002
Code could be a lot slimmer, didn't poke around as much as I could, "first timer" so a bit of reuse and ideally we should be able to fetch headers without running through the entire file (so the last commit was more of a poc) but would make for a more streamlined experience. Suggestions and improvements welcome ofc.
> How did you add the files? (Did you associate .csv files with DB4S? If so, is there any limit, by the OS, on how many files to open like this?)
> What if the user add a file using File > Import > CSV? (Can he add more once this dialog is open?)
I added an (experimental until review) feature to *Match similar* files by checking headers (the green highlight in the gif above) so once you have selected a list of files there is no need to manually sort them before to ensure they are in the same format, hence no need to prompt for more files.
@chrisjlocke Anything below WinXP was hardcoded due to memory constraints and dependent on runtimes. IIRC WinXP itself had a limit of `1024 * 2` and I'd like to think modern OSes limits are more denoted by available memory *(don't quote me on that ;)*. @MKleusberg Ah! Thanks, forgot about that and looking forward to it.  ### Details for the issue
Seems like the "Execute SQL" and "Execute current line" buttons are crossed.
I want to run this code
```
SELECT * FROM Transactions
WHERE [Date] Between '2017-05-23 00:00:00:001'
AND '2017-05-23 23:59:59'
```
If I select the first line "_SELECT * FROM Transactions_ " and click the Execute SQL arrow >
`This is the output:  4 rows returned in 0ms from: SELECT * FROM Transactions`
but if I click the Execute Current Line the output is:
```
2 rows returned in 0ms from: SELECT * FROM Transactions
WHERE [Date] Between '2017-05-23 00:00:00:001'
AND '2017-05-23 23:59:59'
```

Hi.
I only discovered and downloaded your app yesterday 23 May 2017. sorry the screen grab image didn't show.
it's///
Version 3.9.1
Qt Version 5.7.1
hours from home.  :) Version 3.9.99
Sqlite 3.18.0
Same problem.
Ok so using only the tool I created a new db with "Table1" with fields
(Integer) Id, (Text) Name, (Integer) Age
I inserted 3 rows:
Insert into Table1 (Id, Name, Age)
Values (1, "Ray", 1),
(2, "Bob", 2),
(3, "Pierce", 3)
Now I query the table:
Select * from Table1
Where Age <= 2
but highlight just the first row *Select * from Table1*
Execute SQL F5
3 rows returned in 0ms from: Select * from Table1
Execute Current Line Shift+F5
2 rows returned in 0ms from: Select * from Table1
Where Age <= 2 It's a good tool.  Keep at it.
I'll add more comments as I play about with it some more.
In Visual Studio 2010 all "bit" rows are returned as "False" even when the
values in them are mixed "False" / "0" etc.  That's why I went looking for
another tool.  It was with the help of your tool that I could see what's
happening.  VS was hiding the problem. Just tried it there.   Highlighting is required.
Anyway I woke up this morning thinking that there should be only 1
button.   If nothing is highlighted then it runs the whole script, but if a
selection is highlighted then only the selection gets run.  This, I would
consider to be expected / normal behaviour.  This is how it works in
SSMS or Rapid for Sybase.
As I was saying, I think it's a very good little app and I think as I'm
just moving to SQLite (for mobile) that I'm going to rely on it for working
against the db since as I mentioned before Visual Studio is doing a botched
job with the bits so not great for a learner.   Also marks against VS it
gives me the usual suspects for field data types; money, double, float,
etc... when SQLite has only 4.

1)  If I put this code in it will fail no matter where I put the cursor.  I
think that it should, this would be expected behaviour
select * from Tags where Id <= 2
select * from Tags where Id >= 3
If I highlight a single line it will run with F5.   Shift+F5 will result in
2)
If I split the lines
select * from Tags
where Id <= 2
select * from Tags
where Id >= 3
Only F5 will work as expected.  So if I select just "select * from Tags"  I
get the full result set.   If I include the 'where' in the string it works
as expected.
Shift + F5 does not work.
My vote is to get rid of the Shift+F5 button.

I think we might be over complicating the problem now at this point.  Might
need to remind ourselves to keep it simple?
Yes I understand that it concatenates the lines.
Is adding the ; is bogus?  Is that how it's done in the other 'big player'
apps? I know I don't consciously use it when I'm scripting outside of C#.
select * from Transactions (*C1)
where Id <= 3; (*C1)
select * from Transactions  (*C2)
where Id >= 4;  (*C2)
Placing the cursor at (*C1) or (*C2)   Press F5 = results from only second
query every time = OK it just ran through.
Shift+F5 = result from whichever query the cursor resides inside of.
When I highlight some text F5 will just run the highlighted text.
I see it now but I think the app is running as You expect it to. Is that
good to the end user coming from the big players SSMS etc?  I'd be looking
to nullify the learning curve as much as possible.
Personally I'm happy to select / highlight the code I want to run.  That's
what I know.
In the case of Embarcadero Rapid if I run multiple queries like above then
I get multiple result sets (in the same grid). No semi colon required.

"*You can't 'assume' that lines beginning with 'select' is a new statement,
as you can have multiple 'select' statements in a select statement.*"  Yes
- very good.  I don't know how the boffins do it.  I've never put my mind
to it.
Hello fellow .Net-er back!
I grew up in VB6 land which ultimately led me to .Net.  I strongly urge
anyone to cross over to C#.  It's not that hard but it does have extra
features and it becomes much slicker to use.  Right now I want to use C# +
Xamarin to create a mobile app across the 3 platforms.  (That can't be done
with VB.NET)   The mobile dev led me to SQLite as a universal data
solution.  I hope I got that right, will it work on win phone, android and
ios?   VS2017 won't develop for Windows Phone 8, only Win10.  So I'm also
developing in VS2015.  I prototype and develop the backend in my free
time at work on an antique VM using XP and VS2010 using WPF + MVVM that I
can take home for porting out to the other apps.   Fekin nuts!  But when
it's done I'll put it up on git then I'll have another little thing to put
on my CV in case Brexit kills off my job - since it's already giving me all
of this free time right now by causing the markets to panic and hold off
spending.

Back on topic.
I would with a reflex CTRL+E to run the script.   I'm sure I got this habit
from SSMS ;)  Open SQL file dialog should default to the same path as the database; instead it opens home folder (tested on Windows). Suit only if you work on a single directory. If you use multiple databases in different places it is still uncomfortable. I would favor an option to open the directory where the active database is.    ### Details for the issue
- An attempt to open the installed DB Browser for SQLite v.3.9.1 in the Windows XP (32 bit) environment returns error "DB Browser for SQLite.exe is not a valid Win32 application"
### Useful extra information
Since the original topic #893 "was locked and limited conversation to collaborators on 27 Feb", but there are still noob users like me and #986 around, that just wish to adopt DB Browser for SQLite 3.9.1 to their beloved Win32 XP machines, hereby I will provide you with easy to understand "entry-level" solutions to this issue.
@h1618
> if you are able to operate a hexeditor, just changing offset 0x40 and 0x44 of the sqlitebrowser.exe executable from 0x0006 (Vista) to 0x0005 (XP) is all that's needed
- Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to perform or calculate location for those manipulations, so this link to the image file with the screenshot of hex-code comparison between unpatched (left) and patched (right) files should give you an idea of what exactly is it there to be changed and where it is located within a hex editor: http://www.hadrurus.com/andiutils/DB4S/SQLite3.9.1HexPatch.jpg
or
> A quick solution is by editing the .exe file using editbin and change the subsystem right after building it.
- I didn't want to seek and install all of Microsoft Visual Studio, so for this method you should go to: http://www.hadrurus.com/andiutils/DB4S/EditBinPack.rar and download:
Then extract all files contained in EditBinPack.rar archive to the folder with the installed DB Browser for SQLite (in Windows XP usually at C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite) on your PC. Now [Start] > [Run] > {_type_} **CMD** > [OK] > {_type_} **CD\\** {Enter} > {_type_} **CD PROGRAM FILES\DB BROWSER FOR SQLITE** {Enter} and finally {_type_}:
> **EDITBIN DBBROW~1.EXE /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.01 /OSVERSION:5.1** {Enter}
After that manipulation is done, check your "DB Browser for SQLite.exe" for runnability, and if all is OK, you're set to use program as usual.
At last, just like me, enjoy latest DB Browser for SQLite v.3.9.1 on your Windows XP!
P.S. I could provide here a link to the patched file itself, and this way it would be even easier to just substitute one file with another, but I am not sure whether I am allowed to do so here.

Hey, @chrisjlocke! You are welcome! I felt very happy too, when both solutions worked. ) OK, I'll try attaching the image with the 1st solution to this comment. Let's see if it works. Once again:
- Original file's hex-code is on the Left | Patched file's hex-code is on the Right.
(btw, if you would have time, please comment here whether it works for nightlies)

`editbin.exe "$(TargetPath)" /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.01 /OSVERSION:5.1`
`link "DB Browser for SQlite.exe" /subsystem:windows, 5.01 /osversion:5.1`
as I've never suggested that. It is totally wrong! Though I must agree that my syntax explanation could be a bit complicated...
So next I'll post a series of screenshots, to make sure that you know exactly what to do (what I was doing), without extra strange symbols in my syntax. I won't even rename "DB Browser for SQLite.exe" for anything else, as I have suggested earlier, so that you see step-by-step exactly how it happens.
- Original installation error notice:
![01 sqliteerror](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28617767/25960476/b8ad2486-367f-11e7-8cc7-6ef2530b1679.jpg)
- Pack of 5 files for EditBin's smooth run, though I don't think that mspdb100.dll is necessary. All of these files have been copied to "DB Browser for SQLite" installation folder:
![02 editbinfiles](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28617767/25960522/ddea45a8-367f-11e7-95d9-2b36474a8247.jpg)
- Step-by-step in CMD until successful patch. Watch attentively, all **MY** lines start with **C:\\**:

- Success story:

Also on my Windows XP SP3 I am able to switch languages inside DB Browser for SQLite v.3.9.1 with ease,  and without any errors on restarts. (

Mm, sorry, I cannot see a single instance of "**editbin.exe**" in your screenshot, I see word "**link**" instead. Well, it doesn't matter. I've supplied the more clear example of EditBin use, without any of that somewhat confusing syntax. Also, I think that one cannot run commands on long filenames in CMD environment, that is why I suggested to use short name at first. Short name for **DB Browser for SQLite.exe** would be **DBBROW~1.EXE**
I'll try latest nightly this weekend (getting pretty short on time by now, soz), I'll let you know if I'll come with the similar result. )))) Installed both on a 32bit Windows XP box. Good news is, both installed without problem, and both had PE's subsystem set to 5.1. Bad news is both raised an error popup immediately after start: "The application terminated as a result of a CTRL+C." This very error I have seen already with other new Qt apps, and I think it is because qt5core.dll has two missing imports, one being CancelIoEx in kernel32.dll - I think this missing import is misinterpreted as having hit Ctrl+C. The Qt libraries all have version 5.8.0.0, and The Qt Company states that the last version that runs on XP is 5.6 - seems they're right. Hey to everyone! With the latest build for tests by @justinclift same here, on Windows XP.

Again tested on my 32bit XP box: installs and works like a charm, no issues found playing around a little bit with my sqlite3 databases - thanks a lot! Dear @justinclift the latest test published by you about two hours ago **works flawlessly**! I want to thank you and everyone in this topic for their contribution to this issue! I've originally started this topic only because the support for Windows XP by DB4S wasn't officially dropped, while the solutions I've read in #893 initially were not exactly clear to me in terms of their application. Sorry, but unfortunately I have almost no knowledge of programming and coding, and I was unable to contribute more to this issue myself. I've updated links in my original post to my website's server, so that people, if that would be of their interest, won't have to go through strange "dodgy" foreign websites, but rather use direct links instead. Thank you all, once again! Here goes the happy screenshot of the latest test:
Aye, @justinclift and it looks like @karim has an eagle eye as indeed with Qt 5.7 both of your Win32 linked files still function perfectly within Windows XP 32-bit native environment. ))))

Personally I am increasingly astounded that people still use XP, many Open Source projects have dropped support for it or provide an old version "as-is". I don't believe we should let XP support stop progress. also confirming that both v5 versions (Qt 5.7) installed and work on my windows xp x86 box without issues. Had medium thorough tests with real world test data, editing/inserting/deleting data, encryption, decryption, and all went smooth and worked as it should. Hello everyone! Since I've started this mess, let me explain my position on the Windows XP. Like many, I've been chasing the progress and had always tried to get most modern things at a time. But later I've got fed up with the fact that everything "latest" is also is the most unreliable. You buy a new latest Supermicro motherboard, and hey, they've just found a problem and made a new revision that as well supports your latest Xeons better... - very disappointing, especially after throwing away a few thousands bucks and instead of receiving the quality expected, you're suddenly losing your time on workarounds, anxiously waiting for a newer BIOS release full of hope that it would solve some of your troubles, and feeling yourself a complete idiot. So I've decided to quit being a corporate tester of their newest devices at my own expense, and now I first wait for others to come up with their comparisons and results, letting time for people to draw up their own conclusions, so that later I'd do a wiser choice based on true user experience rather than on bright, promising ads. How is it related to software? Well, similarly: security updates, software updates, patches, service packs, etc., etc., they've caused so many glitches, halts and screens of death, bringing so much unnecessary headaches and troubles, many of which took whole days to recover. You probably cannot even imagine the other world without the "everyday" updates, which are often a threat to your stable work more than any viruses (in fact in 26 years of my PC experience I've NEVER lost a bit of information because of a virus, but I've lost tones of useful data because of unstable and poorly tested updates). Since Microsoft has dropped updating the Windows XP, it became the perfect machine. All of their updates for my Windows XP are pre-downloaded into separate folder, case there would be a need for reinstall, and my PC is finally set to work for me, as opposed of me constantly servicing my PC instead. Plus, I am also a music production related dude, and much of professional (very long life span) music equipment works perfectly on Window XP, while often there are simply no hardware drivers available for the newer operating systems. Another reason that makes Windows XP still popular are laptops, that are pretty slow with vendor pre-installed software, _but hey, I got an old copy of Windows XP lying around.., that's way better_. Last, but not least. I am Russian, and all of the Russian government is using Windows XP only on their PCs. Why? Because Microsoft has provided the open-source of its Windows XP (including patches) to the Russian government, and Kaspersky Labs have guaranteed that there are no back-doors built in that OS. With today's political agenda, can you be so sure with any other modern OS that NSA is not recording your every step?  Maybe it is not of your concern, but some people do care. Who said that hackers and viruses are the bigger danger than governments, corporations and "updates"? xD
Now seriously, today I am finally very sure, that when I switch my PC on, I won't spend time on updates and recoveries, but would simply do my tasks as was planned. **Am I missing anything? Not yet.** Antivirus and Firewall take care of my security, every software instrument that I need is right here, fine-tuned. Hybrid HDDs make my machine crazy smooth. Would I update to the latest Windows when Windows XP would finally fall? No. I'd go for Windows 7.
Why do I use DB4S? Mm, I regularly edit quite a few SQL .db files from my Android, as Android apps that I need and use mostly lack synchronization availability, or require Cloud services. Thus I edit them on my PC in your DB4S and once edited I synchronize them back to my smartphone, kinda Server/Client scenario.
About the Qt 5.7, Qt 5.8 situation and Windows XP. I suggest, if you wouldn't mind, that you only make **official releases** being compatible with Windows XP, like the case with the 4.9.1 pack that originated this topic. I am pretty sure, that most people that use  Nightlies, probably would be the people of different kind, than those slow-pokes with their Windows XP's. It is very reasonable to dedicate yourself to progress, but also keep an eye on your conservative audience. Well, all this is IMHO, so eventually it is up to you folks to decide on that part, just keep in mind that Windows XP is still 3rd most popular OS.

P.S.1 Personally, I'd set a date in my schedule, let's say 01.10.2017 and check how software market is doing. Till the set date I would stay on Qt 5.7 in everything, or if a higher Qt would **truly** become necessary before, I would simply write "_Windows XP is no longer supported by DB4S since XX.XX.XXXX. Last available release that supports Windows XP is X.X.X you can download it in our archives section._", or something of that kind.
P.S.2 "_Windows XP, too good, too old.., blah, blah_". Instead, please tell me why does Microsoft still feature 32-bit version of their latest Windows 10? )  @justinclift maybe name it 4.9.2? Because I would imagine that some XP users have already received their earlier notification within their DB4S of 4.9.1 update, tried it, it didn't work, and they decided to stay with their DB4S 4.9.0 till next attempt (as I would do if I wouldn't happen to come across #893).
By the way, nice **Operating Systems Market Share** link here: https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx Sounds perfect! Thank you! )) @justinclift everything seems to function flawlessly after a few tests.  ))))

Tested! Perfectly functional! Note: version description retains original 3.9.1 title (just in case).  👍

"download_count": 1050 by now. I am really wondering whether you consider this amount worth the effort input (as I don't possess any other data to compare to)?
> People not sure what they need, and just clicking the first download on the sqlitebrowser.org website
Unlike other links, it clearly states Win XP, so personally I doubt that there would be too many crazy people attempting to install Windows XP version on something else. Well, unless you consider all people that still use Window XP crazy. xD

### Details for the issue
Couple of problems encountered with [the instructions:](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S)
- the `C:\dev\SQLite` folder should apparently be named `C:\dev\SQLite-Win64`
- `vcredist_x64` should apparently be put in `C:\dev\dependencies`, not `C:\git_repos\sqlitebrowser\deps`

Happy to edit the wiki myself ... er ... sometime. Not sure if the above is indicative of other things that have changed but didn't happen to bite me - is that likely? I may have made myself difficulties by installing VS 2013 last, as it's a 5Gb download so I did other installs first while it was downloading, then looped back to do the stuff I couldn't do because it wasn't installed.   Save Error for SQLite Browser
When i press the 'write changes' button, i take error :
Error while saving the database file. This means that not all changes to the database were saved. You need to resolve the following error first.

this is exactly the same problem with #836 but I don't understand what is the solution. Yes, i've updated the system and set up the program repeatedly but still error. By the way, i can create a new database but when I try to add data and press the save button error come then. @justinclift I cannot compile the program myself, unfortunately.
This is the output of terminal while terminally is open. Maybe you can help me after this.

``` After I compiled the program with codes from here:
[https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#ubuntu-linux]( )
Problem solved.
Still, there is an error like that ' Sqlite parse error: ' but I can create a table and add variables.
@justinclift yes the error is exactly.
@MKleusberg i will update the program today, thanks for help :+1:  Hi ! I updated this morning and the error seems to be fixed :)
Thank you for your work :) I tried but still, there is the same error. But I think now this problem is on my own computer. Because I try to delete program first. After I delete the program, still it's been.When try to delete again, I take the error which is SQLite browser not exist on this computer but I can open the program. After I will fix this problem I hope problem work regularly.  Thank you for your help :+1:
Should I close the issue or not? This is my first github experience :smile:  for information the program works well :+1:
Thanks for all your help :smile:    ### Details for the issue

@justinclift  Sorry, I marked the wrong version in the post. I'm using the latest version, 3.9.1, just corrected the same in the post.   Single-line SQL comments cause peculiar behaviour if run in the "Execute SQL" tab.
Say I run the following:
`-- This comment prevents line count working and "changes the database"`
`SELECT * FROM events WHERE logid=81991 AND type='content'`
then
- I don't get the usual "N rows returned" message
- the database is locked and Write/Revert changes are enabled
- the correct result is returned
Alternatively, if I run:
`SELECT * FROM events WHERE logid=81991 AND type='content'`
then
- I get an "Error executing query: ..." response
- no result is returned
Finally (so far), if I try to execute:
`SELECT 40+2 -- get the answer`
`AS answer`
(N.B. `AS` is at the start of the line) then
- I get an "Error executing query: ..." response
- no result is returned
In this case the comment and newline have been removed completely, with the result that what's executed is `SELECT 40+2AS answer` (no whitespace between `2` and `AS`).
I'd suggest the quick approach is to replace single-line comments with a single space, if you don't mind them being discarded from the submitted SQL. If you want to leave them in then you can't discard the newlines, as they're syntactically significant...

@justinclift: OK, I've tried the nightly win64 and it fixes the latter two, but not the first one. I'm slightly wrong now in the report title, as the first problem is also caused by a `/* block comment */` at the start, so it's not specific to the `-- line comment`. I've double-checked that the database is locked until I Revert Changes.
I've also found another case:
`SELECT '-- cause error'`
@justinclift, Surely it is 😢  But I don't know how to solve other more complex cases like `SELECT 'this -- causes error'`. I don't have the ability to re-compile from source, but I've been playing with regexes a bit in Python, and I think
`^((?:(?:[^'-]|-(?!-))*|(?:'[^']*'))*)(--.*)$`
yields two captured groups, the first is the SQL code and the second is the line comment. This relies on NOT concatenating the lines of a multi-line SQL statement (remove the line comments before concatenation, assuming this is being done).
As far as I can tell this is a legal regex in Qt. I tested it against the following:
`SELECT 'string -- not a comment '' - single quote'  -- comment 'not a string' -- not the whole comment`
Note that the regex doesn't match the SQL if there's no comment, e.g.:
`SELECT 'string -- not a comment '' - single quote'  `
@revolter  You can indeed have block comments, see [http://sqlite.org/lang_comment.html](url). I haven't played with removing those but I suspect one could construct similar tricky cases there, too! From what I remember, it doesn't concatenate the lines prior to removing comments.
I hoped for QScintilla to have something to remove comments, knowing it already detects and highlights them, but I didn't find any function that does this.
And, nice regex you have there, could you please explain it a bit? As I only understand them best when I write them. Here you go, @revolter - like any code, regexes are pretty much write-only! I think there are ways to comment them, but I'm too lazy usually...
```
^((?:(?:[^'-]|-(?!-))*|(?:'[^']*'))*)(--.*)$
^                                          $ # anchor beginning and end of string so we use it all
(                                  )(    )  # two separate capture groups for code and comment
--.*   # comment starts with -- and consumes everything afterwards
(?:                 |           )*         # code is none or many strings alternating with non-strings
(?:'[^']*')           # a string is a quote, followed by none or more non-quotes, followed by a quote
(?:[^'-]|-(?!-))*                       # non-string is a sequence of characters which aren't quotes or hyphens,
OR if they are hyphens then they can't be followed immediately by another hyphen
```
Has this been started by any chance? If you can outline any more specifics on how this should be implemented I can tackle it this weekend. Currently in need of this and first time to the project page. I can work with that, we can always iterate on the PR. Thanks. @justinclift Seemed out of place with the actual issue? (didn't read most of the comments) so I removed it. Yup, I have a basic working first draft. I should have it up sometime later, have some other stuff to take care of. Hi guys, real life hit like a sack of bricks so had to afk for a few. Finishing up and will open a PR shortly. Not sure if I will need to write tests as you will see but added some small additional functionality. Will need some help making it conform better to the org style and cleaning up the code, thanks.
If it turns out this went horribly in the wrong direction however ;), hopefully someone can [pick some useful bits from my code](https://github.com/iKlsR/sqlitebrowser/tree/cvs-multi-import) if I can't find the time to edit.
Some minor thoughts on existing behavior
- Some dialogs could probably be skipped at times (Decoding CSV) if the file sizes are below a certain size as the dialog will flash for a second, makes for a somewhat "disjoint" experience at times.
- Tooltips or the dialog help buttons could help document *exactly* what some of the options do.  ### Ubuntu Rendering Issue When There is a Long View or Trigger

I suggest that the user is allowed to scroll 50% of the window height beyond the end of the file. It feels a bit, erm, _odd_ when it doesn't let me.

It's just if you have enough rows to need to scroll, then there should be some empty space to let me scroll beyond the end of the rows.
Here's an example of Notepad++ doing it:

I'm using a Kubuntu 17.04 system where I manually installed sqlite3.18 and manually libsqlite3.18, for example our JDBC driver now loads the installed system lib which is 3.18.
On opening SqliteBrowser 3.9.1 under the about window I get the information the loaded SQliteVersion is 3.15.2
Where is the browser loading the sqlite implementation? The system one, and if yes where is it loading from the system, because it is not the default one, or is the 3.15.2 included in sqlitebrowser? If yes, can you please upgrade version?

I have this same problem, too. I don't know qmake/cmake well enough to know what kind of configuration option to pass in to point it to the correct sqlite3 files.
I have sqlite3 installed and compiled from src: `SQLite version 3.19.0 2017-04-29 19:29:49`
@justinclift That would be really great!! thx a lot! Hi @justinclift,
Have you had a chance to update the docs? The steps provided by @MKleusberg worked great! Now my sqlitebrowser from git master is in sync with my sqlite version.
Thanks!  After updating the row in my database with my own script, and despite my database actually is updated with the correct data, when I view the database in sqlite browser the changes are not reflected. I deleted the original database from everywhere and restarted and I get the same results.
If I uninstall sqlite browser and reinstall, then the changes appear, tried to uninstall again and this time it didnt even work the changes do not appear. -  Version of DB4S is 3.9.1.
- Yes
- Yes
- Yes
1. Pull the database directly from my Android device using ADB.
2. Close DB4S and delete the local database, before reopening to view the new database.
3. Verified in my application on the device that the data is updated.
4. Use an app browser on the device to verify the data is indeed updated.
5. Check in DB4S, no change.
5. Copy the database from the device, and compress to an archive, copy archive to local storage
6. and repeat from the no2 of the this list.
Result is always the same: DB4S is not showing the updated data.
Does it not work like this? Can I not pull the database to local storage and view updates?
Ahh thank you, I did wonder if it was because of wal mode. I think that's
the culprit, will check. Yep it because of WAL mode. When disabling WAL mode everything works great, all updates are reflected just fine when exporting the database from my device. Thanks for the help.
So DB4S does not support WAL mode?  ### Details for the issue

Well... fuck... I am soo dumb!
Thank you, that really helped.  I'm looking at a sqlite database generated from iOS Core Data.  I would like some help trying to format the date columns into a human readable format.  Currently, I just see a 9 digit numeric value.

Thanks for the quick feedback.  It seems that clicking the column header only works in the "Browse Data" tab and not from the "Execute SQL" tab.  After changing the formatting from the Browse Data tab, it doesn't seem to apply to the columns in Execute SQL.
At any rate, I have a couple of options as a workaround.
Thanks!  ### Details for the issue
Sqlitebrowser crashes when viewing an SQL view in the Browse Data tab.
Background: This crash happens when viewing an SQL view in the browser tab.  I can reproduce the crash with a large database but not with a small test DB. To cause the crash, I just open the view, then idle. After a short time (varies), sqlitebrowser will crash.
```
Thread 1 "sqlitebrowser" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

231         inline int size() const { return d->size; }
```
The crash appears to be occurring in `SqliteTableModel::getForeignKeyClause()`
(`sqlitetablemodel.cpp:276`)
**Has `obj` or `obj->name` has been freed then accessed?**.
```

```
```

The program being debugged was signaled while in a function called from GDB.
GDB remains in the frame where the signal was received.
To change this behavior use "set unwindonsignal on".

I've attached the dataset. Try browsing `TRIPS_STOPS_EXT`.
It looks like the code causing the crash is:
```
#2  0x000000000063a0d1 in SqliteTableModel::data (this=0xd23420, index=..., role=3) at /sqlitebrowser/src/sqlitetablemodel.cpp:258
258             sqlb::ForeignKeyClause fk = getForeignKeyClause(index.column()-1);
```
commenting out lines 258-261 seems to resolve the crash at the expense of a missing tooltip.
from:
```
sqlb::ForeignKeyClause fk = getForeignKeyClause(index.column()-1);
if(fk.isSet())
return tr("References %1(%2)\nHold Ctrl+Shift and click to jump there").arg(fk.table()).arg(fk.columns().join(","));
return QString();
```
to
```
// sqlb::ForeignKeyClause fk = getForeignKeyClause(index.column()-1);
// if(fk.isSet())
//     return tr("References %1(%2)\nHold Ctrl+Shift and click to jump there").arg(fk.table()).arg(fk.columns().join(","));
return QString();
```

@justinclift Ubuntu 16.04 and prior version are effected.
Ubuntu 16.04 and 14.04 are LTS version. 16.04 End of Life Cycle is in April 2021 and 14.04 is in April 2019. Which is a concern if we are unable to pack our software for these distros.
Meanwhile i will try to find a work around or fix.   ### Details for the issue
I created a simple db with 5 tables.  I can view and update it locally (through command-line or DB4S), but when I try to place the .db file on my school server, I hit the following:
Error:	local: unable to open C:\RIT\ISTE_646\rogue6_project1\RIT-esports\db\sqlite\sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3180000\ESports.db
Error:	Critical file transfer error
None of the other files in the project are having this problem, and I transferred an earlier version of the same db a few days ago with no apparent issue.  When I deleted the entire project from the server and started over, every other folder and file transferred successfully.

### Details for the issue
Hi,
DB Browser is useful and easy to use. I have one question about the text color.
The default text color in "Browse Data" is black. I always modify the default color to my favorite color, but these changes cannot be fixed. When I restart the application, these colors that I modified before are all set to default color(black).
Thank you very much.

Thanks for your help. This problem is solved.
I downloaded **DB Browser for SQLite_20170330.dmg**, and it works fine.  ### Details for the issue
Similar to #894 The font of the bottom cannot be edited, and I don't have the default font that sqlitebrowser uses, so it shows up as just black squares. The SQL query window above had the same issue, but I was able to change the font of that one to get it to display correctly.

No, I hadn't. Using DB4S version 3.9.99 (2017-03-30-win64) from the nightly builds does fix the font issue, however, it seems like that bottom log is using the same font as the "SQL Log" but a separate size setting whereas the right-side log is using the same font size as the editor.
- "SQL *editor* font" - affects all 3 locations
- "SQL *editor* font size - affects the editor and right-side log
- "SQL *log* font size" - affects just the bottom log
The naming scheme for the options is very unclear as to what they actually edit. There likely needs to be separate options for each location or a change in the naming scheme.  ### Details for the issue
On german UI under "Hilfe" there is a "SQL Ciper FAQ" item, which should be "SQL Cipher" I guess. The same "SQLCiper-Version" text also shows up in the about dialog for the version (3.11.0)
### Useful extra information

Strange enough I dont see the bug in the translation file, the About dialog seems to be translated correctly and the help menu is untranslated. Is there another place for the translations of Windows Portable DB Browser?

Please test it and add to main repo/
https://github.com/keedhost/sqlitebrowser-ukrainian Yes Can you make for me any screenshots with ukrainian version on Mac?  I don't know why but on FreeBSD 11 same problem like on Windows: after choosing ukrainian and restarting app, locale sets to default. Who knows?  I can recheck all the translation, but i haven`t used this program before. So i cant understand some function even in English :( @justinclift I will try to check it all at the weekends.   ### Details for the issue
Kindly pardon this bizarre interruption. My mind is going fast as I age, though I'm relatively young (66) by popular standards. Really, I have trouble focusing. No, this isn't particularly important since I have minimal use for DB SQLite Browser and my current version 3.8.0 does what I need it to do. I was contacted in January saying that my suggestion for Open in read-only mode was adopted and would I kindly test it. Excuse me but I did not do so. But because I kept getting a message touting a newer version available (yes I know I can stifle that message) I did eventually download your DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.9.1-win32 and it installed without a balk but when I went to run the installed program I got the system error message that it wasn't "a valid Win32 application". This surprises and confounds me some unless it maybe relates to WXP no longer being supported. Of course I tried downloading anew (some weeks later) but the result was identical. Sorry to bother you kind guys.

Many thanks for that. Sure, I would ditch this machine in a flash and get a W10 PC (this one, I'm fairly sure, isn't W10 hardware compatible). Another PC of mine runs W10 and I'm disappointed I can't get the game Snood 4.10 to operate right on it. But your advice hasn't fallen on deaf ears so just know that - thanks again. Over and out. Thank you for not forgetting about me, though I was content using v3.8. But YES, I was able to make the cited patch (using an old pgm I had called binedit) and now my v3.9.1 works fine under WXP. I don't immediately see where/how one opens a database read-only, but I trust it is there somewhere/somehow, and don't think for a moment that this is any longer the teensiest bit important to me anymore. Thank you nonetheless!!  ### Details for the issue

Would be great if there was a proper updater instead of the popup that tells me to go and download the latest version when opening the app.
Keep up the good work!
I'm not arguing about the necessity of the pop-up :-)
Just the trip to the site, download and install which can be done as part of the application.
See Notepad++ for example, and many others.
If a user doesn't want to update he should just click cancel.
For me, the necessity to download something and then install it is what sometimes prevents me from updating an application (just sharing my point of view as a user :-))  I agree with HarelM. It is always nice when you can upgrade so seamlessly. :0) And Notepad++ is indeed quite nice example of that. Although it is downloading installer first but it discards it after that I hope.  I just installed version 3.9.1.
My file association was targeting the previous version (3.8.x) which made me understand that it wasn't removed as part of the installation of the latest version...

Once I encrypt the .db file from DB Browser, i am unable to read .db file from uwp application.
Note : I am using "Sqlite.net-plc" for connect SQLite DB to UWP application.  ### Details for the issue
I am using sqlite in multi-threaded environment where multiple applications use sqlite queries to perform get/set operations on attributes available in sqlite db tables. Intermittently i am seeing applications crashing when get operation is performed which intern call sqlite3_prepare_v2.
Crash is not frequent. I rarely see this issue. One thing to notice that, I never hit this issue when i was using 3.8.10.2. First time i hit the issue only after updating 3.15.2.
Following is the GDB back trace for the same. Please let me know if this is a known issue and if its fixed in latest sqlite version.

@justinclift ,
I downloaded SQLite tarball (**sqlite-autoconf-3150200.tar.gz**) from **https://sqlite.org/download.html** and I am using SQLite as library itself. Not using SQLite browser.
Also, i guess if its a linking problem then i should face the problem every time using SQLite APIs. But i am facing this issue once in a while and its quiet random.    Sure. I will drop a mail to SQLite support group. Thanks for the help.  Just want to know if I can go to next table with some shortcut. When I am browsing the tables, I need to click in their name in drop-down menu. Then, to go to next, need to do the same thing.
Why not a simple shortcut or icon to go to next table. This will make my life really easier.  @chrisjlocke I am using the Mac OS X. I tried what you say. Here is ⌘+T. But doing the same thing, when I press down, it just go down one cell. Even if I focus the drop-down menu, the down button don't work.
Maybe this is a specific bug from Mac Os X. Is there a dirt solution to this? @justinclift great idea. How difficult is to make this? I am right now looking a lot of tables and need to do two mouse click to get the next table. I will love have this fix now. 👍
@chrisjlocke the tab don't change the focus. This is not common in osx, but I thing is about the interface technology they used in sqlitebrowser.  @justinclift thanks for answer. I will wait..  @MKleusberg , I tested and it worked really good! In mac you need to use ⌘ + PageDown or ⌘ + PageUp. Thanks, this makes a lot of difference!   ### Details for the issue
<!--
-->
Just upgraded to Win7 from XP. I was working on an SQLite Database for a Unity project using the previous XP compatible sqlite browser. After I install the newest version 3.91 and load my previous database, it asks for a password. I never had a password before, how do I get back into my database?

It's basically for scratch/testing purposes.
I uninstalled and then reinstalled and was able to open it. If there is
the database, it said is was read only. I can't find anything that tells
me where that setting is.  Promote Qt and add sqlitebrowser into https://showroom.qt.io/   This PR, when merged, will compile sqlitebrowser Travis CI upon each git push, and upload an [AppImage](http://appimage.org/) to a temporary download URL on transfer.sh (available for 14 days). The download URL is toward the end of each Travis CI build log of each build.

- Works for most Linux distributions (including Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, elementaryOS, Linux Mint, and others)
- One app = one file = super simple for users: just download one AppImage file, [make it executable](http://discourse.appimage.org/t/how-to-make-an-appimage-executable/80), and run
- No unpacking or installation necessary
- No root needed
- No system libraries changed
- Just one format for all major distributions
- Works out of the box, no installation of runtimes needed
- Optional(!) desktop integration with `appimaged`
- Binary delta updates, e.g., for continuous builds (only download the binary diff) using AppImageUpdate
- Can GPG2-sign your AppImages (inside the file)
[Here is an overview](https://github.com/probonopd/AppImageKit/wiki/AppImages) of projects that are already distributing upstream-provided, official AppImages.
An example AppImage can be downloaded from here:
https://transfer.sh/UiNPi/sqlitebrowser-git.021f836-x86-64.appimage (available for 14 days)  I would suggest to create an AppImage for Linux.
Several Qt application does it by using https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/
Personnaly I prefere compile myself or getting application from the PPA. But for some people appImage would be greate. See http://appimage.org/ Started working on it [here](https://github.com/probonopd/sqlitebrowser/blob/patch-1/.travis.yml). Sent Pull Request https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/969. Instead of storing AppImage builds temporarily for 14 days each on transfer.sh, you could use GitHub Releases to store the binaries permanently. This way, they would be visible on the [Releases](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases) page of your project. This is what I recommend. See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/. If you want to do this for continuous builds, also see https://github.com/probonopd/uploadtool. > We have a server for nightly releases, which could hold those kind of development centred builds.
Excellent. Indeed, https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/ is badly missing Linux builds right now.
By the way, uploadtool deletes the prior continuous build and then uploads the latest one, so that there is always only one "continuous" tag on GitHub Releases.   Fix #965   ### Details for the issue
I cant define pragmas on the run-sql tab. E. g. if I type and execute "pragma auto_vacuum = 1;" and choose the tab "edit pragmas" i cant see my changes.
Its also not working when i modify the options directly on the "edit pragmas" tab, also if i hit the "save" button hundrets of times.
But i found a workaround, if i type and execute this:
end transaction;
pragma auto_vacuum = 1;
and after that I clicked the "compact database" option on the menu strip, then changes were accepted.

Yes I tried "DB Browser for SQLite-2017-02-22-win64", but the problem is still there. The changes will be accepted only, if I hit the "compact database" option. Cant you recreate my problem by yourself? Ok thanks, I thought maybe you already noticed this problem ;)  ### Details for the issue
Open file from console doesn't display the good path in recent menu
### Useful extra information
From console :
sqlitebrowser database.sqlite
From gui , fileMenu : The file cannot be load because it's just the filename and not the full path.

Same issue for the last version. I made you a pull request to fix that.  ### Details for the issue
When running DB Browser for SQLite on my 2016 15-inch Macbook Pro, the WIFI connection becomes very unstable and the ping is moving up and down dramatically. Sometimes it even causes connection dropping. I tested that It happens for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz WIFI. Thanks.

@chrisjlocke @justinclift Thanks for reply. This is the only application I found caused the problem. I haven't  faced this issue on Windows before with any application. It sounds weird but it happens on macOS for me.
I will try the latest nightly build to see if it still happens. Thanks. @chrisjlocke Yes the network improve quickly when DB4S is closed. It seems tab doesn't matter.
Actually I found that I have same issue with another SQLite client. I doubt that maybe my mac has something conflict with sqlite3. That's so weird. I think you may close the issue if you want. I can reopen it if I found the solution later or if someone else has same issue with me. @justinclift @MKleusberg @chrisjlocke  I downloaded from sqlitebrowser.org. And it's a small database. It seems my mac network has conflict with sqlite3 database, not with specific client software. Hope I am the only one facing this, sad. For now I have to stand with it while developing with sqlite. Thanks guys.  When you try to open a database table in "Database Structure" and click right and choose  "Browse Table" in the context menu, it opens the first table instead of the selected one.

Sorry - tested its works :)  ### Details for the issue
When running `sqlitebrowser` built from source, I am seeing a SIGSEGV on application start. The backtrace in `gdb` looks like:
```
#0  0x00007ffff303f72c in _GLOBAL__sub_I_qprinterinfo.cpp () from /lib64/libQtGui.so.4
#1  0x00007ffff7dec1e3 in _dl_init_internal () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
#2  0x00007ffff7dde21a in _dl_start_user () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
#3  0x0000000000000001 in ?? ()
#4  0x00007fffffffdf58 in ?? ()
#5  0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()
```
Given I know that `sqlitebrowser` used to work under RHEL 7.2, I used `git bisect` to find where the problem was introduced:
* `git checkout c0d2e9131ea1bf9eded26f4c3de868d0fbad000a && git clean -f -d x . && cmake . && make -j12 && ./sqlitebrowser` -- fails
* `git checkout c0d2e9131ea1bf9eded26f4c3de868d0fbad000a~1 && git clean -f -d x . && cmake . && make -j12 && ./sqlitebrowser` -- succeeds
So it seems that the offending commit is:
* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/c0d2e9131ea1bf9eded26f4c3de868d0fbad000a

I am working with Arabic Language saved in UNICODE Format in SQLite. I want to implement a search. But there's a problem.
Let's say the text is
```
<html>
<head>
<style>
@font-face {
}
@font-face {
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
</h3>
</body>
</html>
```
And it is stored in SQLite Database. Now I want to search `html`, it will return the result and if I search  `وامر` it won't return a result because in actual text, it is `وَاْمُرْ` (with these extra UNICODE).
What I found so far;
1. Make extra column and put stripped text into it and then search (I can't do it because there are thousands of books and they will take a lot of memory)
2. UDF Like SQL (I couldn't find any suitable example/tutorial to implement it)
4. SQL query using LIKE and GLOB operators and wildcard characters.
I'm stuck for two days and couldn't find a working solution. Option#4 is desirable but any working solution will do the charm.
Meanwhile, I've to keep application memory efficient and optimized searching.
Any help is highly appreciated.
What I've done so far
1. I've made regex to ignore html tags and text between style tag and used it in query with REGEXP.
- I want to ignore these extra characters too. I know their UNICODEs, just need to know how to append it in the regex. This is my regex;
`(?![^<]*>)(?!<style[^>]*?>)(TEXT)(?![^<]*?<\/style>)`
- I've used it in query like
`SELECT text FROM dummy WHERE text REGEXP <myregex>`
It's not giving an error but not returning the desired result too.
2. I've compiled `sqlite3` library in my project. I am now looking for anyone to help me with writing a function for my regex, attach it to database and call it from query.
Thank you for guiding me. I will definitely do so.  ### Details for the issue
I have 2 Databases as *.db file that I want to merge.
On the first Database I use the export function (as SQL file instead of CSV) and export all tables I want, with NO "INSERT INTO" and NO "Multiple VALUES" seleced.
In the dropdown I chose "only data export" and export it.
In the 2nd Database I try to import as SQL file and it runs without any messages/hints/problems.
After the process is completed, there is only a small part in the new Database.
For example there is one column with an ID that has 2943 entrys.
After the import is "done" it has 507 entrys.
So somehow there are a lot of entrys lost during the export/import process.
I hope you guys can give me hints what I can try to get this working or if there are any knows issues and ways around it.

![error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6054234/22694338/2395c35c-ed47-11e6-9d42-01dfd1703092.PNG)
hey @justinclift ,
I didnt mention of exporting the 2nd database because I didnt export this.
Maybe my way is wrong but I thought I could go like this:
1. Export the first database (as SQL file)
2. Imtort the first database (as SQL file) into the 2nd database
3. Save as new database.
4. Merging completed :)
I have no idea what to change on the export process to work properly.
If I export the first database with  "INSERT INTO" or "Multiple VALUES" seleced or choosing "Export everything" on the dropdown, the import on the 2nd database doesnt work at all because the table is already existing.
So there is no other option then just choose "Export data only" on the dropdown and try to import it like this.
I hope you guys can give me hints how to merge these two databases because I am somehow lost now. Hello, @Phil1988. Could you send me all necessary files (*.db and/or *.sql) to reproduce this issue? The problem is that I dont have any other databases/files to reproduce this issue and the databases I am trying to merge are Whatsapp databases with a lot of private data that I dont want to share.
Is there anything else I can do, to help you helping me? :D @Phil1988, could you send to me only schema of your tables, without data. I deleted every record of the databases so every data should be gone (hopefully :D ).
Here are the 2 databases, I hope you can find the problem here.
I renamed them to *.png because uploading *.db files are not allowed and *. zip file didnt work...
Just download these files and rename them to *.db (I tested it and its working).
I believe that the problems associated with the table messages_fts (CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE messages_fts USING FTS3()), which requires support of Full Text Search 3 extension. It is an assumption.
@Phil1988 remove your files by editing last message (databases still contains some of private data (use File->Compact Database next time)). Just use email next time. @Phil1988, Is data lost in any of these tables:
messages_fts
messages_fts_segments
messages_fts_segdir
messages_fts_content
?
If yes. My guess, this is because you can't merge FTS 'Shadow Tables' without understanding how full-text search is implemented.
If no. Could you please research which tables is losing data. Maybe its simple PK constraint? PK must be UNIQUE in merged table. I dont know if one of there tables has some lost data because only the "chat_list" and "messages" tables are  important for that merging and I only tried to export and import these. @justinclift, still not enough data to understand what is going on in a particular case, but it seems to me that the problem is that at the time of import, while inserting rows with existing PK's doesn't output any error messages.
For example, lets create a table and add the 3 rows:
CREATE TABLE `table` (`pk` INTEGER, `text` TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(`pk`));
INSERT INTO `table` (`pk`, `text`) VALUES (1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c');
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO `table` (`pk`, `text`) VALUES (1, 'X'), (2, 'Y'), (3, 'Z');
COMMIT;
The import process will take place without any error messages, although it should be an error:
UNIQUE constraint failed: table.pk: INSERT INTO `table` (`pk`, `text`) VALUES (1, 'X'), (2, 'Y'), (3, 'Z');
@Phil1988, is `messages` table contains rows with the same PK as in imported data? What is "PK" ? Primary Key?
The exported and the imported database have both the "_id" row as "INTERGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT".  Since I am using sqlitebrowser to help me develop iOS applications in Xcode using Core Data, the pathnames to the sqlite files are demoralisingly long and hard to remember. I can easily print the full pathname in the console and then copy it into the paste buffer. I would like sqlitebrowser to have a place for me to copy and paste that path and open the database directly.
At present the only way to select the path is to navigate through the finder-like dialog, which is painstaking and error-prone. Thanks for the suggestion. I'm on a Mac. The trouble is that in the app I
simulator has a different path. I'm on a Mac, and there is unfortunately no such text box. @Logistes On Mac, in the Open Database dialog, hit <kbd>cmd</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>g</kbd>, and paste the full path to your SQLite database file (you might need to use a right-click in the textbox to be able to paste in there for some reason). @gboudreau Thanks Guillaume. I have finally got back to this problem, found your reply, and it was perfect.
It is hard to remember, but it is the open dialog homolog for the Finder | Go | "Go to folder ..." action, which has its key stroke combination shown in the menu item. So I can recall it from that.  I maybe confused here .. I have an sql file with multiple CREATE TABLEs
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE ....
CREATE TABLE ....
CREATE TABLE ....
COMMIT;
One of the CREATE TABLE statements has an error.
When I execute the sql (using Import) I get the error, however the other tables have been created.
Why?
I would expect the entire transaction to be rolled back. Unfortunately it has made things worse. Now I get a rollback without an error. See the attached.
I think there is still an implied transaction. My sql file has a BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT in it, so a rollback on error is to be expected. However when I remove the transaction I still get the rollback  error which should not happen. If I run the previous build it seems to load the sql just fine (I fixed the errors). But in general this and https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/955 still exist.

OK, will check again tomorrow – thanks.
Should I raise another issue, that Import should output to the log I think. This error still exists and is not fixed (sorry to say)
Please see the attached, the error should be that a CHECK constraint has failed.
[Test.sql.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/748068/Test.sql.txt)
In addition when I remove the BEGIN/COMMIT Transaction statements in the sql, the load is still rolled back. This should not happen. The Load process should follow what is in the sql.
I created a table and insert a row with the following
CREATE TABLE `characterSets` (
`name`	TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
`characters`	TEXT NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(`name`)
);
INSERT INTO `characterSets` (name,characters) VALUES ('Line Separators', char(10, 11, 12, 13, 133, 8232, 8233));
When I browse the row it shows like the attached png. This is not correct.
![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6769116/22477349/984215a8-e7dd-11e6-8501-296a55bc35b2.PNG)

what shows browser down on the right lower corner? UTF...? I thought that was a good question - it was UTF8 now it it UTF16le and the result is the same.
I have the following sql script which when I load it, it successfully commits.
There should be an error. The first INSERT INTO fails with a check constraint and the record is ignored.
Expected result is for the transaction to fail.
BEGIN TRANSCTION;
CREATE TABLE `types` (
`uuid`	TEXT DEFAULT (lower(hex(randomblob(4))||'-'||hex(randomblob(2))||'-'||hex(randomblob(2))||'-'||hex(randomblob(2))||'-'||hex(randomblob(6)))) CHECK(uuid regexp '^[a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{12}$'),
`description`	TEXT NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(`uuid`)
);
INSERT INTO `types` (uuid,description) VALUES ('6d15a5615-0000-43ff-b4f2-762b0dbfb4e6', 'Substitution');
INSERT INTO `types` (uuid,description) VALUES ('615a5615-0001-43ff-b4f2-762b0dbfb4e6', 'URL');
INSERT INTO `types` (uuid,description) VALUES ('615a5615-0002-43ff-b4f2-762b0dbfb4e6', 'Date');
COMMIT;
CREATE TABLE `test2` (
`id`	TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (randomblob(6)),
PRIMARY KEY(`id`)
);
Browse data and the click new record, default has wrong value.
The issue seems to be that the default value is ignored when it's part of the primary key. Its on Windows with the latest nightly build .99 If the user (me) is intelligent enough to create a default value that is random (and possibly a constraint) then do you need to check for it causing duplicates?
If you do, instead of trying to parse it and check if it is random can you do an if exists first?   ### Details for the issue
I created a tiny DB with this application on OSX Sierra.  I installed the app into my appcelerator titanium app and it worked in the iOS sim.  However on the Android emulator and on the android device it does not seem to get recognized - no instal error is reported but the table is missing.  Is the file produced by this application incompatible with android?

Not sure, but I tried adding the db file in many different places with no luck.     Some people say to put it in the assets folder, some in the Resources folder, some say the lib folder, other in the same folder as my js-script.  If I was just writing for Android I would include the sql to create the  db but the appcelerator best practise is to include the database if it is small so I'm trying that.    I was able to run a create table statement on the database after opening it so a database is getting created but not the one I am trying to install.     In appcelerator the Ti.Database.install(dbfilename) method will create an empty database if it fails to install the one given as dbfilename.  So if the file format is somehow not compatible or if the file is not found it will create the empty db.
i want save text in right side! but when i click Apply ,text save in left side!
i can not save it right side!
please see video,how can i  save in right side!?help me please
https://youtu.be/LmHSJrNqi6c @justinclift   same problem in  nightly build!  i can not save in right side! The problem is actually that sqlitebrowser doesn't set the direction for that textbox to LTR automaticly. It should do that as all other widgets. I'll check. I think it's because of the text formatting (It's a richtext widget).
And for the bug, it is not. This is the right and correct behaviour. You can't save in "Right side", because you started the text with a LTR direction letter.
It doesn't matter really for the database, but visually, it matters.
You can force the text direction to be RTL when viewing the page (seems to be a webpage). @awi1369 Can you please write the information of your system locale? I tested it in Windows 10 with both English and Arabic locales, and the text in the edit box was aligned to left (And it's direction is LTR).
Appeared as:
<div dir="ltr">
H5:
</div>
and not (as you have):
<div dir="rtl">
H5:
</div>  #945  ### Details for the issue
Export cvs files don't use utf-8 as character settings so my Swedish letters are being translated to something else.

This is a duplicate of #781 as far as I can tell Hm. Maybe I’ll fork the project then. Is the issue still related to SQLCipher? Yes line 41 is exactly where it is (and line 80 for x64).
All you should need to do is define the preprocessor flag SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5.
I’m a little unclear as to why FTS4 is even working in your current build since you don’t define those preprocessor flags anywhere, and FTS3 and FTS4 are not enabled by default either. But wherever you’re compiling SQLite, as long as you make sure SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5 (and …_FTS3 and …_FTS4) are defined, that should be all you need to do. Agreed. Although again I’m not sure why FTS is working at all in DB Browser without those flags – and it does work - so I’m curious if this makes a difference. It should though. In the version that has SQLCipher, are you using SQLCipher’s implementation of SQLite even for non-encrypted databases? That would explain why FTS works in the official Windows build. And if so we would need to use the non-SQLCipher version. Both copies can work for me.
I was able to create, rebuild, search and delete the fts5 table(s).
This is great! Thanks. Also confirmed, it’s working great. Thanks so much for getting this done so quickly. And for the great piece of software; it’s a huge time saver for me in optimizing queries for my application. Oh great. Sure would be happy to.
(Incidentally I wish I knew SQLCipher existed two years ago because I would up making a custom SQLite VFS for encrypted databases in Windows. Works great but man was that painful…). Sorry for the lag. Yeah FTS5 is working perfectly! I haven’t tried out more advanced features like ranking or highlighting but I have no reason to doubt they’ll work (or if they don’t it’s an SQLite problem and nothing to do with your code).
Thanks again, seriously.  #941  ### Details for the issue

I'm attempting to open an sqlite database (called "Recordings.db") associated with Voice Memos copied from an iPhone.
When attempting to open this file from a VirtualBox Shared Folder db4s fails with "invalid file format"

Are you able to recreate this issue? (if you still have your Mate VM from the last issue I filed) :) Fair enough.  Like I said, it's probably a bug in VirtualBox but figured
you might have some good insight into it  Support of operator 'BETWEEN'. For example for column with filter '400~500' will be generated WHERE statement 'BETWEEN 400 AND 500'.
```
500~400
a~b
1~a
```
#935 @justinclift, not sure why its so much commits in PR. How to remove merge commits? @justinclift I thought to do so, but it didnt happened. How am I going to create a second PR?

Query tabs can be closed without any prompt to save or warning about lost data.
In other database management GUI, when the user clicks to close out a query they are presented with a prompt like "You have unsaved changes.  Do you want to save before closing?" to prevent lost work.  DB Browser should add this for unsaved query tabs.

Could you add the following badge ? Just to promote Qt !
![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Qt-qmake-green.svg)  I was coding with lua got this error
chunk_2:(11,29-12,12): attempt to call a nil value
Pls help  If I have an INTEGER column I can filter the numbers in it using the supported operators from this page https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Using-the-Filters.
Is it possible to have a filter for **range** (- or \~)? Something like _min-max_ (or _min~max_) to show only the numbers in this range. For example, If I want to filter a column with numbers between 1 and 5 I can type in filter something like **1-5** (or **1~5**). It is like combining _Equal to or greater_ and _Equal to or less_ together.
Also, maybe we can have an **and** (,) operator? To show only specific numbers we can type something like **1,2,5**.

- [x] DB4S needs a feature
@MKleusberg Thanks. Yes I will try it and report back. @MKleusberg I tested it and it is working very nice. Thanks!
@schdub Thanks a lot for this! 😄  Maybe DB4S should provide a hint when the `~` (range) operator is being used on a column that is not an `INTEGER`. A tooltip, modeless dialog, or changing the background color of the column's filter?
This should work also with `>` (greater than) and `<` (less than) operators, since they are only used with numbers.  ### Details for the issue
Hi!
Im using sqlitebrowser from the Debian testing repository on my machine running Gnome Shell (3.22.2).
When I have sqlitebrowser opened, it seems like it is constantly requesting focus. I cannot switch workspaces, since it constantly switches back to the sqlitebrowser window.
Also I cannot minimize it, since it instantly gets de-minimized again.

From #948
The problem starts in one of the following commits
1ced89779353346548d2e71d8eb58dc4d278f1ca
b9e4433318efb869af494dd2c7631e0787248143
aa965ff7256bbf0dcb279ad90697c3ed9f56c203
1ced897 and aa965ff fail to compile in my machine, so I couldn't bisect the exact bad commit. Bug appears only when `View→Edit Database Cell`  is enabled. It's only `Edit Database Cell`. Tried all permutations and `Plot` doesn't trigger the issue. I can confirm this bug on GNOME 3.22 on Fedora 25.  Looking at the above comments, I'm just running SQLIteBrowser as it comes installed by default - I haven't disabled or enabled the Views as mentioned two comments above.  If there is anything you want me to try to confirm, please let me know.  ### Details for the issue
I download an sql file from a site backup on WP Engine. Multiple agents ensure me the file is NOT encrypted. One specific response he had when asked was:
> Positive because when I cat the file out its not encrypted at all.
> It’s just plaintext SQL
I download the file and try to open it and it prompts me for the password.

I click "ok" and it reloads that same prompt.
I click "cancel" and it tells me the file is invalid:

Thanks guys. I thought it was a valid file, but it was indeed just a dump, plaintext. It would be nice if the program could give a better response to this though. I'm willing to bet many others have done exactly what I did. Perhaps you can somehow tell that it is a DB dump and tell the user something like:

Hi. Sometimes *.sql files has no instructions for using transaction and importing from them is very slow. Checkbox for forcing transaction import will be very useful in this situations. Sorry if this issue already exists)

Since I don't know if that bug could also be related to the fact I wasn't using the right version of DB4S when I exported my settings files, here is a summary of the different files I provided.
- [sqlitebrowser.plist.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/701448/sqlitebrowser.plist.zip) are settings files generated using 3.9.1 version that is known to have issues on macOS Sierra (#737).
- [sqlitebrowser-settings-v3_9_1v2.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/701764/sqlitebrowser-settings-v3_9_1v2.zip) is my current settings file using latest version (3.9.1v2) that is working well regarding preferences.
Hope it helps clarifying the situation.

Trying to view and modify an existing database. The viewing and modifying work fine with SQLite Database Browser 2.0 b1 (which I believe is an "ancestor" of DB Browser for SQLite), but with DB Browser for SQLite, things do not work as expected.
The database opens, but using "Browse Data", if certain tables are selected (but not all), the list of fields of that table is not anything like what is shown with DB Browser for SQLite. Selecting some tables produces the expected result, but then if certain other tables are selected, the field descriptions from the previous table are retained instead of being updated to the new table.

Lets see if this fixes the missing translations. :smile:  @justinclift Awesome! Seems that all the previously missing translations are now right. :+1:
So is safe to update the .ts for all the other languages. :smile:   ### Details for the issue

Hi I'm trying to compile the project on my Mac but getting this error. I've followed the steps in the BUILDING.md file for **MacOS X > Building an .app bundle**
I got up to the **qmake** action, but the next step **make** fails with the following. I've attemped the two **qmake** commands in the latter part of the secion:

That solved it. Also the nightly build worked. Thanks!  Corrects some typos and tildes since the latest update. :smile: @justinclift We could try and see how it works out in the next nightly build. @justinclift I see that now among the 55 strings tagged "unfinished" are those that previously were missing in the .ts.
Should I translate them now? So that we can check before changing them for all the languages, if in the next nightly build also the other strings already translated but not showing in the GUI like "Edit Database Cell" and "DB Schema" are also fixed. @justinclift Done, and [PR ready](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/928). Hope that it works and the new generated files finally fix the missing translations for all the languages. :smile:  ### Details for the issue
On preferences/data browser,
text and background color for field are all black.
I do modification but at next start this issue come back.
Thanks

Some data points:
1) Yes, this is under VirtualBox ( Version 5.1.12 r112440 (Qt5.5.1) )
2) The screen does start out that way, at least for that particular database.  When I load others (which are also included in that link I added.  See "/data/databases/" ) they look fine. Is the problem database
too big, or the schema too long or something along those lines?
3) With the problem database, it is just that one column "schema" in the one pane "Database Structure" which is messed up.  The "DB Schema" panel on the right side, which looks like exactly the same data to me, is not corrupted in the same way. See attached screenshot
4) This is all using the current version as of tonight from the PPA. Here's the "about" info:
Version 3.9.99
Qt Version 5.6.1
SQLite Version 3.14.1 Try this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/fk1uup3zx7sb8r0/data.tar.xz?dl=0
I'm certainly willing to do some work on it.  I do have the guest additions installed and I'll try adjusting a few settings related to graphics.
I can also work on compiling from source if you think there's a difference between it and what is in the PPA.
FWIW, this is the only application I see corruption in and it's only in that one pane (and the one database, of the few I've tried sqlitebrowser with, though of course that may be a red herring) No problem, thanks for all of the help so far.
I've done the following and I'm still seeing the same issue
1. Clone repository from github
This produced some messages and failed, which lead me to  issue #635 and then to installing some qt5 related stuff
3. sudo apt install qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools
This produced some messages but seemed to complete (see attached)
5. make
This succeeded (see attached) and produced an executable
6.  execute ./sqlitebrowser
7. sudo make install && sqlitebrowser
Another note: I tried rearranging the columns so "type" comes after "schema" and it is just the "schema" column that is corrupted
What is it about those tables?  The length of the schema? Let me clarify that: if I delete the two tables from within the application the corruption disappears instantly I just tried in a freshly created Standard Ubuntu 16.10 x64 desktop VM and
Versions for this VM:
Db4s: 3.7.0
Qt: 5.5.1
Sqlite: 3.9.2
Deleting the apt_apt and apt_rwy tables within the application immediately
clears up the corruption Yep, it did help.  On the same stock Ubuntu that had issues I followed these steps along with the install of qt 5.7.0 and I no longer see the corruption.  That's fine with me.  Did you want to look deeper into what interaction is triggering this issue since this is an experience users may receive until the distributions update their qt libraries?  Or did I manage to stumble across some unique screwball corner case that isn't worth bothering with? Sure, it's from a project on github (jlmcgraw/processFaaData) Hey, no air quotes around 'real data'!

### Details for the issue
If I changepassword via vb.net and open it in code, works fine.
I tried the nightly build (3rd Jan 2017 version) and now it says "invalid file format" and does not ask for a password or pagesize value.
If I then changepassword(string.empty) - i can then open up the unprotected sqlite db in sqlitebrowser without an issue. Just cannot open a password protect version.

So, I am using 3.9.99 nightly build ( which says invalid file form) because the 3.9.1 would just crash (closing down the app).
The help about menu in sqlite browser is saying:
Version 3.9.99
Qt version 5.7.0
SQLite version 3.15.0
I am not using any encryption on the database at all - just using the standard password protection built into sqlite, in the case of vb.net, i am issuing a changepassword command to perform this.
attached zip file has two databases, one is an empty (no tables) database and the other has a password of "a password" set against it.  I can confirm that if I open it up with sqlite browser it comes back with "invalid file format" and if i reset the password to string.empty, it removes password protection and the database is fine, so I know the database is not getting corrupt.
Thanks! A Quick question about licensing with SQLCipher - am I able to use its encryption abilities in my application as I want to release it as a commercial product (shareware) and would really like to have the data encrypted - Im not too good at reading licenses, its like reading a contract and it completes loses me :S
[dbs.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/682145/dbs.zip)
You can password protect SQLite3 DB. For the first time before doing any operations, set password as follows.
SQLiteConnection conn = new SQLiteConnection("Data Source=MyDatabase.sqlite;Version=3;");
conn.SetPassword("password");
conn.open();
then next time you can access it like
conn = new SQLiteConnection("Data Source=MyDatabase.sqlite;Version=3;Password=password;");
conn.Open();
**This wont allow any GUI editor to view your data. Some editors can decrypt the DB if you provide the password. The algorithm used is RSA.**
Later if you wish to change the password, use
conn.ChangePassword("new_password");
To reset or remove password, use
conn.ChangePassword(String.Empty);
I guess I will probably have to either
(1) use unprotected DB until I do a release (as it works fine through VS2015)
or
(2) wait for a possible update as this will affect all .NET users who use sqlite browser.
I'll stick with number 1 and occasionally check it with (2) on builds in case its something that is in the pipework (or has been broken). Im assuming at one point it did work, Sqlite is a great desktop database (much better than access mdb's).
Thanks for your help anyway - at least i have learned something more about Sqlite today :)
I use VS Community Edition 2015.
The .net SQLite component is the general one (I assume), downloaded via github, using the NuGet package manager for solution, I type in SQLite and the search term, System.Data.SQLite by SQLite Development Team 1.12M downloads "The Official SQLite database engine for both x86 and x64 along with the ADO.NET providers" is in the description.
From what I have discovered, is the switching on a password protected database, encrypts it with RSA as per this link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5669905/sqlite-with-encryption-password-protection  ### Useful extra information
Similarly to #505, it looks like Sqlite has an issue when opening a database with VIRTUAL tables:
```
```
This seems to have no effect though except of this in logs. This is a [Geary](https://github.com/GNOME/geary) mail-client database, if needed.

To the people that has coded this: is this a conscious design decision, or simply a missed detail? I can do a bit of testing to see if I can update the grammar with the full language description in the next few days (have a little bit of time available). Thank you.
I agree that the grammar thing seems the least difficult, had something in place (probably not as good as your solution).
Modules for creating virtual tables seems to each have their own grammar: the fts5 module as example has quite a few extras. So in order to be simple to use, the db Browser should know the standard modules grammars. Additionally, perhaps, the support tables created by a module could be treated somewhat differently from “normal” tables.
Everytime I try to launch something that uses/shows something about my graphics card, it crashes.

Fault Module Name: atiumd64.dll. Exception Code: c000001d. Exception Offset: 000000000013db71.
- My computer is screwed
- My graphics card is broken
- Atiumd64.dll is failing
Reply with your answer. Not exactly. The fault module name is different and so as the Exception offset. And it also crashes most java programs including Minecraft, Java Settings, etc. Sorry I was replying to the earlier comment. Anyways the thing is my graphics card settings is even crashing. I upgraded my graphics card drivers and now I guess it's failing at something. I got steam on there fine. I tried running a game and it loaded perfectly. The problem is java and graphics card things are crashing. Steam is running fine. I tried running 3D and 2d steam games. Whatever my graphics card is doing, it's something nobody has heard about because I've been searching everywhere and nothing was related to my problem.
My graphics card is a Radeon RX 480 GamingX. I have an AMD processor. My AMD processor is a 6-core. Yes it's an msi. My computer is a custom built gaming pc. Windows works like a charm. Yes, I went to msi.com and downloaded the same graphics card drivers I had. (Updated drivers for the same card I have) Now I can't run java or some programs. so what's with the atiumd64.dll? Thanks, I'll try that, if it works I'll let you know. But there's one thing I gotta say: there are 3 atiumd64 on my pc. Ummm My computer was on a black screen for a second. It's not now Never mind it works No I'm talking about the black screen Ugh these drivers take forever to download x.x Imma just go screw around in mcpe  It's stuck at 66%
It's not stuck anymore It couldn't install Who are you Anyways it's not fixed Imma ingnore innermous if he's not gonna help.  For linux there is no drop down menu? A bit confused, this means I can't import csv files to the database. Am I missing something? ![dbbrowser](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17105146/21472528/3f4248f8-caad-11e6-929a-c5bb0ac75c73.png)

I didn't really see any change Ohhh okay, I see what's going on. For some reason, I have to drag my clicker over the top bar (with the power button, etc) to see the drop down options.
Thank you! @JonathanJohann  Check this link http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/ubuntu-desktop-moving-application-menus-back-into-application-windows/. May be this will help.  @justinclift, I'm interested. But it took about ~ 1.5 years since my last implementation, it is necessary to adapt the source code for the current version of DB4S. I can implement this task.

I often open een WebSQL database from Chrome to test out a framework or app, which means that it often changes the structure of the database.
But the only way to see those changes is to close the database and to re-open it. It would be great if there was a menu option to reload the complete database. Yes that seems to do the trick, exactly what I needed!  Would be really cool to have profiler feature.
There is no SQLite profiler out there, so would be a first.
I think SQLite has profiling built-in, like you said, but it's text-based and not easy to use. No SQLite tool right now has proper GUI profiling.
I don't know if SQLite would support that though, because a profiler, when listening, will automatically list queries sent to the db. You don't need to interact with it, just keep the window open and see what is happening.
Can SQLite do such a thing, that is listen for events? @MKleusberg I see what you mean. I guess it's not possible. What a pity!
Not being able to see what commands are sent to the database, makes development and debugging a real pain. @justinclift Unless I'm using it wrongly, I don't think that the log tab does it. What I do:
- load sqlitebrowser, open my SQLite database file
- run my app, perform some operation which hits that database
- observe the log tab
...and nothing is logged there. Not under "Application" or "User".  Does the SQLiteBrowser support [a-z] and _  wildcards? I have been unsuccessful in getting any results from the following queries, despite the face that my table (Keywords) has the word 'hello' in the Keyword field:
SELECT * FROM Keywords WHERE (Keyword LIKE '[h]%' )
SELECT * FROM Keywords WHERE (Keyword LIKE '_ello' )

> but simple '_' and '%' are supposed to work.
The % works fine. I simply can't get the underscore to work. Have you tried creaing a query with _  ? When I run the following....
SELECT * FROM download_counts WHERE release LIKE '[3].3';
SELECT * FROM download_counts WHERE release LIKE '%[3].3%';
SELECT * FROM download_counts WHERE release LIKE '[3].%';
SELECT * FROM download_counts WHERE release LIKE '[3]._';
...I get no results. The SQLite library I am using does not support RegExp.  See www.devart.com/litedac  ### Details for the issue

All data fields in Browse Data show as black text on black background. The colouring schema is fetched from preferences. The error is repeatable.
When I do this:
1 - change "SQL editor font size" in pane SQL in Preferences
2 - exit program
3 - start program again
I get this error:
- data fields in pane "Browse data" are all shown in black text on black background
It is possible to change colours in Preferences (possible workaround). Once I leave the program and starts again the text is again shown in black on black (i.e. unreadable).
### Useful extra information
Workaround: delete the preferences file com.sqlitebrowser.sqlitebrowser.plist at my local Library/Preferences.

I have to keep re selecting the table I'm interested in on the **browse data** tab whenever I change the tab to something else, e.g., **Exectute SQL**
Is there a way to make the program remember? Indeed that was the case! Thank you for the swift reply!  ### Details for the issue

- load into debugger: windbg/ollydgb: cannot stat, no valid win32 ...
### Useful extra information
- look on PE32 header, and find: optional PE32 has os-version major set to 6 = Vista (minor to 0)
- googled and found: VC2012 SP0 (not SP1) dropped XP support by setting os-version to 6

and BTW: patching offset 40/44 of the PE Header from 0006 to 0005 allows the program to run flawlessly, so it is no technical limitation, only a political - was this a deliberate decision? there is an easy way, see here:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj851139(v=vs.120).aspx
and if switching to VS 2015, there still is:

it's just a setting ... and BTW:
> XP has practically no users
netmarketshare 11/2016: 8.63%, more than 8.1 and more than all MacOS together, and way more than Linux:
that's "practically no" for you?!? So what version runs on XP or what shall be done to run it on XP? @iRybin: as I said already in comment 2, if you are able to operate a hexeditor, just changing offset 0x40 and 0x44 of the sqlitebrowser.exe executable from 0x0006 (Vista) to 0x0005 (XP) is all that's needed - it is not a technical reason, just a restrictive labeling that alienates XP users ... @h1618 @iRybin ~If that helps, the [nighly builds](https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32/) run fine on XP SP3, even on CPUs without SSE2. There is a note in the project front page to test them in case of trouble. :smile:~ @justinclift @h1618 @iRybin Hmmm. Unfortunately seems that the new nigthly builds available don't work with XP SP3 anymore. :sob:
The latest version that can confirm that works with XP SP3 is 2016-10-01, but is not available to download anymore.
In my case if I'm doing it right, patching the PE header in the binary as @h1618 suggest doesn't help: the program then loads but crashes immediately with an exception. :confused: @h1618 If patching the PE header fixed the "not a valid Win32 application" error and allowed you to run DB4S without problems, then I believe the fix is very simple.
Microsoft dropped support for Windows XP on newer versions of Visual Studio by setting *SystemVersion* (offset 0x0040) in the PE header for all generated .exe to version 6 (Windows Vista) by the linker. MinGW on the other hand set this value to 4 (Windows 95/NT).
DB4S is built using MSVC (2013) without setting the minimum operating system to 5 (XP) so the .exe gets the default one 6 (Vista). I believe changing `/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS` (version not set, defaults to 6.00) to `/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.01` (for Windows XP, and 5.02 for Windows XP 64-bit) in [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L323) will make the .exe run on Windows XP without problems. This will just change the minimum *operating system/subsystem version* that are set by the linker. More information on [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fcc1zstk(v=vs.120).aspx).
@justinclift I think DB4S used to work on Windows XP when using the old build system because it was **not** using MSVC. @justinclift Unfortunately I don't have much experience with CMake.
`devenv.exe` (Visual Studio) works with `.vcxproj` XML project files, and will not accept that /SUBSYSTEM switch. It is a linker switch and should be added to CMake so it can generate a working `.vcxproj` file for `devenv` to use.
Try editing the `CMakeList.txt` and add the switch there, then look at the generated `.vcxproj` file. You should find something like..
<ItemDefinitionGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|Win32'">
<Link>
<SubSystem>Windows</SubSystem>
<MinimumRequiredVersion>5.01</MinimumRequiredVersion>
</Link>
</ItemDefinitionGroup>
If you found `<MinimumRequiredVersion>5.01</MinimumRequiredVersion>` then it should work.
Another solution is by editing the source files. Something like..
#ifdef _MSC_VER
#    pragma comment(linker, "/subsystem:windows,5.01")
#endif
Finally, a quick solution is by editing the .exe file using [`editbin`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d25ddyfc(v=vs.120).aspx) and change the subsystem right after building it. Something like..
editbin DB4S.exe /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.01
editbin DB4S_x64.exe /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.02
**NOTE:** Windows XP 64-bit was introduced later than the 32-bit version so it got a different version. Personally I don't think the editbin solution is ideal. If something else changes in Qt or elsewhere and we actually drop XP support but then use this to "add it back" then we could be covering up a multitude of issues. So, we should do this with the linker really.
However I would vote for dropping XP support completely. @glawrence `editbin` will not add/remove support for XP. It will just set the minimum operating system version in the PE header so the OS can load it. This is exactly what the linker will do after combining all the object codes into an executable.
It is perfectly fine to set it to a lower value too. The latest version of MinGW set it to 4 (Windows 95/NT), even if you are targeting newer OS like Windows 7 or higher. An application will not work of course if it cannot find the newer Win32 APIs.
Judging by @h1618 solution (patching the exe) that worked for him then I guess DB4S is not using any newer APIs higher than Windows XP, and I don't see a reason to *drop* XP support. In fact, building the same source and using the same build system but with a different compiler other than MSVC will make it work.
I know supporting and maintaining older OS versions is hard, if you have to write code like this a lot..
```cpp
#if (_WIN32_WINNT >= 0x0601)
// Windows 7 or higher
#else
// Windows XP and lower
#endif
```
But this is not the case here. It is just changing a couple of bytes in DB4S executable. Using the linker switch, `#pragma` in the source code, or `editbin` will accomplish that. To be honest, I think `editbin` is the best solution since almost everyone here wants to drop XP support.
How about making a new installer just for XP? So, after the build system make windows packages, it copies them, patch them using `editbin` then release as Windows XP only. Even better, make a new release for *older* versions of windows by using 4.00 (Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP) instead of 5.01.
As long as DB4S is not using newer Windows APIs it should work fine on older versions, without making any changes to the source code. If DB4S started using newer APIs then you can immediately stop releasing the older versions package and drop support for it, but not before that I hope.
@chrisjlocke I don't use Windows XP and yes I know it is old but I also know it is still has a large user base. Microsoft tried to drop support (stop making exe that will run on XP) for it in VS 2012 and failed. They were *forced*, by the huge user base, to add support for it in VS 2012, 2013, 2015.
I use Windows 7 and I continue to use it even after Microsoft [dropped support for it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet) about a year ago and I think most of DB4S windows users are on Windows 7.
If you don't want to support older OS then be ready in 3 years to find a way to make DB4S work on Windows 7 when its *extended support* ends in 2020, and Microsoft raises the minimum operating system version to Windows 8/10 in MSVC. @justinclift I agree with you, and that's why I prefer the `editbin` way, since it doesn't mess with the project build system or source code, and no files need to be changed. You can add it in the batch file that create the windows builds, and make a new installer for *legacy* windows.
Anyway, no one can support XP forever while every project is dropping support for it. According to this [comment](http://blog.qt.io/blog/2016/04/21/qt-5-7-beta-released/#comment-1197572) in Qt blog, Qt 5.6 LTS is the latest version to support XP. So keep that in mind when upgrading Qt. No support for XP? Too hard? Yeah, I hear ya. Too hard to use your product as well when there are so many other choices that do work...SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB. Wasn't too hard for them apparently ; )  ### Details for the issue
When SQL is executed in sqlitebrowser, the resulting table can be exportet to csv.
Generated csv-files are difficult to import into e.g. MS Excel, because for each datarow, the trailing separator is missing. When importing, the last column value of the first datarow is not ending with the desired separating character. The next datarow does not start with a separator, so at this point things get messed up.

Should have digged deeper before opening this issue, found the corresponding issue-threads too late,sorry. Strange things happen in the Microsoft World: If you open the generated csv by double-clicking and excel opens, everything. If you try to import the same file from within excel via "import as text", the described problems arise :-)
Copy-Paste works like a charm. Just came on this problem because i mailed a CSV to my boss... ;)
Dear Justin,
sorry for not responding - to little time, I´m sorry. Thank you very
much for your help and support.
Regards,
Stefan
### Details for the issue
If you open a database in DB4S that is also open in another process, then if you make changes to the database and click "Write Changes", the changes are not written to the database.  The journal file goes away and the changes remain in DB4S in memory, but as soon as the database is closed and reopened, the changes are gone.  There is no warning or error displayed.

At the end of an install, the installer asks if you would like to run the program.  If you leave that checkbox ticked yes, then the installer doesn't drop its own administrative priveleges before running DB Browser.  DB Browser, thus, gets run with those priveleges.

I think you have just made your own case for waiting at least a month before taking a new release of SQLite! Hence I would suggest waiting at least a month before using 3.15.2. Just my personal view though. Just set yourself a reminder to check in a month's time, maybe 3rd of Jan actually! Then you can reopen this if necessary. Was looking good until 3.15.2 came along to be honest!!   ### Details for the issue

I'm using the UniDac product from DevArt, they have an enumerated type of the encryption algorithms they support...
... this has been in my app long enough I don't recall why I selected Cast128, and I don't know what technology they're using under the hood to implement encrypting and decrypting.
So the quest for an SqLite db tool continues.  sigh...
drc  :)
I found an unencrypted copy I can use with your product to make a few minor changes.
As for changing the encryption method, I have an installed customer base and don't want to have to deal with some db's in the field are encrypted one way and and some a different way.
When I try to open a database, sqlitebrowser gets a segfault:
```
(sqlitebrowser:10884): Gdk-WARNING **: gdkwindow-x11.c:5554 drawable is not a native X11 window
Segmentation fault (core dump creato)
```
This happens on Fedora 25 with Wayland.
sqlitebrowser version 3.9.1.
I've just closed the session, restarted with xorg and everything works fine.
Can you please fix this problem with Wayland?
I guess that this might help:
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=758026
Thanks Yes, other Qt apps work fine  under Wayland, e.g. Frescobaldi (lilypond editor, hosted here in github).
Let me know if I can do other tests. Sorry, actually I wrote without double-checking: Frescobaldi used to work fine, but now I cannot open a file when using Wayland. I get the same error.
I recently upgraded the system from Fedora 24 to Fedora 25. I've found the solution [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1377616#c11); I installed qgnomeplatform and it's not crashing anymore.  ### Details for the issue

Here is a sample query that has both languages. In DB4S the english text after the RTL text get's placed on top of the RTL text. Please seen screenshot below. It is also very hard to write the RTL text because the cursor position is kind of backwards. I know it is a mac issue, but I know some apps have figured out a way around it.
Thank you for the great tool.

Yes. it deleted the files and folders related to 3.9.0, and the shortcuts from the Start Menu (according to the log) By the way, the Windows File Association-wiki you linked seems to be outdated for Windows 10 / the current version of DbBrowser.
The Reg-key is located at `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\sqlite_auto_file\shell\open\command` and there exists a key (REG_SZ) with name `(Default)` with the value of `"C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite\3.9.0\bin\DB Browser for SQLite.exe" "%1"` (which i will now update)  When using the modify table option, adding a field (new column) you can select all SQLite types except BOOLEAN. Even if you edit the TYPE field with text BOOLEAN it remains as the default INTEGER.
Thanks. Interestingly when I initialize the database I use BOOLEAN as the data type which is accepted by SQLite and also displayed in sqlitebrowser as BOOLEAN - hence this threw me off.   ### Details for the issue
The preferences do not seem to update in the data browser section, text colors.  They revert to black on black after closing the app - thanks in advance.

I didn't look thru them since I only installed the product yesterday.
Thought it was new.  But now I see the build I have is actually months
old, so I will investigate the nightly builds as you suggest.
Hard to believe that the author added the right click menu items then
didn't test them.:-)  My suggestions: when a field is just created, it gets a name like `FieldN` and then after you rename it upon creation, [`bool DBBrowserDB::renameColumn`](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/17369b66a62f748aba6106ce59554096dec38667/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L957) method gets called. However, this method obtains the version of a table which still has the old name of the field because table schemas are loaded [directly from database](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/17369b66a62f748aba6106ce59554096dec38667/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L1186-L1201), therefore [the membership check](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/17369b66a62f748aba6106ce59554096dec38667/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L982) fails. If you move field up, the same [`bool DBBrowserDB::renameColumn`](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/17369b66a62f748aba6106ce59554096dec38667/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L957) method gets called.
Currently I have no idea how to make this right. Here is my traceback when moving a field (truncated for short):
#0  DBBrowserDB::renameColumn (this=0xba4558, tablename=..., name=..., to=..., move=-1)
#1  0x000000000056e0bd in EditTableDialog::moveCurrentField (this=0x7fffffffc150, down=false)

When in the Execute SQL tab, I am unable to edit any of the results returned from a SQL query.
Steps to duplicate:
1) Go to Execute SQL tab
2) Run a query ( e.g. **SELECT * FROM _[TableName]_** )
3) Try to edit any cell from results
Double-clicking on a cell takes the keyboard cursor to the "Edit Database Cell" view, but I am not able to make any changes.  The "Apply" button is greyed out and not clickable.
Is this by design? Or is there there an option I need to enable to make cells editable in the Execute SQL tab?

Hey, is there a way to do 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS' with DB B, not just  CREATE TABLE, this could save error in CoreData and other, == SQLite error code:1, 'table  already exists'

CoreData —no matter what I tried, showed up an error that my  table did not exist, when it did and I could see it by using SB.
I was trying to pre-population a store and put it in my app bundle.
Turns out CoreData was creating the store for me and it was empty— no data—no table.
Once I got my head on straight and read their technical bulletin for the hundredth time, I figure out all I have to do was open their store with SB and fill it in with my data make a copy of that store and put it in my bundle, done.
Once again sorry the confusion,

When I try to import a .txt that I exported using Access 2010 I get the following error:
**Error importing data: Error in statement #1: near "33". Syntax error. Aborted execution.**
James
This is line 1 in the txt file: 33,"Purchase",6/29/1998 0:00:00,$12312.00
Line 1 is the first row and "33" is the record ID of the first record.
Also, how come the import .csv grayed out?
That was it.
I needed to create a new db with the fields to import to.
Thanks much,
James
### Details for the issue
Clicking on the 'Browse Data' tab always loads the first table or view alphabetically. After selecting the correct table, going to another tab and then coming back to 'Browse Data', it's the first table again. And if it's a big one, it takes time loading data you _weren't_ trying to browse.
So Feature request: 'Browse Data' should remember the last table/view you were on before having switched to another tab. (For that session.)
I'd consider this a bug - not remembering the last table/view in the Data Browser - but if it was never planned/intended, then it's a feature request.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
On the tab "Execute SQL", create a new SQL file and save it to your local drive.
Make a change to the document.
Click CTRL-S.
GET: File is not saved.
EXPECT: File to save.
Click "Save" button on toolbar.
GET EXPECTED: File is saved.
REASON: Every windows user in the world expects CTRL-S to save the current file regardless of the application (e.g. Notepad++, etc.). It is built into our fingers. Thank Microsoft for that. CTRL-SHIFT-S often saves all documents.

When trying to delete all records or large number of
them (~5000) (selecting them and pressing Delete Record on Data tab), it
takes too much time to execute this operation due to large number of
queries like `DELETE * FROM 'table' WHERE '_rowid_' = id`.  ### Details for the issue

Some multi-line queries having comments at the end of a line do not work.
For example, this one:
SELECT
ID,
label -- fails
FROM example;
I get the following message in the lower part of the window:
```
Error executing query: SELECT
ID,
shortName -- fails
FROM example;
```
However, this one is OK:
SELECT
ID,
label -- doesn't fail
FROM example;
Could it be related to the apostrophe?

Yes, indeed, the nightly version works. Thank you! 👍   Having a lot of tables, it feels very annoying to only have 10 rows in the "Table" drop down list:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/415439/20138489/ec89b452-a680-11e6-8711-de8d42d1c206.png)
**My question:**
Could you please make it more lines, like e.g. 20, or even a configuration value so that I can change it by myself? @MKleusberg I've downloaded [this one](https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/DB%20Browser%20for%20SQLite-sqlcipher-2017-01-04-win64.exe) from [this page](https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/).
Seems to work as expected. Thank you very much! 😄

Hi, I think I might be facing a similar issue, I pulled SQLCipher DB (created by an Android App) from an Android Box and tried to open, getting the same "Please enter the key used to encrypt the database" dialog over and over again, even though I have supplied it with the correct passkey. I am not setting page size, so I put page size 1024 in the dialog.
Could this be the same issue or a different one? If this is then please tell me how to _unlock_  the database file. I get this issue too when trying to open a file that's on a samba share yet when I copy the file to my desktop and open it there's no issues. I'm not sure as I have never used this product before and only noticed it on the first time I tried it.
Do you have a link to the nightly builds that I can try?
I'm using Mac OS Sierra if that matters. @justinclift both are working fine for me now. So the nightly has whatever issue I had fixed.  Apologies for the late response, I received the mail on a vacation when I had no tested news to add. But @justinclift unfortunately yes! I got it fixed but I don't know how. I didn't update the software, so unless some windows `exe`, `dll`, etc. files were required to run which were missing from the system previously I have no idea why DB Browser is suddenly working. Anyway the other day a junior colleague opened it because he didn't know DB Browser wasn't working for SQLCipher.
Meanwhile I checked and rechecked versions on both machines, same version (Software and OS both). Opened the file myself and voila, now it was opening the file as innocently as possible.  ### Details for the issue

Hi, I was working with version 3.7.0 but now it's not working on MacOs.. Just FYI.  ### Details for the issue
I had Windows configured to associate the .db extension with DB4S in version 3.9.0.  When I upgraded to 3.9.1, I removed 3.9.0 and had to reassociate the extension.  To do this I:
1. Double click the .db file
2. In the "Open With" dialog, browse to C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite and double click the exe
At this point the dialog doesn't recognize that an application was selected.
If I replace the spaces in the executable name with with underscores (i.e. DB_Browser_for_SQLite), the association works correctly.
I reinstalled 3.9.0 and found that it has the same executable naming convention as 3.9.1, so I have a feeling that the underscore solution may be a red herring.

Here's my procedure:
1. Open process monitor, disabled capturing and cleared the output
2. Got to the Open With dialog, browsed to the path (C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite), and selected the exe (didn't click open yet).
3. Started capturing in the process monitor, quickly switched over and clicked Open in the dialog, then back to turn off capturing.
I've attached the PML log.  If you want it as CSV or XML let me know.  Here's what I see that's interesting with the Registry and File System Activity enabled.
1. 4:55:13.9534235 - Looks like the first time DB4S is accessed.
3. 4:55:13.9751138 - It looks like there are a series of registry accesses for DB4S
4. 4:55:13.9767010 - I see an access for the 3.9.0 path that I used to have
I imagine that something is still pointing to the 3.9.0 path in registry, Windows gets confused and just punts.
[Logfile.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/570186/Logfile.zip)
On a hunch, I jumped into regedit and looked at HKCU\Software\Classes\Applications\DB Browser for SQLite.exe\shell\open\command, and that looks like the culprit.  It has a value of "C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite\3.9.0\bin\DB Browser for SQLite.exe" "%1"
So it looks to me that either the 3.9.0 uninstall didn't clean this up or the 3.9.1 install didn't overwrite it.  Also, the reason that adding the underscores worked is that it pointed it to a new registry key.
Let me know if you need anything else from me.
In windows 10 is't super simple, but .sqlite and .db association would be a great addition to the installer.  ### Details for the issue
It would be helpful to (have the option to) always have a blank row ready at the bottom of a table for new data entry. This would save the steps of clicking "new record" and then selecting which value to enter.
My use case is for relatively rapid manual data entry during an athletic event. The data will be used for displaying current results. I am using `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIME` in order to match the entry time to the racer bib number that is entered. Processing and display will be handled in R/Shiny.

@chrisjlocke, I'm considering a custom application, but I figured I would try an existing database interface first. My main sticking point is to be able to change "bad" data in table form; this seems more complicated to code than just accepting a series of bib numbers.
@justinclift, I was thinking of a row that wouldn't actually be written until non-default values were entered, which if possible would mean no rows full of keys or timestamps but nothing else. I don't know how much harder that is to do, though.
What about using `DELETE FROM `table` WHERE `_rowid_` IN ( ... )` here https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/60e4cb758ed58db3a8d01cb13e82d79cf2d3ef33/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L873-L876 in all cases regardless of whether one or multiple records should be deleted?
It turns out that the method `removeRow` of `SqliteTableModel` object gets invoked [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/982e4c4d346e066b72e8a8df2d47fa00c0075269/src/MainWindow.cpp#L589), and since [`SqliteTableModel`](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/982e4c4d346e066b72e8a8df2d47fa00c0075269/src/sqlitetablemodel.h#L11) is a subclass of [`QAbstractTableModel`](https://github.com/qt/qt/blob/0a2f2382541424726168804be2c90b91381608c6/src/corelib/kernel/qabstractitemmodel.h#L345) which is, in turn, a subclass of `QAbstractItemModel`, the following code from Qt library is executed:
inline bool QAbstractItemModel::removeRow(int arow, const QModelIndex &aparent)
{ return removeRows(arow, 1, aparent); }
```
that is, it forces us to have only 1 row deleted.
My backtrace on deletion looks like this:

It seems to me that we cannot delete multiple records at once if we rely on table model of Qt.
Should we bypass the `inline bool QAbstractItemModel::removeRow` method call?
### Details for the issue
I find it interesting to find out that mac's build of the latest app lacks fts4 support. I use the same app on windows and it has fts4.
So I'm opening this ticket as a feature request.
I also want to refer to already closed ticket https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/762 which is not clear if the feature is already added or not.

I don't mind supporting FTS5 as it seems to be a more mature version of previous efforts. It seems though like FTS3/4 and FTS5 can coexist.
xerial's JDBC driver at least have both.
Here's the make file https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/blob/master/Makefile
Hope it helps.
-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3
-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS
Enables both FTS3 and FTS4
see https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html section "2. Compiling and Enabling FTS3 and FTS4"
I'd be glad to.
Done.
Is there anything at this point to do? Just tested on the latest nightly build: DB Browser for SQLite-sqlcipher_20161127.dmg
On fts4 and fts5 databases, both worked fine. I'm glad we got this quickly sorted out.
Now we need fts5 support on win32 as well..  ### Details for the issue
Hello everyone, the latest DB Browser has a weird issue. The default field colors for showing the result table is black. I tried to change that from the app preferences, it works for the current app instance but resets back to black when the app is reopened.

Same problem :/
Maybe problem with prefences (plist)?
Workaround: delete pref ~/Library/Preferences/com.sqlitebrowser.sqlitebrowser.plist and don't edit preferences of application.  Hi guys,
I have tables with newlines in them (it is an event log). Old SQLiteBrowser (3.8.0) used to export these tables like a champ.
Now, 3.9.1 breaks the export and Excel/Google Drive is no longer able to parse the file you all are creating. It seems to be coming out as garbage, lines munged together, almost like the memory is corrupted somehow.
That was it, thanks!
### Details for the issue
<!--
If you click on the "Browse Data" tab, select a table and then click to another tab (e.g. "Execute SQL"), when you click back on the "Browse Data" tab the application reverts back to showing the first table in the list and not the one you were previously viewing. i.e. it has "forgotten" the table you were viewing and you have to navigate back to where you were.
Also, in the "Database Structure" tab, if you right-click on a table and select "Browse Table" from the pop-up menu, you are taken to the first table in the list (under the "Browse Table" tab), not the one you selected,

I duped this one in issue #873.
Re-tried and works, with the last nightly build - 2016-11-18, win64, v3.9.99
One thing to add to this bug, which is **also/already fixed in the nightlies**: When we right-click on a Table or View in 'DB Structure' and select 'Browse Data', it doesn't take you to that table in the data browser. Instead, it's always the first table/view by sort order. In the nightly I tested against (2016-11-18), this works correctly: right-click on table/view ➜ Browse data takes you to that one in the data browser.
_Btw, this should probably be added to [3.10.0 - A Rubber Cactus Has Many Uses](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/milestone/11)._ Hi Justin,
yes, sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I can confirm that this bug is fixed in the latest nightly build.
Cheers,
Michael.

We are using sqllitedb browser to maintain a local db on the device. The issue is everytime we close and reopen the device the foreign key constraint/pragma is unchecked and as a part user is able to insert corrupt content in the DB. Please resolve.

Same issue on windows portable build. Also seems to ignore the pragma after I turn it on (i can still insert invalid rows)
Still seems broken in nightly Yes, it is checked. I'm sorry I can't build myself and check what's going on for you but I don't do any dev on windows  yes I am :) i also tried `PRAGMA foreign_keys = on;` in the sql box and write changes after running that. Still no luck Sorry @justinclift , I won't have access to a windows PC for a while !  ### Details for the issue
Hi,
I'm currently running DB Browser for SQLite v3.9.1 (64 bit) on a 64 bit version of Windows 10. Whenever I click on "New Database" or "Open Database", the program crashes. I've tried both the 32 and 64 bit versions. I get the following message box whenever the program crashes:

Thanks justin and chris. I'll try the suggestions and report back
I tried the two nightly builds but they didn't work either. I also tried running the program as an administrator, running windows in safe mode and also trying it in a different windows account (with admin privileges) and it still crashes.
I checked the entries in the Event Viewer, and it still contains the same information. It doesn't display anything different. Is there anything else that we can try?
I opened the executable in it. When I did so, I got the following pop up, but it still let me continue.

Here's what it looked like after I clicked on "OK" in the popup. I get several errors, but I'm not sure where to start.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/23085957/19779607/6c7b8d46-9c47-11e6-91a2-2d9fd0c8a222.png)
I've saved and attached the .dwi file.
[DB Browser for SQLite.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/556666/DB.Browser.for.SQLite.zip)
So, if I filter out everything that begins with API-MS-WIN and EXT-MS, I'm left with the following:
```
DEVICELOCKHELPERS.DLL
EMCLIENT.DLL
```
It looks like the C++ redistributables were already installed on my computer. When I ran "vcredist_x64.exe", it brought up a window with "Repair" and "Uninstall" options. I tried "Repair" first, but it's still doing the same thing. Next I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, but still nothing.
justin,
I tried googling, but I couldn't find any leads on which installers are supposed to distribute the dll's.
chris,
That sounds promising. I'll get Process Monitor on my computer. Just let me know where to go from there.
Hi Justin, sorry I've been busy working on a few other things. I should be able to try it out tomorrow. Sorry for the delay.
Hi,
i have the same problem as softdev, but on Linux (OpenSuSE 13.1 64bit).
I've tested version 3.6.0 and 3.8.0 from SuSE buildservice and compiled version 3.9.1 myself.
When i start sqlitebrowser as root everything works fine. But when i start it as normal user it crashes with a "segmentation fault" when i click on "Open Database".
libqt version is 4.8.5
It seems to be a bug in qt4.
I've started qtconfig and set "GUI Style" to "Motiv", everything works fine.
This could be a solution for windows too.
Set user_version of the new db to current user_version.
Otherwise user_version would be set to 0.
It seems like it has to do with these lines https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/60e4cb758ed58db3a8d01cb13e82d79cf2d3ef33/src/ExportDataDialog.cpp#L92 and https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/60e4cb758ed58db3a8d01cb13e82d79cf2d3ef33/src/ExportDataDialog.cpp#L113-L116, that is, it quotes the contents of a field only if there are characters to be escaped. For example, if you have the following data:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6525383/19951659/a2dced20-a170-11e6-83f8-acd018e4c9e3.png)
you can export like this:
``` csv
id,flag
a,"E""E"
b,D D
c,C C
d,B B
e,A A
```
So maybe we should introduce something like `chars_to_quote` alongside with `special_chars`?
### SqliteBrowser support for **_extensions:_** "intrinsic (JSON1)" and "externals", and _compiler-toolchain options_: "Windows/`clang`"
_The following is a effectively a direct re-post of the e-mail I sent yesterday to Justin Clift, which I am posting here at his most kind e-mail suggestion._
Hi Justin,
Apologies for directly pinging you, I can't find any other means to inquire on a "posting-board" of some kind.
**SqliteBrowser** is a great project and a valuable community asset.
**QUESTION-1**: I was looking to see whether the _intrinsic_ **JSON1** _extension_ could be turned on _by-default_ in the nightly builds _(at least the **Windows** version)_ of **SqliteBrowser**?
_Side-note on non-intrinsic **Sqlite** extensions_: Given that **SqliteBrowser** is a great and openly available tool specifically for **Sqlite**, it makes sense to me that it also would be a hosting location for obtaining **Sqlite _extension libraries_** that are binary-compatible with its various platform versions. _Which, leads me to the more detailed second question..._
_First, some contextual background_: I do development work on **afm-scm** (afm-scm.org) _[which is a compatible variant of **fossil-scm**]_ and its integrated **TSL** language-engine and its hosting **AOS** object-system-engine. The **T**ext-**S**cripting-**L**anguage (ts-lang.org) is, for the most part, a superset of TCL blended with JavaScript, Smalltalk, Lisp/Scheme and intrinsically supports and integrates **Sqlite**.
**QUESTION-2**: Would it make sense to enable seamless `make` of **SqliteBrowser** _(on any platform, but especially **Windows**)_ using `clang` as a supported _(possibly-default)_ choice for a fully cross-platform compiler build tool for **SqliteBrowser**?
If one wants cross-platform source build compatibility at the C/C++ language and toolchain level there are few natively compatible options; and only one _(_`clang`_)_ that is also _gnu-compatible_.  As it stand now, building **SqliteBrowser** for **_Windows_** is a _non-trivial distraction_ since it requires variations of the _gnu-based_ toolchain to build quasi-compatible **_Windows_** binaries _(or an apparently complex setup of components to build via **VisualStudio** or_ `cmake` _or_ `nmake` _etc)_.
Not having some solution to these questions, in practice, _cripples_ **SqliteBrowser** use with "optional" Sqlite features and extensions.
The **SqliteBrowser** _default_ releases do not link to a **Sqlite** _(coff)_ library so one has to **_recompile_** the whole **SqliteBrowser** app. I.e., it doesn't reference **Sqlite** via a `shared-library` and its binary depends on the _gnu-toolchain_. Thus, things like the **_intrinsic JSON1 extension_** are "apparently-hard" to build as a **Sqlite** _discrete extension_. This is **quite** "problematic".
_Point in case_: I have various databases with **TRIGGERS** that use and depend on **JSON1** _(an invaluable extension to **Sqlite**)_. The **SqliteBrowser** is _unusable_ with those database tables that have such triggers.
But, my real hope and desire is that the **SqliteBrowser** team might be open to a path to enable _intrinsic_ **Sqlite** _extensions_ such as **JSON1** to become accessible via **SqliteBrowser** either by it being built to reference **Sqlite** via a `shared-library`, or making various _intrinsic extensions_, such as **JSON1**, enabled _by-default_ in the **SqliteBrowser** app builds.
This would be further aided in its simplicity and flexibility with cross-platform support for `clang` as a standardly supported build-chain tool. I assert this would eliminate _(most, if not all)_ special case platform issues for **Windows**.
A bit of other _background_ on `clang` availability: The current **Windows** `clang-tools` are available _freely_, and _natively_ integrated and supported within **Visual Studio** from **Microsoft**; as well as being _freely_  available from the `primary clang team` for use as `standalone` **Windows** based _gnu-compatible_ compiler tools.
It might _(and probably would)_ be easier to configure the **Window's** builds to use either the _free_ `native` **Window's** **Visual Studio** `clang` tools or the _freely_ downloaded **Windows** `standalone` command-line `clang-tools` from the _official_ `clang` website.
**SqliteBrowser** supporting a standard model of `clang` based build configuration would allow building on almost every platform with the same _gnu-compatible_ compiler. _This is what I use for building my code on all processors (Arm, Intel, ...) and platforms (BSD, Linux, Windows, OSX, ...); and worthy of mention, is that this also enables the **option** to build **for-all** platforms simultaneously on  single machine - although that is a bit more work :-) to set up._
Thanks for listening,

#### I'm opening this issue because:
- [X] DB4S needs a feature
- [X] DB4S has another problem
I spent some 4 hours on this and the CMAKE file is difficult in terms of
the dependency list and what needs to be configured. I am pretty sure
that doing this right is many days of work to revise the build process,
easier to start from scratch.
During the 4 hours or so I spent, it required polluting a dev-box with
superfluous tools and libraries and language runtimes.
I.e., The build steps are fragile. QT is a beast. I ran out of time with
ANTLR and QT issues and configuring CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, ...
It has hard-coded paths, version information ...
The CMake file assumed explicit versions of many of its dependencies on
binaries and particular libraries. QT is onerous for many reasons
including the managerial aspects introduced by their marketing approach
to make money.
It assumes various tools and libraries are installed that are not called
out in the material listed on:
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S
I found the CMake code process complicated with dependencies.
I understand it is portable-UI (around the scintilla-core editor) over
the portable and easy to build SqLite engine.
For the windows components there is no-need for the redist files, just
link them into the binary. The libs could be linked in or provided as
so/dll's and on windows use delay-loaded dlls.
# Could it not be built as: (cmd line for 32/6 bit build)
a) SqLite lib reference (binary download - or discrete C-compiler build)
b) Translation tool for localization of code (perhaps directly invoking
Linguist tool if that is best option)
c) OpenSSL lib reference (binary download - or discrete C/C++ build)
## [why is SSL required?]
d) Qt lib reference (binary download - or discrete build)
e) Drag-install with self-installation/uninstallation in Main to avoid
If ANTLR2 is not available, it is unclear what the code will need or
will try to do...
# I assume it is just a build:
1. Compile SqLite or use a existing LIB or SO/DLL
2. Compile OpenSSL or use a existing LIB or SO/DLL [which of the
components needs this, is unclear]
3. Provide a portable UI using some framework, support locales for
globalization
3.1 QT Chosen, locale support provided by Linguist
3.1.2 QT compilation (if not using pre-built binaries) requires
4. Package the resulting binary/resources into an installer (better if
4.1 Let app be it's own installer [it does not need to register
I think it might be easier to build and enrich as a Chromium/Electron
app, or just see if the Linux cross-platform build steps are somehow
simpler.

Sorry.
I tried to get nightly build, but http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org is unreachable for me, due to some unknown reason :(
@chrisjlocke
Yes! I can access chrisjlocke.co.uk, your blog.
It seems that nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org is blocked by GFW.
Could you upload the latest nightly build to your blog? I'll test it.
Thank you for your kind help.
@justinclift
Great! It works! THANK YOU!

### Details for the issue
Well, my point is, it would be awesome to be able to change the limits of the axis window.
Right now it uses the current max/min for X and Ys, which is a little bit inconvenient. (Remember I can´t plot lines? So dots get cut in half)
Also, by adding that we would have a "zooming" tool. (I think this feature seems very easy to implement, whereas a true zooming thing seems much more complicated)
e.g. When I plot this:
![axis limits](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19496875/9286c574-9557-11e6-91d5-f976cbbf0a4e.png)

Hi everyone,
I exactly have the same issue on my installation (Ubuntu 16.04 64b)
Version 3.9.99
Version de Qt : 5.5.1
where I can see the file modified date ?
Thank you The error occur all the time.
The error appear if I click "Write changes" on the interface or "Write changes" in file menu.
If I close the database in the file menu. I click yes to save changes made and it's ok.
Database is ok
Database is also saved if I just click on "Write changes" and close the database without saving it.
I got the error but the database is saved..
I don't know if I answer to your question ?
```
Error while saving the database file. This means that not all changes to the database were saved. You need to resolve the following error first.
no such savepoint: RESTOREPOINT (RELEASE RESTOREPOINT;)
```
Update some obsolete translations. These translations used to work in previous version.
No problem, I'll translate them soon.
I created a new PR here: #840

Ok, I'll try as I have a chance. Maybe today evening.
Thanks for fixing the bugs anyways.
What about the cmake support? I'll test that too.
Lev Unfortunately it doesn't compile on my system. I have an up to date Debian Jessie. It seems that my system got too old.
/usr/include/c++/4.9/bits/c++0x_warning.h:32:2: error: #error This file requires compiler and library support for the ISO C++ 2011 standard. This support is currently experimental, and must be enabled with the -std=c++11 or -std=gnu++11 compiler options.
#error This file requires compiler and library support for the \
I try tomorrow on a Debian testing with more recent compiler.
Lev Ok. Just a note. Should the cmake/qmake system take care about dependencies? So it shall detect Qt5.7, and refuse to configure the code if it is older. I tried on Debian testing, with recent Qt and compiler. qmake doesn't
complained about my obvious missing dependency:
In file included from sqlitedb.cpp:2:0:
sqlite.h:13:25: fatal error: sqlite3.h: No such file or directory
#include <sqlite3.h>
After installing the required packages, it installed fine. I suggest using
cmake as the code configuration tool.
Levente One of the major user case of cmake is to detect installed packages. .configure (autotool) did the same thing, but it isn't portable (eg. it is a PITA on Windows). I personally use cmake it to detect SQLite. Here is what I do.
[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/991259/CMakeLists.txt)
I use the same CMakeLists.txt on Linux and FreeBSD, so this is cross platform. I was lazy, and I just detect presence of libsqlite3, but with a small tweak, you can even detect, and require specific major/minor/patch version too.
I'm sorry if this is not the right place to suggest things. And I think we can close this issue, since the original problem is solved now. Thanks.  ...and if you could include  package dependencies for a generic Linux system to use QT5, that would be nice too. It now insists on using QT4. This is just a wish.
Thanks,
Lev
Okay. I was too fast typing that wish. I read the documentation again, and there is a package list there. After installing those, it does build fine using QT5. I'm so sorry about the former message.
An documentation update would be very much welcome. I tried to build sqlitebrowser with sqlcipher support longer that I liked using [building.md](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md) on a (K)ubuntu 16.04.1. I could not build the master no matter what I used (cmake, make, qmake -> _/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/QtCore/qhash.h:103:5: error: no matching function for call to ‘qHash(const QVector<QSharedPointer<sqlb::Field> >&)’_)._ The only combination that worked was to use the v3.9.1 Tag, install _qt4-default_ and use _qmake CONFIG+=sqlcipher ._ and then _make_.
Once built sqlitebrowser works flawlessly! Thx for this awesome tool.
Jepp, just now. :) Thank you. Good luck! That's interesting. Feel free to ask the version number of any package that I have installed. :smile: Totally agree. KDE was glorious in the 3.x days. It hat a pretty rough time in the beginning of the 4.x versions but now it's pretty good looking **and** stable :smile:  Yes, my Kubuntu uses Qt 5.5.1. I got a blackscreen on my machine this morning. After a lot of hassel a reinstallation of KDE fixed things. So much for stable :smile: Maybe the Qt up- and downgrades messed things up. Dunno....
I am totally fine using v3.9.1 and thinks it is the best/easiest solution if you declare yourself to be Qt 5.6 (and above) only. Just updated build-docs and everybody is happy :smiley:
Guys, cmake is broken at the moment.
After struggling an hour to get 3.9.1 build with cmake, I found this issue, and switched to qmake.
FWIW, my builds are public: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:frispete:PyQt5/sqlitebrowser
The problem with cmake starts with the first line of CMakeLists.txt:
`project("DB Browser for SQLite")`
Next hurdle is missing `C++11` support, that is needed by newer Qt versions.
Fixed this by adding:
`set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-std=c++11" CACHE STRING "compile flags" FORCE)`
to CMakeLists.txt.
Next, it generated gems like this in `CMakeFiles/DB Browser for SQLite.dir/build.make`:
```
# Object files for target DB Browser for SQLite
DB Browser for SQLite_OBJECTS = \
"CMakeFiles/DB Browser for SQLite.dir/src/AboutDialog.cpp.o" \
```
Note the macro name. Guess, what make says to such expressions... <spit>
After that, I realized, that you creates files, based on this name:
```
if(UNIX AND NOT APPLE)
install(FILES src/icons/${PROJECT_NAME}.png
install(FILES distri/${PROJECT_NAME}.desktop
DESTINATION share/applications/)
install(FILES distri/${PROJECT_NAME}.desktop.appdata.xml
DESTINATION share/appdata/)
```
At this point, I went to qmake, which got it to build at least, and *thankfully* kept the old, but sane name.
I still have a few things, that I don't like: the build system should allow to use the platform qscintilla lib. I tried that with qmake, but failed, since openSUSE uses -lqscintilla2-qt5 to distinguish it from qt4 builds, and qmake just removes -qt5. Oh well..
It's up and running, but... I think it is not cmake what is broken. It is sqlitebrowser that miss uses

@justinclift Well, to be honest, I'm glad to have it running "nearly" current. The rename of the binary and all is a real PITA for packagers like me. So even with cmake fixed, I'm inclined to keep the qmake build, because I'm lazy, and sqlitebrowser would be the very first app, that contain spaces in the name (we only have a few thousand other binaries @openSUSE...). Be assured, that this will lead to headaches for about every Linux packager of your package out there.
It's not a question of "if it breaks", it's a question of where.
@leventelist: I don't think, that cmake is a beautiful piece of software, but as noted before, the project name alone is a receipt for trouble. You can call your program as you like, but I would refrain from using any spaces in it, at least not in those parts, that face a file system. @justinclift I see, the CMakeLists.txt looks better now. Let's make a deal, you provide some way of using the system qscintilla, and I test, help to fix the fallout, and push the result to openSUSE official..
Hmm the qscintilla version is tweaked, but that is flagged as needed from MacOS only, hence it should be fine. Deal? @justinclift BTW, the separate Qt packages are available here: http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.7/5.7.1/submodules/ Good news for [openSUSE:](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/451660)

### Details for the issue
Since version 3.9.0 it came to my attention that tables are sorted during save of the database. In version 3.9.0 it was only sorted when you did a refresh of the table, but since version 3.9.1 it always sort the table prior it is saved.
This is very annoying, because I have a config table in the database, which contains configuration parameters for my application which should be saved in the order it was written in the table. Now the table is sorted when saved, I can not read the table anymore, because al configuration items are out of order and my application behaves bad.
Please tell me that this sort option can be switched off somewhere, because I use tables which should not be sorted, but stay in the order the were written.

Hello,
What I use is:
Select \* from adapter;
If rs <> nil then
Do until rs.eof
cgf=cfg+1
Config(cfg)=rs.field("ConfData").stringvalue
rs.MoveNext
End if
The config array will be used to configure the application.
These entries in the db should stay unchanged as I wrote them in the db, but the last 2 versions of sqlitebrowser sort them ascending before writing the changes.
That is my problem.
With kind regards,
Rob
chrisjlocke, I am sure it is not only the view. If I restart the application after I saved the db changes, the application goes nuts. When I pause th eapplication and check its config, all the values are in the wrong places. This was not the case with the version prior 3.9.0. With 3.9.0 I really also thought that it was only the view, because I saw that refreshing the records sorted the records in the table, but as far as I know it did not save that sorted order. Now with 3.9.1 I am faced with a changed table. Before upgrading to 3.9.1 I never saw my application going nuts.
I dont want an order in this table, I know how to order the table ascending or descending on a certain field, but I want this table unsorted in the order that I wrote the records into the table. Unchanged.
That is the way I do read the table when I start the application, in the order I did write th erecords in the table.
Justin, I dont want my table sorted. I only want it in the way I did write the records to the table. These are only 14 records and it is read in the way it was saved when setup was used of my application.
hmmm...ok, then I will use an index from 1 to 14 to keep the table in the order I want it to be.
No, just one field. I use it this way to have just 1 database containing all the files I need and not all kind of seperate files on disk. With only one field I can make changes in the setup of my application without a need to adjust the database fields. If I change something one day and have a config item more, I delete the contents of the table and write 15 records to that table. When something else goes out, I delete the contents of the table again and write 14 records in the table. You see my point, I do not need to add or delete fields in the table. This is by the way the only table I use this way, all other tables are used as you would expect a database is used and do not give any problem. :-)
Ok, that is what I thought already.
Fyi, Justin, sqlitebrowser is a great application, I use it during development of my application to check if the info is stored in the tables as I want it and also ti flip bits to see how my application responds on the change.
Great work!
### Details for the issue
If I want to browse the data which I select from "Database Structure Tab"
It opens the first table of the database, not the one I selected.
Also when I switching through the tabs, the table that I selected in "Browse Data" tab suddenly relocated to the first table of the db.

So, as you may have seen, the latest version of QScintilla that contains the GPL exception is version 2.8.4, which was released in September 2014 (!!). The author of QScintilla has been considering switching to LGPL+commercial for more than a year now, but still hasn't made up his mind.
For my project, we can't afford going back to 2.8.4, so we discussed it internally and we have decided to switch to GPLv3 (see issue opencor/opencor#1301). > @agarny Thoughts? Does the latest qscintilla release solve the problem properly? 😄
FWIW, QScintilla 2.8.10 does indeed solve the problem.  ### Details for the issue
The plot is done in such a way, that the variable selected as "X", is the one that forces the order of the connecting points, So take a look at this nice loop:

Because if not, given the definition of a relational query, the order doesn't matter, so it could be that the results would appear like this:
![wrong](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19350645/9a3e31b0-9126-11e6-923d-78c6308c47ec.png)

It's the exact same plot, but the order of the rows is switched.

@MKleusberg the first one works like charm (still, not user friendly, on excel you can select just a column of data and ask for plotting series).
The second one adds a row which is probably the original order of the data. The order by clause has to be somewhere else, I guess inside the parenthesis.
![not the same numbers](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19351507/1a84d7b8-912a-11e6-9f80-4fe9e163d546.PNG)
Since the row number and the rownum column are not the same, the result is not exactly what I was looking for.
Holly cow,
That is already KIND of implemented:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19521840/3498adce-95e3-11e6-97da-8006f8c659f9.png)
The interesting thing is that it retrieved a set of columns (that DO NOT appear on the results tab) from what looks like a previous query.
The query I was working on has nothing to do with that set of rows and columns, but clicking on that it added the _rowid_
If I go back to sql, ask for anything else, and click that gear sign again, it happens again, retrieves that magical data from IDontKnowWhere, with my beloved _rowid_ column
@MKleusberg Hey! no need to ask for pardon!! ;)
So, if you tell me the nightly you mention is here:
https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/
Yes, I'll give it a try.
Sadly though, I am using the DB Browser since I started around August to focus more on organizing the data I was generating for a project and analyzing it. This has been a temporary position and I will be unemployed at the end of November. I am sure I will be around sqlite db browser (I have read so many names, that I don't really know which is the last acronym you use 😆 )  in the near future...
I am sure this will be a great addition for more people to come!!
Since you didn't confirm that, I completely forgot to check again. Today I needed it, and tried on the nightlies how it works.
It is just what I asked, I think this thread can be closed!
I hope other people find it useful as well!!
Thanks, thanks!!
Hey @MKleusberg !
I have to say that I found other issues with that nighlty build. For example that between queries that had as an output the same columns, it did not remember the ones that were being plotted.
Before I had column1 as X and column2 as Y and after running a new query the graph got updated. With the nightly I had to select the columns to be plotted again.
Also I remember (it's been a month without playing with it), a significant decrease in performance when selecting the columns to plot. I don't know if that was a consequence of the feature I wished it had, or by some other addition..
And those where PV loops. Pressure-Volume loops of the left ventricle of a simulation of a human heart!
90% of what I was plotting were Pressure vs Time or Pressure vs Volume of all different heart chambers; the most iconic being the left ventricle.
Best regards and merry xmas!  ### Details for the issue
In the latest version (3.9.1) for Mac, the font on the SQL Editor is very small and I can't see a way to change it.
I have a very large monitor, but it isn't a HiDPI display. On the built-in retina display, the font is more readable, but still tiny.

Well, I'm an idiot. I thought I went through all of the tabs. Shows me for reporting yesterday's issue today before trying again.
I think part of it was that I saw font settings on the data browser tab and tried them and then had my attention pulled away. Might be useful to group the font settings into one area/tab?
Unrelated, has anyone else had an issue with the data browser font and background color resetting to black on black when the app starts up?
It was on 9. I bumped it to 12. Part of me thinks it could do with 13 or 14 even, but the rest of me thinks I'm getting to old for my own good if I need that big a font.
I tried it on a retina panel and a Dell Ultra-Wide (non-HiDPI) and both were small at 9px (same approximate physical size, actually). It may be @MKleusberg has the zoom setting on 125% (seems like that's the default on Windows 7 and above) or 150%? That would low 8px up to 12-15-ish.
Hi, am not sure if this is the correct thread (if not, I am sorry please let me know where to post this) but "Command" + "-" decreased the font size and I was looking for a way to increase it when I stumbled across this issue.
Wanted to ask if there is a similar command to increase the font size as well?
@justinclift Yes, I meant for DB Browser for SQLite. I have just started using it for a project and was playing around when i accidently pressed this combo.
And yes, I have tried  ⌘ + + to increase font size, but it doesn't work.
@justinclift I did go through the thread and figured that out from an earlier comment of yours. Thanks a lot for posting it again though :)
I was just wondering since there appeared to be a shortcut to decrease font size (in the Execute SQL tab), was there anything similar to increase font size as well.
Hmm.
The code has been changed, but default value is still 9 when I run the program, version 3.9.1.
Could there be some error in build system, not setting Q_OS_MAC correctly? (Or is this simply not yet in version 3.9.1)
(Code is in Settings.cpp, line 200 and forward).
```
// editor/fontsize or log/fontsize?
if((group == "editor" || group == "log") && name == "fontsize")
// Use 12 pt size as the default on OSX
return 12;
#else
return 9;
#endif
``` Hi Justin.
New user, new to github (history 20 years ago as programmer). Learning how to do things.
No hard feelings.
And not to abrupt.
I should have done a better search.
Hoping I can contribute a bit in the future, right now only checking how to do things.
Best wishes

Hi,
I don't want to be picky, collaborators of this repo do a great job and I'm very thankful to you.
I just realized that sqlite browser is slower than it should when opening big tables. like 150k rows vs 45 columns (cells with small/medium text size). It seems that the program tries to load the entire table before visualization. Wouldn't be better, if possible, to load just the rows that are contained in the current view?
Anyway, just a suggestion :) if I can help with anything just ask.
Thanks!
@chrisjlocke In some tables I might have, but in others I don't have for sure and it still take ~1 or 2 min to open the table.
By the way, my cpu is the i5-6300HQ 2.3GHz.
@justinclift No, even with 1 it takes a lot of time to load :(
Off-topic: @justinclift was that image generated by software or did you manually write the text and draw the boxes? Just curious.
Thanks, @justinclift.
@revolter I can't send the database since it has confidential data. As soon as I have some minutes I'll create and post a similar dummy database so you can see the problem. Thanks!
### Details for the issue
First of all, I want to apologize if I am doing anything wrong. This is my FIRST ever ticket on Github.
When I select one column for x axis, and start selecting columns for the y axis, the automatic chosen colors seem to appear at total randomness:
![order of colors](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19245271/21402e1a-8eee-11e6-8be2-61fb9689faad.PNG)
I selected them in order, one after the other with no other actions in between. This is constantly happening. I think a predefined set of colors should be used, and colors with easy differentiation. Like excel does, it starts with blue, goes to red, and so on. Always.
Next thing about the colors. Please, remove the yellow from the automatically selected colors:
![yellow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19245452/313640a6-8eef-11e6-9577-583e426c875e.png)
here it is "easy" to see because there's a lot of fluctuation, but take a look at the beginning of the graph, there's no contrast with yellow on white.

Thanks for the warm welcome Chris :)
I am aware that I can change the colors (is the first thing I do when the program chooses yellow!).
For the kind of purpose I am using it, I don't save projects. But for your comment it looks like it would help me not to lose my SQL queries, since until now what I do is save a couple of "key" queries, and load and modify them every time. I had no idea that feature existed. Thanks for the info!
I would love to participate in improving the graphing capabilities, since I already have several things in mind that would ease out a lot my workflow. But I don't want to stress the team with tickets.
I think I found the "line":
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/MainWindow.cpp#L1984
```
QColor color = !curbkcolor.isValid() ? (Qt::GlobalColor)(qrand() % 13 + 5) : curbkcolor;
```
Wow, you are all going fast!
@MKleusberg thanks for your nice comments.
I will open then a couple of suggestions!
well, I don't want to sound rude or ungrateful, but I am sure we can come up with a sequence of colors that is better distinguishable from one another. One question is, in which order did you pick pick columns? The first three are very similar, and going to the center, the difference between alternate colors is still very similar.
Let's face one thing, usually you will just need to plot two, three, four lines, so for me, apart from allowing that functionality, which from your message I understand that you have already done so 👍 , what is left is choosing these easily distinguishable colors. I am going to throw this out there, as a suggestion of a palette that gets the work done:
What do you think?
@revolter The last approach (golden ratio one) from the article you linked, really seems to work! right? Is that the code you used? If so maybe you where very unlucky with the randomness?
Not sure if I understand how this should work to correctly follow Mac-OS conventions.. I get the following behaviour from 3.9.1v2 on my Macbook Pro.
cmd backspace = deletes a word (i.e. anithing surrounded by whitespace)
alt backspace = deletes the whole line
if you first do cmd backspace (i.e. deleting words), the alt backspace changes behaviour to undoing the cmd backspace until all changes have been undone - then it deletes the full line.
I believe all of this is built in to the QT framework. My suggestion is to close this issue.
### Details for the issue
The program looks funny on my computer. I think it has something to do with the density of the Surface Book Display. And the program is not programed to respond to changing the density.

### This is when I logged on to windows before I docked my surface book.

Figure 1: This screenshot is taken on my 1080p monitor. Here the title bar that has the program's icon, title, and the minimize/expand/close buttons are really big.
![001042](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10580420/19256260/033b24ca-8f1a-11e6-8546-bb6c71798413.png)
Figure 2: This screenshot is taken after I dragged the above window over to my Surface Book. Here the font sizes are really small.
### Now I logged out and logged in WHILE the surface book was docked. This produces funny looking windows but sort of a reverse of what I saw before.
![001043](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10580420/19256350/0d543cb6-8f1b-11e6-915c-19b3aece04b9.png)
Figure 3: Taken on the 1080p monitor. This is the original screenshot that I put. Here the font size is too big.
![001044](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10580420/19256365/3129b5ee-8f1b-11e6-9c48-24d51b2b975f.png)
Figure 4: I dragged the above window over to the Surface Book. Here the font size is too big and it's cut off.
**I also want to emphasize this problem is specific to high density display laptops docked to regular 1080p monitors on Windows 10.**
Heh, this hack/workaround fixes the issue: https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=121272#p423989 I find that everything looks a bit small on my hi-dpi display, and there's only an option to change the size of the text in the table.  ### Details for the issue

Make table view's column widths persistent for each database so that when the database is closed and re-opened, the browser view displays table columns in the same width as they were before closing, instead of the default column widths.
### Useful extra information
<!-- The info below often helps, please fill it out if you're able to. :) -->
Maybe the widths can be stored in ~/sqlitebrowser.conf as part of recentFileList or additional entries for each recent file, containing the file name, table name, and a series of column widths. Only those with the column widths that have increased or decreased from default should be saved. There is no need to keep track of all databases, just the ones in the recent list.

@justinclift is this the standard way to do it? BUILDING.md is outdated then.
My bisection blames 54dbd62508791da4bbcbc8c5bac4c770a1cc9cd7 for it. However, that commit itself breaks the build because of something completely different (see below).

```
CMakeFiles/DB Browser for SQLite.dir/build.make:1652: *** missing separator.  Stop.
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:69: recipe for target 'CMakeFiles/DB Browser for SQLite.dir/all' failed
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/DB Browser for SQLite.dir/all] Error 2
Makefile:149: recipe for target 'all' failed
```
Judging by the Git diff, yes, it is done and will not need any changes. Maybe we should create an issue for it.
@justinclift Let me create an issue with as much information as I can provide later.
3 minor changes

### Details for the issue
2) "Modify Table" level;
3) every row in "Foreign Key" column will be `place`(`id`) instead only for `place_id` field.

@MKleusberg, after building on Qt5 (Qt 5.7.0) not reproduce anymore. Thank you.   As far as I have seen when translating these strings this should not be necessary.
Thank you~ =D
#389
Updated translation of the new Spanish terms for v3.9.1 and some coherence changes.
The [issue discussed previously](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/723#issuecomment-242979348) with a couple of translated terms that are shown untranslated seems to persist in the current  nightly build, but hopefully won't affect the v3.9.1 release this time either. :smile:
OK, can't hurt to check at least if the terms shown untranslated in the nightly build are translated in the release.
Made 4 minor corrections to the current terms and generated a new pull request, that if there are no more changes seems all good for the release.
Cool!
If for the master there are any changes, can also take a look at them. :smile:
### Details for the issue
When I import large CSV tables memory leak occurs. After import memory should be free. Eg. Now sqlitebrowser is using 10 GB RAM

+1 GB csv files. It occurs in single import. Aftert import success RAM is still in use. (10 GB+)
One of my CSV:
20 376 731 rows
17 columns
Also i can add that this bug occurs when all columns are as 'TEXT'.
When i first create table leak is much less. By create table i mean create it with better data formats for columns

Pretty much as the title says. I do not believe this occurred in the previous version. May not seem like a big thing, but when you copy value to paste them into a filter, or into another application you then have to edit the value to remove the quotes. Just really annoying, and so I think I would have remembered this if the previous version had the same functionality.

So far, all the values I have needed to try :(
Yeah, I have done that too, although TBH, I'm not sure which is the most irritating. Either way, it is something silly.
@justinclift apologies for being tardy on this. Yes, this issue was fixed.- current version 3.9.1   Seems good. Do you know what they use to generate the HTML?
### Details for the issue
1) the name was changed to “DB Browser for SQLite” (in 2014, I think) but the spaces (with cmake version 3.6.1) cause a “missing separator” problem when make is run.
2) After a local correction to 1), later.
sudo make install
failed because src/icons/DB_Browser_for_SQLite.png, distri/DB_Browser_for_SQLite.desktop and distri/DB_Browser_for_SQLite. .appdata.xml don't exist.
### Useful extra information
For me, the solution for 1) was to simply vi into CMakeLists.txt and
1,$s/DB Browser for QLite/DB_Browser_for_SQLite/g
For 2) there is a sqlitebrowser.\* for each of them – so I replaced them, after which the make install worked.

Well I should say thanks to you guys for the product.
Seems to work very well so far as I’ve used it.
It will participate in a significant demo next Friday!
Sure I can compile from source.
Maybe our cmake is old?  3.6.1…

I created a field as a autoincrement primary key but it doesn't show in indicies - why

Nightly builds for Windows link goes here...
http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/
... which only contains a build log text file entry.
Sure, or you can zip up the 64-bit Windows .exe and send it to me at darrel.christensen@tx.rr.com
I pulled down the nightly build and opened the db I created.
I have a table with a Primary Key and Indices still has (0) next to it.  :/
Right now it's a single table with 2 fields.  The first is the Primary Key and it's an Integer, the second is just a Text field.
Attached.
NOTE - as your product works with .db files it would be nice if your attachement technology supported that file type.
[miracap.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/491183/miracap.zip)
Fun fact: just changing the extension to any of the suggestions works too.

[miracap.pptx](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/491203/miracap.pptx)
But obviously actually zipping the files is a better practice.
Looking forward to a build with this corrected, can't see moving ahead creating my db if indicies aren't being handled correctly.
True, I'll make 'em by hand for now.
Keep me posted, and let me know if there's any other features/fixes you need tested and I'll be happy to help...
Yes they're optional, but when I tick a checkbox like "Primary Key" when creating a table where the operative word is KEY I usually get an index no matter the engine or front end I'm using - is hence my original posting.
### Details for the issue
Switching to the "Browse Data" tab resets the Table dropdown to the first item. It should remember the previously selected table (if any). I would say this is a bug - it seems to remember the row position when switching to the tab but not the table!

I have no experience with Qt. If this is known or expected, just close this issue. If I am the only one to see this, it may be an installation-specific bug. There seem to be no references to `QGradient` in the tree, so I am somewhat clueless as to what is this.
Just to let the little debugging I did in this time recorded somewhere:
If you let the cursor blinking in a state such as the following

What the heck. I followed those steps, and now opening works fine from command line, even without using the newly built `.app`. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
Thanks for the help!
Yeah, some configuration must have changed. In my older iterm session, I still get the same error as I initially posted. If I open a new session/tab in iterm, it works correctly.

The virtual table article_fts5_001 is created, but the fts support tables are not.
Also the virtual table cannot be dropped.

Thanks @justinclift and @chrisjlocke for the prompt response =)
@justinclift i found an old thread during the release of 3.8 (https://discuss.zetetic.net/t/db-browser-3-8-0-for-sqlite-sqlcipher-released/969). Could it would be possible to get the developers at zetetic to compile the updated SQLCipher with the new SQLite extension for FTS5?
Thanks for sharing the instructions!
I will try to see what I can come up with.
Once again, thanks for sharing :smile:
Has there been any progress on this? Can I help in any way? Would really like to be able to try out FTS5 using DB Browser. Thanks.  ### Details for the issue
The label "SQLCipher-Version 3.11.0" actually says "SQLCiper-Version 3.11.0" so there is a missing "h" in "Cipher".
Just a very minor issue but I noticed it so I report it :)

Yes, it's fine now. Thank you.
Here is the solution:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33728905/qt-creator-project-error-xcode-not-set-up-properly-you-may-need-to-confirm-t
@justinclift
I followed the steps then Qt Creator can create & compile GUI project on OSX 10.11.6 and Qt5.7.0.
> = Xcode 8
In Xcode 8, as Bruce said, this happens when Qt tries to find xcrun when it should be looking for xcodebuild.
Step 1:
Open the file:
Qt_install_folder/5.7/clang_64/mkspecs/features/mac/default_pre.prf
Step 2:
Replace:
isEmpty($$list($$system("/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcrun 2>/dev/null"))))
With:
isEmpty($$list($$system("/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcodebuild 2>/dev/null")))
@justinclift That steps only makes Qt5.7.0 works with XCode8 on helloworld like applications, QScintilla still cannot compile. I got errors like:
```
/Users/joshua/programs/Qt5.7.0/5.7/clang_64/lib/QtCore.framework/Headers/qbasicatomic.h:61:4: error:

Thanks!!!
Yes, it got me all the way to the Octave GUI built under 10.12 with Xcode 8 and Qt 5.6.1 and 5.7.0 (with relevant Qt patches too).
Nope, I've not poked qscintilla2 upstream yet with my patch. I'm easily confused when upstreams aren't on GitHub :smiling_imp:
The "revelation" was that all Qt5 reverse dependencies seemed fine except for qscintilla2 so it was actually a C++ issue not a Qt5 issue at all.
It's most assuredly an Xcode 8 issue (happens on 10.11 and 10.12 with Xcode 8), but it's not a Qt5 issue other than incidentally.
It would be good to verify the patch doesn't break anything that was working on <= Xcode 7 x <= 10.11, so that we know whether it has to be constrained in any way, but ultimately that's qscintilla2's burden to bear. (e.g., does the patch break Yosemite + Xcode 6 or 7, etc.)
You're welcome :)
@justinclift that would be awesome. There's little I like less than "reporting upstream"
In case this helps: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15583604/implicit-instantiation-of-undefined-template
I think someone may keep it printed out in binders under their mattress.
@justinclift Thank you so much :bowing_man: You're great :)
This patch builds ok but cause a serious bug of QScintilla.
Make `QPointer<QsciLexer> lex;` global instead of QsciScintilla's memeber would make lexer be singleton.
If you build an Application with multi-docs, different doc need to have different lexers (for different languages/apis/calltips), not share a global one. So lexer should always be a member of QsciScintilla's.
I made some changes based on this patch and it works fine without damage QScintilla's logic.
Here's the [LINK](https://github.com/joshua-meng/Lunar/commit/751e3f015ecbefe7fcb90f02092574711b6cec3d).
@joshua-meng please test @agarny's patch and see if it works for you equally well.
> Not sure which approach to go with.
@justinclift if both patches work equally well
```
24 additions and 0 deletions.
```
vs.
```
78 additions and 67 deletions
```
...
Surely it works, I reviewed @agarny 's patch and found it totally same solution as mine.
The only difference is I use std::unique_ptr to wrap the raw pointer of implementation struct.
Use `#define lex (lexerStruct->object)` is a good idea to avoid too much addtions/deletions.
@joshua-meng @agarny so whose patch are we recommending to upstream, assuming upstream is even remotely paying attention? :see_no_evil:
Anyway, Phil should already be aware of my patch since I posted a message on his mailing list (see https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/qscintilla/2016-October/001167.html).
I found this bug basically caused by `extern "C++"`, when we remove `extern "C++"` from QsciScintilla.h, and move `QPointer<QsciLexer>` to cpp (because in QsciLexer.h, there is still `extern "C++"`, so we should move it out of .h file), it compiles ok.
Then I tried to remove all `#ifdef __APPLE__ extern "C++" { #endif` and `#ifdef __APPLE__ } #endif`  from QScintilla project (which appears in nearly all header files), compiles ok. links the output libraries to my App, works well too.
The conclusion is: This is all `extern "C++"` caused problem, it may be useful in early versions of XCode, but XCode 8 does not need that. I think QScintilla would not adopt PIMP patch to fix this bug because actually that was a magic skill of C++ to hide things to implementaion, temporary solution which just jump over the problem, not a perfect solution. I suppose QScintilla may remove `extern "C++"` later for the newest XCode.
A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close bla bla bla ...
Version 3.9.0, Qt Version 5.7.0, SQLCipher Version 3.11.0
windows 10
when I click "Open Database"
I have seen the released 64 bit version crash at the "Open Database" on several machines at work. I had to revert these to the 32 bit version. It does not happen on all machines. Other 64 bit Qt applications on the same PCs work fine. The crash does happen on accounts without admin privileges.
I tried it a few days ago with a somewhat recent nightly (not exactly sure
of the date) and that failed the same way however the laptop is in the
field and I don't have current access to that.
John  ### Details for the issue
As of https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/7deeb02889e170752bba2aa9ed367fcdb9912cdf, DB4S fails to delete some indexes it creates.
### Useful extra information
If one was to create an index starting or ending with trimmable characters (such as an ASCII whitespace ` `), one would create an index which the browser cannot delete by itself.
This is the type of bug you find when you make typos (such as trailing whitespaces), but I don't think such behavior is acceptable anyway.

Executing
```
DROP INDEX `Index `; -- With the trailing whitespace

works as expected.
The right mindset to find failures. Similar attempts reveal problems in several non-mature terminal utilities. These problems, however, never happen to an end user until they happen, which may take a few years, or may never happen.
I was typing and your comment popped up. Damn. Will present a demo soon.
[How to reproduce the issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp_pzS7FD3c).
I like that Gnome makes these captures so easy (and working on multiple 1080p screens out of the box). Many examples are show, don't tell and these settle most issues.
@justinclift on it right now.
@justinclift it now (8be2c54f51f174e1bf9e728e41f28d5a95b2cdb4) works as expected.
Corrected capitalization inconsistencies.
Fixed missing spaces in the Portuguese translation.
---
As I said I was going to do, I improved the Portuguese translation to make it more consistent. Some minor spacing bugs were fixed too.
Although some of the terms come from a capitalized English word, they should not be capitalized in Portuguese due to how title case is normally handled in Portuguese.
Some abbreviations were expanded as they are clearer and more natural this way.
---
Unfortunately, after translating a string which I missed last time, something weird happens to the settings page.
![settings-bug-sqlitebrowser](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8271090/18414784/7ea11e3c-77ad-11e6-8303-7d68d8c6c6ab.png)
See the two `[]` "buttons" on the top right corner. Please tell me if they look any better in your desktop environment (it might be an issue with what I am running, not with the GUI itself).
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
Just fixed an important mistranslation. This is what happens when the translator does not use the translated interface.
> Should these updates be applied to the v3.9.x branch for that too?
I would say so. These do qualify as iterative improvements over the previous translation work.
> Sounds like further investigation is needed?
Yes. Could you help me test a hypothesis? If you could rename "Geral" to something much longer, such as "Very very very really really long string" so I could see what happens when the buttons get too wide for the dialog on your system, it would be great. This would help me decide whether this is a bug with the GUI settings or just a local issue I have to figure out myself.
Yes. I think it is something with my desktop environment then. Not a problem with the implementation here.
Thanks for your feedback.
Yes on my side. If I ever find something else that needs to change I will open another one.
@justinclift I've toggled on watching this repository. As updates to the translation are needed, please let me know. I don't use this so I have no interest into getting acquainted with the codebase, but the Linguist workflow is simple enough so that I will make myself available for it.
### Details for the issue
I am attempting to design a DB using foreign keys.  It has already been discussed that there are deficiencies if a column has a FK as well as a non-null, since you cannot add a row.  I thought I might be able to work around it, and discovered (I think) another bug.  I attempted to make my FK "DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED" (https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_deferred)
So my test schema is (create this DB using sqlite3):
```
CREATE TABLE one ( pk INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT );
INSERT INTO "one" VALUES(1,'test');
CREATE TABLE two( pk INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, fk INTEGER NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY( fk ) REFERENCES one(pk) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED );
```
After that, if you open the DB inside sqlitebrowser, turn on the foreign key pragma, click save, then enter a row in table "two" that violates the FK, not only does it not report an error, but the UI and the database get out of sync.  The UI shows the row entered, but if you quit sqlitebrowser and open the DB in sqlite3, it is clearly not there.

Arrg I don't know where the text I just typed went.  OK again,
I tried to work around the fact that sqlitebrowser doesn't work when you have a foreign key with NOT NULL.
Using sqlite3, create the following schema (note the DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED, see https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_deferred):
CREATE TABLE one ( pk INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT );
INSERT INTO "one" VALUES(1,'test');
CREATE TABLE two( pk INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, fk INTEGER NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY( fk ) REFERENCES one(pk) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED );
Then open that DB in sqlitebrowser, enable foreign keys pragma, click save.
Now, add a row to the "two" table that violates the FK.  Sqlitebrowser lets you add it, doesn't complain, and shows it added in the UI, but if you quit and look at the DB in sqlite3, it is (correctly) not there.
If you do this without the DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED, you just plain cannot add any data to the table (as discussed in #638).
Thanks Justin (re the missing text), I thought that might have been the case :) oops.
I just tried master, and it is slightly workable. It seems now new rows are inserted with 1 in the FK column, instead of 0.  That works, as long as I have a 1 in the column the FK refers to, which may or may not be the case :)
If the idea suggested in other tickets to have a manual BEGIN/COMMIT process was workable, and this bug regarding DEFERRABLE FKs was fixed, then I think that would achieve a desirable result.  Users could click BEGIN, add a row, doctor it to taste even if its initial state violates the FK, then find out if it is accepted when they hit COMMIT.
I totally understand though that such a (seemingly) simple task might be very disruptive under the hood.
IMHO that's better than silently letting the UI and the DB diverge.  If the user is using foreign keys, they should understand what "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed" implies.
Hey Martin, thanks for addressing it!  Closing.
### Details for the issue
When I open the application my mouse is frozen outside (in the margin) of the program. The mouse works correctly with every other application.
The mouse actually is working because buttons become selected and I can click on things but I do not see where it is aiming.
It's like the window doesn't get along with the pointer.
The rest appears to work correctly.

Hi @justinclift & @pchtsp. Do you guys need my help ?? Sorry it took me sometime to respond. I can look into the bug if still exist in 3.9 on debian. may be i will be able to figure it out if it is related to packaging or anything else. Thanks.
I already deployed packages for that (arm) on my ppa. But dont worry i will
create another ppa for just for testing this bug.
Hey! Thanks both for the quick answer and the help. I do feel comfortable
building from source. As soon as I plug my phone to an HDMI screen, I will
test building it.
I'll keep you informed. And thanks again!
F.
@justinclift @deepsidhu1313 .
Just tried compiling with ubuntu instructions. Worked. I have only checked that I can indeed see the mouse over the GUI and load a database I had.
The previous version was 3.8.5 so I guess it could be a good idea to update the repository.
thanks again!

### Details for the issue
Add support for Delphi FireDAC's SQLite encryption, if it's not too complicated :)
It uses aes-256 by default (and it alone will be enough), but supported ciphers are:
_aes-128, aes-192, aes-256, aes-ctr-128, aes-ctr-192, aes-ctr-256, aes-ecb-128, aes-ecb-192, aes-ecb-256_
> The encrypted database format is not compatible with other similar SQLite encryption extensions. This means that you cannot use an encrypted database, encrypted with non-FireDAC libraries. If you need to do this, then you have to decrypt a database with an original tool and encrypt it with FireDAC.
>
> The encryption is provided through the officially supported SQLite approach - custom codec code and compilation with SQLITE_HAS_CODEC defined. All encryption routines are implemented on Delphi and embedded into the sqlite3 code.

Look at that source file I uploaded, there are sqlite3_\* functions with cdecl calling convention that are defined in obj file, inside the file there are mentions of sqlite3.c and CodeGear C++ 7.20 compiler.
Maybe it's possible to just convert it to dll?)
[sqlite3_x64.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/455907/sqlite3_x64.zip)
...or make a DLL out of it, somehow :)
You mean in C++?) No, I can only provide libs, and maybe create a DLL, but it wouldn't be any different, if the above obj can be linked already.
### Details for the issue
This is more a feature request/suggestion and is specific to .NET
If you define a column as 'DATETIME', the ("official") .NET DB provider objects can be configured to return actual .NET DateTime Types via SQLiteDataAdapter and SQLiteDataReader.
The "issue" is that DB Browser tends to ignore/discard "DateTime" and use INTEGER (or sometimes the last legal base type selected).  The only way is to use a CREATE TABLE statement in a SQL window.  Once the table is created, 'DateTime' shows in the column type list but **only** for those columns already defined that way.
This would likely be confusing for other platforms, so it might be useful to display 'NetDate` or similar to the user but use 'DateTime' in the CREATE statement.  Another option would be to enable it via a Preference.

The NET Provider is fully capable of creating/returning NET DateTime variables/DataTable columns.  **In spite of** DATETIME not being listed, it can be used in the table definition and the official NET provider will use it to do so.
It is a DB Browser issue because it wont allow/use DATETIME when creating a table.
![sqlitedates](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12514284/18286901/70ac8a1c-743a-11e6-82ea-7f7e20d4d538.gif)
(its a bit snappier run locally)
It relates to when defining a table.  The first part shows how even when I type in `DATETIME` it uses whatever - something from the dropdown list.  The second part shows how it acts with a table which was created in a SQL window.
I _believe_ "DATETIME" acts like meta-data for the NET Provider.  The actual data format for dates is defined by connection string options.  The default stores an ISO8601 string.  The NET Provider sees "DATETIME" and returns DateTime objects - **only if that column is defined as DATETIME**.
The NET provider knows to store date data  to an appropriate string which it will be able to parse **back** into a DATETIME type.
The official DB Provider only does this for columns defined as DateTime **and** data which matches the DateTimeFormat setting in the connection string. Add this '...;DateTimeFormat=Ticks;...' to the connection string and the Provider will automatically save the ticks value for DateTime vars (thus saving the data integer/Int64).  Ticks also convert back to DateTime types (variables, datatable columns etc) provided the column is defined as DATETIME (ticks is less useful because it cannot distinguish UTC from local).
About Type Affinity
From that page: "_The type affinity of a column is the **recommended** type for data stored in that column.  The important idea here is that the type is recommended, not required. Any column can still store any type of data._"   Without check constraints anything goes.  In the case of DATETIME, as I said, I think the Provider is doing all the magic based on the column info and the connection string option.
As I said in the original posting, this is probably something that only .NET devs would want/need (no one seems to know that it works). Other platforms may well choke on it, so it might be something that is enabled as an option.
I have a working demo and decent explanation, but I cannot find a recent, applicable StackOverflow post to attach it to.
Hope this helps
I think using something from the list is generally a good idea, since the list is complete except for this one (?) case.   There might be other types allowed - who knows,  I cant find this latent ability documented anywhere.
Since other platforms might choke on it, is the reason I suggested an option.  When _Enable NET DateTime_ is on, add DateTime and Date to the list (I am not sure it actually treats Date differently).
Here is a reason this could be very valuable:  if you execute a CREATE TABLE statement from your NET app, Type Affinity apparently kicks in and also changes **DATETIME** to **TEXT**.  That means for NET devs they **need some sort of tool** like this to create tables that support DATETIME types.  The Execute SQL tab works perfectly.
It is also probably why so few know the capability exists.
I had an error in the SQL - they do get created correctly from code
I'm using the latest version of sqlitebroswer (3.9.0) on OSX 10.11. I need to run a query that uses FTS to do a full text search on one of my tables. However, when I actually run the query I get the error: "no such module: fts4". Does the version of sqlite that comes with sqlite browser  #not include fts3/4 support? If not, is there some way to add it, or to at least point the program to the sqlite version I have installed on my machine?
I'll give that a try. Thanks so much.
Hmmm... No luck. I opened the newly built app file, pasted in my query, and tried again and I got the exact same error message. If it helps, I think the issue is actually coming from the virtual table that the query is running against. The create statement looks like:
`CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ZSKUINDEX USING fts4(content="ZSKU",ZOPTICS_MATERIAL_TYPE,ZOPTICS_GENDER,ZBRAND_ID)`
I'll try it and see.
I suspect that solution is not going to work now that I think about it. The virtual tables are being created by an iOS app and I'm pretty sure the version of sqlite that xcode uses does not support fts5 yet. Is there a way to build sqlcipher with fts4 instead of fts5?
It does indeed work. Thanks again for all your help.
I have a database of size 90 MB. SQLite browser doesn't seem to handle it too well. It has a huge lag while browsing or updating the db.
It is a local database. I have just one table with 260 rows.
My table create statement is as follows:
```
CREATE TABLE "slides" (
`slide_no` INTEGER NOT NULL,
`slide_type` INTEGER NOT NULL,
`text_size` INTEGER NOT NULL,
`heading` TEXT,
`sub_heading` TEXT,
`img` BLOB,
`string1` TEXT, `string2` TEXT, `string3` TEXT, `string4` TEXT, `string5` TEXT,
`read` INTEGER,
PRIMARY KEY(slide_no) );
```
All the fields are small (less than hundred characters) except `img` (of type `blob` with approximately 33000 characters in every row) and `string1` (of type `text` with approximately a 1000 characters in every row)
By 'updating the db' I meant, adding new rows to the db or editing existing rows in the db.
When I open SQLite Browser and open the 'Browse Data' tab from any other tab, UI freezes and it takes about 5 seconds to load. Once it loads, when I try to scroll (up/down or left/right), it lags, UI freezes for about 4-5 seconds again (sometimes it even says 'Not responding' for a while). When I click on any field to edit it, it takes quite some time to get selected.
I'm using 3.9.0 on Windows 10. I've faced the lag since version 3.8.0. It was infact why I updated to 3.9.0 recently.
I shall try the latest nightly build soon and let you know!
I **must** mention that 3.9.0 has been significantly faster than 3.8.0! But still not fast enough
I emptied the `img` column in a copy of the database and browser got lightning fast!
I cant seem to figure out a suitable `WHERE` clause for the `img` attribute to empty only **some** of the records. Assistance please?
@innermous you can use @chrisjlocke's[ bloat1.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/453013/bloat1.zip) and [bloat2b.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/453013/bloat1b.zip) to reproduce it. I verified with those db's and it's the exact same problem as originally described.
1. bloat1 contantly takes about 173 MB of memory. Only the CPU usage raises from 0% initially upto about 20% (sometimes lesser) when I scroll (up/down or left/right) in the browser or if I click on a menu item (say File) or if I switch from another application to the browser. Took about 6 seconds to open the Browse Data tab once the db was opened in the browser.
2. bloat1b contantly takes about 340MB of memory. The CPU usage raises from 0% initially upto about 22 - 26% (sometimes lesser) on similar circumstances as above. Took about 12 seconds (twice as much as bloat1) to open the Browse Data tab.
3. my original db contantly takes about 75-80 MB of memory. The CPU usage goes upto about 23%. Took 3 seconds to open the Browse data tab.
One interesting thing that I noticed is that when the field with large text is not in the viewable area of the browser (when I resize the browser and scroll away from this field), the browser is fast and CPU usage is under 5%. When I scroll right towards the field with large text, that is when all the problems seem to occur. While scrolling right, it scrolls fast till the field is encountered and then hangs/freezes for a couple of seconds and then loads and completes the scroll. Once this field is in view, the problems are as described initially.

Hoping to get a nice new feature/capability.  Routinely when I am working on writing complex SQL queries, I use the 'Execute SQL' tab to refine them as I like being able to type and hit ctrl-enter to see the results.  Even better, doing so with a specific selection only executes that code making it a joy to use.
However, many times I have to routinely go back to the 'Browse Data' tab to check on some things, and every time I do, not only do I hate being switched away from my code (making a lot of tabbing back and forth) but on every return to the 'Browse Data' tab, it's reset and I have to go looking for what I was after all over again.
Now one solution would be to somehow persist the state of the Browse Data tabs, but from other bugs here, I see the coding pattern has been a dump-and-reload model, making that a non-trivial task.  BUT... if we could somehow float the SQL windows (and their results) into new windows, we could look at the data side-by-side with the SQL code.  Actually, being able to float multiple windows would be the best so I can look at several result sets all at once.
For instance, this would come in handy when I'm trying to see the results of a temp table and the results of a join on that temp table.  I'd like to select out the results, leave them on screen for reference, then execute other code against it.
As an alternate to floating windows, and for that matter, preferable to them, I'd actually love to see a truly tabbed interface, similar to how VS Code handles its tabs.  You can open groups of tabs, then split them horizontally or vertically as you see fit. If you could then save these as workspaces, perhaps with your open SQL statements in a metadata file alongside the open database, that would be epic!!
But heck... I'd even settle for simple side-by-side tiling of what's already there.  Point being, being able to see both your code, its results, and the Browse Data feature all at the same time is IMHO a sorely-needed feature.

@chrisjlocke, that's not really a feasible option as when you change the structure in one side, you can't tell the other to easily refresh.  That and two different instances would be two different transaction scopes too (i.e. where you have to commit or revert your changes with the buttons on the toolbar.)  In a perfect world, it would work like Visual Studio (or VS Code) where you can create tabs and do whatever you want in each... browse the schema, run SQL, whatever.  You could split them, stack them, group them... you decide.  Honestly, if it had that feature alone, I'd gladly pay $50+ for it just thinking of how productive it would make me.
Sounds like an excellent plan to get started.  One-each of the main windows is fine for now. That would solve my personal problem/desire to browse the data while editing SQL in another window.
Here's another thought... to keep things simple, pre-load the 'tabs' with the four main areas you have now.  Let us close them, move them, etc.  Then, have a 'New Tab' button that when you click it asks you do you want a new schema view, browse view, SQL view, etc.  A simple drop-down prompt under the button would work.  Point being if you design it so each 'tab' is its own thing, but which can post notifications that other tabs could listen to (i.e. for schema changes, etc.) then you'd have both a very easy interface for newcomers, and a powerful interface for pros.
This could also simplify what's already there.  For instance, currently in the SQL tab, it allows 'sub-tabs' if you will to open additional SQL windows.  That entire thing can be removed since if you want another SQL window, just open a new SQL tab.  Cleans up the interface even more.
Anyway, just ruminating on the designs.  I'd be happy to mock them up in Sketch/Photoshop to better show what I'm thinking if it would help.

After de-installing the former DBBowser, which did work well, I installed DBBrowser 3.9.0 and found that my database does not recognize DBBrowser anymore as it's default program to start with. I tried to associate *.db (extention I use for a long time) with DBBrowser, but 3.9.0 does not appear, even after browse and select, in the program list to open the files with.
Is there something wrong with the registry settings or so?
Now I have everytime to start DBBrowser, open a database, select my database and then I can work, while with the old version I only had to click the database file and it opened with DBBrowser.
This situation happened on 2 different PC's I work on: one with Windows-7 and the other with Windows-10. Same behavior.

Hi Justin,
I could assign the db to DBBrowser 3.9.0 now, all my db's do have the new icon now.
Thanks for your help.

### Details for the issue
Not really a bug, but a request.
In File -> Open Database, could you please add to the OpenDialog filter the
_**.sql_\* file extension, in addition to what you now have (*.db, *.sqlite, etc.)

Here's what I see. I'm hoping you can add *.sql to the four file
extensions you already have.
Hope this comes through
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13080152/18072084/1efaaeae-6e10-11e6-886e-977d28bf0973.png)
They are sqlite3 files. I don't like such a long file extension and have
been using just .sql for a few years. Thousands of file from all the
users of my app have been created.
http://www.bridgecaptain.com/downloadDD.html
I understand your reasons for not adding .sql to the list. Makes perfect
sense.
At the moment I just have one extra step - changing to the All Files (*)
view in the open dialog. I can live with that until #659 is up and
running.  I'll also consider use of the .db extension instead.

When loading a db with a custom page size, the dialog only allows a max value of 8092 (seams like a typo for 8192), yet a page size up to 65536 is valid.

I'm running 64bit Windows, but I'm in no rush. :)
I tried the build provided but I'm still not able to open the DB.
I suspect it's a different issue tho as the db I'm trying to open it's created using the c# wrapper System.Data.SQLite.dll from what I can see there is no password and the db contents don't look encrypted when opened in a hex editor. But I do know they exec "PRAGMA page_size = 32768;" which Is how I came to report this.
I can verify that it lets me set 32768 in the dialog tho.
Yes I'm a c++ developer, but I personally use the native sqlite code so the browser works just fine for my needs :smile:
I just decided to have a browse of a db created by a 3rd party tool that happens to use the c# wrapper, so unfortunately I don't feel like implementing support :disappointed:
A few more terms translated to Spanish.
No. `&oacute;` is the html entity for 'ó'. Fixing now with the utf-8 character that worked previously for other terms.
You are welcome. Glad to help. :)
Hi Justin! This was the same issue I described to you earlier.  As mentioned, while in QT4 you can see all the data, the paging controls are wonky there too (i.e. I don't know of _any_ version where they work correctly.)
[OddPagingInDbBrowser.mov.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/446295/OddPagingInDbBrowser.mov.zip)
Movie attached.  You can see that while only eight rows are shown (sizing changes this amount), it's still paging by up to 100 places, meaning if you want to see anything between 9 and 90, you can't use the paging controls.  Paging size should match the shown number of rows, always.
Yes, different than the QT5 issue of not seeing all the rows, which I did see as well. This issue exists in both QT4 and QT5 versions.
Just jumping in here with zero experience with this code, but reading the thread so far, could it be an issue of an internal window's frame not being properly constrained by the outer 'viewport' window (and by 'window' I mean control, whatever).  I've seen cases where people have tried implementing their own scrolling mechanism and the math has gotten mixed up between what you're seeing, what you're supposed to see, and what was actually going on behind the scenes, but was obscured visually.
Again, just a complete guess, but based on something similar I'd seen in the past, so again, check the actual bounds of the various windows/frames.
So is the fact that the other bug was closed also saying this one is now too?  If so, when are the next binaries going to be made available?
No, no rush. Just wondering! :)

### Details for the issue
DB4S has a default font that it is using for the "Browse Data" tab. You can see it in the next image.
![db4s_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8761081/18008694/6887ef3c-6ba9-11e6-87dc-b8876c7d2cff.jpg)
However, if you open the "Preference" window to change anything, or simply opened it and closed it without changing anything, it will change the default font and make it look like this..
![db4s_2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8761081/18008733/a15a8298-6ba9-11e6-91c7-92a5bbc72a9d.jpg)
This only happens if you click OK, whether you changed settings or not, but not if you click Cancel.
In both cases, there is no font selected in the "Preference" window. It is empty like this..
![db4s_3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8761081/18008945/71a00748-6baa-11e6-8ba2-c8531b220222.jpg)
To go back to the font I want in the first image, I have to edit the registry and delete `font` value from `HKCU\Software\sqlitebrowser\sqlitebrowser\databrowser` key, then restart DB4S.
What is the default font that is used in the first image? I think this will be fixed if I set it manually.

There is no .conf file. Everything is saved in Windows Registry.
@justinclift Let me know when you build it so I can test.
@justinclift Thanks. :+1: I saved the link and I will give it a try later.
Sorry for the delay, and.. yes, it works! :tada:
It is no longer blank and it is now set to "MS Shell Dlg 2".
Also, and like @justinclift said, we need to change the font for the "Execute SQL" tab too.
@justinclift I don't use the "Edit Database Cell", I edit fields directly which is very fast. I move around with the arrow keys and start typing on a highlighted field to edit. It is one of the things I like a lot about DB4S.
Thanks for making me a working build, and thanks to @innermous for making a quick fix.
@justinclift Yes, I see now that the font in "Execute SQL" tab has changed. It is much better now, like it used to be. This font doesn't change when you change `font` in "Preferences" window, right?
Ahhhh, yes. :smile: I see it now. It is like you said in the "SQL" tab in "Preferences".
I tested both (changing font in Data Browser tab and Execute SQL tab) and they are working very good. Thanks a lot for all your help. :+1:
Steps To Reproduce:
1) Open any database with one or more tables
2) Expand any table in the "Browse Data" view on the right
3) Change the tab from "Browse Data" to "Execute SQL " and back to "Browse Data"
Actual Results:
The selected table is reset to the first table in the DB.
Expected Results:
The selected table stays the same as before you changed tabs.

I cant start  the browser using this command "sqlitebrowser" in terminal, but I could start it with that command before update ?
It work when I type DB then hitting TAB and I did update using .tar file ,also I used the same file type for installation before the update...
This command does not work
`ln -s "/path/to/new/DB Browser for SQLite" "sqlitebrowser"
`
and by the way I saw some error message after "cmake ." command, should I share?

I think I have to get used to "DB" with TAB. :) You can close this issue if there is nothing to work with "sqlitebrowser" command. Thank you
### Details for the issue
I had hoped to be able to open files directly from outside of sqlitebrowser - e.g. from Windows Explorer, another file manager, or the command line.  For this to work, it would need sqlitebrowser to register for some file extensions: *.sqlite, and maybe others.
Is this something that you would expect to work?  If not, please can I request it as a feature?
Thanks

Just compiled it myself under Linux.
The described bug (DB Schema view resets on tab change) is fixed.
But there is now a new bug:
Now the reset happened when I clicked on "Cancel" in the "Modify Table" dialog.
This takes not only in the DB Schema view on the right place. Also in the main window.
I also think it is not the best practice to reset the hole schema. Why not just refresh the changed column? And not collapsing the hole schema.
I think this would increase the user experience and the performance a lot.
Verified fixed in [684958b](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/684958b29ce3d26684d9142d73df773b11189d54).
### Details for the issue
So I'm using Chrome's SessionBuddy extension and once in a while I export SavedSessions table out of the extension's DB to edit out some URL's (from The Great Suspender). And after that I import back the saved .CSV (it's edited on N++) into SQLite browser. It all worked great on 3.8.0. But now on the 3.9.0 version when I tried to export the table as .CSV, edited it, imported back and it is somehow corrupted or incorrectly saved, there are over 140 columns in the screenshot. But there should be 14.
As you can see in the 2nd screenshot which was taken now after I tried to do the same on 3.8.0 luckily I did backups of that DB.
This happened after I exported DB table out of the newest SQLite Browser version (3.9.0) and imported it back in.

This is how it looks when .CSV is exported and imported on version 3.8.0

It's private, but you can easily try this by yourself if you're using Chrome:
- It automatically creates a DB in this location when you save a session. `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\databases\chrome-extension_edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko_0`
- Open it with SQLite browser and try to export SavedSessions table (as .csv) and then import it back, it looks kind of messed up.
I think there's some bug with newest version's .csv saving system, some characters are not saved or something like that (I'm not an expert, it's just my guess) I compared both .csvs and there are some spaces missing in the newest version (in first line, after `filteredTabCount 13` 13 wasn't separated with a space) and probably somewhere else.
@justinclift Windows 10 Anniversary Update, 64-bit
@justinclift I just tried it and it works !!! Thanks. 👍
Could be considered an installation bug, especially for 'regular' user.
Windows 7 Ultimate SP 1
DB Browser for SQLite 3.9.0, 64-bit
There is no "uninstall" entry in Windows 7 "Programs and Features" Control Panel item. (There was one for v. 3.8.0.)
Workaround is to directly use the "Uninstall.exe" program in the installation folder (the one above the "bin" folder where the program's executable file is located).
![screenshot - 24-08-16 14_47_19](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/454810/17943541/d693f0d0-6a09-11e6-9cfe-8c1aea86270c.png)
Yep!  The program now shows up in the Uninstall list as expected.
Minor glitch when _uninstalling_ the program : It doesn't check if program is currently in use.  The uninstall goes through without any errors, but leaves the program executable and DLLs in place.
That's totally fine.  :-)
I found this, which seems to do both the checking and the aborting : http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Check_whether_your_application_is_running
Not sure if it's any help in your case though, I have no idea how NSIS works.
Not sure if this is related, but when modifying an existing table, adding a primary key to it, even after confirming that the data should support a primary key on the selected fields (i.e. no nulls and when running a group-by with a count on the fields, I never get anything but a '1') it just silently fails and doesn't add the key.  No warnings, no errors, nothing.  The dialog just gets dismissed and nothing actually happens.  Same thing when I tried marking those columns as 'not null'.
Since this is just a db of the public NJ Transit schedules (as imported from flat CSV files) I can send it along so you can try it yourself if interested.  (It's 20+ mb so I figured I'd ask first. If so, lemme know how you want me to send it to you.)
Definitely have both the time and the interest.  Again, your product is an integral part of me being able to create mine so anything I can do to help I do so gladly! :)  Just post the link here on where I need to go to get the daily to test and I'll let you know, just like I did with the black-on-black browsing issue.
Oh... and it's your just-released build... again, the one you linked to in the other question about preferences and colors.
> So should a line mean a text line or an SQL line (up until the first semi colon)?
Pretty much what was said above. Production SQLite code has many queries spanning multiple lines.
Tip: https://github.com/search?l=SQL&q=_id&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93 may give you a few examples to try.  Completed the missing translations and a few context and coherence adjusts.
@justinclift  Hope that in the release all looks good. :wink:
### Details for the issue
Yeah.. why not?
You can add the ability to open databases that are protected with RS of System.Data.SQLite (.Net Framework)
Then will be the best SQLite Browser in the world!

But System.Data.SQLite is not a part of Microsoft.. that come from SQLite DLLs
Yeah, that is what i mean :)
I mean.. whit this dll you can set a password to database, but you can only open it again whit the same dll.. not but other SQLite browser.. and.. in internet exists only 1 browser that can open encrypted database with this dlls, but is a very only software (2009), now is pretty bugged.
Hope you understand what i mean :)
No, the enrcryption use a personal security system, that is already writed in the System.Data.SQLite.
For set a password you can simply add this dll to a project and use a command:
Connection.SetPassword("MyPass");
I have read something online, and im sure that use not SEE (external plugin) but RSA (internal function).
Anyway.. i think (and is just my opinion).. i think that you will have good benefit if you add the ability to open database that are encrypted with System.Data.SQLite. Because there are many users that use this dll with .Net Framework, by programming in VB.Net; C#, F, etc.. and many of them will use this internal protection to encrypt thier database. I mean.. why use an external dll or plugin if you can protect your database with the same dll that you use for read/write it?
Example:
I made a "Database.db" with System.Data.SQLite.dll and i use it in my app, then i use also your browser for open my databse and watch what contains. But is i set a password to this database, i cannot open it anymore (with your browser).
I (and other users like me) must CREATE a new app that will use only for watch the content of the encrypted database.
Remember that just one browser can open database encrypted with System.Data.SQLite.dll (SQLite2009 Pro) but is not good as your browser :)
With this more function you will have more users.
My idea was to use the integrated protection, not another external dll. :)
Anyway.. i dont know what i must ask on this forum, so.. i think i will pass :)

My suspicion is this has to do with the new way macOS Sierra handles unsigned applications.  It stores them in a 'random, secure' portion on disk, not simply the application folder even though it _looks_ like that's where it is.  This is part of their new security.  My guess is this is the cause of the app not being able to find the preferences.
That said, even if the preference file isn't found, the defaults should not be black on black.  At least set them to black on white, possibly making nulls gray on white.
All of the above is also pure speculation and I could be completely wrong, but I am not seeing this behavior on earlier versions of OS X, including El Capitan, only macOS Sierra.

The good news is macOS Beta is now open to everyone, even without the developer network.  Even so, your product has greatly improved my development environment so I would be more than happy to help you with testing, signed or unsigned. Let me know. I don't mind installing out for test builds.
Feel free to reach out to me directly too.  234-248-6275 or Mark@MarkDonohoe.com
Hope I can help!
Mark
Yeah, just came out today I think.  I'm installing it on my machine too if you want another tester.
The DMG worked fine for me. As for the app, it worked after I disabled the security prompt.
Even so, there was another issue... if you say 'run it this time' from sys prefs security, it doesn't actually open but instead prompts you again. You have to completely disable the security, run the app, then reenable.
My guess is you're using a boot strap mech which would cause that as the boot strapped part runs, but then the main app gets blocked.  But that's purely a guess.
Again, disabling it temporarily solves the issue.
One thing though, signing, sierra and the rest aside, you should still change the defaults to black on white instead of black on black when prefs aren't found.  At least it's a temporary work-around rather than making a user have to change it every start as I do now.  Of course this goes away with signing, but still... it's a good practice regardless.

Crap! Missed this.  I'll test when I'm back on my machine in about an hour.
Just a quick update... both the beta 2 and nightly open fine here on my desktop running El Capitan.  No security prompts anymore so it's recognized as being signed.
I'm currently installing the latest beta (Sierra 7) on my notebook and will let you know what happens there.
FYI... 3.9.99, the nightly doesn't properly browse data.  It's not returning all records.  I'm seeing paging controls but they don't seem to work either.  Note, this is still on El Cap.
If it matters, this is a relatively small dataset.  It’s the NJ Transit train times.  Definitely not 100K+ records.  The largest table is 44K but most are < 5K
BTW, even in 3.9.00 and even 3.8 the paging controls seem to be doing odd things.  For instance, right now on my browse data tab, it says 1-11 of 229.  If I hit the ‘next page’ button (the right arrow without the line) it now says 91-101 of 229 (it jumped by 90) but if I press it a third time, it now says 191-201 (it jumped by 100).  I would think one would expect it to jump by 11 in all cases since that’s what’s shown, but if the intent was to always make it jump by 100, as stated, it’s not doing that either.  At least not for the first one.
No biggie as I just scroll anyway, but still...
HTH,
M
Just tried it.  While I can now browse all the data in the table, it still has that wonky paging behavior I spoke about earlier.
Oh... and the preferences issue is still there.  Here's what I see when I close, then reopen, then go right to browsing data...
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/897883/17920618/a07dcc70-69a3-11e6-95eb-6ef112923287.png)
re: the nulls... yes... definitely check for that and return the defaults as necessary.  I'm one to always code for any possible value that's compilable (that a word?)
To answer your question, this isn't a VM, it's the Mac version running right on the hardware.  However, I'm also running Win10 via Parallels 11.  I can check the Win version of the same build if you want to send it over. I also have an El Cap machine here too.  Lemme know if you want me to test on all of them, and if so, what version of the app.
As for setting up the dev environment myself, I'm stronger in C# and Swift and even Objective-C/C++ but am by no means an expert.  I've also never done QT development, although I have liked what I've seen with it. (I actually met the original owner of TrollTech way back before even Nokia bought it.) . Still, perhaps making a debug build where you log stuff to files, then I can send those over to you.  I'm also fine setting up a TeamViewer session where you can take control of my machine and experiment yourself.  Lemme know.
Also, just ran your 3.9.99 beta 3 (which appears to be signed) on Sierra beta 7 and still got the black cells.  I'm wondering if perhaps there's some bad preferences being held around.  Can you give me a list of all the locations you've written files and I'll nuke them all? (Do you have an uninstaller or script? That would be even better!)
Ha! Found the cause of the issue!
Using your above references to the prefs, I nuked them, and as I had hoped, the colors appeared as normal even after closing, then reopening the app.
However, as soon as I went and changed from the default colors to match my liking (for reference, I set nulls to 'Moss' and binary to 'Lavender', both under 'Crayons'), while they displayed correctly for that session, closing and opening the app went back to the black-on-black colors I was seeing.  Deleting the prefs again got things back to normal.  Setting the colors broke it again, etc.
Hope this helps!  More importantly, I hope it's a quick fix so I can finally use my custom preferences with your app. :)
Just chiming in.  Does this mean someone worked on a fix for the prefs here?  If so, lemme know and I can test it right now on El Cap 10.11.6. (I'm not set up to build tho so if someone can make a binary, that would be great.)
My guess is that it is a QT bug, preferences are now saved and retrieved correctly as far as I can see.
I have recompiled on my mac
- OS: Sierra (10.12.2)
- Qt Version 5.7.1
- SQLite Version 3.15.2
Recompilation from inside of QT Creator as I´m still stumbling around learning what to do.
/Gunnar Hellquist Absolutely.  I can test. /Gunnar Hi!
In my testing and loading and saving of preferences is correct - the dreaded black data fields are gone.
I have done a few checks here and there of other functions and they work (not in any way any exhaustive test).
Default size for SQL is still 9, but I guess that is by design (change in next release).
Glad to be of some help.
/Gunnar I can confirm that on my machine (Sierra 10.12.2) the black-on-black issue is solved in the new build (3.9.1v2). Preferences are handled correctly, application downloads, installs and work as expected as far as OS and preferences are concerned. This issue can as far as I see be closed. I downloaded 3.9.1v2 and had to remove my preferences file, found above, before the black background was resolved. I did't try changing the background preferences within the application to but that may have done it as well. The black background issue hasn't returned for me yet! Hi,
Sorry but the problem is still there for me whenever I try to modify preferences.
I am using Sierra (10.12.2) and DB4S from cask (3.9.1v2).
If I don't modify preferences I can restart DB4S and background colors remain correct.
Whenever I change a preference and restart DB4S the black-on-black issue is present.
Please find attached a working and bugged version of sqlitebrowser settings.
[sqlitebrowser.plist.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/701448/sqlitebrowser.plist.zip)
Am I missing anything?
Thanks for your help.
-Nicolas
@revolter Sorry, I forgot to mention that I did all my tests from a fresh setting file after having deleted the previous one. So deleting the setting file does not help in my case. @justinclift Ok, just found the bug, it's me! :-)
After uninstalling the cask version of DB4S to test a nightly build I realized that another old version (3.9.1) was still installed...
I uninstalled it and reinstall latest version using cask and everything works perfectly!
Sorry guys for the wrong alert, my bad.
And thanks again for the fix. I've been doing some testing using settings from nkahnfr's attached .plist but haven't been able to reproduce the issue. I did notice this part below that diffs from my preferences.
`<key>databrowser.reg_bg_colour</key>
<data><string>@Variant(</string>` Disregard my last comment, just saw @nkahnfr message  Korean Traslation for 3.9.0 release.
Thank you!, @justinclift  =D
wow ^-^/
oh... I'll edit strings and resend pull request soon~
your ui testing screenshot images are very usefull!!
Should be changed now.
@justinclift Here you go.
If I did anything wrong (haven't used Linguist in a while), just let me know.
> With MainWindow.ui, the strings tab for editing Pragmas are a mixture of English and Brazilian Portuguese. It looks kind of strange.
It is wrong. I've pushed another commit which should makes them all English. Some of these simply don't have a common PTBR translation (they would be written in English and italicized). Therefore, I think that it is best to leave them in English.
Sure. Although this seems like a cheap workaround a bigger problem. I will look into doing this later when I am home. Glad you found out the cause of the issue. If you posted a cropping of the English version I could reply while at University.
I asked about the image because due to the way verbs work in Portuguese, conjugation may be an issue. However, "Definir encriptação" is likely a good translation.
I will normalize some capitalization tonight.
Yes, the capitalization normalization may be done in the future (it is on my TODO list). As it seems more like an improvement than a correction, I will not rush it as I am already quite stressed out.
If I need to sign anything let me know. My translations are donated to the project as-is and may be released under the same license(s) as the rest of the code.
Hi Justin,
I finished it early this morning ;)
I'll have a look during this WE.
Do you have a dead line for a new release (4.0.00 ? - first picture,
from 3.9.99).
In that case I choose an infinitive verb e.g. Autoriser to avoid
Thanks for all these pictures. Very useful.
How to compile the program under Mint ?
Qt is OK but it is the 5.x release...
For the view with SQLCipher, is the hight of the window variable ?
I'll add some CR (or <br>, I don't have the file right now).
Hi Justin,
That looks good.
What's about ExportCSVDialog. It seems the list box (field separator) KO. Have
to replace Tabulation bu Tab. ?
: Arrêtée, Normale, Complète", if these texts are used here only.
I'll send you the file later...
Done.
I saw "Supprimer la table" I've changed to "Supprimer une table" to harmonize
with the others texts.
Have a good "end of day"... Tomorow; I've to work (again :) )
Hi Justin
Yes
Cool ;)
### Details for the issue
Reproduction (it should be reproducible w/o Python, but that's what I exactly did):
1. In Python (2.7, 32-bit):
```
import sqlite3 as db
dbcon = db.connect("base.db")
dbcur = dbcon.cursor()
dbcur.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS people")
dbcur.execute("""
CREATE TABLE `people` (
`id` INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
`name` TEXT NOT NULL,
`member` INTEGER DEFAULT 0
)""")
dbcur.execute("""
INSERT INTO people VALUES (NULL, 'John Appleseed', 0)
""")
dbcon.commit()
```
\2. Open `base.db` in SQLiteBrowser
\3. Switch to "Browse Data" tab
```
...
dbcur.execute("""
CREATE TABLE `people` (
`id` INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
`name` TEXT NOT NULL,
`rank` INTEGER,
`member` INTEGER DEFAULT 0
)""")
dbcur.execute("""
INSERT INTO people VALUES (NULL, 'John Appleseed', 100, 0)
""")
...
```
\5. Hit refresh button in "Browse Data"
Result: Table "people" has 3 attributes, and John's membership flag is "100"
Expected: Table "people" has 4 attributes, and John's rank is "100"

I'm using 64-bit build in Windows 10. BTW, the thing gets refreshed if I switch to the "Database Structure" tab and back (so it seems that data are queried but schema is not). I'm on to check the nightly build.
Behaviour as expected in 3.9.99. :) Over and out, waiting for the release (Thanks for this tool a lot!).
I've tried to be as military as I could (y'know witch their "positive" and "affirmative"), haha. It's not present, the table has 4 columns.

There you go, Justin. Have checked the new translations and didn't find any obvious error, but may need to see the compiled result to be sure. :)
Thanks @justinclift for reviewing it and showing the screenshots, have been very helpful!
You are correct about these errors. Have fixed them:
- ../ImportCsvDialog.ui" line="230" removed spurious & that you found.
- ../PreferencesDialog.ui" line="637" corrected the bad capitalization that you found.
Also fixed:
- ../EditDialog.cpp line="460" swapped the parameter %1 order to the correct one.
- ../EditDialog.cpp line="480" removed spurious parameter %1.
- ../MainWindow.ui" line="1782" changed translation to be consistent.
but can't locate where that broken dialog is in the .ts file.
Thanks, not me. I'm not seeking any credit but appreciate the offer very much.
Have updated the Spanish translation to fix some incoherences, hopefully all of them. Will be glad to review it before the new version is released to check for any new changes if needed.
Have not been able to find where to fix these shown in the screenshots:
Found these untranslated tooltips but can't locate where are the sources to translate them:
Are the **Delete Table**, **Delete View** and **Delete Trigger** tooltips configured independently? Seems that all show the same tooltip set for Delete Table. Don't know if it's meant to be this way.
Cool! Good luck @justinclift with the certificates. Looking forward for it.
Guess that I wil need to generate a new pull request when these fixes are completed (and then translated)?
Hmmm. Ok, I'll be sure of that, think that then I better start a new clone because the github webgui is a pain in the neck to sync branches and don't know how to rebase it.
@justinclift I'll be glad to provide the Spanish translations for 3.9.0 as soon as needed if there is some hurry to release.
Now it shouldn't take me more than 10 minutes once the new .ts are ready if you let me know. I will just fork the new v3.9.x branch, update and generate the pull request including these.
If the other translations are also complete and the release won't get delayed updating them then why not fix all them? On the other hand, a cosmetic fix like this for just one translation probably won't justify much a long delay if new features are available with this release.
About the "Close Tab", if can't be found in the sources then may be is a Qt tooltip? There are also some other untranslated "Cancel" buttons (i.e. in the import/export dialogs) that seems to be the case.
I'm not sure to be prepared to deal with the responsability of translating the Qt5 widgets being such a high impact project and not being a heavy user to understand the exact right context for them. :fearful:
I'll take a look at the 644 unfinished terms of Qt4 to see if are straightforward to translate but not sure if it's going to be a bit of wasted work to translate an old version.
Anyway seems that sqlitebrowser is very minimally affected by them to justify compiling Qt5. :wink:
Cool! Looking forward to it.
Just issued a pull request completing the missing translations. :smile:
Let me check this weekend the ts source files for how many lines actually need to be translated for Qt5.
Seems that a lot since all but qt_es.ts are missing their Spanish translation. It may take me weeks and a few iterations to complete these, and I'm not sure what I'm getting into.
Have been checking those Qt links, the documentation and all the Spanish .ts files.
Seems that most of the current translations are already imported from the old Qt4 version but tagged "unfinished" even if also half of them are new terms still untranslated.
So for Qt5 is more about first enabling each term than translating them. And that would requiere to be able to verify the proper context uses for each one. It's difficult to be sure otherwise and will be more work later to fix.
Not developing with Qt to see the results and getting feedback unfortunately I'll be unable to do that. :(
@justinclift for some reason there are a couple of already translated terms that previouly were displayed correctly in the Nightly builds that in Nightly build 20160828_0218 are untranslated as shown in the capture below. Have checked both v3.9.x and master branches and seems to be correctly translated though.
Don't know if that affected the v3.9.0 release as I couldn't check it.
![nightly build 3 9 99_20160828_0218](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14217781/18034525/7ff2ef40-6d3f-11e6-8da9-9cce3590a329.png)
Awesome! I'm glad that all went well with the release! :smile:
Have translated the unfinished terms from the master branch but only could find 4 of them.
Does it worth to make a pull request now for such a minimal update or better wait for something more substantial?
Done. :smile:
Hmm. It failed. Seems that didn't like the &oacute; html entity in the html text. Using utf-8 directly that worked for other terms.
@justinclift ImportCsvDialog.ui in my system:
![screenshot from 2016-08-10 184559](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1304776/17560727/c5341862-5f2b-11e6-8e43-18218eece98e.png)
Do you mean empty preview at bottom of dialog?
@justinclift, I think that's because Export CSV dialog allows to export data with empty "Other" line separator value.
Hello.
In "Browse Data" tab, for FK's with 0 index not work:
- tooltip with text "References %1 (%2)...";
- Ctrl + Shift + Left Mouse Click.
Possible solution sqlitetablemodel.cpp, 261
```
if (column >= 0 && column < obj.table.fields().count())
```
instead
```
if (column > 0 && column < obj.table.fields().count())
```
@justinclift,
1) import tables from .sql file: [kuban.db.sql.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/411587/kuban.db.sql.zip)
2) open Browse Data tab and select level table;
3) column place_id - it's Foreing Key to place(id) key;
4) try to jump to place table using Ctrl + shift+Click or try to wait tooltip with "References %1(%2).." text - none of this happens.
@MKleusberg, @justinclift seems to be working as expected. Sorry for late reply.
### Details for the issue
as topic says. My procedure:
- opening the database
- fireing an sql-statement updating the table
- browsing the table
- leaving the database without saving
Unfortunately DB4S is changing the writedate of the db file, despite saying "don't save".
I could understand if it is changing the accessdate, and leaving creationdate and writedate untouched.
Regards

> Does any of the above help?
Yes and No. You know, just peeking into the file, doing some SQL and leaving without saving is expected to leave the database timestamp unchanged - but is does not. Thus the timestamp of the file couldn't be used as an original information anymore. That's sad. I can remember that EXCEL has some issues here too.
If you exactly know of the programs behaviour you can workaround as you wrote. But I'm human and I won't take into account each and every programs oddities to do workarounds - I just wanne go ahead with reasonable thinking.
Well, if I cannot argue the developers to alter the behaviour I have to live with it or ... using the workaround.
So, thanks for the workaround ;-)
if there is no chance of a quick fix of the program - as of saving timestamps and reset them at closing the database without being saved - well, than we can close this issue.
Surely it is not the biggest point out here.
I thought it could be bad for other reasons.
So I'm fine with the workaround, at least for now ;-)
### Details for the issue
Database file that start with "." (hidden by default on OSX) are not selectable by the file picker when you click "Open Database". The following screenshot shows the open dialogue side-by-side with the same window in the finder. You see there are several hidden files that don't appear in the sqlitebrowser window.

Version 3.8.0
Qt Version 4.8.7
SQLite Version 3.9.2
### Useful extra information
The workaround is to rename the file, but this is a hassle and gets even more inconvenient when dealing with frameworks that expect the file to have a specific name.

Thanks for the shortcut tip. I'll use that in the mean time. Fwiw I already have hidden files visible by default. That's why you can see them in the finder in my screenshot. But that doesn't seem to apply to dialogues so the second of the two solutions does not actually apply to this issue. It's counterintuitive that turning on hidden files all the time DOESNT make them visible in dialogues as well.

I think we can leave the flag as it is for now.
On version 3.8.0, OSX 10.11.6
In preferences -> database, manually entering a value into the "Prefetch block size" input does not work.  The only way to get a value to stay is to hold down the arrow key, which takes a very long time.
It is also possible to manipulate it with the keyboard via page up, page down, etc, but it is still slower than manually entering the desired value.
Thanks for a great project!
Hi @revolter thanks for the tip!  It seems to be working in the latest nightly.  In the last release I was finally able to get it working after checking and unchecking foreign keys.  I suspect it was just gui-related. Thanks!
Fixes #696
A comment is needed, but I don't know really why is the problem happening and why it got solved by multiplying the input height!
I tried but some miss-positioning issues happened here on Fusion, Windows and Breeze themes (Linux).
If someone can try that on Linux, it would be great.
Hello,
I've been using DB Browser since May and I'm loving it.
It's too easy to create, import data and manipulate data directly.
I use the CSV export a lot and it works very well for me. But sometimes I need sqlite records to be available in a JSON, as they are as CSV. So, I have to export to CSV than convert manually to JSON.
Certainly I can create a script to access database and export do JSON, but why not have this as a system feature.
Suggestion:
Implement by default a JSON export as CSV and SQL
Offer a dialog box for choose where to save and a checkbox to be the export pretty print or not.
Best regards,
@justinclift Why not? For sure. I'll take a look this afternoon. The crash bug happens in a specific OS?
I'll love to have this feature!
@justinclift Right guess I was looking for something Mac-related on the wik homepage, there's good stuff in the building.md though that maybe could be extrapolated to a new article if it's current? The Mac section mentions an issue with 10.9 and was last updated in 2014 so may need a refresh.
@justinclift Cool, knowing how much Apple loves breaking things I just assumed 🔥
Yes that makes sense!
Link for reference: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Notes-for-setting-up-your-build-environment-on-OSX
The filter input row isn't mirrored in RTL locales.
That is because Qt draws from left to right, and the painting wasn't recognizing RTL locales.
This fix does change the position of the inputs to be drawn from right to left (Using `width() - ..`).
According to Qt documentation:
> The position is measured in pixels from the first visible item's top-left corner to the top-left corner of the item with logicalIndex.
For that the size of the column is added to the postion so that it's measured from the top-right corner to the top-right corner.
Fixes #631

> If we remove the & signs from all of our strings
Accelerators are triggered by `Alt+E` not `Ctrl+E`. They are different than shortcuts :)
What you need is `QKeySequenceEdit`. That will make it easier to check weather the shortcut is used or not (Signals/Slots..). You can get it from designer and see how it works :)
It would be great to be able to run SQL that uses functions from the [JSON extension](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html).
Ahh, had not noticed that pref pane. I imagine that would work but haven't compiled one of them before (on macOS 10.11 and will accept hints!)
I noticed in another issue that you're on a Mac as well? Some Mac dev docs would be great. Maybe I should open another issue? 😃
Absolutely! Their (sqlite) extension docs seemed pretty sparse and I wasn't sure where to start. Thanks @justinclift @revolter
The JSON1 functions (https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html) will be available in this nightly build?
@justinclift Looks good so far:
```
SELECT json_object('ex','[52,3.14159]'),
json_array(1,2,'3',4),
json_array_length('[1,2,3,4]'),
json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$'),
json_insert('{"a":2,"c":4}', '$.a', 99),
json_replace('{"a":2,"c":4}', '$.a', 99),
json_object('a',2,'c',json_object('e',5)),
json_remove('[0,1,2,3,4]','$[2]'),
json_type('{"a":[2,3.5,true,false,null,"x"]}'),
json_valid('{"x":35}')
```
outputs
` {"ex":"[52,3.14159]"} , [1,2,"3",4] ,4, {"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]} , {"a":2,"c":4} , {"a":99,"c":4} , {"a":2,"c":{"e":5}} , [0,1,3,4] ,object,1`
Thanks, hopefully flipping on support for other platforms isn't too hard!
Appreciate it @justinclift - people will probably want a JSON browser too, heh... One step at a time :wink:
Is any plans to release with the JSON1 enabled by default?
(json1 is a core extension - sqlite should be recompiled with the json1 extension enabled.) It's very easy to to add JSON1 support to sqlitebrowser. Only "-DSQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1=1" is required when building sqlite.  @justinclift, apologies for not replying back. Thanks for fixing the issue. :)
Qt expects a RTL text, so it sets the text direction to RTL.
An easy fix is to add a "LRM" character to the end of the string, it acts as an English letter and would move the bracket to the right :)
Or forcing the combobox direction not to mirror by using `setLayoutDirection`.
That's not what I'm seeing here. While the selection direction is not right (I'll report that upstream), the items direction is correct:
![screenshot_ _](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3509617/17248915/1a144fda-55a6-11e6-87aa-0aa39be1f15f.png)
_I'm building the app right now and would update this when done._
ArchLinux 64bit, Qt 5.7.
I think you would take some time to finish installing Arch :sweat_smile:
_Done!_
![screenshot_ _](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3509617/17249149/38b2fd46-55a7-11e6-9a8e-2845e876ebc8.png)
So it's exactly as in the designer. I think another bug report should be filed ASAP!

Have a nice meal :)
> For "I think another bug report should be filed ASAP!" are you meaning for us, or for Qt? If for Qt... um... are you ok to do it? I probably wouldn't even describe the issue clearly enough for them to fix it.
[This](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/667#issuecomment-236175247):

It is already reported, and I just updated it ;)
Here: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-55012
I used to be able to refresh the view of the database in the browse data window and see changes. This appears to no longer be the case. If it's by design, so be it. Just thought it was a very handy feature. Now I have to reload the database.
Was on Windows 7, didn't work there either. On 10 now. Newest release version, just reinstalled it...
Funny enough, if I have BOTH versions open at the same time, it works. With just one or the other, it doesn't appear to want to update... I'm clueless on that one....
I'm using the refresh button in the program window.
Just did a test. If I open a second instance of the program and open the database, I can refresh just fine. I opened the newer version twice. Going to try now with the older version. I have no idea why it makes a difference, but it does...
Ok. Exactly same behavior with the release version... Wish I could offer a hint but there's a reason I love your program, I know NOTHING about SQL....
If needed, you're welcome to Skype in and see it on this end. It's no big rush, I just happened to think of reporting it when I reinstalled and it still didn't work.  :-)
I am seeing something similar, on OSX. But it just started happening today, and worked fine earlier today!
I just updated to OSX 10.11.6, but only BECAUSE of this problem. (I took a chance it might fix it...)
I don't typically use the refresh button, though, I always forget it is there. I usually switch to a different table, then go back to the table that's been updated.
simPholders finds your simulator images and exposes them in a menu bar window. simPhuse provides yet another convenient way to access them, via a mounted filesystem. In either cases, you can select based on device, version, running app name, etc. instead of an obscure udid.
I rarely actually use the simPhuse mounted filesystem, though.
I can confirm same issue with the nightly. And once I turned off simPhuse, then no problem with refresh.
So, I have my workaround. But you still have your odd behavior, when using it with an odd filesystem. ;)
Perhaps, though, this will give you a clue as to related issues.
Would it be possible to add file types to the preferences so that the choices of file types is not just _.db and *._? A low priority item, I realize. But if somewhere in the preference there were a place to add additional file types that would show up in the file open/save dialogs, that would be great.
Maybe even make those items open automatically in the shell. (lower priority)
I would prefer an editable list of extensions somewhere in the preference dialog, which is nowhere near as simple as editing a .h file, I know. But. I use various extensions for various different projects and I doubt they are common with other users. *.PACKAGE, *.CFG, *.OBJECT. See, I doubt many other people would need these.
Only 25+years of C/C++ experience (no Qt experience but I understand the gist of it) but I lack the time to work on the browser. If no one gets around to it in a few months to a year, I might find some time. I agree, though, it is probably a good "get your feet wet" project for someone new to the your code base.
It doesn't need to be prefilled with my needs. Just prefill it with the current defaults.
Databases (*.db)
And then the dialog also adds All Files (*.*) and if someone wants to delete *.db they can. If they want to add new ones they can. And the up and down arrows are also cool.
Every time I open up the program it asks me if i want to update, i click "Don't show again" and carry on. When i reopen the program later, the message still pops up asking me if i want to update.
See issue #621 for details.
I built a new installation package and during installation on Windows 7
I could  see that the previously unquoted path is now quoted.
I'll be following the development of this issue.
I'd say to give the file for someone who really knew what translation (and the technical part of it) is.
The programmer is NOT responsible for fixing the translation files. You
should contact the translator to fix that, or you simply don't get it
released.
This isn't accepted in Arabic, it is not Japanese/Chinese.
I can work on the translation but my way of my translation is different,
current translations.
> When you say your way of translation is different... are you meaning a different dialect of Arabic?
@justinclift Thanks.
When opening the "Browse Data" tab the first time, then selecting a table from the drop down, it automatically shows the data for the table in ascending order by '_rowid_'.
I can tell by watching the SQL log window, it shows these SQL statements:
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `ConfigInfo` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `ConfigInfo` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC LIMIT 0, 50000;
If I then click on the "Execute SQL" tab, then click back to the "Browse Data" tab, it shows the data for the table in descending order by '_rowid_'
The SQL log window now shows these five new statements:
SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_master UNION SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_temp_master;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `ConfigInfo` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `ConfigInfo` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC LIMIT 0, 50000;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `ConfigInfo` ORDER BY `_rowid_` DESC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `ConfigInfo` ORDER BY `_rowid_` DESC LIMIT 0, 50000;
I believe it should not be changing the order like this, and just use 'ASC' order.
It was with version 3.8.0, 64 bit version for Windows.  Sorry I haven't tried any nightly build.
Hi I just tried these two nightly versions.
The Win64 version from http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/  still has this issue occur.
The Win32 version from http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser.exe.zip seems to work fine.
Again I can see it changing the order by to DESC in the SQL log window.
SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_master UNION SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_temp_master;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `BinaryFile` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `BinaryFile` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC LIMIT 0, 50000;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `BinaryFile` ORDER BY `_rowid_` DESC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `BinaryFile` ORDER BY `_rowid_` DESC LIMIT 0, 50000;
The Win32 version just does not execute these last two SQL statements, but the Win64 version does.
That's because of: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/b773e77a0c17317c9096728876e2b3c0f29be559/src/MainWindow.cpp#L2487
which leads to deleting all the current fillter inputs: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/FilterTableHeader.cpp#L30
Data should be saved somewhere and then called when repainting..
1. Open any table
2. Right-click and select "Show rowid column"
3. Move your mouse over this column
4. DB4S crash
DB4S v3.8.0 on Windows 7 (64-bit)
No crash for me. Tried with a couple different databases.
Still crashing with the latest nightly build (3.8.99).
``` sql
CREATE TABLE t(c TEXT);
INSERT INTO t VALUES('x');
```
I can use filter on the **_rowid_** column, and I can click on any row on it too. But only if I do it quickly. It is just that when I keep the mouse over any row in this column for more than 1 second, then DB4S crashes.
I just tried it on another PC (Windows 7 64-bit also, but without Service Pack 1) that I never installed or used DB4S on before, and it is still crashing. Unfortunately, I don't have Linux or Mac to try.
@chrisjlocke This is exactly what I'm having, and I don't think it is the database problem. Also, **_rowid_** wasn't showing for me sometimes, but I wasn't sure how to explain it properly. Thanks for recording it!
@chrisjlocke, that video great. thanks for recording it and illustrating the problem.
@revolter Thanks for the fix. I was waiting for it to be merged to test it.
@justinclift I'm unable to run DB4S after installing the file you linked. It is showing me this error..
![](http://i.imgur.com/6MTZCc4.jpg)
I have vcredist_x64.exe installed on my system.

Also, it seems that DB4S installs it during setup too.

The missing dll is MSVCP120**[D]**.dll and not MSVCP120.dll. Is this the debug version?
@justinclift Yes! It works! :smile:
And thanks to everyone here for helping with this issue. :+1:
@justinclift Sure. I will report back after checking it.
@justinclift I can confirm that this issue (the crash) is fixed in the latest nightly build. But I noticed that #510 is not fixed in this build.
The latest nightly build only fixes the crash bug. Showing _rowid_ column doesn't refresh it until you switch "Browse Data" tab and switch back to it again, or if you click on any of the columns filters.
From nightly build..

The installer you linked has _both_ fixed. It doesn't crash _and_ **_rowid_** column refresh instantly after showing it.
Tried creating a relational database with 3 tables; one parent and 2 children. Went to the Edit pragmas tab and clicked on the Foreign key checkbox. As soon as I return to the Database structure tab that pragma was turned off. Cannot create the db within the application.
Same problem occurs trying to import the db schema from a .sql file; the foreign keys are not recognized or accepted.
Wish there was documentation for this application.

Justin,
That's certainly understandable. I know that docs are often a much lower
priority than coding, but something on the wiki about what works and what
doesn't work would be helpful to folks like me.

Yesterday I tried building -3.8.0 (I use the SlackBuilds.org scripts for
most of my additional software), but it apparently requires a newer version
of QScintilla than that distributed with Slackware-14.1. However, -14.2 was
released a week ago and may have a QScintilla version that works. When my
DVD arrives I'll upgrade all the hosts and try again.

Justin,
Slackware's going to start mailing out the DVDs with 14.2 by the end of
the month (I guess they're all in production now). So it'll be August when I
upgrade and will try the latest build of sqlitebrowser then.
Hi
I'm currently running on a debian 7.11, cmake version 2.8.9 and tried to compile the package by myself.
I checked https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md and made sure that build-essential, cmake, libqt4-dev and libsqlite3-dev are installed.
I'm building it with USE_QT5=OFF. ccmake shows
```
ANTLR2_INCLUDE_DIR               ANTLR2_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND
ANTLR2_LIBRARY                   ANTLR2_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND
```
Which debian package would satisfy that?
I continued the process and executed `make` but it stops at
```

Is there any other package besides `libqt4-dev` that is needed there?
Hi
If I run `qmake` in the source code directory, nothing happens, `qmake` exists with status 0.
If I run `qmake` in the build directory after cmake generated the `makefiles`, I get an error:
```
build$ qmake
Usage: qmake [mode] [options] [files]
.....
```
Doing
```
$ cmake .
-- Could NOT find Antlr2 (missing:  ANTLR2_LIBRARIES ANTLR2_INCLUDE_DIRS)
```
You have
```
set(ANTLR_DIR libs/antlr-2.7.7)
endif()
```
and this is a relative path, I guess relative to current running directiory and not necessarily to  `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`.  I always create a build directory outside of the source code and this could be an issue.
Do you usually generate the cmake-Makefile on the same directory as the source code?
Now I get
```

Last time I had a `segfault` with GCC it was when I discovered that my RAM was faulty and had to change my ram. That's strange because I have to compile quite a bit of C++ code and I usually don't have these problems.
// edit:
when compiling with cmake, `TreeParser.cpp` is compiled without a problem.
> The trick will be figuring out what and why. ￼
I'll take a look at that later when I get back home (right now  @work). I have some projects using CMake,  I have some experience with it.
I'm not sure, I think I have a problem with my RAM. I'll let memtest run over the weekend.
When I use `qmake` to compile as `root`, then the build was complete. But `sqlitebrowser` crashes immediately with a `segfault`. If I run it with `valgrind` (might give me a clue as why it dies with `segfault`) the QT app window is loaded, rendered but after a couple of seconds  it dies with `segfault`.
As I said, I'll let run `memtest` over the weekend and see what happens.
I didn't forget this issue but I was on holiday and this week has been crazy, lots of deadlines.
I executed memtest over the weekend as I planned, it run more than 60 hour straight without interruptions and not a single error was found. I don't know why gcc fails with segfaults.
I'm still running on a debian 7. I will install debian 8 on virtualbox and see if I can reproduce the same results.
Hi
I did find out however that the reason I got the segfaults was not my RAM or debian buildchain. Some time ago I installed linuxbrew because I wanted to test something. linuxbrew compiled a glibc, gcc and other packages on its own and put them at the front of PATH. I haven't realized that until I was compiling something for one client of ours and I constantly got segfaults. That's when I executed gcc --version and I got a segfault as well. Then I realized that I was executing the gcc from linuxbrew the whole time.
Since then I haven't had the time to experiment with that. But I haven't forgotten it :)
So, I make a git clone and the current commit is `684958b29ce3d26684d9142d73df773b11189d54`.
I first tried `qmake && make` and this time it compilied without any issue. The program runs without problems.
I also tried `cmake`. It still complaining about missing `ANTLR2` libraries, but this may be a path issue. `cmake` is able to generate a `Makefile` and running `make` works also as well, the binary runs, everything seems fine.
The only issue I have is that the UI is to aggressive with the focus. If the UI loses focus, it regains automatically again, and this is a problem when you have virtual desktops, because the moment you change to another virtual desktop/screen and the UI loses focus, it regains focus and you jump back at the virtual desktop you've started the UI. I use fluxbox with at 12 virtual screens where every virtual screen has something running. While te UI runs, I'm unable to switch to the other screens.
Hi
the `v3.9.x` also compiles (qmake/cmake) without a problem. The focus problem is there as well. I'll test it later @home, different system (gentoo).
@justinclift: it's me, same person, different account (my personal).
I've made an update in gentoo (dev-db/sqlitebrowser-3.8.0) and it works normal, I can change the to my virtual desktops when `sqlitebrowser` is running.
I've compiled the `v3.9.x` version using `qmake` and `cmake` and I had the same issue: If I change to another virtual desktop, `sqlitebrowser` regains immediately the focus and my virtual desktop goes back to that where `sqlitebrowser` is running.
No,
- When compiled for the `v3.9.x` branch, the focus problem **is** happening
- When compiled for the `master` branch, the focus problem **is** happening
- When compiled for the `v3.8.0` branch, the focus problem **is not** happening
Does not open password protected SQLite db created with Navicat!!!
Hi,
In windows 10, every time I double click a database cell the window opens in the left upper corner of the screen. If I press Esc and try again it opens in a "normal position", at the middle of the screen.
The position of the window alternates between these two.
Its pretty inconvenient each time it appears on the left upper corner since the upper and left side of it are off the screen, not allowing dragging nor resizing or closing the window (with the pointer).
I'm running SQLite Browser 3.8.0.
Thanks!
Hi @GHProjects and @justinclift,
This isn't specific to windows 10. I'm on Windows 8.1 and have the same behavior. This is also present on the latest nightly build.
I don't know the behavior on Linux, but I'll bring it up and see what happens.
The same issue on Windows 7 :(
I'm glad this is brought up. I've mentioned it in a previous report (#413).
Since the position of the main form is stored when the application is closed, my suggestion is a new setting in Preferences to also store the position of the Edit-window.
Because of this bug I'm still using a build from August 19th 2015 but I'd like to update, cause I like to be up to date. :)
This happens on linux. Can someone please confirm? Then will @GHProjects please change the subject to be more accurate if someone else confirms the same behavior on linux?
> Because of this bug I'm still using a build from August 19th 2015
That's pretty silly. There's been many other bugs fixed since and sqlite has moved on as well.
@GHProjects, why would you not have the permission to rename a thread you started?
I don't know Qt or c++ very well (I'm a Delphi Pascal guy) but I took a quick look around the source code and I imagine something like this would work:
On show (or initialization) of edit dialog
restoreGeometry(PreferencesDialog::getSettingsValue("EditDialog", "geometry").toByteArray());
restoreState(PreferencesDialog::getSettingsValue("EditDialog", "windowState").toByteArray());
On close of edit dialog
PreferencesDialog::setSettingsValue("EditDialog", "geometry", saveGeometry());
PreferencesDialog::setSettingsValue("EditDialog", "windowState", saveState());
This is taken from "MainWindow.cpp" and I just altered a part of the lines to say "EditDialog" instead. I'm not sure the setting for "windowState" is necessary to save and restore though. Can someone more knowledgable please say that it might work or that I'm totally wrong. :-)
I'm willing to try a nightly build with this (or correction of this) code to help testing.
Thanks @justinclift I'll take a look at the guide and see if I can set up a working build environment during the weekend.
Altering the event below works for me on Windows to keep the dialog opening centered over the main window. But I have no idea about other platforms, multiple monitor setups and other possible special cases.
``` cpp
void EditDialog::showEvent(QShowEvent*)
{
// Whenever the dialog is shown, position it at the center of the parent dialog
QMainWindow* parentDialog = qobject_cast<QMainWindow*>(parent());
if(parentDialog)
{
move(parentDialog->x() + parentDialog->width() / 2 - width() / 2,
parentDialog->y() + parentDialog->height() / 2 - height() / 2);
}
}
```
This works great for me on Linux. the edit cell box stays centered each time on all cells.
I've had the opportunity to try my Windows build on a computer with two monitors, and I'm happy to say it works great there too. :smile:
For information, the current official build has problems there which can cause the dialog to appear on wrong monitor,
A pull request has been made. :smile:
You're welcome @justinclift.
Tackling other things.... sure, do you have more dialogs that needs to be centered? :wink: But seriously, do you have anything particular in mind? I'm still new to Visual Studio, C++, Qt, yeah basically everything in your brilliant Windows Build Guide. :smile:
@justinclift  If I can find the piece of code that performs the launch I should be able to fix the security issue. Right now I don't know where to start looking, so any hints are welcome. :smile:
Confirmed this works great on windows 8.1. The edit database cell displays in the same spot all the time.
Hi,
When I'm working with SQLiteBrowser and I need some additional screen resources, I occasionally minimize the SQLiteBrowser window.
However, when I then need to access SQLiteBrowser, I cannot get the window restored.
I need to Quit the application and then re-open it.
I'm running OS-X El Capitan and I retrieved the following information from SQLiteBrowser:
Version 3.8.0
Qt Version 4.8.7
SQLite Version 3.9.2
Is there something I'm doing wrong?
Is there anything I can do to change this behavior?
Regards,
Rob.
Just tried it myself as well.
Minimizing using the orange button on top left indeed.
Clicking on the icon in the Dock doesn't do anything.
When I do "RightClick / Show all Windows" it pops up. Although this works, this is not the default on my system.
When I minimize the Safari window I'm now using to write this answer, I just need to click it once from the Dock to have it restored.
When I write programs for Windows using VB, if a program is minimised and restored, you not only have to make the window 'normal' again (from minimised) but also have to change the Z order - it might be why the window is restored but behind other windows?  I've never programmed for a Mac so unsure what I'm on about....  in VB you have to 'activate' the required application to bring it back to the front.
No problems on Sierra (10.12.2) using build 3.9.1v2.
I suggest this issue can be closed. @justinclift Thanks for the update!
Just downloaded / installed this version and it is properly behaving like other apps!
You seem to have fixed the issue!
Thanks!!!!!!
Regards,
Rob.  The filters raw where you can search in the coloumn for a specifc string isn't mirrored in RTL layouts.

@innermous In Qt5, pass "--reverse" to the app, so it's "sqlitebrowser --reverse"
Hi,
I need export my SQLite database to sql file with MySQL compatibility, hence I want to use always backtick (`) for CREATE TABLE syntax. For example:
```
CREATE TABLE `Table1` (`ID` INTEGER,`Name` TEXT);
```
for example I have a table with schema:
```
CREATE TABLE `Source` (`Source_ID` INTEGER, `Name_Source` TEXT);
```
if I export this table, it become to:
```
CREATE TABLE "Source" (`Source_ID`  INTEGER, `Name_Source` TEXT)
```
or
```
CREATE TABLE 'Source' ('Source_ID' INTEGER, 'Name_Source' TEXT);
```
in this case I want no quote around the columns like:
```
CREATE INDEX Source_Source_ID ON Source (Source_ID);
```
```
CREATE INDEX 'Source_Source_ID' ON 'Source' ('Source_ID' );
```
So when I import the sql to MYSQL database, I got syntax errors
@justinclift it would be great to have user defined quote character for export
@MKleusberg it would be great if you can implement this feature(tables and indices are enough for me), however I am not able to test the nightly build this week, I will check later ASAP, thank you. @justinclift @MKleusberg thanks, it's now working! I will close the issue  I mentioned something similar in #599 - whenever a field is moved/edited, a whole bunch of SQL is executed.  I can't understand why this isn't 'written' when the user clicks OK, which must happen when a table is created, rather than edited.  If you want to move a field down 10 rows, thats a lot of SQL operations on a live database...
If you try to resize any column after having pressed 'Add Record' but before completion the addition, then no matter which column you try to resize, all columns are resized in the exact same way losing the original widths for all columns.
@justinclift this behavior works as expected in accordance with #241. @justinclift after adding new record new row is selecting MainWindow::addRecord(), 568 (I don't know why, since 2013-04-07). If we continue to change width of single column, it will actually change the width of all columns, because new row is selected (every column in row is selected). I see the problem now.  I guess it's a non-issue then other than it's not obvious to the user why this is happening.
So, if the whole row is automatically selected when pressing 'New Record', it could also appear as selected (all highlighted -- instead of just the row number) just as if one selected the row manually by clicking on the row number.  This would at least make it obvious that the whole row is selected at that moment, and it would have a consistent look between manual and automatic row selection. In latest build I just tried, only the row number is highlighted when pressing "Add Record".  The entire row is highlighted only after starting the column resizing, which is too late as you have already messed up all other rows from their previous size.  I have seen repeated crashes when the following actions are taken, and this is reproducible with the most recent nightly build.
1. With a DB open, go to the 'Browse Data' tab
2. Select a blank record (note: when I say blank I mean "", not (NULL).  As in an empty string).  These can easily be generated by a CSV import without all fields populated for every row
3. Ctrl+C to copy the cell value
4. Select a cell with a non-null value in it, Ctrl+V to paste
5. The application crashes
I am using Windows 7 Enterprise
Sorry for the delayed response, absolutely ill test it at work tomorrow when I use the browser :)
I have re-tested the issue with the latest nightly build and the crash is no longer observed.
I tested copying a blank value into a populated cell, copying a blank value into a blank cell, copying a blank value into a null cell, and copying blank values into cells with different data types.  All tests passed.
Note: It is interesting that the Browse Data tab doesn't perform validations on entries into the cells based on data type.  Was this intentional?
Closing this ticket, thank you for the quick response!
Very good explanation!
This PR adds the option to save a password per database file name and upon trying to open an encrypted database for which the password was saved in the Preferences, it opens up automatically, without the need for user input.
Fixed #486.
I saw that but didn't know why it failed. I'll try that tonight. Or should I pull the latest commits on my fork and then merge the master in this patch branch?
I can amend to a pushed commit? :O But, I'd keep it as a separate commit because it's another thing.
I knew that the branch is in sync with this PR, but I didn't know I can edit commits that are pushed to GitHub. I usually edit unpushed commits in my workflow. But thanks for the explanation :smile:
I didn't test with other than 1024 page size (I don't know what page size is :laughing:). I'll test it these days and let you know if I need the database file.
Well, I can't encrypt the database. I'm following these steps:
- select `File` > `New Database...`
- `Save As:` > `Untitles2.db`
- click `Save`
- create a `test` table in the `Edit table definition` window that pops up
- click `OK`
- select `File` > `Set Encryption`
- change `Page size` field value to `2048`
- click `OK`
- the database closes
- the `Invalid file format.` popup appears
and I'm left with `Untitled3.db` and `Untitled3.db.enctempold` files.
Well, it looks like that's by design. `Untitles2.db` is really encrypted, and I think that `Untitle2.db.enctempold` is just a safety backup.
What do you mean by _".ui sizing"_? The fact that I didn't managed to put the `Add` and `Delete` buttons next to each other? 😂 I did tried a lot but could figure out how to do this.
Also, I solved the _"it should probably prompt using the manual password dialog when the automatic ones fail"_ problem, and I recall thinking of this but forgot about it, it was so obvious.
Another thing I noticed is that you entered the file with the extension. I made it so it needs just the name of the file, didn't think more thoroughly about this.
I think it needs a discussion. It kinda seems more logic to require the file extension too because of these reasons:
1. one could have `test.db` and `test.sqlite3` files, encrypted differently
2. you, instinctively inserted the name with the file extension too, so there's a chance that that will other users do
@glawrence, I don't have access to a Windows OS.
And, the passwords are saved [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/625/files#diff-5ac1944317cd5ef74bfa5b0c9cfab070R185), but, yes, they are stored in plain text, I guess. I send them without any modification to the [`setSettingsValue`](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/PreferencesDialog.cpp#L183) method, which uses `QSettings`. But it looks like `QSettings` is saving them in plain text.
What do you think I should do before saving them? Like MD5 them? Should I make the table cell of password type in order for it to display dots or asterisks instead of the actual password?
Of course I don't mind. Thanks for drawing my attention too.
I don't have much knowledge of security myself, but I do know that it's very important, even if it's not "enjoyed". So I don't think I can do this all by myself.
Another option is to not get this merged until we fix the plain text passwords problem. Or lose the master password, as it's more complicated than salting and hashing them the same way.
I understood, but I really don't know to do UI in Qt yet. It's very very very different from Xcode with which I'm accustomed. I don't understand how to increase the table widget's width.
Well, I already found out where and "how" to edit the UI, but, like you noticed, I can't resize widgets.
@glawrence, I thought about what you said. I don't think it's possible using hashing, because the password will need to be "unhashed" when tried opening the database. Also, knowing that they are stored on the user's PC, I don't think is such a problem. FileZilla, Thunderbird and others do the same. What do you think?
I had created a table and used a default value of .5 for a REAL column. When I went to the Browse Data tab and selected the table, no column names or filter fields were shown. When I tried to Add Record I get "Error adding record: no such table: (INSERT INTO '' DEFAULT VALUES;)". Then I tried to modify the table. It brought up an empty Edit table definition window with none of my existing fields. After recreating the table I discovered that if I used a default value of 0.5 I did not see this problem.

Not only that, but if you add a record via the 'Execute SQL' tab, the record displays in the 'Browse Data' tab.  Hover the mouse over the row, and DB Browser weeps, curls up in a ball and cries horribly.

(This was in the Jun 11 nightly)
Yeah if you can get me a windows build I would be more than happy to test it.
A Windows 32-bit one for me please.
I think I have a similar/related crash case.
No rush.
With Nightly build (17-Aug-2016 02:21) things seems partially fix.
Its not crashing anymore (_when letting the mouse hover to long over a data field_) :smile:
Table edit still showing
```
CREATE TABLE `subject_data_tmp` (
);
```
on a table created with:
```
CREATE TABLE subject_data_tmp (pid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ASC, pr_id INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT ASC)
```
But that one is in the pipeline if I got it right.
Night night.
---
(_I have spotted that odd "DEFAULT ASC" part on my side._)
Yea, that `DEFAULT ASC` was the trigger of the problems on this side (_an edit error from me that slipped by_). After changing it to a more appropriate and intended `DEFAULT 0`. sqlitebrowser (_the nightly and the last final version_) went back to behaving as expected/normal.
(_Kept a copy of the original error case database for re-testing, just in case. If needed._)
This isn't a bug per-se, but more of a 'what do you think?' question . suggestion.
If I create a table with a field set as an integer, DB Browser (or sqlitebrowser) doesn't moan if I try and create a new record and put 'test' in that new field - ie, a string (or text) in an integer field.
This isn't a fault with DB Browser, as you can do it in the raw SQL, so my thought was whether it would be useful if DB Browser had some 'validity' checks...  guess it would only need to be for the interger and real data types (oh, and numeric) so can't see it bloating the program too much...
No problem.  Thanks for replying.
@justinclift I have made a commit with a fix to this issue in my master fork. Before I turn it into a pull request I have a question: I previously made a test commit with my ignore-file, but I assume you will be able to pick just the last commit I made, or will everything always be pulled?
Thanks for your advice @justinclift. I think I succeeded. Otherwise, please let me know. :smile:

This doesn't happen to me in the sqlitebrowser from this morning (9 june, 2016).
Try making a database, write it, close browser and open it up and see what happens.
I did not get back to this issue until today, I have been unable to reproduce this failure even with the original file. Perhaps Mars has to be in the right place in the sky? I will continue to use this application and try to get it to reproduce.
Hello
I am learning SQL, now I am practising with queries that combine data from multiple tables that are related to one another. How I can do it on DB Browser? I
Thank you so much
Clicking 'File' and 'Attach' should attach another database into the mix.  Might just be the databases I was using, but it didn't do much for me...
You can't use it (the attach keyword) in the SQL window, as that uses transactions and you can't use ATTACH in a transaction.
Hi Chris
Thank you so much for your quick reply, but i have tried it before and it doesn´t work; I attach the another database but when I do a query the browser doesn´t find that new database.
No, I must admit, I tried it when I saw your query (never used it before in anger) and couldn't get it to work either, and just assumed it was because there was either a schema clash or the planets weren't aligned quite right... (I was using it on Win 10 ... unsure if that matters....)
I was also using the latest nightly, in case that helps... (thats the usual first reply ... ensure you're using the latest version!)
I assume you're getting the 'enter a name for the attached database' dialog window?
Looking at the SQL log, something is attempted...
ATTACH 'D:/Downloads/Applications/SQLite Database Browser/sqlitebrowser.exe- 7 Jun 2016/1.db' AS `test`
SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_master UNION SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_temp_master;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `test2` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `test2` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC LIMIT 0, 50000;
but not much happens... no errors are displayed, etc....
Yes finally i have had to create a new table inside the other. It was a simple exercise to query multiple tables that have relationships with each other.
Thank for your time and help
What were your steps to do that?
I wrote CREATE TABLE artists(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT); and then I inserted a few registres, for example: INSERT INTO artist (id, name) VALUES (1, Iron Maiden); and it had worked for the exercise which i had to do. Were very simply queries such as SELECT \* FROM albums LEFT JOIN artists ON albums.artist_id = artists.id;
When deleting a field from a table, the default button in the popup dialog is 'Yes' rather than 'No', which is the usual convention for dialog boxes that have consequences.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/15848978/ebb8ce0a-2c87-11e6-9b29-5dd433784113.png)
Thanks for the prompt fix.  Was only a cosmetic issue mainly, but nice that
it now follows convention! ;)
Will test tomorrow and report back.  Thanks again.
On the sqlitebrowser from the 9th of June, I'm not prompted _at all_ when I delete a row. I'll download the latest (even though the code may be the same) and see if there's any change.
Above is still true for the sqlite from the 10th of June. Also, I'm not prompted to delete data from the table or the entire row or multiple rows.
I am prompted if I'd like to restore the deleted table, though, and I'm prompted if I'm sure I'd like to delete a table. The default option on the latter is no and the default option on the former is yes.
If you delete a row you're not prompted, as I presume if you think 'Oops', you can click 'Revert Changes'.  So thats 'as per design'.
I can confirm though that deleting a field now displays a dialog box with 'No' as default.  Thanks for a prompt fix.
Hi, I'm using your tool for many years, and it's always been my best choice in dealing with sqlite, but this last version crashes very often, especially if you run this app, change to another with ALT+TAB and then return  by the same keys with the SQLite Browser, app crashes...
Please fix that.
Thank you for your work!
Just a nod (either helpful or not...) that I've been using 3.8.99 (why don't nightlies have a specific version number?  Even 3.8.99.20160707? Just noticed x.99 is a generic version number) with no application crashes. The version I use every day is dated 26 Dec 2015 (so just after the main release... without the data cell popup) but just downloaded the latest nightly and couldn't replicate it in that either.  I'm using Win 10 64bit.
I'm not able to reproduce the issue originally reported on windows 8.1. I'm using a nightly build from last week. I don't get a new nightly build unless there's any updates to the github source.
We could use  dropdown combobox for foreign key cells to make edition even more comfortable.
Example here:
![combobox](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8950786/15634933/f85d2b5c-25d8-11e6-8a8e-3cc3cf74dc60.png)
Cell editor should provide suggestions based on available set of values. Problem is, I don't have idea how to get rid of ambiguity. How do we know, which text to display? In heidi it works so natural and implicitly.
sqlitebrowser: 3.8.0
1. Create new database
2. Create table with name "test"
3. Add a field named "index"
4. Check "PK" (Primary key)
5. Click OK.
Error message:
```
Error creating table. Message from database engine:
near "index": syntax error (CREATE TABLE `test` (
`index` INTEGER,
PRIMARY KEY(index)
);)
```
It's fixed! Thanks!
This is a suggestion for an optional feature to make the whole experience somewhat better.
If the user turns this global option on, any database specific configuration could be saved inside the database itself in a specially named table (e.g., _sqlitebrowser_config_ or whatever -- maybe ever user defined table name).
What do I mean by database specific?
For example, I always resize the column widths in the browser because the default usually truncates data in a way that I can't be sure what the field contains.
These new column sizes could be saved inside the database itself (in that special congifuration table).
When opening a database, sqlitebrowser could check for the existence of that table, and if the needed settings are there, use them, else revert to the default ones.
This configuration table could be used for all sorts of current or future database specific options, not only column sizes.  For example, it could even save the contents of the 'Execute SQL' tab to be remembered across sessions.
What do you think?
I wasn't aware of that!  I'll give it a try, and report back if I have problems with it.  Thanks.
However, why does the project file have to be a separate file?  (For example, backing up databases now one has to remember to take along all those extra files.)
One of the great things about SQLite3 is that all you need in relation to the database is contained in the same single file.
Regarding the way this works now, an immediate issue I see is that the related project is not automatically loaded upon loading the database.  I would expect if I load xxx.db that xxx.sqbpro (or xxx.db.sqbpro) would also be loaded to save typing / operator steps.
Even if I tell it to load xxx.db.sqlbpro it works as far as loading the database, but again the settings are not automatically applied.  (Unless, it actually ignores the .sqlbpro final part, and simply loads xxx.db)
A second issue, when I try to save the project, it defaults to the name of the database itself including the extension.  So, one has to manually edit the filename.  I don't like my filenames to have double extensions (e.g., xxx.db.sqbpro).
(This is all under Windows, in case it matters.)
A little off-topic regarding this PR, but, does this project have a coding style? I noticed that you put the brackets on the same line (I personally prefer this too), while in the rest of the project they are on a separate line. I think it would be a good idea to stick with a single coding style throughout the entire project. What do you think? Maybe we ca discuss this in more depth in #602.
I personally indent the `case`s :smile:
My question wasn't necessarily about this PR, it was about the whole project and the future PRs. But it was just an idea :smile:
Nice work with your c++! You're on the pathway to make sqlitebrowser is more superior.
mxe uses gcc 4.9.3, which should support most if not all c++11 features, so shouldn't be a problem here.
but qt5 is a different story, last time I updated mxe i tried to use qt5, but I just couldn't do a static build, either they removed support for it or I made something wrong. but I'm afraid that a switch to qt5 whould require more work for nightlies.
> I have no idea how well C++11 is supported on MSVC nor how to activate it.
It's even simpler on MSVC, it comes out-of-box.
> don't want to rush this.
IMO, there's really no need to rush this, but lots of boilerplate code could be optimized. What about Qt4 - it  just stinks as 11 year old stuff. It's just outdated, lots of stuff had been fixed and added/removed over this time. Upstream developers do it for a reason.
My suggestion is to start working on Qt5 in another branch, and continue distributing current(Qt4) version until Qt5 version is polished and perfect. More than that,  Qt5.7 is upcoming soon, in that version Qt devs introduce full vice versa C++11 support. More info [here](https://blog.qt.io/blog/2016/04/21/qt-5-7-beta-released/)
**Edit**: [This is the solution](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/602#issuecomment-393322886).
The [`BUILDING.md`](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md) file mentions how to build this from the command line, but I would like to be able to do this from `Qt Creator`.
When using `make`, it correctly builds the app, and it looks like this on a MacBook Pro with Retina support:
<img width="1149" alt="screen shot 2016-05-22 at 13 26 44" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/15453498/f0860024-2020-11e6-93b2-74daadf4c06d.png">
but when I build from `Qt Creator`, it looks like this:
![screen shot 2016-05-22 at 13 27 16](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/15453506/108af35c-2021-11e6-9990-769fd9317b4c.png)
the text and icons are blurry, and also I noticed that the drag handle to the left of the `New Database` button looks different too.
I'm also not able to `Run` it, just `Build` and then manually open the `.app`, because I get this error:
```

```
Another problem is that I can't manage to build with SQLCipher support. The `.md` file says to replace `any calls to cmake and qmake`, but doesn't specify in which files. Could this be done by creating a new `Build and Run Kit`?
Sorry, I didn't have time to look into your wiki. I did manage to get it somewhat working after posting this issue.
1. One of the problems was that the `Qt Creator` project was not configured properly. Having absolute zero knowledge about it, I just "next, next, next"ed in the wizard popups. And, by default, it used a "project configuration kit" (if I recall correctly the name) using Qt 5.6. So I deleted it and somehow imported a kit from the project, which had the correct Qt 4.8.7.
I currently don't have access to `Qt Creator`, but when I do and have time, I can provide detailed steps, exact labels and buttons names or screenshots for this.
I now understood it a little better.
This also fixed the retina problem.
2. I also managed to enable SQLCipher by adding that flag in the same "project configuration kit". Same remarks as above.
3. I'm not able to directly run the project though.
I installed `Qt Creator` using `.dmg`, not `brew`, if it helps. I did install `sqlcipher` using `brew` though.
> I need to remove sqlite (brew remote sqlite)
Also, wouldn't that break OS X stuff?
> Not 100% sure, but I don't think Homebrew has a formula for Qt Creator.
Oh, I think I said something stupid, I don't think `Qt Creator` is available on `brew`.
I think I meant `qt` alone. Is it only available on `brew`? I can't recall this, sorry for the confusion.
> For me that's workable
> I think it's the same case for me too, but it would be nice if it worked without this removal... if it's possible, of course. But for now, I think we can make sure to mention these in the docs:
>

> Remember that, by removing sqlite, if you have other Homebrew formulas installed using it, they'll barf until it's put back. You can put it back using `brew ...` (here, I don't know the undo-ing command)
Or something like this.
I am now receiving this error after removing sqlite:
```

Does [this](https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/34302) help you to help me solve the problem? :D I don't understand much.
Well, I didn't remove anything else on purpose. But it seems I do have that file:
```
```
I found this possible solution:

>
> Why does this work? Because for whatever reason, when Apple requests libJPEG.dyld, whatever system searches for it finds /opt/local/lib/libjpeg.dyld because the search is case insensitive. For a Unix operating system. Go figure. The lines above will force any program looking for libjpeg.dyld to be redirected to Apple's libJPEG.dyld.
>
> But wait, what if you WANT Macport's libjpeg.dyld? Sorry, not possible unless you statically link your program to libjpeg.a. And since I've never done that before, I can't help you if you want to do that :(
Do you think it's ok?
I managed to get it (finally) working by actually running all the command from [here](https://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macports-users/2010-November/022663.html), not only the jpeg one, but replaced `/opt/local/lib/lib*.dylib` with `/usr/local/lib/lib*.dylib`
This is my `brew list`:
```
/opt/local/lib ❯ brew list
autoconf    chisel      fontconfig  gmp     libpng      libusb      mackup      openssl     recode      unar
automake    cmake       freetype    highlight   libtasn1    libusb-compat   makedepend  pkg-config  rename      unrar
boost       colordiff   gd      jasper      libtiff     lua     neovim      qt      sqlcipher   xz
```
And, what do you mean by what program?! It's sqlitebrowser, of course 😆
`brew remove jpeg --force; brew install jpeg` didn't work :( I wonder what could it break if I leave the Apple's symlinks in `/usr/local/bin`
I don't think it was a problem of missing library. A symlink for `libJPEG.dylib` existed, but it pointed to a different file, which probably didn't have the `__cg_jpeg_resync_to_restart` symbol.
Here is my `otool -L` output:
```
sqlitebrowser.app/Contents/MacOS/sqlitebrowser:
/usr/local/opt/sqlcipher/lib/libsqlcipher.0.dylib (compatibility version 9.0.0, current version 9.6.0)

/usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 915.0.0)
```
Yeah, that makes sense though.
So, to make it clearer, I currently have the Apples `dylib`s symlinked in `usr/local/lib` and it's working (and I'm working to on a PR 😄). I can directly run sqlitebrowser from `Qt Creator` with the debugger attached. So it's all good now. I'll continue like this and see if this overwrite is causing problem somewhere else.
From the `master` branch? I forked and cloned the project a couple of days ago, should I have the new executable name too? I have `sqlitebrowser.app` and `sqlitebrowser` inside of it.
Nice name for the setup 😂.
It doesn't upset me. But I remember stumbling upon `DB Browser for SQLite.app` myself while in the trial and error period. And I'm wondering why isn't the project building with this new name too. I do want to have the latest commits.
Oh, I am 45 commits behind 😐. Need to search again on SO how to sync a fork 😂.
Ooooh, I know what happened, I forked the project from the browser, but I already had a fork, so it just redirected to it, and I happily cloned it locally.
I don't think that works for a fork. I usually go over and over to [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository)
I have the following schema .. when I click the add record button, I get an error that it failed with foreign key constraint -
Why does the add record need to do a real INSERT before I have had a chance to edit the row?
(that's what the sql log is showing) ... this will never work.
``` swift
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE "words" (
`groupid`   INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
`word`  TEXT NOT NULL,
`action`    TEXT NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(groupid,word),
);
CREATE TABLE "groups" (
`groupid`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`name`  TEXT NOT NULL,
`description`   TEXT,
`enabled`   INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
`canedit`   INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
PRIMARY KEY(groupid)
);
COMMIT;`
```
@justinclift sure. This issue annoys me aswell.
I had the same problem when I clicked on new record I got the error message.
I am not an experienced coder but I thought that if the data entered into the fields were held in a buffer and the record would be written after all the fields have been entered into the buffer.
any idea if a fix is imminent?

After deleting a table, the `Delete Table` button remained active and if pressed, it tried to delete table `''`.
Yaaay, my first sqlitebrowser PR and accepted PR :heart:
Of course :smile:
Sure thing, I do have some bugs which I didn't have time to address.
Also, is it a good practice to create a separate branch for every PR, right?
Ok, thanks again!
I'm using Windows OS and Qt 5.4.1 (but also happens in Qt 4.8.7 ... laptop here has 5.4.1 but work PC which has a newer build of SB has an older Qt...)
When modifying a table, there are checkboxes for primary key, not null, etc.  If these are double-clicked, text can be entered into the cell.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/15438228/09ab1a62-1ec3-11e6-98de-8685ce4c5b3c.png)
Obviously its only a cosmetic issue as the text is ignored, and I presume you don't want to bloat the code with 'cleanup' code on the off-chance some muppet will enter text, but didn't know if the table cell allowed editing, but disabled text entering for particular columns.
Yes, the 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' can be entered by double clicking in the cell where the checkbox is.  Interestingly, when editing an existing table, because its a change in the row, the usual 'modify table' SQL process is run (but obviously ignored).
In the 'real world', I can't see anyone double-clicking in the cells, and if they did, they wouldn't enter text...
I presume its because the cell is empty and can contain checkboxes, rather than being solely a checkbox.  Again, on my Windows version, the column can be resized out, but cannot be resized back down to the original size ... as if it 'should' contain text...
No-one would do it + and it has no bearing on the program + and entirely cosmetic = waste of time!
Hello,
I downloaded windows nightly with date stamp of the 18th of May and noticed it's built with sqlite 3.12.0. The latest available version of sqlite3 is 3.13.0 but that was just released today. ;) The next most recent version is 3.12.2:
http://sqlite.org/changes.html
I believe 3.12.0 had such a serious issue Dr. Hipp removed it from being downloadable.
Can 3.12.2 or 3.13.0 be used in sqlitebrowser?
Thanks!
Yes, I'll try this out with the 20th of May's build!
Much better! Now it's a version 3.13.0!
- quickly move the cursor over `d`
the selected table will be `d` instead of `a`.
Sorry, the title is poorly worded. This happens in the `Browse Data` tab actually.
When I click the table `a`, it starts a loading process, but if I quickly move the cursor over the table `d` before the process completes or the dropdown closes, it finishes by showing the data of the table `d`.
> so no chance to click on another one during the loading process
Not click, just hover.
I'm using OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 (15E65) and Qt Version 4.8.7.
Summary about this patch:
1. One can duplicate record via:
- context popup menu over the record in table
- shortcut Ctrl-"
2. The very first _copied_ value in new row is focused. Primary keys are ignored.
3. Copied alues aren't written to db instantly until "Write changes"
In #577 there was suggestion to provide "duplicate field". I find this feature ambiguous tho, _especially_ for user. So much depends on which row is currently selected, which row should be copied where and so on. I guess, in this case one should really just Ctrl-C Ctrl-V.
So, since original feature request was about duplicating _records_, this closes #577 . We can discuss better design for ditto field separately.
@justinclift all right, I am looking forward to it.
@innermous, I think that he's referring to [this](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createview.html).
Patch updated.
Frankly, I wanna say 2 things about code. Firstly, it's sad not having C++11 support. Lots of boilerplate code could be avoided with use of lambdas to connect signals and slots. More than that, check [docs](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots.html), you are using outdated slot interface (I guess it's only for Qt4 support, which has dinged 7 years already IIRC).
@justinclift everything is done as others requested. Why not closing issue?
@justinclift okay, I guess we'll make browser even better together :ghost:
Cheers.
Hi,
I really like the feature where you can export various tables in a database to a csv file as it's a quick way to get data out; however, exporting on a linux machine, the file is actually ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators.
That means the export inserts ^M at the end of the line:
```
trip_id,date,dayOfWeek,pickup_time,duration,distance,total,beginning_zip,ending_zip^M$
3b5a4966-f6ce-45e5-a659-448715344dbf,2016-04-18,monday,18:42,1036.8,3.17,6.7,89119,89109^M$
0915dd1f-86cc-440a-ae72-0f12ae0aaef1,2016-04-18,monday,19:05,816.0,3.35,6.31,89109,89109^M$
```
On anything other than windows, these ^M are annoying and difficult to deal with. Fortunately they're easily removed with a sed string.
Can sqlitebrowser be updated to export to a strictly ASCII file?
You can observe the new line characters (^M) on linux with `cat -e file.csv`
Wow, that was a super fast commit!
I built it successfully on my linux machine and I'll test it when I'm at home.
Great job, @justinclift:
```

```
I'm happy with the results!
Hi @justinclift,
I was watching the other thread and have recently tested the new changes. They look good and it's pretty nice you made a the other option so someone can make it whatever separator they want.
Steps to reproduce this issue:
1. Open table with no records at all (or remove them all)
2. Press Ctrl+A
3. Press "Delete record"
4. Watch the world burn
```
ASSERT: "!isEmpty()" in file /usr/include/qt/QtCore/qlist.h, line 335
The program has unexpectedly finished.
```
Hi everyone, just a feature request, not urgent at all: if could be possible to allow to change the font of the cell editor or to use directly an external editor (like notepad++ or notepad2-mod)
Great project and product, i keep my todo list ordered by the priority thanks to your efforts (portable version).
Sorry for the delay. Version 3.8.0 . I checked the preferences and there is the font is adjustable for the sql editor or the cells in the table overview, but not in the cell editor itself.
Edit: if in the "cell editor" i switch to binary edit (or hexadecimal) the font that i choose also for the sql editor and for the table overview is applied as well. Only in the text editor mode it does not work.
ditto.
The 'browse data' tab displays rows in a large font. No way that I can see to reduce it, though that would be desirable.
I ended up taking a different route to my unreachable goal, old chap. I'm
currently stuck in a crevice. But I shall have a look when I get a chance.;)
Not sure if there is already a method to do this but if not, then a feature request, to be able to filter records in the browser by NULL so one can see all records that have null in the respective column(s).  Currently, I haven't figured out how to filter records that have no value, other than using a direct SQL statement.
Thanks
I sure am. I tried just now with the latest available download, and it does not work. Seems to work OK now (both the download and the =NULL).   yeah that's a good point.  How about something like #587 ?
By using shell magic, you mean to compile the version inside the app, when building it?
So, SQLCipher is bundled within the app the building for release only?
I don't fully understand this. For development I had to `brew install sqlcipher`, so, isn't it possible for one user to have a version and one user another version?
Also, the runtime empty database was what I wanted to say next, though it looks a little bit hacky 😄. And it was asked [here](https://discuss.zetetic.net/t/how-to-retrieve-the-openssl-version-in-use-by-sqlcipher/466/2) already.
sqlitebrowser freezes with 22Gb database file. I can open database, edit the pragmas, view structure, but sqlitebrowser freezes when I try to click on "Browse Data" tab and eats 100% CPU.
sqlite3 CLI client works with that DB file without any problem.
Database structure is:
CREATE TABLE `DATA` (
`time`  TIMESTAMP,
`one_get`   DOUBLE,
`two_get`   DOUBLE,
`three_get` DOUBLE,
`four_get`  DOUBLE
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_time on DATA(time)
Ubuntu 14.04

8Gb. By the way, ram leaks are not observed at the moment of freeze. There is CPU loading only.
> largest SQLite database file I've heard of someone using with this
We are using even bigger DB files from program written in c. It works like a charm.
Thank you so much for your answers.
I have cloned and built yesterday's git master, because previously I had tried to use very old Ubuntu's version built from [launchpad.net](https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser) Seems, that it was the version 3.8.0. Result was similar for any versions - sqlitebrowser freezes.
Today morning I have built sqlitebrowser up to commit 484206b60c5f57ea8259031af67b3c0f28944e5 Fri May 6 01:23:15 2016 +0200
Unfortunately it did not fix my problem - sqlitebrowser still freezes immediately when "Browse Data" tab pressed.
Now I know what had happened. Sqlitebrowser does not freeze. Every time when I clicked on "Browse Data" tab It had been waiting when following SQL request would finish execution:
SELECT COUNT(*_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `EURJPY` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
Of course it is not solve the issue, but I have made some experiments to get duration of similar requests to that big DB:
$ sqlite3 ./DATA.db
SQLite version 3.8.2 2013-12-06 14:53:30
sqlite> .timer ON
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `EURJPY` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
296000329
Run Time: real 340.013 user 136.504500 sys 18.499167

Notice that the dropdown is missing when the image is recognized.
Screenshots are from today's nightly (having the JPEG plugin, see #579):
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2906988/14936787/704b756a-0ef5-11e6-8114-43b319ef97ca.png)
and latest 3.8.0 release:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2906988/14936790/76cc3780-0ef5-11e6-85bd-dcc6201107b5.png)
Regardless of version or image format, sometimes it would be nice to check the binary data even if it's a known image. For example adding Image to that dropdown would be a nice solution.
This would make it easier to check header bytes without needing to export and open the file in an external editor.
Cool, thanks for the updates, I'll check it out.
What is required to support JPEG in BLOB typed columns?
The JPEG encoder/decoder at http://www.ijg.org/ works nicely, I just integrated it myself in Java JNI few weeks ago.
Windows 7 SP1 x64, and I can confirm that the nightly build handles the JPEG BLOBs and the latest release doesn't.

Holy-moly I thought [this](https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Notes-for-compiling-on-Windows) was the full docs for that :) Sorry, but I don't have time right now, and I'm planning to update to Windows 10 soon, so you're probably better off setting up a VM.
I'm just updating from 3.4.0 to 3.8.0 and notice that the current version has a lot of dll files and a `platforms` folder, would it be possible to build a single big exe file like before?
Hmm, thanks, that's good to know, but it's not a full solution. It only works as long as you don't change your nightly toolchain, also it could be unstable at any time (have to be lucky to get the right nightly).
I personally would be willing to compromise x64 for a single file downloadable from the Releases page (without installer).
Brrr, reading those errors gives me the chills... well done! I'm so used to just executing `gradlew jar` and it does everything (dependencies, compilation, packaging); all I need pre-build is a JDK on PATH :wink:. I would've thought that the situation in the OSS world have changed over the last 10 years, but it's just more different compilers to accommodate and more make-like builders. :disappointed:
You can prioritize this low (if you have prios), it's just a nice to have. I like to have my arsenal of dev tools in one folder (less dirs to add to PATH).
A 'ditto' function!  I second!  And don't forget keyboard fans (CTRL-" or something, like in some spreadsheets).
Actually, it'd be nice to have two 'ditto' functions.  One to copy just the cell above, and one to copy the whole row.  (OK, maybe the whole row can be done with the mouse only as one can repeat the keyboard way for each cell of interest.)
@tonypdmtr are you sure Ctrl-" is common shortcut for that?
I picked up the task btw.
Yes, Excel uses it, for one (see official link below).  The actual combination is CTRL together with a single quote (no SHIFT is needed to get the double quote) but it's referred to as CTRL-" (double-quote).  This is supposedly easy to remember as it resembles the '' (two short vertical bars) used for a 'ditto' notation.  Have a look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark and here: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Excel-shortcut-and-function-keys-1798d9d5-842a-42b8-9c99-9b7213f0040f (look down the page for the CTRL-'  single quote, and its description).  Actually, for Excel it works with both single and double-quote but in one case it copies the value and the other the formula.
@tonypdmtr
Thanks for explanation of Ctrl-", that was the thing I never knew.
I am thinking about UX design of that feature. Should button be greyed out in those cases?
@justinclift how do you think, maybe this should be positioned near "Add record" and "Delete record" instead?
The unique fields issue is irrelevant in the sense that the ditto operation simply copies the cell (or row) above to this one.  This is either an allowed thing or not.
What I mean is the operation is no different from someone trying to actually type in the respective field values.  This will be either allowed, or not.  How it displays an error is no different in either case.
Regarding the UI issue: (I'm a keyboard person so the CTRL-' covers me).  My idea about it, however, would be to have a right click on the row/field you want to copy and a popup window to give two options: 'Copy Row' and 'Copy Field'.  No special buttons.  What do you think?  This is actually more powerful than the keyboard shortcut in that you can 'ditto' any row/field, not just the one above.
Just to add a couple more details of how I envision this:
1. CTRL-' (single quote) can be for cell/field copy, and CTRL-" (double quote) for row copy.  Easy to remember: One quote does less than two quotes.
2. Once the 'ditto' operation is complete, the cursor could automatically move to:
(a) the cell/field to the right, when a single cell/field is copied.  (If on last column, go to first column -- i.e., wrap around.)  This will allow repeated CTRL-' to very quickly copy multiple fields, even when not the whole row is needed.
-- or --
(b) the first cell/field, when a whole row is copied, to allow possible edits.
What do you think?
@tonypdmtr you can ditto field one time. After that it's ambiguous where to ditto another field, cuz new row is already created.
IMO only ditto row matters.
Ambiguous?  Ditto always works in relation to the field above.  So, wherever the cursor is, that's where (the column) you get your value from.
IMO, if you have to keep only one, then only ditto single field matters.  Because, it will never be the case that a new row is needed that has the exact same information for each and every column.  On the other hand, it's quite common to have the same values repeated for one or more columns in different rows.
I thought this option should duplicate current row in the end of table... Now I see I imagined everything wrong, sorry.
I wish everyone could have same seeing of the problem  :confounded:
@innermous You thought right except that it doesn't necessarily have to be the whole row.  If you also take into account the current column (where the cursor is, or mouse click happens), it's the same thing.  You just use both grid coordinates, not just the row, from where to get the source data.
Copying the whole row is convenient when someone wants to keep all but one or a few fields the same (happens less often).
Copying a single field is convenient when one wants to clone one or few fields only (happens more often).
Once the copy is done, the user will most certainly need to work on the fields that need to be different, so it'd be nice to stay on that new row and be allowed to continue editing as usual.
@tonypdmtr u don't understand what mean. Everything you say is right. But real thing is, what happens when we have K rows and we ditto row N? There are 3 possible outcomes:
1. Some data from N (column or whole row whaaatever it doesn't matter now) is copied to K + 1
2. Data from N copies to N + 1 (following item)
3. Data from previous item (N - 1) dittos to N.
Let's make it simple then.
You press 'New Record' in browser, and a new row appears ready to accept your data.
You position the cursor to some cell in that new row.
You do DITTO function.
The contents of the immediately above row for the same column is copied into the current cell as if typed in by hand.
Then, ideally, the cursor on the current (new record) row, moves to the next column.
This covers the keyboard way, at least.
Wherever you right-click the mouse, you copy the data from that row instead of the last one to the corresponding column in the new record.
Did I answer your question?
@tonypdmtr well, at least I see whole picture now.
I too got lost in this discussion. My initial feature request and actual use case scenario was to duplicate any table row, and, of course, every column value, except, unique fields.
My use case was quite different from what @tonypdmtr sees.
This:
> Copying the whole row is convenient when someone wants to keep all but one or a few fields the same (happens less often).
was false in my case. I did want to copy an entire row multiple times, and only change 1-2 fields.
Knowing the "A picture is worth a thousand words" idiom, here are some pictures to better explain myself:
Before:

Correctly.
@revolter Hmm. How exactly is what I said different from what you just said?  You say the same thing only worded differently.  (Unless you're referring to the 'happens less often' part. But this is a matter of opinion.)
> My use case was quite different from what @tonypdmtr sees.

@tonypdmtr, I may have got it wrong, sorry. Not a native english​ speaker.​
So ditto field always dittos current field into the very last record (created with "New record"), right? So it can be called for several fields.
@justinclift was speaking about Ctrl-' (ditto single field). Everything is clear with ditto row.
I have ditto row working, not sure implementation is good though.
Working on ditto field.
UPD: In my opinion, duplicate row should create new record with same data, rather than changing it for already created one with 'Add record'.
@tonypdmtr what you think about that? See the bright side of it:you can duplicate row several times with just pressing Ctrl-" several times, no 'Add record' step is needed anymore. I believe this use case appears much more often than that you described.
@innermous I agree about the CTRL-" ('ditto' for row) that it appears to be simpler when done directly (i.e., without having to do Add Record first).
As for copying the same row several times by repeated CTRL-" presses, I would think that in most cases, it would be practically impossible.  A correctly designed database would not expect the exact same row to be repeated without any changes in (at least) one field.  So, some editing (automatic or manual) has to happen for each new record before going to the next one.  If the change is automatic (like an auto-increment field) then that's not an issue.  But I would think this to be the exception rather than the rule for most tables, which IMO would require manual changes.
@tonypdmtr i'd stick to @revolter picture, cuz I understand this use case in the same way.
@MKleusberg Sure thing :D
@MKleusberg It's working great, thanks a lot @innermous!
Updating from version 3.7.0 32-bit to 3.8.0 64-bit does not update the file handler registry in:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Classes/Applications/sqlitebrowser.exe/shell/open/command
The path after update was still 'C:/Program Files (x86)/..' and should be 'C:/Program Files/..'
This breaks the "Open with" dialog such that it ignores your choice.
It's exactly the same issue :)
It should be taken care of during install-time.
This is essentially a limited scope version of #332, asking to always open the most recently installed version of SQLite.
A proposed fix for this issue
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/498#issuecomment-214718575
Can confirm that the nightly build works on OS X with Retina display.  I tested it on a Mac without retina display as well, no negative effects.
![screenshot 2016-04-28 09 11 05](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18670565/14871058/3dd0ee96-0d22-11e6-8739-a8faa7e93600.png)
😄 yeah, just an easy one liner. The process of finding out what to change gave me a chance to see how qt works, which I've never used before. It was pretty interesting, but not too complicated as the code, to my novice eye, is really clean and well organised (so is this app's).  As for what the future holds, I'm just gonna keep learning and programming, hey? 😀
But I did notice that my professor always has to make some changes to the font size in class (prefs aren't saved because the machine boots from a master OS image on every reboot) so I was thinking about adding a "Presenter" mode checkbox or something to the preferences pane.  Might be a nifty little project for me to dabble in C++.  I won't make any pull requests until that branch is rock solid though.
Regrettably, I have not.  I did research it, and found a commit stating a permanent fix had already been implemented in v2.8.1 that removes the need to disable bufferedDraw, though the compiled version does not seem to behave as such.  I think it should be brought to the maintainer's attention.
I added column titles '_id' and 'data' to the end of the first row of a csv file (no data in any row) hoping to make the '_id' column the primary key after importing the file.
The 'PK' status does not stick when modifying the table, unless I fill the column with numbers first.
Adding the column manually works fine (and the column is filled with numbers - perfect).
When modifying the table and the PK status doesn't stick, is the database reporting any error?  I presume the SQL log would show the commands sent and the errors (if any) returned?
There are no errors shown in the log page.
However I think I have found the cause.
The file was created by saving from Excel so while there may be no data in the cells there are trailing commas on each row giving an 'empty' cell not a 'NULL' one.
If I remove these commas the 'PK' status sticks and the column gets filled as expected.
Any chance of a "Add 'Primary Key' column" option in the csv import box?
Should I add a make separate request for this?
I first encountered the custom option when selecting one of the other available options (hex, octal, round number, etc) on a colum, and then going back to "edit display format". I noticed my selection was not what I previously selected (hex, octal, round number, etc), but rather it was "custom".
Added package `sqlite-devel` as a requirement for CentOS, because when I was building sqlitebrowser-3.8.0 from source on my Centos 7, command `cmake .` throwed error:
```
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
linked by target "sqlitebrowser" in directory /home/maxim/software/sqlitebrowser-3.8.0
```
Installing `sqlite-devel` from `base` repo fixed the problem.
This patch allows to view result data from the _Execute SQL_ tab in the EditDialog.
This patch is lightweight and already useful to me - and hopefully other people
Ideally, I'd like to be able to edit the data too, but I couldn't get it to work, because when the user enters freeform SQL, it is nontrivial to determine what the underlying table is (see http://www.sqlite.org/sessions/lang_select.html).
Ah. I think there is a double-click action missing, so I have to admit it is nonobvious:
To see what I am trying to accomplish:
- open a database
- enable _View -> Edit Cell_
- Go to _Execute SQL_ and enter a select statement suitable for your db.
- In the result table view, click on an item and watch the Edit Cell update the data.
I use this for a db that has lots of JSON blobs that I need to inspect.
Yes, please.
Also, I'll look into adding a double click action so that the Edit Dialog opens when a cell is double clicked. That would make the new functionality much more discoverable.
(But not today, I'll look into it tomorrow)
I added the double click action (much better).
But I can not reproduce your bug on my machine. In any case, I don't understand how I could have introduced that sort of bug - this pull request mostly only connects the edit dialog with the result table.
Can you reproduce your bug when browsing the table?
Thanks for the quick thumbs-up (to both of you)
Hi @MKleusberg: I've made the changes you suggested - thank you for your thorough review.
I'll look into the new slot for multiple SQL tabs this evening, but I'd prefer to open a new pull request for that.
hopefully a passable attempt to add decimal support per
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/373#issuecomment-211025161
I re-organized the conversion list, too.
I had a database that threw up an error- 'database disk image is malformed', but DB Browser was able to export the tables to .SQL files.
However, when I created a new database and told DB Browser to import this SQL file, it told me , "Nope" - "Error importing data: Error in statement #1: cannot start a transaction within a transaction.
Aborting execution".
Indeed, the SQL's first command is 'Begin Transaction'...
I presume the import routine should say, 'if the first line is a begin transaction, then I'll do nothing, otherwise I'll add one...'
Or do we have to delete the generated 'begin transaction' lines from the SQL before importing?
DB Browser: 3.8.0
OS: Windows 8.1 64bit
It does, yes.  I was going to post that the 'executing sql...' dialog was stuck and didn't update, but its just doing it v..e..r..y slowly.  The .sql has 505,000 lines, and after 3 hours, its on 9%.  The import is going to take a while....
No, it was a new database, so no indexes ... fresh empty database.
Yes, now I've found the right position inside the TS file.
I removed the `<numerusform>`-lines there as both (singular and plural) have the same phrase. I'm not very familiar with Qt and TS files so therefore I can't imagine if this provoked the problem.
The problems are occuring with the removed lines.
@justinclift Just updated the project name, now everything should be ok.
@justinclift I do not have any overview about this but when looking at newer translations (Turkish for example) there are about 2800 lines of content, whereas in the older ones there are only around 2100 lines.

After applying 730a272454cdca4846629642e500f383487e54fd on top of 3.8.0 crash is fixed, thanks :)
As for reproducibility - when one has whole system compiled with `-fstack-protector-strong` it helps find things like that :P
No merge? Is there something I can adjust?
:raised_hands:
haha no prob. :+1:
Sure. I'll take a look tomorrow or over the weekend

Not helpful, but I don't get this issue, and happily open files on mapped drives.
I've had this before in other applications, depending on how the drive is mapped.  Or permissions.
Can you access the server in DB Browser via the UNC, eg, \\server\share ?
The problem went away somehow and i am not sure what did it.
I have set DB4S to open SQLite files by default and when i double click on the database it opens and now that i try even with file > open it works.
It is as if making it the default program it got more permissions.
Yes i can/could open the share when it was not working.
We were setting up new computers recently and they would get this same error window just by trying to open that share before we added them to the proper group.
It works for me now so if no one else has this problem must be my windows acting up.
Sure close the issue.

When I look at this picture, I don't know what to click, what will happen, and what I should do next. I assume others are in the same boat as me. I think it'd be a good idea to give some instructions that address these questions.
Oh, whoops, I didn't see it on the right side. Thanks!
Before last update I was able to set the application as a default application to open .sql files, and after I could not.
I am sorry but no.
Awesome.
According to [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/table-constraint.html), a foreign key constraint could include multiple columns separated by  a ','.
If I execute:
```
CREATE TABLE to_reference_multi
(
id1 INTEGER NOT NULL,
id2 INTEGER NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT Identifier1 PRIMARY KEY (id1, id2)
);
CREATE TABLE to_reference_single
(
single_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT Identifier1 PRIMARY KEY (single_id)
);
CREATE TABLE test_reference
(
id1 INTEGER NOT NULL,
id2 INTEGER NOT NULL,
id3 INTEGER NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT Identifier1 PRIMARY KEY (id1, id2, id3),
);
```
The resulting test_reference table ignores fk_multi and looks like:
```
CREATE TABLE `test_reference` (
`id1`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id2`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id3`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(id1,id2,id3),
);
```
I can confirm FKs with multiple columns aren't completely ignored anymore. However, adding two FK constraints with multiple columns leads to only one mixed constraint.
I downloaded the nightly build from sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com and executed the same commands in the original post.
<details>
<summary>
The resulting test_reference table confirms that one constraint isn't ignored:</summary>
``` sql
CREATE TABLE `test_reference` (
`id1`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id2`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id3`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(`id1`,`id2`,`id3`),
);
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>
To test two FK constraints with multiple columns I executed:</summary>
``` sql
CREATE TABLE table1
(
id1 INTEGER NOT NULL,
id2 INTEGER NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT Identifier1 PRIMARY KEY (id1, id2)
);
CREATE TABLE table2
(
id3 INTEGER NOT NULL,
id4 INTEGER NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT Identifier1 PRIMARY KEY (id3, id4)
);
CREATE TABLE test_reference
(
id1 INTEGER NOT NULL,
id2 INTEGER NOT NULL,
id3 INTEGER NOT NULL,
id4 INTEGER NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT Identifier1 PRIMARY KEY (id1, id2, id3),
CONSTRAINT fk_multi1 FOREIGN KEY (id1, id2) REFERENCES table1 (id1, id2),
);
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Resulting in a test_reference table with one mixed FK constraint as follows:</summary>
``` sql
CREATE TABLE `test_reference` (
`id1`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id2`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id3`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id4`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(`id1`,`id2`,`id3`),
FOREIGN KEY(`id1`,`id2`) REFERENCES `table2`(`id3`,`id4`)
);
```
</details>
Of course, the rules aren't enforced unless I enable foreign keys. That's the expected behavior according to [sqlite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_enable) but a warning message might be useful.
Windows 10 Home 64-bit - Version 1511 - Build 10586.545
sqlitebrowser version 3.9.99 - Qt version 4.8.7 - sqlite version 3.13.0
It works! :smile:
Output for multiple FK constraints is as expected (I also tested a single constraint and it still works fine).
``` sql
CREATE TABLE `test_reference` (
`id1`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id2`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id3`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
`id4`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(`id1`,`id2`,`id3`),
);
```
I found it so odd that I couldn't open simultaneous sqlite database, that I figured I better ask here before assuming thats true and continuing my search
I would love to see multiple window support in this fine program.  Is there a feature request area somewhere?
Thank you for the speedy reply and I can certainly understand there is a never-ending list of things to do (and that are more important).  Unfortunately I'm running on OSX which is not as friendly about multiple copies of a program running as Windows is.
I'll put my +1 on this feature and hope for the best!  Thanks for the consideration, too.
I appreciate the extra info on an OSX work around.  I'll give it a try.
Hi
It would be nice to add an option to only export to SQL the records and not the whole structure of the database ie :
When using menu Export / To SQL add an option like 'Do not export Database/Tables Structure' in order to only have the "INSERT INTO" records in the SQL File.
This can allow exporting full data, make tables structure updates with a blank database, then import new records without having to delete all CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX records in the SQL File.
I'm sorry but I don't have sufficient skills to do it myself...
Thanks a lot.
Hi Martin
I just tested the last nightly build.
It works perfectly like I expected!
Thanks a lot !   it'll let me save lot of time !
Just a comment : are the instructions in the out SQL : BEGIN TRANSACTION; and COMMIT; mandatory, since when we import an SQL file created by the Export function it throw an exception : cannot begin a transaction within a transaction ?
Sorry for the OffTopic .... If necessary I'll open a new issue.
Thanks for your reply
Hi Justin
Sure I'm always interested.
No problem to test this option with my real data.
Let me know when the build is ready in order I test it.
Thanks a lot.
Sorry,
I had to deal with my car's issues...
because I use it as a portable version?
Thanks and please forgive me for the answer dealy..
OK.
No problem.
i'll test it on an x64 Windows 7 VM with my real data...
Hi,
I just tested functionnality.
Unfortunately, the message is always here.
I used the following sequence :
- File / Open database
******Open a freshly xreated database with empty tables
- File / Import / Database from SQL File
*****\* Chose the exported SQL file with options : keep column names in
INSERT INTO and Export data only
- At the question : would you create a new database...   -> answer No
Then the error is : Error : cannot start a transaction within a transaction
Thanks and sorry for the delay...
Hi all

time...
I've a VB program reading in a CSV and creating the necessary database records, so sqlite is creating a -journal file and squidging this into the database as and when required.  However, if I open the database in DB Browser while this is going, it either doesn't read the database schema (no tables are shown)
![2016-04-07 112037](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/14348191/cef0bada-fcb2-11e5-9a74-94b0c17e7f4b.jpg)
or (if it can grab a bit of the database in time) the number of records is screwy (but it has read the schema).
![2016-04-07 111223](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/14348136/7c2aecd0-fcb2-11e5-9c25-ab8717186a3e.jpg)
I assume this is 'by design' as the database file is being written to, and so the file can't be read.  However, I didn't know if it was possible to 'work around' (open the database read only?)
I tend to work on other tables, or need to check on what fields I've added to a table, while another program is adding data.  I appreciate dabbling with a 'live' database is akin to sticking fingers in a live electrical socket, but I'm willing to accept the risk...
Seeing 'no records' can be frustrating.  The obvious fix is to work on a copy of the database, but this can get messy.
Thanks for the reply.  The current limitation isn't major ... a pain, but understandable.  I could move the whole database to SQL server, but prefer the 'lite' way of a simple database and only one DLL to distribute for programs.
I appreciate its not a simple fix, but I didn't know if simply opening in 'read only' (a bit like how Word does ... if it can't open the file for writing, it opens it read-only) would work ... but thats no different to creating a copy of the database and working on that.
Hi
we are getting error when we open the DB. Error as follows
"sqllitebrowser.exe has stopped working"
please advise us how to work on this exe
Hi Kumar,
I posted a similar issue yesterday, and it's been posted a few times before. I'm assuming you're using Windows 7-10?
Here are the previous threads:
[Issue #552](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/552)
[Issue #543](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/543)
[Issue #495](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/495)
It appears this is a somewhat uncommon issue with no current fix. However, there is one current workaround using the Nightly Builds [Located here](http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/). Using the nightly build worked just fine for me and others. I hope this helps you move forward, and hopefully they are able to track to the cause of this crash soon!
When on the "Browse Data" tab, clicking "New Record" immediately inserts a new row containing default values into the database.  This causes the validation logic to run against those defaults, even though it is reasonable for a client to want to edit the values prior to inserting them.  It would be preferable to create a new UI element upon pressing the "New Record" button, but defer the insert statement until:
1) the row is deselected by the client, or
2) enter is pressed when not editing a cell value, or
3) the client attempts to change the table being browsed
Upon any of these user-initiated actions, if validation fails, show a dialog explaining the error and re-select the offending row.  To continue, the user must either click "Delete Record" or fix the offending data.  This enhancement is hinted at from #294, #463, and #514.
I double this and #463 , very irritating bug.
I just started using DB Browser for SQLite and each time I attempt to Create a new Database the program crashes with the error "sqlitebrowser.exe has stopped working..."
I'm using Windows 7 Profressional 64 bit, and I tried using both the 3.8 and 3.7 builds with no luck. I also tried opening as administrator, still no luck.
Is there something I'm doing wrong? Is there a setup step I'm missing?
Thanks!
Looks similar to [Issue #543](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/543)
And like the others, using the Nightly Build works with no issues.
Sure @justinclift, it will probably be tomorrow before I have a chance, but I'll give you a shout once I do.
The app's version number should be displayed in app's About Box and in Finder's GetInfo dialog.
OK I uploaded two screen shots to my initial report above. In doing so I discovered that I had been using the your version from Jan 2015 which doesn't show the version info in either the AboutBox nor Finder GetInfo, as reported.
However I then downloaded the latest version which does now show the version in the About Box, however the version info is still NOT displayed in the Version field of Finder GetInfo. Cheers, Joe
I uploaded the screen shots again here.... The About Box shot is from the Jan '15 version, and doesn't show the version but the latest build now does. The Finder GetInfo only shows the app name but no version info.

I am using SQLite browser to store data I have saved text data successfully but can't set or save the image in that. What do I need to do to save the image in SQLite browser? Please help me out.
I am using import button but it's not working. I need to store lots of images. Is there any way available ?
I am using the latest version. Just drag and drop is working but it is taking too much time to load the application when I run. Is there any other solution available ?
I want to just fetch the stored data (Images and text) from the SQLite database into my ios application.
I am having a large number of data to be stored in the database. I have saved some images with drag and drop option but it is taking too much time to load the app in simulator. I need a soultion for saving the images and fetching it from SQLite database.
The export SQL dialog has no option to select or de-select all. I ran into this issue when I wanted to export a subset of a very large database of about 70 tables, so I've added the two self-explanatory buttons.
I think another good improvement would be support for shift-clicking to select a range of tables, which I can also implement.
When in the 'Execute SQL' tab and entering SQL into the window, when I press the 'Execute current line', the SQL from the cursor downwards is executed, which isn't 'the current line'.  (am using Windows 3.7.0 ... also same behaviour in 3.8.0)
Unsure if this is 'by design' (kind of makes sense if you split SQL over several lines and want all those lines executed, eg half-way in the window...) but isn't quite 'what the button says will happen'.
Thanks.  I noticed that highlighting SQL and pressing F5 only executes the highlighted commands.  This seems an 'undocumented feature' ... unless its standard in other sql systems.  It gets around the above issue though... albeit a bit long-winded sometimes...
Hi
I just installed the latest version of sqllite browser on my 64 bit windows 10 PC.
The sqllite browser opens and when i click on new databases, the application crashes.
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2013 is also installed on my PC.
Can any of you please provide me with a solution for this problem?
Try execute in compatibility mode.
Hi,
I have selected the compatibility mode and tried in both win 8 and win 7 mode .... but still its not working.
Installing the nightly build version worked for me.
Thanks lawrence
Just as a 'fix' (which isn't a fix...) but as 'new database' always opens in a 'random' directory\* (or at least not where I want the database) I open an Explorer window and create a new file where I want it, call it 'xyz.sdb' and then double click this file.  This opens DB Browser with this file, and I can create tables as required.  DB Browser happily opens zero byte (empty) files.
*OK, not random, but not always the directory the last database was opened either.
Wondering if there Is there a limit on the number of records imported?
Querying the new imported table to count the row also returns a row count of 40001.
How certain are you that there are 42224 records? Is it possible there are extra line breaks, blank lines, etc? Can you share your .csv file?

I've managed to isolate the problem, and I believe it is a bug...
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17833200/14290602/87bc8998-fb57-11e5-9ce3-be5975079fa5.png)
In one of the fields being imported called Summary, is from a system that users have typed in a summary of an issue or problem raised in system testing, , and when the numpty users type some thing like
Exception raised in 'Ease of Use" API when blah blah etc has been done.....
In this instance, the user has opened Ease of Use with a single quote ' , but has close off with a double quote " . It appears the file import isn't escaping these properly. And then eats up all the characters across multiple rows, until there is another occurrence of this unmatched quoting! - which also occurred in the data dump I was using.
I proved the issue by 1) Exporting the newly imported  table back out as sql, into a text file, and could see multiple rows rolled up in one insert. and 2), Removing all the single & double quote characters from the data that was being imported, after which the row count corrected displayed 42224 rows as shown on the browse data tab in the GUI.
Great app BTW, it has helped me implement some data analysis code in excel, using the DB Browser as a tool to get data into a db. Hope this helps.
When copying a single cell (CTRL-C) that contains multi-line text, and then pasting it (CTRL-V) on another single cell, each line from the multi-line text fills another row of the table in the database.
But it already works correctly when multiple (multi-line) source cells are copy-pasted,  So, why have a different behavior for the single source cell in the first place?  To me this seems counter-productive.
There could be (like it is done in spreadsheets) a 'Special Copy' menu bar (e.g., Edit/SpecialCopy) option where the copy is performed in an alternate or user-defined way.
But don't you think the default behavior should be identical for either single or multi-cell source?
IMO behavior we can see now is quite convenient. Definitely it should be kept as default one to avoid confusion of users that are used to it.
I think the best way to handle pending change would be "Multiline text copy" switch with "line per entry" and "all to one entry" values possible.
I would put it under View -> Preferences -> Data browser menu
Agree, it will be better.
Are you meaning some kind of radio setting in menu bar which will change behavior until switched to other option  or actually option for one time paste?
In first case if user will set option to all-to-one, pasting of multiline text will always lead to adding of one field per paste, while in second case it will only paste one entry for multiline text if user will click, let's say, Edit -> Paste -> Buffer to one entry.
Also, I'm confident setting name should be about pasting data, not copying. And it might be good to use Ctrl+v for entry-per-line paste and Ctrl+Shift+v for all-text-to-one (as in other programs, where Ctrl+V used for formatted input, while Ctrl+Shift+V for plain text entry)
But what about Mac OS users? Do they have menu bar? Have asked two people and they gave me different answers
Lets have table like this:
CREATE TABLE "Foo" (
`Id`    INTEGER,
`Name`  TEXT NOT NULL,
`Bar`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(Id),
);
If you edit it within the app, unique constraint is not read from the DB and after edit it is gone completely.
Ah sry :)
Its with 3.8.0 on Fedora 23 x86_64
Hi, I've tested it with the current master and it seems to work. Thanks!
I'm running Version 2.0b1 on Linux Mint 17.3 XFCE.
If I try to set an alternative location it shows it in the text box and I click OK. The config file (SQLite Database Browser 2.conf) is saved in ~/.config/sqlitebrowser.sf.net. But when I try to open a database it goes straight to my home folder.
When I go back to Preferences it now has my home folder shown
[db]
defaultencoding=UTF8
defaultnewdata=NULL
defaultlocation=/home/xxxx/Data/xxx/Desktop/gps/
defaulttext=Plain
Is the preference file saved somewhere else ?
Hi
Thanks for quick response.
With a little trepidation I decided to compile as suggested.
Loaded dependencies, then ran as per website.
All worked OK.
Now have working version 3.8.0
Thanks a lot

When writing SQL in the "Execute SQL" pane, the browser tries to suggest table names in a similar manner to IntelliSense in some IDEs. It interferes with my typing. I really hate this feature. How can I disable it?
When in the browser tab, CTRL-UpArrow or CTRL-DnArrow currently behave (AFAIK) like simple Up/DnArrow except for moving the marker.
I propose these keyboard shortcuts be used instead for selecting previous next table/view (in the order these appear in the drop-down list above but order is not really of much importance).
This makes it very fast (for those of us who prefer the keyboard over the mouse) to change table/view.
Thank you.
Seems OK.  Would it be possible to open a sqlite3 database hosted on a remote server (Azure to be specific), provided the connected using has the proper authorization?
These are options I thought of:
a) connect to the remote location and run the sqlite3 command on the server.
b) I believe azure is windows hosting (although can be linux, I think) so that means you can install sqlitebrowser on that thing and open the db locally, right?
c) download the database and use sqlitebrowser to browse it locally.
But I agree with Justin, make a copy of the db and look at it, especially if it's still being written to and used.
I use option a today, but I just found the sqlitebrowser yesterday and
thought it would be nice if I could connect directly from the client to the
remote DB file.  I did find an ODBC for sqlite that has promise.
_Thomas F. McGeehan V_  Hi,
Really great product! The only issue I've come across so far is that when I import a csv that I exported from Excel, my data rows get reversed:
![table_reversed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16559983/13459914/0b01b2b6-e045-11e5-8ec7-bf616931372c.jpg)
As you can see, I've added a column called "ID" and designated it as Primary Key. It matches the order of the data in the csv. Does the built-in rowid order matter? Am I in good shape as long as the PK order is correct?
Thanks again,
Matt
My code is this
```
static void Main()
{
NewMethod();
NewMethod1();
}
private static void NewMethod()
{
System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteConnection.CreateFile("test");
SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder sb = new SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder();
sb.DataSource = "test";
sb.Version = 3;
System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteConnection c = new System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteConnection(sb.ConnectionString);
c.SetPassword( "123");
c.Open();
c.Close();
}
private static void NewMethod1()
{
SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder sb = new SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder();
sb.DataSource = "test";
sb.Version = 3;
System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteConnection c = new System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteConnection(sb.ConnectionString);
c.Open();
}
```
And i have no exception at end!
I'm having difficulty adding a record when a check constraint is defined. I can provide a db example offline if anyone can help me?
I just came across a concrete example for this:
```
CREATE TABLE "AAA" (
"FIELD" TEXT,
CONSTRAINT "AAA-FIELD-EVEN_LENGTH_CHECK"
CHECK(LENGTH("FIELD") % 2 = 0)
)
```
The fix for issue #505 seemed to fix some of these (check constraints with logical connectives such as AND/OR before that fix also exhibited this behavior), but the constraint parser clearly has some unresolved issues.  The above table prevents inserting new records (or browsing the data within it) in the April 3, 2016 nightly build.
For previous versions, I can drag a sqlite file onto the app to open it. I find it inconvenience to use the open database button, and navigate to the file, since folders for  iOS simulator are difficult to locate. Hope this can be fixed in next version.
@justinclift Thanks for the quick reply and looking into the issue.
I meant to drag and drop a .sqlite file on a running instance. In my case, drag-n-drop opens a Finder for me, but not automatically opens the sqlite file.
By the way, my Mac OS version is 10.11.3. I have also tried to `brew install sqlitebrowser`, and it still doesn't work.
Hi, jumping in here because of the "help wanted tag".
(Similarly, @justinclift, you cannot really drop a file onto an instance because an instance is not a GUI element. Did you mean to have dropped the file onto the app's open window or did you mean its Dock icon?)
Also, which version are you using? ... Oh crap, the OSX app does not even show a version in the Get Info window. That should be fixed (I guess the Qt system is responsible for missing out on that?) Anyway, my About window shows 3.8.99 for me, and there D&D works on 10.11.3 for me.
Please try one thing: Create a copy of a db file, and rename it so that it ends in .db instead of .sqlite. Can you drag that file onto the app icon then?
Oh, BTW, the way the file extensions are declared in the Info.plist do not seem to be correct because the "Open With" operation on a .sqlite file does not offer the app as it should. I may be able to help fixing this but that would that you'd be able to make custom edits / additions to the Info.plist and not depend on Qt(?) auto-generating everything (what it's currently putting in there is rather outdated and not fully correct, IMO). Can you do that? I am not a fan of Qt and thus have no installation to try myself.
OK, let's see what @inksword finds out. Happy to help.
@tempelmann
Great! It works if I drop the file onto the app icon in either the dock or the Applications directory. However, it doesn't work if I D&D the file on the GUI window. Here are the answers for your previous questions, FYI:
- I am actually D&D on the app's GUI window
- My sqlitebrowser version is 3.8.0, Qt version is 4.8.7, SQLite version 3.9.2
- I created a test.db with sqlitebrowser, and D&D on the GUI window, and a finder window opened
D&D

The finder window actually points to the user's home folder.
![screen shot 2016-02-28 at 9 22 26 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6120048/13376678/26100980-ddfd-11e5-84e5-c409342ab25f.png)
Still don't understand, how it could happen that dragging a file over the app's window can lead to opening a window from the Finder.
The Finder can indeed open new windows during D&D, but only if you target a folder shown by the Finder, e.g. a folder icon on the desktop or in another Finder window, and when you then hover your dragged file for 2s over it (can be turned on/off in the Finder prefs, or at least used to be so).
However, if there's another app's window in front of the Finder target, this should not be happening.
Curious. But not really a big issue any more, I'd say.
I could not input Chinese characters into the fields of the data browser. But copying and pasting works find.
I am wondering this is a bug or it is simply not supported yet? Thanks!
I am using version 3.8 on Ubuntu 14.04.
May I take a look at it and submit a PR if I come up with a fix?
I'm still using WinXP 64bit SP2.
There were no problems with SQLiteBrowser 3.7 Portable.
For ver.3.8 Portable, the
SQLiteDatabaseBrowserPortable\App\SQLiteDatabaseBrowser32\sqlitebrowser.exe
runs ok
while
SQLiteDatabaseBrowserPortable\App\SQLiteDatabaseBrowser64\sqlitebrowser.exe
windows doesn't recognize as a compatible application and doesn't start it.
Why are builders not using a compatible compiler???
Bij modify a cell, the title of the screen is "Edit database cell".
This screen fly van center to the left top corner.
**Example:**
"5684 GM" --> "5684GM" --> no space inside string (screen center), next
"5684 WX" -->"5684WX" --> no space inside (screen left top), screen center, screen left to
en so on.
-Open a Database.
-Browse Data (filled database).
-Double click on a cell (filled).
A screen with the name "Edit database cell" is shown, position left top corner.
-Press now the button cancel.
Double press again on the same cell.
The screen what is shown has now a different postion (centre)
Repeat this several times.
I checked out the source, ran `qmake` in the source directory, then `nmake`, and got this output:

I don't have Windows 7.
@justinclift Nope.
@glawrence It's cool; I ended up just downloading the binaries.
But it's not fixed?
So it's not planned to support Qt 5.6?
I have upgraded from 3.4.0 (win32) to 3.8.0(win64v2) and now DB Browser for SQLite is saying the database I have is invalid.
I have dropped down to 3.7.0(win64) and that opens the database fine.
Hi, sorry for the delay.
I have been able to open the DB on Fedora 21 using a different version of SQLite 3.8.11.1
sqlite> .version
SQLite 3.8.11.1 2015-07-29 20:00:57 cf538e2783e468bbc25e7cb2a9ee64d3e0e80b2f

Ported over from this issue: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/428#issuecomment-147124785
Not sure if this is a bug or not, but the output panel font remains unchanged despite changing the **SQL Log Font Size**:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/121520/13150645/74d88c0c-d61b-11e5-814d-d98956c1b73f.png)
Is the output pane _the_ considered the "log"? if not, then obviously it's not a bug. But would love to have the option to configure it.
The other perhaps orthogonal suggestion is that the output pane have some kind of visual cue to show that something has happened when a query executes. Even as a moderate "power" user of SQL and of DB Browser, I sometimes forget I have to look down there to see if my query had an error or if I just wrote a query that returned a nonsensical empty set (it varies depending on which monitor I'm using and how large the editor is currently stretched out to...).
A cue that an **error** happened would be especially useful. Not for people like me, but perhaps for the Excel-to-SQLite users who are used to have Alert Boxes thrown in their faces when an error happens. But don't make it an alert box...a little red highlight around the output pane (or error text) is good enough :)
v. 3.8.0 for Windows (64 bit)
1. Create new sqlite database.
2. When prompted to create table, hit cancel.
3. Go to File > Import > Table from CSV file...
4. Select a CSV file where the column names are in the first row.
5. Check option for "Column names in first line".
6. Click "OK".
Table will be created but the column names will still be in the first row. Columns will be named "field[n]...".
Perhaps this is intentional but most other db GUIs I've worked with would take that first row and name the columns based on the text in that column's cell. That's the expectation I have when I select that option. If I don't select that option, I still get the column names in one of the rows but I now get a blank line above that row at row #1.
I've followed those same exact steps and could not re-create this bug. The columns are named as expected. Is there anything else you did not mention in your test case? (Using windows 7 x64)
I forgot to post back a follow-up. The problem wasn't with the sqlitebrowser, it is with the CSV. If the tool that generates the file has white space before your first row, probably a line break, then you get the effect mentioned.
I'm using 3.8 on Windows 10. When I am entering text in a cell I press the Enter key to save the cell/row. In 3.7 that simply did what I expected. It saved the changes. But in 3.8 it saves the changes then pops up the cell editor window, but the contents of the editor are the old value of the cell BEFORE my last entry change. I have to remember hit Esc or Cancel the dialog each time. This is unexpected and confusing behavior, and causes extra steps and potential data loss. I don't mind that the Enter key pops up the cell editor window, but only when I was NOT editing a field. Popping up the editor dialog should be the behavior only when I am navigating cells. And if/when it does pop up it must contain the latest version of the cell, not some previous version.
I'm getting this too, on Windows 7. I notice it when attempting in-place editing.
@MKleusberg: that seems to be fine! Thanks for the suggestion (which I should have thought of myself).
Might I suggest that rolling this change into a production release be given some priority, because the status quo gives the appearance of data loss, and could conceivably result in same if the user doesn't work around the problem correctly.
I'm glad I created a github account for this issue. :)
I have verified that this is fixed in the nightly builds. I look forward to the 3.9 release.
I don't like how the name is just 'sqlitebrowser.app', so i always rename it to be SQLite Browser, is there a way to modify the build scripts so it has a prettier name by default? =)
maybe it needs to be escaped? "SQLite\ Browser.app" ?
Version 3.8.0
Qt Version 4.8.7
SQLite Version 3.9.2
2.8 MB database file (3 tables, 5 views, 3 indexes) is taking several minutes to open.  Once finally open, any operations are taking a very long time, often leading to a freeze which requires the application to be force quit.
Wow, huge difference with the version I just built from the prebuilt one. Not only are the issues noted above gone, but overall the application is significantly more performant.
Has there been any thought to using an update installer? This way users can just press "Install & Restart" instead of having to go to the GitHub & re-download.
One that comes to mind for Mac OS X is this: https://sparkle-project.org/
My apologies - my issue search somehow didn't turn that issue up!
I'm afraid I don't have enough time or experience with OS X (only Swift for iOS) to get it working at the moment.
hello , just installed look so quality but unfortunately on windows 10 desktop icon low on pixel can you please modify the icon ,i am ok with the image itself but looks ugly when pixels are low
Does the Windows version support SQLCipher?
Hello,
in attached database, i perform the following query:
select \* from M1 left join M2 on M1.timestamp = M2.timestamp
This delivers the below result (in CSV format):
timestamp,M1,timestamp,M2
2015-07-15 23:59:51,0.0,2015-07-15 23:59:51,10.0

2015-07-15 23:59:54,3.0,,
2015-07-15 23:59:55,4.0,,
2015-07-15 23:59:56,5.0,2015-07-15 23:59:56,13.0

2015-07-15 23:59:58,7.0,2015-07-15 23:59:58,15.0
2015-07-15 23:59:59,8.0,,
But in the plot I can only select 'timestamp' and 'M1'.  'M2' is not available presumably because there are NULL values present in that column.
Is it possible to add a feature to have this column available also in the plot, and draw previous value or Nothing (plot with holes) when NULL values are present in the query result?
Best regards
Carl.

Hi Justin, how can I make use of and test the nightly builds for Windows64 if I sit on a sqlitebrowser **portable app** version and have no administer priviledges?
Regards
Great! I checked this before but was'nt successful. But you encouraged me to hang on. And in addition to your hints, for me I needed to replace (update) the platforms directory in addition to the files mentioned by you.
...
Hm, as I see by now, you already mentioned the platforms directory by yourself.
Wiki is a good idea, cause next time I like to use a nightly, I will not remember what I've just learned here ;-)
Well, thanx
Ralf  Hello,
in attached database, i perform the attached query.
[test_db.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/121597/test_db.zip)
The fix is working with this build http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/sqlitebrowser-win64-issue639v2-201607131125.exe but not with this one http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser.exe.zip
I tried the latest nightly build just now, and still the same problem.
Windows 7 SP1 (64-bit).
I don't think it is DB4S fault though. It could be a library problem. Cause after I reverted back to official version (3.8.0), show rowid is now working correctly.
To make it more clear, I was using the official version (3.8.0) and I had both problems (crashing, and not refreshing rowid). Then I uninstalled it, and installed the one @justinclift made in the the "win64-onceoffs" folder, and it fixed both. He told me to test the nightly build, and this build fixed the crash bug only. Then I uninstalled this "onceoff" version, and went back to the official one (3.8.0) and it is showing rowid correctly now.
| Link | Crash | Show rowid | Qt |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [sqlitebrowser-3.8.0-win64v2.exe](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/v3.8.0/sqlitebrowser-3.8.0-win64v2.exe) | Yes | Working | 5.5.1 |

| [sqlitebrowser.exe.zip](http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser.exe.zip) | No | NOT Working | 4.8.7 |
True. But to be honest, it could be also something on my PC. Anyway, I'm using the version you made and it is working fine. I will just wait for the next release (3.9.0) and see how it goes. Thanks @justinclift and @revolter for your help. :+1:
sqlitebrowser-win64-issue639v2-201607131125.exe  Working  Qt 5.6.0

I'd like to be able to go direct into the 'Browse Data' tab from the command line.  I.e. something like "sqlitebrowser --browse boat.db", if this isn't possible now then this is an enhancement request.
Also, is there anywhere to ask this sort of question, I'd prefer a mailing list but I guess a forum would do.  Twitter really doesn't seem a sane way to handle technical[ish] discussions.
I have already suggested that the default tab on entry be the browser as it is the most likely place one wants to be in the majority of cases.  I don't even think an option should be needed.  Maybe the option should be there to go directly to one of the other tabs.
That still doesn't help getting to a specific table, though I agree it does seem to be a sensible default.
Right, and your suggestion only specified the db file, not the table.
Maybe you meant something like
sqlitebrowser some.db --browse sometable
Then, I would suggest, the browser again to be the default, and on the command line to simply say:
sqlitebrowser some.db -t sometable
(-t for table)
Oops, yes, you're right.  I didn't make it clear that I want to go direct to a specific table.
I agree an option is possibly the best approach.  (Preferably a command-line one, and a short one like -t to avoid typing too much all the time that specifies directly the table to browse.)
As for the 'intelligent' behavior I don't think it will actually work in practice because (for me, at least) most databases have more than one table/view, so I would end up back in the original (current) behavior, which I don't enjoy very much.  Unless, of course, it is in addition to having an option as described above.
So, if there is a single table, yes, go to browse that one table, but if there are more tables, check if the option says which one, else (no option) go to datastucture tab.
(BTW, why does opening a big table cause a delay?  Is the whole table read in all at once instead of pages as they are displayed -- you know with the LIMIT ... OFFSET clause?)
Thanks.

It would be useful to have the ability to specify somehow where to go
in the table, especially if it's a big one.  Default to 'last n
records' that fit on the page with 'last' meaning most recent.
Excellent!  I have just built from the latest source and there it is, a -t option to specify the table to browse.  Thank you.  I was actually going to try and do it myself (that's why I got the source) but it's done already.
In latest (last night's) build, whatever changes I make in the edit box are not accepted, either by CTRL-ENTER or pressing the OK button.  (The problem could have been introduced earlier because I haven't been updating on a daily basis for some time now.)
The fix worked but it still has one minor issue.
When typing directly on the cell and pressing ENTER, the edit box does not update with the new value.
I get an error when I try to modify the following table:
```
Sqlite parse error:  "line 5:72: unexpected token: NULL" ( "CREATE TABLE \"anime\" (\n\t`id`\tINTEGER,\n\t`name`\ttext NOT NULL,\n\t`type`\tTEXT NOT NULL,\n\t`ep_watched`\tinteger NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK(`ep_total` is NULL or `ep_watched` <= `ep_total`),\n\t`ep_total`\tinteger DEFAULT NULL,\n\t`status`\tTEXT NOT NULL,\n\t`date_started`\ttext DEFAULT NULL,\n\t`date_finished`\ttext DEFAULT NULL,\n\t`animedb_id`\tinteger NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n\t`anidb_id`\tINTEGER UNIQUE,\n\tPRIMARY KEY(id),\n\tFOREIGN KEY(`type`) REFERENCES anime_types ( type ) on delete restrict on update cascade,\n\tFOREIGN KEY(`status`) REFERENCES anime_statuses ( status ) on delete restrict on update cascade\n)" )
```
Here's a cleaned up version:
```
Sqlite parse error:  "line 5:72: unexpected token: NULL"
( "CREATE TABLE \"anime\" (
`id`    INTEGER,
`name`  text NOT NULL,
`type`  TEXT NOT NULL,
`ep_watched`    integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK(`ep_total` is NULL or `ep_watched` <= `ep_total`),
`ep_total`  integer DEFAULT NULL,
`status`    TEXT NOT NULL,
`date_started`  text DEFAULT NULL,
`date_finished` text DEFAULT NULL,
`animedb_id`    integer NOT NULL UNIQUE,
PRIMARY KEY(id),
)" )
```
Yep, looks like it's fixed.
Version: 3.8.0
SQLite version: 3.9.2
In the "Execute SQL" tab, I can run:
```
select load_extension("path to extension");
select new_function(...)
```
but if the startup file has
```
select load_extension("path to extension");
```
then when attempting to run `new_function` I receive:
```
no such function: new_function: new_function(...);
```
Furthermore, this startup file fails to modify the pragmas:
```
```
if the database is supplied to the command line, the startup file is executed, as expected. The startup file is only ignored when the database is opened via the GUI.
Mac version 3.8.0. If I have a SQL Output with say 1,000 rows, clicking the top left corner of the window should select all records in the output window. In reality, it only selects the visible records (10 or so).
A related bug is the scroll bar in the output window. I can't grab it and scroll to the bottom and thus shift-click the last row to easily work around this bug. I have to resort to shift + page down. This used to work in previous versions though.
Thanks for a great tool though.
I would usually do one of two things which both worked.
I would click the top left hand corner to select everything then command c to copy.
If I didn't need everything I would click whichever columns I needed to select everything in that column(s). Then again command c to copy. Both approaches worked prior to the current version.
All the best,
Chip.
Hmmm….
I thought I would try the ole quit and restart. That fixed the issue. I usually keep sqlitebrowser open for a long time, sometimes even for days. But I checked and after a restart of the app, it’s fixed. Sorry for all the trouble.
Regards,
Chip.
Hello Sqlitebrowser team!
I've been using Sqlite + SqliteBrowser to replace a very expensive only MongoDB service. It's been working great for me, but most of my work consists of 'dumping' data and retrieving it, without a lot of complex queries. Thus, I've been using @piskvorksky's SqliteDict (for python), which 'pickles' the values and stores them in the table.
While I am not particularly connected to 'pickling', it would be really great if there were a 'decoding' of most common encodings in the fields. For example, one might dump entire ProtoBuf (google's)  objects into the database, and be able to see 'real-time' changes, as it is decoded by the viewer.
Thank you!
Now that you mention, I might try to get my hands on trying to implement my request. The things that I learn, I'll document, it'll be useful as a foundation for other extension-makers.
I just need onee hint to get started. I'm trying to figure out the point between the query returning results, and the results being displayed, but have been unable to do so. Any idea what file/lines I should be looking at?
Somewhat related, perhaps it might be a good idea for someone more knowledgeable to add a little bit of documentation, if only in the header files, and at a file level? _That_ would definitely be a great first step towards starting a healthy extension environment.
Hi Guys,
Tried a basic "sqlitebrowser-3.8.0-win64v2.exe /S", and "sqlitebrowser-3.8.0-win64v2.exe /?" to see if there where any options, but the installer just launched.
Cheers
Hey @justinclift . I meant to post back before @rp did with the same info, and indeed I though I had tried this very option (see first post), as when I first checked I though I still saw all the install wizard dialogues relating to folders etc. However, running this again worked slightly differently second time round.
Because I already had sqlitebrowser installed, I still saw prompts, firstly to ask if I want to uninstall the "old" (but same) version, then the uninstall wizard. However, the actual install did progress fine.
Not sure if it is possible to override the uninstall/upgrade dialogues as well?
Hi no Problem, I feel happy that finally there is progress. Well the fetch all button seems to work. 2 Points here: 1) maybe the fetch all button could be "highlighted" - or make visible - only in case, that it is of use, as to say, when the actually plotted data are actually limited? 2) when the fetch all data button is activated surely it tooks a while til all data are loaded and plotted - but I miss the "hour glass" here, to get informed that something really miraculouse is happening under the hood.
Ah, and unfortunately the original issue "Plot misses columns with NULL as first value" is still not affected by this patch.
But thanx for this first step

Hello, I seem to have a fix for this issue.
I use sqlitebrowser in a course at my university, and noticed the problem.  The cause of this issue was the Scintilla Editor output being drawn to a buffer which as it seems was not being scaled correctly. (Source: http://scintilla-interest.narkive.com/Yb4Qbh9h/scintilla-gtk-on-retina-displays)
I managed to fix the issue by setting `bufferedDraw = false` in `EditView.cpp`, in the Scintilla library.  I'm unsure if modifying the bundled library is this is within this project's constraints though.  (The modification to the app.plist file does not affect rendering or buffering within Scintilla).
In my fork, I also made some other changes to the default font size, bumped from 8 to 13 in the editor, and up to 12 in the data view.  Perhaps we could add a menu item for "High DPI mode" or some such so it's not the default for people on machines that lack high dpi support?
The before/after images are at the top of this, including the unit tests, which all passed.  I do hope this can be added, as I've seen a couple of other people reporting this issue.

That's awesome!  :smile:
I am working on the pull request, just going to try and squash my git commit history first, per the developer wiki.  For this commit, I'll just disable the `bufferedDraw`, so the rest of the settings stay the original defaults (they are more of a personal preference, and I wouldn't want to impose).
I'd be delighted to test out the nightlies for the next builds as well. :smile:
Cheers!
sorry, wrong repository... -.-
Upon selecting the open database button the program crashes after 3-4 seconds. It dosn't seem to matter weather or not I select a file/folder or not. The same thing happens when using file -> open or control + o. Im using windows 10 for home (64 bit). I have tried using the portable and 64 bit version but both experience this crash.
Thank you, that has fixed it.
Ok, if you need me to send any logs or anything then please let me know.
Yes that is what I mean - no other information appears. Only the standard sqlitebrowser.exe has stopped working.
Thanks, I'm afraid I'm currently away but will definitely try asap when I get back on the 26th August. Nice work guys!
One above has fixed the issue for me and works perfectly - nice one :smile:

thank you!
thanks for the sqlite-devel tip -- @justinclift would it be possible to add this to the building.md for centos?
Ah your right it is.  My apologies -- I was looking at the building.md from tar.gz that I grabbed from the main site: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/archive/v3.8.0.tar.gz
I just discovered Sqlitebrowser. Many thanks for this project, very useful to rename fields !
Two years ago, I had to convert a mysql database to sqlite and it was difficult to find a free tool, so I wrote my own.
I think it is fairly good now and includes tables and data (of course !) indexes and Foreign Key constraints. I think you write in C, my script is written in Python, but it could give you the structure and the sql requests.
I thought it would be interesting to integrate in your program importing a mysql database.
You find the code here : https://github.com/Averell7/mysql2sqlite
Note I have also a sqlite to mysql, but it is much more limited, only tables and data, just because I am lazy and didn't need more...
I'm use version 3.8.0 and if I want put a filter (for example C) it doesnt work.
I read https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Using-the-Filters but not work.
Yes
![filterz](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5431180/12264103/1b1067dc-b913-11e5-9b56-9891bf44d742.png)
I exit and then I enter to the application and now work.
I remember that I create the table, insert some records, write changes an then test filter and its not work. Maybe this was the problem.
Is it possible to set to 0 this delay time (it's a bit annoying waiting the app refresh the list)?
Or create a preference item where insert the delay time...
Sorry for the delay (busy time).
I just tryed and it works well.
But I noticed that app is very very slow if showing very large table (with or without the delay time)
I am editing my sqlite database for Android application on OSX 10.11.2. I have both AndroidStudio and SQLiteBrowser (3.8.0) opened. My database is broken after hours of editing and saving on each change. There must be something in the backround chaning the database file, maybe AndroidStudio, or the AndroidVirtualMachine. Changes are partial - lots of fields are blanked. Please introduce backround file change detection. I have lost my hours of work two times already. SQLiteBrowser does not verify the written file, so I am writing into pure space and the results are lost. Please add database file verification.
OSX 10.11.2

There is no concurrency problem. No other application have access to a database file. SQLiteBrowser 3.8.0 corrupts sqlite database files - it does not save what it show, it does corrupt database file!!!!! :-1:
I have local file. Simple case. At first I though that would be concurrent access problems. But then I rebooted with nothing else accessing the sqlite file. I was only editing it with SQLiteBrowser. For some reason it does not save data into database, and even worse it randomly blanks some fields..
What I did was to put some data into table cells, then save, then refresh view of that table by re-selecting it from the list, and some data was gone... sometimes data was on refresh but it was gone when I closed and reopened the file. I had to repeat until success, but finally I have switched to dbeaver.. :-(
I have reviewed the source files and found no issues in concurrence with your problem too which I also  have been using this application for creating pre generated databases for mobile development and I have not had these same issues. From the sounds of your problem you may have a coding logic error. As justinclift has stated Android does have some issues that are related to using a pre generated database and thus it is at times best to programmatically generate it.
Nope, I access only sqlite, modify database, store database, close database, open database that is already corrupted. Maybe that is dependency/libraries problem for a binary download. I am also using MacPorts tree for the rest of the OpenSource.. no clue :-)
hello @justinclift, that database crop is not the case in my case, i am working on a file that is source for apk that is then copied to app data directory, so its one way operation.. but your notice is valuable thanks!! :-) yea hope so! =)
maybe concurrent access from AndroidStudio and SQLiteBrowser? is sqlite file modified anyhow on open? although its only read once a while to copy, maybe some race condition occurs.. it would be nice to make a md5 sum of the opened file and verify against external file change..?  Application crashed after I have entered id field that was already taken, then warning popped up, I pressen Esc, and application crashed.

That did not happen every time, randomly.. but also I got database corruption very very often.
Does OSX package depends on any external libraries or everything is included? Maybe there is a conflict with MacPorts packages/libraries?
Getting this on Windows 7 as well. A reliable way to reproduce this would be to create a database with the following without using the wizard. Just go straight to SQL input.
``` SQL
CREATE TABLE `SOME_names` (
`id`    INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
);
```
Then add a few records:
``` SQL
INSERT INTO SOME_names (username) VALUES
('Billybob'),
('SuzyQ'),
('Janey');
```
Now using the Add Record button for that table, try to input 'SuzyQ' again. It will throw an error detecting that SuzyQ already exists, but once you click 'OK' then try to head back to the main app. Here it crashes and burns.
The only common thing I see here is that @cederom and I are both using underscores. While I suspect that shouldn't affect things, I still wonder if it has any play.
No problem @justinclift, the only thing with crashing it on Win7 is that it doesn't generate a crash report for you guys. If it does, I don't know where to look for it.
Able to verify on both Win 10 and OS X 10.10, but only for the most recent release version (3.8.0), and not for the nightly build from Apr-23-2016. It seems to have been fixed in the meantime.
I used the examples by Lech above to verify. The only way I could get it to reproduce was to press enter after adding an already existing row. Warning dialog appeared and could be closed normally, if simply clicking elsewhere (outside of cell being edited) to remove focus and end editing.
The 3.8.0 version seems to be popping up a new window "Edit database cell" for detailed editing a lot more often than the nightly (Can't tell if maybe every time I end edit with enter?) If that may have been/might be relevant? Adding a duplicate row from the detailed edit window doesn't seem to cause the crash either.
Nice app, btw :)
Sorry for the late response, I just tested my example against a 3.8.99 nightly under Windows 10 Pro and it appears to be behaving itself fresh out of the box.  :+1:  Thanks!
Also thanks to @MKleusberg with a work-around for 3.8.0 until the next stable version is available. :smiley:
Sorry,  this was in error.
@justinclift It looks like I ended up implementing this 😄 Could you take a look at it? It was so hard for me to implement this fairly simple feature. But I'm understanding Qt and the project structure more and more ❤️.
When searching, the list of found items appears in the grid below.
Pressing down arrow (while still in the search box) highlights row number but not the whole cell (as if when clicked).  Pressing right arrow (or TAB) does not go to the cell, either.
Pressing ESC, when in the result grid, could go back up to the search box to let one type another search.  Now it does nothing.
Thanks.
No, I just noticed this.  It's not a bug, rather a 'polishing' of the UI for easier use by keyboard.
Greetings everyone,
My goal is to re-compile sqlitebrowser for Windows with the support to open encrypted database. I downloaded the source code and already "scan" the support you insert in source (#ifdef ENABLE_SQLCIPHER)
I have Qt 5.4 & sqlcipher (binary & almagation files - license trial from Zetetic, and source code avaible ofc), but I dont know which steps to follow to attach sqlcipher with sqlitebrowser.
For now I did:
qmake CONFIG+=sqlcipher
make
But it gives me this error (which I though do not related much on sqlcipher...):

Do you have any ideas what is gone wrong? Is there anything I miss in the configuration steps?
Thanks a lot for any helps,
Best regards,
Hi guys,
Sorry for duplicate posts in here and your private mail @justinclift, I guess we should discuss here from now on, It'll be easier for both of us :)
Yes indeed, I usually compile my other Qt projects with mingw32 and this configuration and it works fine.
This error showned up when I tried to compile antlr lib. I'm not sure that it depends on string_s.h (which is standard) from other packages or not.
Following this link, I must have MXE to compile? I had msys2 already https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#cross-compiling-for-windows
And then in the cmake file, I find some absolute path for the libs, which means that I have to set it to the right path on my system?

Oh wrong call, it is a cross-compiling for Windows from Linux, won't work with me then :(
So if I stay in Windows and use cmake (with mingw) is it still possible?
When I ran cmake -Dsqlcipher, it gives me this error:
-- Could NOT find Antlr2 (missing:  ANTLR2_LIBRARIES ANTLR2_INCLUDE_DIRS)
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
Eventhough I already add the path to my sqlcipher lib files:
find_library(LIBSQLITE ${LIBSQLITE_NAME} HINTS /local32/dst/sqlcipher/lib)
set(ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_PATHS ${ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_PATHS} /local32/dst/sqlcipher/include)
I had libsqlcipher.a & libsqlcipher.la in lib directory (build from sqlcipher source with same MingW 32 tools). I wonder is these 2 files the CMake are looking for?
2nd questions: I must set these variables to the path of sources or binary?
SQLITE3_PATH
OPENSSL_PATH
I bypass the error when run "cmake -Dsqlcipher=1" when force link library to a pre-compiled sqlite3.dll. However, when I run "make", the same error that I had in the 1st post with qmake is reproduced, and I still have no idea why...
Finally, I manage to compile with MSVC compiler & Visual studio + sqlcipher lib precompiled, it seems that it won't work without MSVC compiler. I now have sqlcipher browser works perfectly.
Thanks a lot for all your helps! :)
Hi @glawrence
I would love to contribute for your community. But I don't know what to write much about, it's pretty straightforward in fact. I just hesitated to choose the build tools (qmake or cmake, gcc or MSVC...)
So my build set is : MSVC + cmake, in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
In general you guys all setup already all .vcproj file, config & build step. All that I have to modify is the paths to dependancies (sqlcipher, Qt for MSVC 32 bits) in CMakeLists.txt file (which for now is not generic, but point to local path of your build, I think for the future you can setup some find[Package] with CMake for those dependancies).
The roughest part must be figuring out which sqlcipher .dll I have to link with, because I have differents builds from differents sources, but I choosed a C/C++ DLL for Windows pre-compiled that I order a trial from SQLCipher main site web.
Rather than make the package generic, I just modify it to make it work on my local build. I don't know if it's useful to improve your work?
> Does anyone know where to set that?
You set this in cmake-gui by selecting a 64 bit generator. All 64 bit generators for Visual Studio will have Win64 at the end.
> So, I'm unsure where it's getting x86 from. ???
The default generator is 32 bit
BTW, You can also set the generator on the command line via cmake -G "generator"
cmake --help
will list the options.
just tried no luck
To reproduce:
Type some SELECT into the SQL and execute it (BTW, CTRL-ENTER does not work for that, only F5 -- this is another issue).
The result will show up in a grid box, but going to the cells will not update the Edit Box (even though in read-only mode just like a View)
Still does not work with the keyboard -- moving from cell to cell does not update the edit box.  It only with mouse clicks.
The CTRL-ENTER issue is OK.
(BTW, what happened to the statically built daily releases?) Well, I didn't say it should be editable.  However, the reason IMO you need the read-only edit box is because long cell contents are easier to read that way, rather than directly from the grid cell. Indeed, now ENTER is needed all the time for **both** keyboard and mouse.  (This feels awkward to me.  It's certainly worse for mouse users as they now have to use both mouse and keyboard.)
I'm not sure of the previous mouse behavior but didn't it update the edit box with each mouse click?  If so, then perhaps the mouse click event could be 'manually' called whenever the grid cell is changed by keyboard, no?  (I suppose there is some way to detect that, I don't know QT.)
Regarding multi-selection, the edit box should always show the most recently accessed grid cell contents.  Using 3.8.0, and the nightly build from 6 Jan.
When you add data via the 'browse data' table, when you press Enter to confirm data in a cell (or add new data) the 'edit database cell' window appears.  This didn't occur in 3.7.0.
If you add new data into a cell (eg, 'test') and press Enter to confirm this data, the 'edit database cell' window appears, but it is also blank.  Pressing Cancel closes the window, and the original data entered is correctly stored in the cell.
Additionally, updating the contents of a cell and pressing Enter displays the 'edit database cell' window, but this window has the original data in it.  Clicking OK on this erronous data is actually ignored - the edited data is saved.
No, 'View' -> 'Edit Cell' has the same error, but the dialog doesn't appear.  Focus is changed though...
Now if a cell contains 'test' and I overwrite it with 'test2', and press Enter, 'test2' is saved to the cell, but 'test' appears in the window underneath.  The dialog doesn't appear though.
Additionally, the 'Edit Cell' pane at the bottom is labelled 'Edit &cell'...
Excellent - thanks for assigning it - much appreciated.
Hi.  Yes, annoying bug.  Ship please! :)
thanks @justinclift, I prefer to wait for the next official release.  I think it was the only\last open thing for the 3.9 milestone. :)
@justinclift  Finally, i'll accept your offer to provide the version with this commit. :)
lol... caved in at last.... ;)
So, here I am again :)
Previous version of the program issued standard confirmation message, query executed successfully..
now i get "not an error: "
guess that means a-ok?
basically the query was:
drop view blahblah;
create view blahblah as ....
I have a database I was just working with an older version and now the new version crashes when opening the same database.
I can open the file in 3.5.1 but not this new version
Here is the db file for review
Mac OSX El Capitan
Yes that opened it just fine.
Thanks.. The point of this excercise was to hopefully have a feature where
I could copy the VIEW creation statements... alas that is not the case.
Now off to google to figure out how to do that...
Sure!
Verified it works without crashing
Still happening for me under El Capitan. Sample database which causes freeze on open every time: http://pawky.net/df.db
DB created with http://peewee.readthedocs.org/. Peewee can work with the DB without issue, but even schema-only (no data) fails to open in Sqlite Browser.
Good news for you - Sqlite Browser isn't to blame.
Bad news - Finder's QuickLook feature is. If I toggle the file open dialogue window to a non-column mode (which means no file contents preview), I can open the file without issue.
Some times, for a db pulled out of an Android app, it shows this error, while the file can be opened using other sqlite editors on the device (eg. SQLite Editor (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.SQLEditor&hl=en) )

thanks, so it't not this apps bug then
again thanks for quick response
My students use this application for android application.
I love this project. =D
Thank you, please merge~  :+1:
Windows DATE is a date formatted as double, with origin at 1/1/1900. This modification allows to display doubles interpreted as a Windows DATE, similar to the unix epoch display option.
The fractional part of DATE is the hour/min/sec representation.
eg.: 42372.4709375 represents 2016-01-03 11:18:09.
I propose to add both a date and a datetime format.
date ('1899-12-30', `Date` || " days" )
would indeed be shown as
2016-01-03.
Adding to readme since that's where most people will look for this information.
If you have the edit boxed docked, and close the DB, whatever was last displayed in the Edit Box remains visible.
Seems OK. Thanks.  I'm not sure if you are supporting this version yet, but when I try to import or save a new database, the program crashes immediately.
@justinclift compiling the package manually worked! Thanks!
Sqlitebrowser is actually being compiled and provided in Fedora 22/23 so it's much easier to get it running.
I'm running installer in Traditional Chinese (zh_TW) environment, but the installer message is in zh_CN (both encoding and the message itself), which shown as mojibake. (See attached image.)
The problem both appears in 3.7 and 3.8. It only affects installer; the main program correctly detected zh_TW.
OS: Win 7 Enterprise with SP1, 64-bit, Traditional Chinese Version
When creating a new database or opening an existing one the application crashes with the error
Complete crash log is attached
[sqlitebowser crashdump.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/73302/sqlitebowser.crashdump.txt)
What version of OS X you're on, lphooge?
Yosemite, 10.10.5
@justinclift yes i do have homebrew installed.
I do not know what you are referring to with "compiling DB4S", but when I build the app bundle like the instructions say, the resulting app does not NOT crash when creating a database. The official build still crashes.
Also, a sqlite3-binary already existed in /usr/bin (3.8.5 2014-08-15 22:37:57 c8ade949d4a2eb3bba4702a4a0e17b405e9b6ace).
I think I'm seeing the same issue. Here is a crash log if it will help:

Sorry for the delay. Yes, that nightly build seems to work for me.
Are you sure that version was built with Qt5? I downloaded and ran it successsfully and in the 'about' menu it said it was built with 4.8.7 just like the newer nightly (and the 3.7 release).
I don't have much time to test, but it seems fine, no crash when creating a new database.
Looks good for me as well. One bit of feedback though. The default font for the data browser is really cramped and hard to read, especially when you are looking at some 20 character uid. I eventually found the setting to change it but it is something that may be worth looking at.
I'm not sure. When I went into the settings there was no font selected so I assume it was using whatever the default system font is for OSX.
Not that I know of. Defaulting to a font like arial that is easier to read at small sizes or simply defaulting to a larger font size would probably solve the issue. Not sure what font the previous versions used but that one seemed pretty good.
Not a problem. This little app makes my job easier on a daily basis, so a few questions are a small price to pay ;)
"sqlitebrowser.exe" from the 3.8.0-win32v2 install is triggering a "invalid win32 app" error message on this side of the curtain.
OS: Win ... XP
Yes, the nightly (28-Dec-2015 02:20) starts up ok on this side. :) ... :thumbsup:
Thanks for continued XP support. :smiley:
I have a table 'A' with Primary Key on 'ID' column. I have some data inside, however there is no record with ID = 1.
If I try to add new record in B i get:
DB Browser for SQLite
Error adding record:
CHECK constraint failed: B (INSERT INTO `B` (AID) VALUES (1, ...);)
I found out that the problem is not caused by foreign keys but constraints added to columns.
It seems that when adding new row, it is added with 'default' values and then edited with values given by user.
This is for version I downloaded today, so 3.8.0. The same applies for 3.7.0. I'm running windows, downloaded x64 version.
I had this problem today. I try to add a new record but it says:
I have attached the db that I am trying to view.

Hey guys. I just wanted to confirm I'm having the same problem with the latest version on my Windows 64 Bit Desktop computer.

That build works fine for me.
Also, I noticed that the Qt version in the above build is 4.8.5, while the version when it crashed before is 5.5.1.0 in the windows error detail.
That nightly appears to be working fine. Adding to what @chinhodado reported regarding versions;
3.8.0 - Qt version 5.5.1, SQLite Version 3.9.2
3.8.99 - Qt version 4.8.5, SQLite Version 3.8.4.3
@eikcam Shouldn't 3.8.99 be Qt version 4.8.5, and 3.8.0 be Qt 5.5.1?

@chinhodado You are 100% correct. My bad. I have corrected my previous post :+1:
Thanks for the quick action @justinclift. I'll roll with the nightly you provided for now and wait until the experts do their thing.
Cheers.
Corrected overlooked problem suggested by @tonypdmtr on issue [#453](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/453). I make new issue because [#453](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/453) is already merged.
This is a very nice feature, but I believe it can be made a bit more powerful.
1. When pasting a BLOB field, instead of getting the actual content of the blob, I simply get the string 'BLOB'.  (I don't know if this should be considered a bug or an enhancement request.)
2. An enhancement I see to this copy/paste to make it even more flexible is a one-to-many ability.
That is, if I have a single cell copied to the clipboard, but I have multiple cells selected when pasting, I would like the single value copied to each selected cell.  (It's quite common that one wants to copy a single value to a range of cells -- like in a spreadsheet.)
3. It can be made even more powerful (many-to-many) by pasting each copied cell in sequence to all selected cells.  That way, if I have copied two cells with contents 'A' and 'B', and paste to a range of five cells, I should get 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'.  (So, the source can be more than one cell, and the destination more than one cell, but the two numbers do not need to be equal.)  This will also take care of [2] above automatically as it is a sub-case of this one.
Thanks for your great work, and Merry Christmas to all.
1. I don't thing this cannot be much better, because clipboard is in text format.
2. and 3. I'm not sure that have enough time to make that (I lack time a lot), but you could do it. Guys here are really nice and quite open for contribution.
Also consider to use SQL for such advance things. Because that I choose sqlitebrowser over spreadsheets.
Merry Christmas to you too.
When editing the table, and adding any column does not check that the name is already in use, resulting in the loss column added when saving table and fall program attempting to move a column with duplicate names
to repeat
1. Create a table with columns (Field2, Field3, Field4)
2. open it for editing
3. add a new column, it name will duplicate (Field4)
4.1 when saving last column will be lost without warning
4.2 when trying to move the last column will happen fall program
add:
if you use non-standard column names, the name of the column will be repeating the standard
That will not be enough
you need to add a check of repeatability column names in edit mode when you change the order of columns and save.
Not only standard column  names
to repeat
1. Create a table with columns (a1, a2, a3)
2. open it for editing
3. add a new column, it name will duplicate (a3)
4.1 when saving last collum will be saved as 'Field4'
to repeat
1. Create a table with columns (Field1, Field2, Field3)
2. open it for editing
3. add a new column, it name will duplicate (Field3)
4 when saving last collum will be lost (second 'Field3')
to repeat
1. Create a table with columns (Field1, Field2, Field3)
2. open it for editing
3. add a new column, it name will duplicate (Field3)
4 trying to move last collum (second Field3) upper  -> program will crash
These examples are not just for the standard column names.
No checks the correctness of the table in the editing mode structure
as I understand:
commit only affects moment to add a new column but there is no verification of column names before executing a user-entered changes
look good, ok!
i close issues after test
all right
May I suggest (hopefully for the upcoming release, as it is a tiny change) the 'Browse Data' tab moves first in the order of tabs so it is immediately available when opening the app.
I'm quite confident the majority of users, most of the time they enter the app, they want to go straight to viewing/editing data, instead of the database structure.
Hopefully you agree, and Merry Christmas to all.
When you try to open a Sqlite database which uses indexes on expressions then DB4S only shows a message box "invalid file format".
Quote from [https://www.sqlite.org/expridx.html]
> The ability to index expressions was added to SQLite with version 3.9.0 in October of 2015. A database that uses an index on expressions will not be usable by earlier versions of SQLite.
I don't think it's a bug since the SQLite team clearly states that using that new 3.9.x feature makes the database incompatible with previous versions. That's why I'm asking for an updated version.
I'm using the newest available setup for Windows (8.1), 3.7.0 which includes SQLite 3.8.10.2.
The "problem" (=incompatibility) starts after creating an index (by using another tool) which includes an expression: `create index PixelCount on Images (Width * Height)` and the database again becomes compatible after dropping such index.
```
$ sqlite3 -version
3.8.10.2 2015-05-20 18:17:19 2ef4f3a5b1d1d0c4338f8243d40a2452cc1f7fe4
```
```
Version 3.7.0
Qt Version 4.8.7
SQLCipher Version 3.8.6
```
on OS X 10.11.2

…and this is apparently the latest DB4S version released to the public.
Thanks for the information, that's good to know!
> In the meantime, if you need things to work right away
Fortunately, not really (I usually only use DB4S just for quick "prototyping"/testing harder queries), so I'll just wait. :laughing:
And, by the way, I want to say, DB4S is an awesome thing
My version of sqlitebrowser (Windows64) seems less flexible than required for a course I am following (Python using databases with Charles Severin).
How does one change the field names ("field1", "field2" entries to ) to, say,  "name", "email" and my options are "text",  not VARCHAR as seen in the course material.
Thanks for any help.
Thanks! Of course. ;) My "clicks" weren't determined enough.
Best seasons wishes and thanks again,
Sandra Britz

I create a database in memory and shared it.
But I don't know how to connect it with this tool.
Oh, I see. Thank u.
This would require to change it in the code as well as in the i18n files.
I mean the key combinations to for example run a query.
That sort of thing :wink: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/9582786237792f9db010fb6b18f6e43dd558e589/src/EditDialog.cpp#L17
Hi.
I added paste (Ctrl+V) and erase (Delete) functionality for cells in Browse Data table (ExtendedTableWidget).
I add it for my convenience, please consider to merge it if you think that is usefull.
1) Commits-merged.
2) Even better with Del and Alt+Del
I synced my fork to the newest commit [4727b0b](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/4727b0bb9226377ca2eb1c46a0ec6f4697b53746).
My erase() is erased.
Commits squashed as you like it.
When pasting, the data is quoted.  Maybe the quotes should be removed, or else there is always need for manual editing after pasting.
I will correct that today.
I have some Pragmas that I set in ~/.sqliterc . However, the SQLiteBrowser does not seem to use this file. How can I force SQLiteBrowser to always use Pragmas with a preset value? In other words, how can I make "secure delete" always false (unchecked) without having to change it in "Edit Pragmas"? I would also like to make "Temp Store" and "Journal Mode" always set to "Memory".
The GUI-editor would be fine if I only ever had to set the PRAGMAs once and then always use the same settings.
In table view I added a filter for a column. The column contains a text representation of a date as yyyy-mm-dd (e. g. 2013-04-27).
**Example 1**
Filter `>2010`
SQL-Log: `SELECT rowid,* FROM msgs_view WHERE 1=1 AND date > 2010 ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 0, 50000;`
Problem: It's a text field but filtering is done numeric.
**Example 2**
Filter `>2010-10-01`
SQL-Log: `SELECT rowid,* FROM msgs_view WHERE 1=1 AND date LIKE '>2010-10-01' ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 0, 50000;`
Problem: It's executed as LIKE filter and not as GREATER THAN
**Remark**
There is always an additional sql execution to detect the number of rows
`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT rowid,* FROM msgs_view WHERE 1=1 AND date LIKE '>2010-10-01' ORDER BY date DESC);`
Shouldnt ORDERY BY be omitted for performance reasons?
This isn't an issue with sqlitebrowser -- I didn't know the appropriate way to reach you.
When I look at the OSX .app Frameworks folder of sqlitebrowser, I noticed that your project is much smaller than my Qt app -- you utilize less Qt framework bundles. How did you get your application to support that? For instance, I'm not using QtQuick or QML in my Qt/C++ application. However, when I run my project through macdeployqt, it includes these frameworks in my app bundle. When I try to remove them, my application won't load.
I found what's going on in my Qt/C++ app. Once I included QtWebKit, it
increased the size by several MB and forced the adding of QtQML and
QtQuick, even though I'm not using those. If I don't add that, the other
frameworks don't get deployed by macdeployqt.

Nope, close it. Just didn't now to reach someone really experienced in this
field. Sorry to place a ticket like this.  Thanks so much for your
assistance! :)

Topic says it all.
Regards
Hi Justin,
I'm on Windows 7. With the last stable this button was fine.
I used this button most while attaching databases - and this only could be done by SQlitebrowser one by one - with saving the first attached database before being able to attach the next.
Regards
sorry Justin - betatester, no progger :(
Hello Justin,
sorry for letting you waiting. Seems fine to me :-)
The only thing I wonder about is: the nightly build exe file is roughly tenfold bigger than the one from the original release (32MB to 2,2MB).
Regards
Yes, but it has no dependencies on other files (DLL, etc.)
I wish the actual release did the same.  I like the stand-alone binary version better (like with SQLite3 or FOSSIL)
+1 for releasing both ways.
Thanx for shedding some light on this Topic, Justin.
Personally I use the portable version, that's my main concern. I put the nightly build into the 64-folder, as with the original release I use the 64-version. With the Information now, that the nightlys are 32bitters, that is the wrong Folder. But it does not matter anyway, because the static nature of the build. Right?
Regards
Neither of the Windows 64-bit releases work on my computer. I am on a 64-bit Windows 7 OS. I open the application and click "New Database." Then an error message shows saying "sqlitebrowser.exe" has stopped working. My machine then automatically closes the program. This program does not work.
This is the log I found for the error. Do you know how to fix it?
Faulting application name: sqlitebrowser.exe, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x5548f5ba
Faulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 6.1.7601.19045, time stamp: 0x56259295
Exception code: 0xc0000005
Fault offset:
Faulting process id:
Faulting application start time: 0x01d12575726a93e9
Faulting application path: C:\Program Files\SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser.exe
Faulting module path: C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll
I suggest you try searching the internet for "Exception code: 0xc0000005" which returns all sorts of possible causes from bad memory to corrupt video drivers, if you add in "ntdll.dll" then you might find something more specific or helpful. However I am sorry to say this suggests the problem is with your computer and not DB Browser for SQLite. If you have access to another computer with Windows 7 you could try running DB Browser for SQLite on there.
But how come its never been an issue before? I think that file is a link library that is used by a lot of programs. How come it only fails with your application?
It works well on my Windows 7 64-bit computer ^_^
I'm having the same problem on a windows 10 machine
Yup, that worked ! thanks !
See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1282792 :
"In the browse data tab, add new row, then double click a field. The popup window appeared to edit the field, and it froze."
Problem is that during synchronization of the plaintextedit and hexedit, the updated editor emits the changed signal which then triggers another syncronization, and so on, resulting in a stack overflow due to infinite recursion:

This keyboard shortcut to set a field to NULL still does not work correctly, I suppose.  It behaves the same a plain DELETE, the field is emptied but not NULLed.
(BTW, Ctrl-Delete feels like a more intuitive choice to Alt-Delete.)
SQLite Browser Version : 3.7.0
OS : Windows 10 64 bit
Steps :
1. File->Export->Database to SQL file
2. Select New INSERT INTO syntax..
File selection window opens, and the the program crashes
![issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12444895/11015554/326a49e2-8589-11e5-81ef-4e01a6faa5be.jpg)
Also, dragging a picture to a blob field could insert that picture.  Now, it crashes.
@justinclift I just did with the current nightly build.  It works much better now.  However, (again) being a keyboard person myself, I would like the focus to stay in the cell I was, rather than move to the editor.  That way, I can move over the grid using arrow keys (rather than mouse clicks), without losing focus all the time.  Try using it with the keyboard arrow keys, and you'll see what I mean.  With the mouse, it works great.
Suggestion: How about you keep the focus the way it is now when someone uses the mouse to click on cells, but keep the original cell focus instead if the keyboard is used.  That should make both use cases work the best.
(BTW, the drag-n-drop still does not work.  I think it tries to open the dragged file as SQLite3 instead of a blob to be inserted in the dropped at cell.  Not a big deal, though.)
Works great! Thanks!
I only noticed one more issue (a bit unrelated to this) with the edit box.  I can make a different ticket for it, if you like.  But, while we're on the subject, I'll mention it here:
When ESC is pressed from within the edit box, it minimizes to the left lower corner. If you try to double-click on it (or the min/max icon) to make it big again, it completely vanishes (it becomes floating -- instead of docked -- but nowhere to be found).  Even trying to re-enable it from the 'View/Edit Cell' does not bring it back.  Only way I found to bring it back is to close the app and re-open it.  So, something is not quite right there.
So, maybe when restoring the edit box, center it on the screen and bring to front for easy locating.
(Couldn't ESC be used for going back to the grid cell instead of closing the edit box?)
Thanks to all for your great work!
Perfect work!  Many thanks.
If I'm browsing a view (instead of a table) the cell data isn't shown in the editor.  Of course I cannot possibly edit a view, but how about having the data display there in read-only mode so it takes care of the original issue of seeing the whole field?
Is read-only edit box possible?
Great!
My final (I hope) observation is a really minor remaining issue:
You enter the edit box and type something, and instead of accepting it (with OK or CTRL-ENTER), you press ESC and go back out to the grid cell.  The value in the edit box does not revert back to the original (unless you move away from the cell and back on it).  It stays modified so the cell and the edit box no longer match either other.
Thank you all again for all your work (and immediate responsiveness).
P.S.
1. CTRL-Z could act as "File/Revert Changes" when you're not editing a field (i.e., in global scope)
2. Unless there is a separate selection for edit box font, maybe the same font should be used for the edit box as the one selected for the grid.
One more similar to the previous one:
If you edit directly on the grid cell, and press enter you go to the Edit Box but with the previous contents of the cell -- even though the cell has been edited already.
Sure.
When moving in the browser grid from cell to cell, it'd be nice to have the full contents of that cell display in some full-width textbox (e.g., at the bottom of the screen -- like with a status line).
This is much faster than entering/exiting the editor for each cell when quickly browsing the data.
(If this is also a multi-line textbox, it could also take care of issue #416 I created earlier.)
@MKleusberg Thanks for this.  I tried it and it looks very good.  However, double clicking (IMHO) still slows it down more than it's necessary.  How about the edit box being refreshed as soon as move the cursor from cell to cell, without any extra action, e.g., when navigating with the arrow keys.  (I personally tend to use the keyboard more than the mouse.)  Thanks again.
So I was told it was in SQLite format. And I can open it in sqlite3:
```
$ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.8.4.1 2014-03-11 15:27:36
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
sqlite> .open History
sqlite> .tables
downloads_url_chains  segment_usage         visit_source
keyword_search_terms  segments              visits
```
At the `qmake` step, I'm getting `QMAKESPEC has not been set, so configuration cannot be deduced.
Error processing project file: /Users/igallevy/source/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.pro`.
Looking at Note 2 in the build section (referenced by your link), I see that I should run one of the `qmake -spec` commands, but there is no context given for which. So I ran `qmake -spec macx-llvm`, which seemed to work. However, after I copied the .app to Applications and attempted to start, I got the following dialog:
**sqlitebrowser cannot be opened because of a problem.**
So perhaps it should have been compiled with the other `qmake -spec`, but I'm far from knowing. I did retrace steps and tried it (same result), but some cleaning up may have been needed before trying that.
If I get the time I'll try starting from scratch if all that entails is blowing away the sqlitebrowser source I checked out. Or maybe you'll have a new build done sooner :pray:
I had this problem, but I think it was because Chrome had the file open while sqlitebrowser was trying to read it. I made a copy of the file, and sqlitebrowser was able to open it.  Picking up on #184
- SQLite 3 seems to use affinity types - ( https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#affinity ) - and has baked in support for column types such as 'DATETIME' etc.
In SQLite Browser, if I execute the SQL that creates a columntype of DATETIME, SQLite supports it, and DATETIME is shown for the column type.
However, when trying to add / edit a column type, these types are not supported, even if I type them in manually.
Perhaps the default column types could be listed, but the add / edit dropdown will accept custom types as well.
I feel this qualifies as a bug - as I can't use your tool to access a built-in function of SQLite.
Thanks kindly
Tried a project save and then re-open it but doesn't show on the file list because the file extension identified as a SQLite Browser Project is not on the file.  No clue as to what is expected.
I've just installed 3.7 for the first time, I clicked New Database and this caused the application to crash. I also tried 3.6 and the same happens.
Clicking Open Database has the same effect.
I presume there's some conflict with my machine but I have no idea what that might be, everything else is running fine and it's only a 2 week old installation of W7.
Same for me on Windows 8.1 x64 on x64 version.
What a day, first Django migrations f*d up and now I can use that tool to review the database.
Now it looks good. 64-bit version runs fine and the open dialog doesn't
cause crash. I'm able to browse my test database from Django application.
Thank you very much.
I just worked through getting it to build on Qt 4.6.2, on a locked down Linux machine.
It struggled with a few errors when building v3.5.1.
Here are the errors:
```
main.cpp: In function 'int main(int, char**)':
main.cpp:115: error: 'QFile' has not been declared
main.cpp:123: error: 'QFile' has not been declared
main.cpp:148: error: 'QFile' was not declared in this scope
main.cpp:148: error: expected ';' before 'file'
main.cpp:149: error: 'file' was not declared in this scope

MainWindow.cpp: In member function 'void MainWindow::executeQuery()':
MainWindow.cpp:749: error: 'QElapsedTimer' was not declared in this scope
MainWindow.cpp:749: error: expected ';' before 'timer'
MainWindow.cpp:750: error: 'timer' was not declared in this scope
EditTableDialog.cpp: In constructor 'EditTableDialog::EditTableDialog(DBBrowserDB*, const QString&, bool, QWidget*)':
EditTableDialog.cpp:20: error: 'currentMSecsSinceEpoch' is not a member of 'QDateTime'
ImportCsvDialog.cpp: In member function 'virtual void ImportCsvDialog::accept()':
ImportCsvDialog.cpp:199: error: 'currentMSecsSinceEpoch' is not a member of 'QDateTime'
FilterTableHeader.cpp: In constructor 'FilterLineEdit::FilterLineEdit(QWidget*, QList<FilterLineEdit*>*, int)':
FilterTableHeader.cpp:14: error: 'setPlaceholderText' was not declared in this scope
```
I'll see about doing a pull request sometime with the fixes.
Fixes basically were:
Add `#include <QFile>` to main.cpp
Wrap includes for `QElaspedTimer` with:
```
#if (QT_VERSION < QT_VERSION_CHECK(4, 7, 0))
# include <QTime>
typedef QTime QElapsedTimer;
#else
# include <QElapsedTimer>
#endif
```
Wrap calls to `QDateTime::currentMSecsToEpoch()` with
```
#if QT_VERSION < QT_VERSION_CHECK(4, 7, 0)
QDateTime::currentDateTime().toTime_t() * 1000
#else
QDateTime::currentMSecsSinceEpoch()
#endif
```
Wrap call to `QLineEdit::setPlaceHolderText()` with
```
#if (QT_VERSION < QT_VERSION_CHECK(4, 7, 0))
// setPlaceHolderText(tr("Filter"));
#else
setPlaceHolderText(tr("Filter"));
#endif
```
Hope that helps someone.  These fixes should make it backwards compatible with Qt 4.6.
I'll try rebuilding it with 4.6 on a home computer this weekend. I found
those errors on a locked down computer without internet access.  Sorry
about the late response.  Does it still build easily with 4.8 since
supporting qt 5?
This is an old thread, but I'll just add that yesterday it saved my hide.  Qt-4.6 may be ancient, but it's what's in use in RedHat 6.8, which is still widely used in industry.  This patch is not irrelevant to me.  Just for jollies, and to be informative, my company-standard installation has qt-1:4.6.2-28 and qt3-3.3.8b-30 installed.  (If you thought Qt-4.6 was old...)  I have qt5-5.6.1-3 available but not installed - apparently nothing "standard" has called for it.  The preparations are beginning to upgrade to RedHat 6.9, but I'm not sure what Qt code levels that will entail or when it will happen. Awesome!  Glad it was useful.  The biggest thing to watch for with older versions of RedHat is support for OpenGL or the MesaGL libraries and xcb support.  If those are fully installed and supported, then Qt 5 will play nice.  Otherwise some gotchas come up.  Qt 4.8.x doesn't need OpenGL, and Qt Lite (in Qt 5.8+) also doesn't need OpenGL.    I have a question regarding the built-in plotting function. I observed that for larger databases (~ 2M entries) the plots look quite different compared to plots made with e.g. python. I also observed that the plots very much depend on the ordering of the entries in the database.
Since the plots are extremely fast, I assume that you perform some kind of "thinning" before doing the plot? I am right about this? Could you elaborate about the details of how the plots are done?
Thanks,
Christoph Niehoff
The plots depend on what x and y axis(columns) you select,
and of course how your current select statement looks like.
And no there shouldn't be any data left out for plotting, all data that is returned from the select should be used to plot
Dear Rene,
thank you for you reply!
Let me give you an example.
When I perform the two following select's:
1) select dataA, dataB from DataBase order by dataA
2) select dataA, dataB from DataBase order by dataB
I assume that in both cases I have the same datapoints (or am I wrong here? I am quite new to SQL... ).
But when I make plots with dataA on the x-axis and dataB on the y-axis, I get totally different outcomes  for both cases (different distributions of datapoints and different plot ranges).
Also, I can make a plot with all points. Then I can perform a select that only returns entries, which are in a region, where the plot with all points didn't have any points. This select then shows that there are entries in the database, that the plot did not show...
I assume that this very much depends on the structure of my data. My database contains ~2M entries generated by ~500 different Markov Chains, so the data is pretty much "clustered"...
Thanks very much,
Christoph
I had a look at the code(some time has past since I wrote it) and I think I have not really accounted such order by statements and the plotting is still more or less some kind of prototype. So this is more or less a bug or missing functionality.
But I can say that we pass all the data returned from the statement to the plotting widget (qcustomplot), but as you noticed it may happen that some data is not shown, thats because it's not possible to draw every datapoint if the x-axis is too large and the plotting widget has to skip data.
Dear Rene,
thank you very much for taking the time to look into the code.  I think, this pretty much explains it. Thanks, that helped a lot.
All the best,
Christoph
It would be convenient to open recent files with combination: CTRL + 1 (2,3,4)
actions:
open base
amend data
press the key combination (cntr + 1)
press (ESC) (2 times why?)
when you try to make a change in the base will be informed that it is locked
all right
On "Execute SQL" tab I write:
SELECT default_image, russian FROM cards WHERE russian_lower LIKE "%тихо%"
I get:
SELECT default_image, russian FROM cards WHERE russian_lower LIKE "%????%"
Windows 7, build 7601, 64 bit, I never do updates, because can't remember even once that they helped me with anything.
SQLite version is 3.8.9
It's 3.6.0, I'll try the newer one and report.
It's OK in 3.7.0, sorry for inconvenience.
Hi GitHub,
I try your DB Brower for SQLite Version 3.8.10.2. The Browse Data text filter does not work at all. I will try it your next release again and see if your software is desirable.
Best regards,
Hi Justin,
Please look below. When click the bug report of the program, it will go to your website.
[cid:image001.png@01D10693.56217F10]
Best regards,
I think @ITS225EN you will need to attach the image directory in GitHub, e-mailed images don't work, as far as I know, we certainly can't see your picture, sorry.
Hi Geoff,
Later I download sqlitebrowser-3.7.0-win64.exe to try. This one works.
Thanks,
That's great news. Do you know what you had before exactly? Just in case there is an issue.
With monospace fonts query editor rendering seems to be ignoring the proper space width. Screenshots below are both of the exact same text using 10pt Courier New with the red line 1px after the select keyword.
How it should look: Notepad++ 6.7.9
![notepad _6 7 9](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12277525/10455659/f57223a2-7192-11e5-80ed-f36572dcbca8.png)
How it looks: DBBrowser 3.7.0
![dbbrowser_3 7 0](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12277525/10455658/f5519a1a-7192-11e5-9b12-7a376d017c46.png)
Please note that spaces might not be the only characters involved and **_formatting_** might also affect the result.
Here is the text:
```
select sum(ValorNeto) as Neto, sum(ValorIVA + ValorNeto) as Total
from NV
on NV.IdEntidad = Entidad.IdEntidad
on NV.IdNVEstado = NVEstado.IdNVEstado
{1};
```
Perfect! :+1: :+1: :+1: (I'm no longer suprised :grin:)
I apologize if this has been addressed elsewhere, I did a quick search for font-related issues and didn't see anything.
I'm on DB Browser **3.7.0** and on OS.X **10.10.5**
The font-size for un-quoted alpha-symbols seems to ignore the specified font-size in the SQL Preferences:

I followed the instructions (uninstalling and re-installing sqlite and qt via homebrew) but unfortunately, I get this error when trying to run the compiled app:
```
LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Applications/sqlitebrowser.app.

Thanks! I'm closing the ticket now as the issue has been resolved. Don't know if it's worth mentioning that the **output** font remains uniformly small...but maybe that's intended? Or in an option that I've missed (is it not the SQL Log Font Size, which I've set to be 32 in the screenshot above, the same as in the SQL Editor Font Size setting)?
If I have one more interface suggestion to make, based on my experience in using SQLite Browser for live demos and teaching SQL in-class, it's that that bottom output panel can be very easy to miss, even for me, but especially for new users/SQL novices who don't realize that it's related to the execution of the query...which gets confusing for novices who struggle with knowing the difference between an empty query set and an actual error. Configuring the font-size would be helpful, but even a little color flash upon update, or a red-highlight border around the output box in the event of an error, would be really helpful.
Thanks again!
I'm happy to see the usage of qhexedit in the wild. I would be more happy, if you add a reference to
https://github.com/Simsys/qhexedit2
yes we use qhexedit, it was introduced while @MKleusberg reworked the value editor dialog a long time ago.
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/tree/master/libs/qhexedit
np
My base has 134 records in table 'Projets', as displayed by my application, but sqlitebrowser displays only 106 records.
I thought this was due to accented characters in the records, but that is not the cause.
Unfortunately, this panel does not allow to attach a base or an .xls file...
The base (Lightcomm.db, 150k) and the excel file (Projets.XLS, 8k) are available with
www.pixname.com/DBBrowser/Lightcomm.db
www.pixname.com/DBBrowser/Projets.XLS
I did not specify that this happens on Windows 8.1, with
sqlitebrowser
Version 3.7.0
Qt Version 5.4.1
SQLite Version 3.8.10.2
and - surprise - all 134 records are there.
Thanks for your interest, and sorry for disturbing you.
I have downloaded the 64 bit version of sqlite browser. It appears to start normally and properly. As i do any activity on the browser for e.g. click on any button,an exception shows and the browser crashes. It goes off automatically. Please look into it and suggest some solution.
Hi Justin... I have a similar issue....
I just installed the latest version of sqllite browser on my 64 bit windows 10 PC.
The sqllite browser opens and when i click on new databases, the application crashes.
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2013 is also installed on my PC.
Can you please provide me a solution for this problem?
Hello,
is there any way to Interrupt a (far too) long running query. Actually I kill the process, but that's not the nice way to do.
Regards
Hello Martin,
I understand your concerns. Perhaps just as information: SQLite Studio shows up an interrupt button when a query is engaged, works fine, so far no problems, but not heavily used anyway.
I came to this, because by un(for)seen changes at my collected measurement data I run into troubles with my (old) queries: SQLite Studio could interrupt them, SQLite Browser I had to kill each time ...
Personally I much more like SQLite Browser; I use SQLite Studio for some work because here I can attach a bunch of databases by a set of query statements, which SQLite Browser cannot.
Regards
I have many records with underscore char in the text.
Thanks
Vertically, the list shows only 10 entries whereas there is plenty of place to display a much longer list. My 23 tables could easily fit in one list (they do in the Database structure tab).
Sure, no problem :
Thanks
In my previous mail I sent a screenshot of about half the screen. The
full screen is below, and you can see the problem of navigating the
scrolled list...
Please see the enclosed screenshot.

Done.
Hi Justin,
DB Browser does not display records containing accented charaters. Is
this the normal behavior? What needs to be done to display such records?
I switched the browser language to French, but this does not modify the
operation of DB Browser.
Regards,
tried with
Version 3.7.99
Qt Version 4.8.5
SQLite Version 3.8.4.3
Same problem.
Hi Justin,
The accented words problem went away with 3.8.0.
The width of the 'Browse data' menu is still too large.
A request: include an option to 'Open the last opened base automatically'.
Regards,
Hi Justin,
Thanks for accepting my suggestion, and a happy new year!
It would be nice if the user could change the row height for the data browser. I presume this would be placed on the Preferences -> Data Browser tab.
I'm on Win7. I'm leaving today for the week but will be back on Sunday. I would be happy to test at that time.
Hi Clift,
I have version 3.7.0 installed on a Win-32, Win7 PC. I don't see
where I can change the row height size.
That version number sounds like a release one, @justinclift was suggesting you look at the latest nightly build. If you go to https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser and scroll down you will find some explanation and a link to the nightly build. Try that and see.
Now using 3.7.99 and I see many NEW   options for changing the font and font size - but none for the row   height.  Even when I use a very small font size the row height   remains unchanged, and too big. I tried a smaller font size, just to  see if that would reduce the row height. Nope.
I want to have shorter row heights - primarily to see more rows on   a single screen.
A friendly +1 for this.
I just updated from 2.0b1 to 3.9.1, I was very excited by all the progress… but then I became very sad when I saw how bigger the rows have become… Yes, there is an improvement. Here are some screenshots:
* [3.9.1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/544424/24899798/e49ba6a8-1ea1-11e7-9791-507eb501d9bd.png)
* [nightly 2017-04-11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/544424/24899801/e7bc9bb2-1ea1-11e7-9112-7081f7c3e6a3.png)
Personally I'd prefer even narrower rows, like in the "Database Structure" tab. But it's highly subjective, I use quite denser layouts than most people do.
So, it should be fine as it is now. Thanks! Hi Justin,
While I recently got a Win64 PC, I also have my old Win32 PC.  I tried both 2017-04-11 versions (what is the difference? what is sqlcipher? ) on the Win32 PC and both worked really well. There are certainly many more features now which are not apparent how to use. I'm sure the online Help will follow.
I thought there was going to be something under Preferences that specifically addressed row height. Changing the browser font size will change the row height indirectly but I saw nothing that would change the row height directly. For example, a smaller row height with no change in font size would reduce the white space between each line.
One minor change I noticed. File names in the new version use forward slashes / instead of back slashes \ . It just looks unusual to see some of the files with back slashes and some with forward slashes when I view the most recent files in the Files menu. I think the Windows default is back slashes, although I believe either will work. As a PC user, this is something I've never paid much attention to.
Hello!
Though it's said to run on 10.6.8, sqlitebrowser 3.7.0 produces an error when I try to launch it on this version of Mac OS X. 3.6.0 launches normally:

I tried but got an error here:
bash-3.2$ git clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.git
fatal: could not create work tree dir 'sqlitebrowser'.: Permission denied
Ah, I see. I should have moved to the admin's home when switching users with su.
Qt compiled fine here:
/usr/local/Cellar/qt/4.8.6: 2791 files, 119M, built in 693.9 minutes
11 hours vs. 2. Your machine seems to be "slightly" faster than mine. ;-)
Testing the binary now, and it works!
Thank you!
Now I "only" have to figure out how to interpret my database's contents. ;-)
Update: Opening the db works, but then browsing a table and clicking the refresh button lets the app crash:

An the resulting binary starts up without problems but crashes with a SIGSEV when I try to browse a table in my DB, even before hitting refresh.
Sorry I can't be more helpful.
The last time I coded something successfully was when I used 68000 assembler. ;-)
Same problem here on Mac OS X 10.6.8 32 bit on MacBook Pro 3.1
I noticed that the v3.7.0 .dmg provided here unpacks as version 3.4.99; it does not run on Mac OS X 10.6.8. The v3.6.0 .dmg unpacks as version 3.6.0 and runs properly. ...
Will try shortly.
Sorry, I'm short on time.
Must test later.
I'm there, what should I do?
My internet connections seems to go down …
Do I need to do this part again?
$ brew install sqlite --with-functions --without-readline
$ brew install qt
$ brew link sqlite3 --force
IT WORKS!!!
Thank you very much!
I have with the newest build a similar problem

Nope, Justin. So far I never compiled anything, always download just binaries.
The version     http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/onceoffs/sqlitebrowser_201509260125.dmg
works as well as the one with (or without) cipher of 20150608. All later crash on Snow Leopard :(
I tried to delete the content of a table "myTable" in an attached database "myDB":
DELETE FROM myDB.myTable;
And got the following error:
no such table: myDB.Tablename: DELETE FROM myDB.myTable
(Where "Tablename" is the name of a table in the main database)
The table itself exists, so a query on that table works:
SELECT \* FROM myDB.myTable;
Deletion on the main database works fine also:
DELETE FROM main.myTable;
Kindly regards,
Andreas Martin
When a field contains line feeds, in the Browse Data tab, the contents are displayed on the same line but without any space between the lines.  I propose you replace line feeds with a space so as to look better as single line.  For example:
If fields contains:
Hello<CRLF>
World
It now displays as:
HelloWorld
(no space between Hello and World)
After my suggestion:
Hello World
That would work also (even better, actually).  However, still a space should surround the special character or else again it will look as one word when printed as a single line.
I would like an option for Filter to automatically enclose whatever typed text in %% so as to not to have to type the % all the time.  This is because I have found that practically always I need a “%text%” type search instead of just “text”.
That's why I thought of it as a settable option (View/Preferences)
Better yet, a checkbox right next to the filters row where one can immediately change the default, and also verify its current state.
Hi,
another problematic point here is the immediate activation of the filter while still typing. With big data it took relevant time to complete the intendet filter phrase, and the program does filtering again and again with every of the next typed in characters.
1) drop this auto activation behaviour (not that conveniant)
2) make it optional by Setting (a bit better)
3) define a certain amount of time to wait that no further Input is done in the filter field and only then start filter Action (my best bet, i.e. 400ms might be a good starting point)
Regards
This seems unrelated to this proposal as the only difference is that the LIKE argument will be automatically embraced by % characters.  None of the remaining functionality is affected.
As for appropriate solutions to the other issue, I'd go with 3.
I appreciate all the work put into this, and the result is very good.
If I'm looking for John, typing John will give me both and there may be cases where I only need to see just John without Johnson.  And, there is no way to make it not find Johnson.
I think some kind of on/off switch for this option is needed.
(BTW, one minor note about the implementation.  I looked at the code and when the string is empty it is replaced by '%%' when just one '%' is sufficient.  Not important in that it does not change the behavior.)
I didn't know about the = option.  That will work just as well. Thanks.
It's OK as far as I'm concerned!
Hi,
Thanks for a great product.
My Name is Svein Berger (mr.) I'm a Norwegian software developer.
First I want to apologize for my limited knowledge of English. So please try to understand my note.
We are using an technical application that saves data to a SQLite database.
The first version of the program was written in Delphi. Later I rewrote the program in C#.
The character set back then was Windows western europe (same as CP1252)
When I rewrote the program to C# i kept the old character set. That was because it was to complicated to convert the data to UTF-8.
As a Norwegian (it applies to most countries in Europe), we use letters that are outside A..Z like øæå ö ü etc.
At the time we startet to use our database UTF-8 was not the common character sets. The transition to UTF-8 is no problem for those who only use the letters A..Z. But for us who live in countries that have an extended alphabet, the transition to UTF-8 is a challenge for some older systems. The letters A..Z kept the same places in the new character set, but the letters that we use was "shuffled around".
An example: Pressure test is in Norwegian Trykkprøving. But it is like this Trykkpr�ving in DB Browser for SQLite. For all charaters ØÆÅ øæå is displayed like �. Not very nice.
Pleas see attatched screen shot.
If I had written the program to day, I would of course used UFT-8, and everyone would be happy.
I fully understand that you do not add an additional interpretations of the character set in the program. But if you have the opportunity and see this as a challenge, I would be more than happy to test the solution for you.
If I make my self unclear, please ask me and I will try my best to answer you.
Kind regards

Hi Martin
Wow! Thank you very much, all participants. This was quick and amazing!
I do most of my development i Windows, and I tried it there. It works great!
All my tables (aprox. 120 tables) , in two databases uses the old cp1251 format.
How do I set it to open all tables in cp1252?
And again thank you for your great support!
Regards
Hi Martin,
Thank you again, this works fine, all tables are set correctly. And yes, there is no problem to set the encoding every time I use the program.
I Run a query in "Execute SQL". The result there is still UTF-8. Is it possible to include the selected encoding in the query tab?
You guys are awesome. Great support and fast solution.
Thank you.
Hi Justin,
I do have Homebrew and followed your guide. It's working great. The encoding option is there and working.
Thank you.
There was a previous problem (https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/394) in the Window's version that was fixed on August 19th 2015. Later it got broken, which I mentioned in that thread, but here's a new report with up-to-date information. :smiley:
Now, the Edit-window is alternating between two places depending on the position of the main form. First it appears in one place, then the other next time it's opened. If the main window is moved, it's two different places. Sometimes half way outside the screen border.
The position of the main form is stored when the application is closed, so wouldn't it be a good idea if you added a setting in Preferences to also store the position of the Edit-window? Those who don't have any problems can leave that setting unchecked and will have the applications default behaviour. :smile:
I tried the nightly build from November 10th and, for me, it behaves the same erratic way as described in the post above.
I'm seeing this on the 3.8.0 build of Windows x64 as well.
I just tried it, and the Windows build still has the problem.
Yes @justinclift I was going to suggest that myself, both this and #394, plus also #342.
In an existing table with data, if you change the datatype it rollsback on saving. For example you import an csv file, and it uses id fields as text. Now you want to make it integer, you can not.
Dear Justin,
I am using it on windows8.1.
Regards
Ashutosh
I do create COLUMN with the COLLATE NOCASE. Sqlite browser does not parse COLLATE NOCASE
statement correctly.
e.g:
CREATE TABLE `MyTable` (`ID` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,`Filter` TEXT COLLATE NOCASE)
DB4S: Version: 3.7.0
OS: Windows 7 64 bit
@slidertom did you get a chance to test this please?
Was just going to raise a ticket when I saw this was already here.
Using the latest nightly build (13 Jun) and this works 40% successfully (using Windows 10 64bit)
Maybe I broke it, but I 'cheated' by editing a table and changing the field from 'text' to 'text collate nocase'.  DB4S kindof accepted it...
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/16045736/b02c725a-3241-11e6-965b-65ee0ab5cb0b.png)
But its not in the dropdown
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/16045764/cfd73aae-3241-11e6-8916-48e250c3cb75.png)
...and the 'Modify Tab;e' GUI doesn't see it.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/16045783/e5b2b11e-3241-11e6-96eb-a071e3111ed6.png)
It does physically work though - the field is now nocasing, so 'fred' is found with a field containing 'FRED'.  Adding a field doesn't break this, but MOVING a field does.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/16045824/1bab18ba-3242-11e6-8960-06f189491e84.png)
So it works, but only just...
I added a table via SQL, and the same results occurred.  Physically worked, appeared in the schema line but not the dropdown, and not in the 'Modify Table' GUI. Adding a field didn't break it, but moving a field did.
I am still getting this error on the latest nightly build.
Do I need to be concerned about this?
Can you fix it?  I have to make sure that the blob column is not displayed to make the scrolling speed acceptable.
There needs to be an option to not attempt to render the contents and just display "BLOB" as was previously the case.
Is there a change for a, relative soon, nightly version with a workable BLOB display fix.
With (displayed?) blobs the current 3.7.0 SqliteBrowser becomes so unresponsive its just unworkable.
Tried it with nightly 3.7.99. (added the nightly exe (renamed) to the current installed 3.7.0 version, just in case that's not the way to do it.)
OS: Windows, 32bit, XP
(funny, every time I specify XP I now feel I'm saying something political unacceptable.)
Sqlitebrowser performs very slow when running Recursive CTE. I have a table with >500K rows and it takes Sqlitebrowser about 6 minutes to finish the query. Other sqlite browsers/managers such as sqlitespy, database.net, etc take around 1 min and 45 sec to complete. The fastest is sqlitespeed. It takes only about 1 min and 15 sec to complete the query. Can somebody take a look at this?
Thanks
Justin -
Any update? Did he get a chance to investigate?
Thanks,
@MKleusberg - I recently got a new PC so I have different results when I tested the sample that I sent you. The latest DB browser (v3.9.1) now can complete the query in 149 second (2.5 minute) vs 68 second if I use sqlitespy. With my old PC, DB browser took 6 minutes to finish the query vs 1 min and 45 with sqlitespy. It seems DB browser processes the query faster but still lags behind other sqlite browsers.
I'm more than happy to help you run the query using the special build to figure out the issue. Just let me know.  Is it possible to show the ROWID of a record as a column? Currently each table has an unnamed column (the leftmost one) that looks like ROWID but it is not.
@justinclift I think you have Mac nightly builds working now, so thought a polite nudge might be in order
@MKleusberg I just tested on OS X 10.11.2 and it worked the first time I tried it but now it's not displaying the column.
- I enabled it for one table and it displayed the rowid
- Switched to a second table and enabled it, but no rowid was shown
- Switched back to table one and toggled it off/on, and rowid did not return
- restarted sqlitebrowser and now unable to display rowid at all
Not sure what is going on. Would it be possible to just move 'show rowid' to the preferences pane and apply it across all tables? That would make the most sense to me..
The feature is working great for me, thanks!
I have a table that contains a json field.  If I do a query of the table with no where clause the json field shows text.  However if I put in a where clause to pick a  particular set of records (1 or more), the json field only shows the word BLOB (in italic and light font) where the same same records without the where clause shows the text in the json field.
Why does this happen?
Sorry.  This looks like it was already fixed in version 3.7.   I was running version 3.6.
Thank you for any assistance that you can provide! Glenn

yes
On the Open Database dialog program asks me for the file and it reads the supported file types are ".db .db3 .sqlite .sqlite3".
But for some reason when I try to open "key.db" file from profile settings of Mozilla Firefox it prompts the plain message saying : "Invalid File Format". I was unable to find any working solution on the forums (i didnt try any solution talking about downgrading btw)
I'd be glad if you take a look
The same error I get with the android calendar db file /data/data/com.android.providers.calendar/databases/calendar.db
The file starts with "SQLite format 3"
Do I need write access? It works when I copy it to local folder ...
Maybe the error message should say this then
That's the best behaviour imaginable :+1:
No I'm just using the FreeBSD port
I'm getting this error message on a ssqlite db file...
Let's discuss
It is worth to check from flow perspective, I am not an SQLite expert and have been digging sqlitebrowser sources only for couple of hours.
Especially we should pay attention to places where former save() and saveAll() were used.

I would say the bug is that UI is unable to display names with escaped special symbols. There is nothing bad in having special symbols escaped in the names of fields/tables, isn't it?
In the same circumstances if we will rename column 'example' to 'exa`mple' it will be renamed (from the first look). However, attempt to move column up/down will lead to "renameColumn: cannot find column " error.
Also, on exit through "ok" button changed name will be not saved if alphanumeric sequence is used. In case of numbers only we will see situation which was initially reported here
ok, all work
yes, bug fixed
Is it possible to assemble the project in windows ???
You may suggest where to start and what libraries are needed?
i try compile in qtcreator ...
but why that was an error: "'::strcpy_s' has not been declared"
Try to go exactly according to instructions...
I installed SqliteBrowser recently, and to my surprise found that the program tries to make a https connection to an IP automatically at launch. With the amount of open-source involvement in this, I realize this probably something innocuous like Checking for updates or something, but even then, connecting to some IP without any form of notification to the user raises immediate red flags to me.
If it is indeed about automatic updates, please allow the user to choose it consciously, rather than doing it behind the curtains. With a simple dialogue at first launch, saying "Automatic updates are enabled and will ensure DB4S is at the latest version" - with a prominent OK button and a "Change setting" text link that takes you to the Preferences page - you can also ensure that only those who really wish to disable auto-updates do that. Currently, even if the user wishes not to allow external connections (for whatever reason), a connection is going to happen at the very first launch, before (s)he has a chance to change the Preferences.
And whenever update check is going on, you could also give a simple notification, putting to use the several unused pixels at the bottom of the window. I consider this necessary because, given that DB4S is a desktop program that one doesn't expect to connect to the Internet, making external connections is an unusual state for the program and something that deserves a user notification. Putting it at the bottom left also keeps it similar to browser status messages, which would make it easier for users to grok.
I found it support 2d chart on GUI. Does it support 3d plt based on X, Y, Z data?
Thanks. I'll have have a try.
Thanks for the reminder.
in order to meet the requirements: `sudo yum install qt-devel ant-antlr antlr-C++`
(not exactly sure about the C++ bindings). while it builds with `cmake . && make && sudo make install`.
please check and add to the build instructions - tested on CentOS 7.1.
looks good. one probably would just need to validate the dependencies on a fresh install once,
because I'm not exactly sure if not others were already installed (they'll gonna complain, if not).
Just FYI: you also need gcc-c++ or the build fails with a CXX error on Fedora 22/23.
Sure, I can do that. I actually didn't end up installing from source since I ran into other issues with the build (it didn't find MAC or WIN but did find X11 and it wouldn't build).
So I did what I should have done from the start & looked in repo. Fedora actually packages it out so it's as easy as dnf install sqlitebrowser. I'll do a PR & update for Fedora 22/23.

Hi!
I'm using the Window's version of your great browser. One thing I've noticed is that each time I doubleclick on a cell and the window "Edit database cell" opens it moves further down the screen. After opening it a couple of times I need to move it back up before it disappears off screen. As you probably understand, it can be a bit irritating when doing lots of editing.
I would prefer if the edit-window always opened at the same position. Or even better if it opens in the position where it was last closed, to give the user control.
Hope this can be accomplished. :-)
Have a nice day wherever you are!
Thank you very much MKleusberg, your fix makes it work a lot better. :smile:
The first time after application start the Edit-window opens screen centered, but after that each subsequent opening is centered over the main window.
This is broken in the nightly build (at least since August 29th). Now the Edit-window appears screen centered every second time, and halfway outside the top left corner of the screen every second time. I know nightly builds may contain oddities but I just thought I'd mention it so it doesn't remain like this when you make a final build. :-)
I'm back to using the build from August 19th.
I can add that where the Edit-window appears depends on the position of the main form, but it seems to alternate between two places. Maybe some kind of offset?
The position of the main form is stored when the application is closed, so wouldn't it be nice if you could add a setting in Preferences to also store the position of the Edit-window? I think that would be the most general solution.
I just had another thought. Since this thread is labeled "Fix applied" perhaps I should start a separate thread with this "new bug-report"?
May the force of SQL be with you. =D
would love if we were able to edit(UPDATE) the returned SQL records from a SELECT query without having to manually issue an UPDATE statement or switching back to the data editor tab.
When i run a SELECT query, the results are not editable. Double-clicking in the cells does nothing. Would be awesome if i could edit the results in-place.
I understand the difficulties. Thank you for at least considering it.
... and how to use them?
Of course ^^ Thanks for your help @justinclift @MKleusberg :+1:
UTF16 = Case sensitive compare
UTF16CI = Case insensitive compare
comparison is performed by QString functions.
AFAIK the Byte order of QStrings are CPU dependent. This means, that the collation does not work if the byte order of QString does not match the byte order of the database.
The reason to choose this collating sequence was the need for a Unicode collation that really matched the in-memory comparison. Especially regarding  non-UCS2 chars and Unicode normalization. The performance should be OK as we're not copying any data here.

The new version of sqlitebrowser produces an error on attempting to open:

Having read some other posts this appears to be a 32 / 64 bit issue.  Am I out of luck or are there plans for a backward compatible version?
Anyway - thanks for a great application - even if it is stuck at 3.6.  (why is the new one 3.4.99?)

That worked.  Making qt only took an hour…..
Although it turns our I already had it installed in /opt/local/Library/Frameworks (21 Qt frameworks) and a remarkably large number of instances of sqlite3 in various places.  So my sqlitebrowser app is only 4.9 Mb - yours was ~ 19 including the three frameworks and libsqlite3.dylib.  So I'm assuming that my binary is very much dependent on being  on this machine.  Which is OK.
Anyway - somewhat surprisingly it seems to work just fine.
I appreciate your help.  If you ever need to test stuff I have machines running 10.3.9, 10.5.8, 10.7.5, and 10.10.4 and would be pleased to help out.

Homebrew reacted negatively to the antique OS, so no luck there…… ('operating system too old').

Building under Mac OS X 10.10 was broken using QT SDK 5.4. Add
To be able to build against sqlcipher fix INCLUDEPATH for mac by removing the -I from PATH.
When I launch version 3.7.0 on a Mac (10.10.2), the About DB Browser for SQLite page shows version 3.7.0.  But in the Finder, is shows version 3.4.99.
![screen shot 2015-07-13 at 1 32 29 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11401821/8643897/17425434-28ff-11e5-993a-90deb9a8bd26.jpg)
My mistake (my Mac was always launching the old version) -- close it.
Together with amount of rows returned, the amount of time the query took is the most important info if the query is successful. This info is at the bottom of the success/error pane. Could that info be on the first line together with the amount of rows? E.g. "5 Rows returned  in 115ms from:\n"
@justinclift Yes, this issue may be closed as well
Since most screens are more wide then high and query texts rarely occupy the screen's entire width,  the space in the "Execute SQL" tab could be used more efficiently if the query field could take up the entire left part of screen and the result/feedback fields were stacked on the right side.
Of course, the possibility to resize the left/right panes would be a bonus.
Wow, this is truly swift!
I'll have a look tomorrow...
The views are not expanding vertically...
Having considered the aesthetics, I still prefer the success/error pane to be stacked underneath the results pane. The editing of the query is the main task in this window hence its view should be most comfortable/efficient.
@justinclift Sure I will with this amount of speed and effort put in by MKleusberg... :-)
@MKleusberg @justinclift  Just tested the nightly build of July 10th. It works like a charm!
- I've got a 50% increase in vertical  space, which gives me much more oversight when editing and testing my queries.
- I also like I don't need to scroll down the entire success/error pane any more to see the performance figure of the query.
Thank you! I compliment you on your responsiveness....
Just out of curiosity, why is the query repeated in the success/error pane? I don't see an added value over the same text in the query pane. Wouldn't messages like "no such column: l.locationId" or "5 rows returned in 52ms" be enough on their own?
@justinclift Yes from my point of view this issue can be closed. Thanks for your support.
or Remove files that don't exist anymore, or both.
It would be good to have this extra menu item in the File menu, a bit like Notepad++
hey, i will try later today, thanks
sorry about the delay, confirmed working, thanks.
22 days in, still no portable 3.7.0 as far as i can see
possible to get a portable version released?
great, thanks :)
It would be a great addition if the `Table name` field would be auto completed by default with the file's name without the extension.
So if I'm trying to import a table from the file named `my_first_table.sql`, the `Table name` field would contain `my_first_table`, obviously, with the possibility to change it.
@justinclift, sure, but I don't know how
It's working great! Thanks.
Even with two tables, the dropdown is unnecessary small, it should **not** have arrows for such small dropdown.

`OS X Yosemite 10.10.3` and `DB4S Version 3.7.0`
Somehow it's solved, the list is now much bigger, and, for a small number of tables, there's no need for scroll. I'll close this issue and reopen it if the bug reappears.
Im having a similar to issue #89 but with the cells  content color

Problem:
Current software can display numbers only in decimal format.For my current use sqlite as a database,  many items are created in hex format. Not comfortable read them in decimal format.
Suggestion:
Every display of data has two options, decimal or hex. Let user to choose.
Thank you for your efforts!
Yes, your proposal is exactly what I want.😊
Wonderful, I have tried and like it. Thanks!
A little suggestion for hexadecimal display. Instead of  "printf('%x', `an item id`) ", "printf('0x%x', `an item id`)" may be better.
After I select an display type for an item, then exit the database. Next time, I enter this database, I still have to re-select the display type for this item. I know the reason is that the database does not remember my selection. Could this problem be solved?
I have a lot of BLOBs that I need to display in a hex format, so I made a small patch.

@justinclift I have updated my profile with my name. I would prefer not to give out my email address.
You're welcome :)
Happy to see this new feature. I updated to master and tested it out--thanks for the work to do this.
I'm not seeing a way to display values in a decimal format. Am I missing something?
Add backtick formatting to highlight required packages and file names.
"A table in this database requires a special collation function 'PHONEBOOK'..."
contacts2.db from Android 4.4.4 (HTC One M8 DS)
DB loads fine after clicking Yes once or 30 times No :) I can't open some tables (same errors), but can export them to CSV.
Win 8.1 64-bit 3.7.0
I've created a table called 'android_metadata' with a field called 'locale'.
Then I go to browse data and press "New Record" and get the following error:
"Error adding record:
near ")": syntax error (INSERT INTO 'android_metadata' VALUES ();)"
I guess its because I didn't enter any value to inserto to the DB, but there's no field to do it.
If i run the command from the "Execute SQL tab" it works fine.
I'm using Win8.1 x64
Thank you
I'm sorry for the long delay to reply.
I've just downloaded version 3.7.0 yesterday.
Those where my first steps into DBBrowser. Afterwards I added a few more tables and they worked fine, but this one still didn't.
I created a new db following "i think" the same steps and the table worked fine, but when I open my first file the error still happens.

Hi,
When opening a table that includes fields that are defined with COLLATE NOCASE a scary message box is displayed (see "Collation warning.jpg").
Trying to sort the table according to such a field gives wrong results both when trying to run a query (see "Wrong sorting using query.jpg") and when clicking the field header (see "Wrong sorting.jpg").
For comparison, the commercial SQLite Maestro application gives no warning and has no problem with the sorting (but of course it's not free).
Is there a solution for that?
Thanks,
Yaron Bank

Hi,
Thanks for your answer.
I really chose 'Yes'.
When I choose 'No' the sorting is really OK.
If I always chose 'No' will I be safe from harming my database?
Is there a way to set the application to always work with 'No', so I don't have to click 'No' the 1st time I open a table with COLLATE NOCASE fields?
Thanks,
Yaron Bank
Hi,
I thank you all for your answers.
Still, I want to be sure if I got it right that if I always chose 'No' for the message box I'd be on the safe side. If so, that would be good enough for me.
Thanks for your help,
Yaron Bank
Thanks a lot for all the commenters.
This has been very helpful.

```
sqlite> PRAGMA user_version = 20150623;
sqlite> PRAGMA user_version;
20150623
```
However, when viewing the database from DB4S, the User_Version will not be displayed correctly (it will be 10000) if the value is higher than 10000.
According to SQLite3 (https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_schema_version) the user_version is a 32-bit signed integer (maximum value is 2,147,483,647).
```
sqlite> PRAGMA user_version = 2147483647;
sqlite> PRAGMA user_version;
2147483647
```
Thanks for the quick reply and fix. I will test it tomorrow and get back to you.
Yes, it is working. The User_Version is displayed correctly now. Thanks a lot.
Function `setFont()`, without params, sets font for all lexems types. .
To set default font color to black I used `sqlLexer->setColor(Qt::black, QsciLexerSQL::Default)`.
That's also keeps numbers color with aquablue color
And it doesn't  looks very clever now, it thinks that every not special english SQL word is table or column name.

There is some old bug which presented from version 3.6. Look at this picture (first line) that's how it looks now, cyrillic characters (out of comments and quotes) are drawn with different font:
![image 10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5500999/8280145/0e3f9ea2-190d-11e5-84ce-87f600c57cda.png)
That's how it was in version 3.5.1 and probably the way it should be:
![image 6](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5500999/8280115/c6f13772-190c-11e5-8a12-39bb50c75e8c.png)
There is the test string:
``` SQL
абвгдеийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя
-- абвгдеийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя
SELECT *
FROM Student
WHERE name like 'Александр%'
```
This problem is presented also on windows and linux. Also changing font size doesn't affect size of this characters. Looks like It's also affect arithmetic characters and digits:
``` SQL
-- абвгдеийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя
SELECT 1234567890-=/+,.\|
FROM Student
WHERE name like 'Александр%'
```
I have tried to compile binded example, changed font.
``` cpp
...
textEdit->setUtf8(true);
QsciLexerSQL *lex = new QsciLexerSQL(this);
textEdit->setLexer(lex);
...
```
This is what I got. All as it should be:

Some characters a bit bolder but all the rest is ok.
I found out that if make this small fix in SqlTextEdit::reloadSettings() function, everything starts to work, but I'm not sure will it broke something or not...
``` cpp
...
defaultfont.setPointSize(PreferencesDialog::getSettingsValue("editor", "fontsize").toInt());
// sqlLexer->setDefaultFont(defaultfont); // comment this line
sqlLexer->setFont(defaultfont); // and replace with this line
setupSyntaxHighlightingFormat("comment", QsciLexerSQL::Comment);
...
```
Ok, let me try =)
I tried to delete a column via the "Modify Table" popup. Selecting the column and clicking on "Remove" brought up a popup that said "No error", but the column remained. The SQL log for the app shows:
SAVEPOINT sqlitebrowser_rename_column
CREATE TABLE `sqlitebrowser_rena... <string can not be logged, contains binary data> ...
INSERT INTO sqlitebrowser_rename_column_new_table SELECT`_ID`,`name`,`local_path_template`,`is_localized`,`is_automatic`,`file_set_id`FROM`FileInfo`;
DROP TABLE`FileInfo`;
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT sqlitebrowser_rename_column;
which I interpret to mean that a) the rollback means that the operation failed, despite the "No error" popup, and b) perhaps binary data in the CREATE TABLE statement is not helping, either? (Could this be a side-effect of the new UTF-8 support?)
Thanks for asking. I'm making an assumption here (yes, I could try it out, but... :-) that the sqlite API reports an error message if you try to delete a table, or rows in a table, that can't be deleted due to a FK constraint. So if sqlite's error message(s) could be displayed in the popup, instead of it displaying "No error", that would be a big help. If that's not feasible, then even "Unknown Error" would be better. As it was, the "No error" lulled me into thinking that indeed no error had occurred. (Maybe "No error" was displayed not to mean that no error had occurred, but rather that an error _had_ occurred but the browser couldn't determine what the error was.)
I realize this is asking quite a bit more, but: It would be great if, when I try to delete a table or column that's referenced by a foreign key, the browser could tell me in advance of execution "You can't do that; it's got foreign keys pointing to it."
Thank you! Hi, all,
I'm very sorry for not getting back to you on this. The short story is that
I _think_ that it worked, but I no longer have access to the database where
I found the issue.
Thanks,

How do I export the file back to its original extension and format in ".db"?
Hi Justin thanks a lot for the insight!
I see the export options when I click "Export the database" - here's a screenshot
http://i.imgur.com/6t6brlp.png
How do I save the changes directly to the file?? (without exporting to a new file) That would be best!
I apologize for the dumb question but, what is DB4S?? Is it a ".db" file editor? I've googled it and pulled nothing (I'm new to databases btw!)
Ooopsie!! Sorry xD
Well I just downloaded the zip and trying to make this DB4S work but there's no exe to launch the program!! How do get this thing to work? I can't wait to try it!
Thanks so much guys it worked!
I've used the SQLCipher instructions to allow my iOS app to create an encrypted database.  When I try to open it in sqlitebrowser I just continuously get prompted to enter the password.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.  Any ideas?
It does use SQLCipher to do the encryption, what i don't know is what the page size is.  I wrote the app using the instructions on the SQLCipher website, but it doesn't say anything about what page size it's using.  What can I do to start investigating?
Thanks for your help, I found the problem.  You mentioned building sqlitebrowser with a newer version of SQLCipher, well that's what I needed to do.  My iOS app was using an old version of SQLCipher.  Once I updated SQLCipher to the latest from github, I could read my databases in sqlitebrowser.  I even tested with sqlitebrowser 3.7.0 and it worked great.  Thanks for your help!
Prior to version 3.6.0 windows allowed me to assign the ".gpkg" (GeoSpatial format built on a SQLite file) extension to be opened with sqlitebrowser.  With versions 3.6.0 and 3.7.0, Windows won't allow me to associate the file extension with sqlitebrowser.exe
That was it exactly. I don't know how that didn't come up in my search for a fix. I greatly appreciate your prompt and precise reply :)
Version 3.6.99, Qt Version 4.8.5, SQLite Version 3.7.17 OS  Centos 7.2
There is no provision for naming or changing fields.  The database is limited to default field names e.g. field1, field2, etc.
Yes, it Is peculiar.  I am able to make entries on a contemporary build under OsX, but not under Centos Linux.
Yes, I ran the build scripts locally; no error flags during the process.  My local build seemingly supports everything except revision of field names v.v. Importing a database created on a Mac, entering new data, changing old data, outputting to CSV, exporting, all work uneventfully.

Spot on ... prominent with the Centos build.  Thanks.
I’m using a Cinnamon shell over GNOME (v.v. GTK3+ based), so yes there could be a source of divergence.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30643061/sqlite-db-browser-invalid-operand-for-regexp
I use DB Browser for SQLite version 3.6.0; SQLite Version 3.8.9. If I use regexp on a nullable column `revision` then `invalid operand` error is happened.
``` sql
SELECT brand,revision FROM TDevice WHERE TDevice.revision regexp '^ASUS$';
```
Below is the schema:
``` sql
CREATE TABLE `TDevice` (
`id`    INTEGER NOT NULL,
`model` varchar(128) NOT NULL,
`revision`  TEXT,
PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
```
After I replaced the NULL `revision` with empty string, then this issue fixed.
``` sql
UPDATE TDevice SET revision='' WHERE revision IS NULL
```
I assume `regexp` should behave as `LIKE` operator, because `LIKE` operator can accept NULL text.
When a table is empty an you export, (suing the first 2 checkbox)
it will export an additional ); just after the create table.
Consequently, It makes an error  when you import,
It works with the latest nightly build.
Thanks !!!!
Using File > Export > Database to SQL File:
Tables containing some data, are written correctly. But for empty tables, an extra ); is added on a new line, after the table.
Example:
correct:
CREATE TABLE "Table_with_data" (
"object_id" INTEGER NOT NULL,
"value" REAL NULL);
INSERT INTO `Table_with_data` VALUES (1,40.0);
INSERT INTO `Table_with_data` VALUES (2,90.0);
CREATE TABLE "Empty_table" (
"object_id" INTEGER NOT NULL,
"value" REAL NULL);
); <<<<<<<<<< redundant closing bracket
OK, I will. I'll let you know if it works. Thanks for fixing!
Hi Justin,
Just tested with the nightly build and confirm fixed. Export is correct.
Thanks,
Best regards
DB Browser for SQlite for SQLITE

while execute sql,
the sentence :

Its working ...Thanx #justinclift
Since sqlitebrowser is oriented towards end-users, it would be optimal if it could be executed from the command line to open a specific database, switch to a specific tab (e.g. Browse Data), open a specific table, and (if feasible) do so either "read-only" or "editing enabled".
Example:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser.exe  --path=x:\mydb.db   --tab=browse   --table=mytable   --action=edit  "
This capability would enable sqlitebrowser to be executed from other applications within a specific context for a specific purpose while ensuring that the end-user gets exactly where they need to be.
Thank you for a great tool.
Don't know about Windows, but with OSX you can do it yet.
This works fine with 32-bit version 3.5.1 (clean portable install) on the same database. I'm reverting to the old version for now.
System: Windows 8.1 Pro
Version: 3.6.0 Portable 64-bit
Hi, the latest nightly build for Windows I found is an older version: 3.4.0
The front page links here: http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
OK, everything works fine with the nightly build. Thanks
On Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 (6.1.7601), the dialog message box, "sqlitebrowser.exe - System Error" is displayed with the following message: "The program can't start because MSVCR120.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."

I uninstalled and resinstalled sqlitebrowser.exe, but that did not work.
I then installed the Visual C++Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 from: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=40784 and installed for 64bit OS. The application then launched successfully.
I'm not a developer, but I suspect that this DLL from MSFT should either be included with your installation or a prerequisite. Hope this helps.
Hi,
I just downloaded and opened version 3.6.0, and there seems to be an issue with the Browse Data feature. When I open my database and browse data, sqlitebrowser shows all of my BLOB columns as being occupied with BLOB, when in fact only a subset of them are (as revealed by browsing with version 3.5.1, and my work with this database). I'm running Mac OSX Yosemite (10.10.3). Please let me know if you need any more information.
Just checked today's build (*20150607.dmg), and the problem is fixed! Thanks, and keep up the good work.
Each time I click on a cell, its editing window will be opened on different positions and it makes me move the window to other positions because the save changes button will be placed under the taskbar.
@justinclift You should set certain positions for such windows. Currently If you edit some cells without moving the window, after four or more times you have to move the window to other positions because you cannot click the save changes button! And that's the problem.
Probably it's me being a non-native speaker of English, but what you mean?
The text before decrypted visible? There is the command 'od`, right?
I'm using a Surface Pro 2 connected to an external 1920x1080 display.
Some text looks really small since it isn't being scaled properly.

You can always use the Windows Simulator to test this across various window sizes and resolutions.
It is a problem for me too. The save icon is 2mm wide on my screen for reference.

Thanks @justinclift - the new version looks fine.
Sorry, I thought the version in the Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon repo would be recent.
Every time i open a database the sqlitebrowser automatically stops working. why? do I need to install something to enable it work properly?

No really, I use at work on a windows 7 PC which works fine but at home I have a windows 8 PC which appears to work fine up until i try and open a database.

So i should try the 32-bit version?
Yep the 32-bit versions seems to be ok.  thanks for the help
Ok thanks any how.  I'm happy with the 32-bit so far as the databases I'm using aren't that big...yet!
At the end of installation, you are given an option to run the program. However the program is run as an administrator user, rather than the user that initially launched the installer.
Windows 7 64 bit and version 3.6.0
The UAC plug-in for NSIS has a UAC_AsUser_ExecShell macro which can be used instead of ExecShell
When you enter a query in "Execute SQL" tab with line-break, your query is not logged properly :
The first line is logged then
&lt;string can not be logged, contains binary data&gt;
Maybe replacing line-breaks with whitespaces could solve the issue.
DB4S 3.6.0 under Windows 8.1 pro x64
Just checked 3.7.0, not solved.
a query which don't need a working database :
```
WITH RECURSIVE
cnt(x) AS (VALUES(1) UNION ALL SELECT x+1 FROM cnt WHERE x<1000000)
SELECT x FROM cnt;
```
taken from [Recursive Query Examples](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_with.html)
Every line is logged correctly, no longer truncated and no
&lt;string can not be logged, contains binary data&gt;
but...
a side effect appeared: empty lines are logged in User log
if you add 5 empty lines at the end of you sql command, User log will contains 5 empty lines
this is not the case in Application log
this issue is not present in 3.7.0 release
I notice the Application log is sightly different than User log
Just to be sure I explained the behavior clearly:
Consider this 4 lines query (3 lines + 1 empty)
```
WITH RECURSIVE
cnt(x) AS (VALUES(1) UNION ALL SELECT x+1 FROM cnt WHERE x<1000000)
SELECT x FROM cnt;
```
With v3.7.0 this query creates 2 lines in User log:
```
WITH RECURSIVE
cnt(x) AS (VAL... <string can not be logged, contains binary data> ...
```
and 3 lines in Application log:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (WITH RECUR... <string can not be logged, contains binary data> ...
WITH RECURSIVE
cnt(x) AS (VAL... <string can not be logged, contains binary data> ...
```
With nightly build, the 4 lines of the query are copy/paste in User log:
```
WITH RECURSIVE
cnt(x) AS (VALUES(1) UNION ALL SELECT x+1 FROM cnt WHERE x<1000000)
SELECT x FROM cnt;
```
And 6 lines in Application log:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (WITH RECURSIVE
cnt(x) AS (VALUES(1) UNION ALL SELECT x+1 FROM cnt WHERE x<1000000)
SELECT x FROM cnt);
WITH RECURSIVE
cnt(x) AS (VALUES(1) UNION ALL SELECT x+1 FROM cnt WHERE x<1000000)
SELECT x FROM cnt LIMIT 0, 50000;
```
I would really like to help improve DB4S but I'm unable to build the source code actually.
I checked the latest nightly,
the commit from @MKleusberg is working perfectly.
Well done :+1:
When you close a database, "Execute SQL" tab get cleared.
There is no warning about that.
Logs got cleared too (user & application).
I tested 3.6.99 nightly build.
It happens too.
Added to the list :wink:
Beside me, anyone else could find useful to be able to open an in-memory sqlite database ?
https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html
I know you can't open an existing in-memory database.
I was thinking this could be useful for testing purpose only.
Instead of creating a database file which need to be dropped / deleted when you want to test something else or test a database generation script.
Not a priority enhancement, I admit :wink:
Maybe, need to take time and look into the code.
Btw, is there a howto build/compile DB4S somewhere ?
or at least a "required" list of things I need to be able to build it ?
I work with visual studio 2013 community
Thanks for the link
I will check and report
There is problem in execute SQL tab when query includes Unicode characters for example Japanese or Chinese kanji. All characters turns to question marks.
CREATE TABLE `Testing` (
`id_@`  text,
`name`  text,
`adress`    text)
select id_@ from testing
The new 64-bit version is obviously not an update but a completely separate program to any existing 32-bit installation. Certainly not a bug by any means, but perhaps a note could be included somewhere for unaware users.
I was unaware of sqlitebrowser's 32-bit-only history and just assumed it had always come in 64-bit offerings when I saw the 64-bit download. As a result, my head got scratched a few times when it kept asking me to install 3.60 even after updating. It only dawned on me when I uninstalled 3.60 and still saw 3.40 sitting in my x86 folder :)
Well, I can think of at least two ideas.
The most useful spot would be in the 'There is a new version, please download' pop-up alert that appears, since it's what triggers most users to download the new version in the first place. Having such a note would clutter up the alert window though, and wouldn't be relevant to someone updating to a 32-bit version or (eventually) from a 64-bit version.
The neater solution is to have the installer detect existing 32-bit installations as well and uninstall them before continuing. This turns into a much bigger implementation though, with the need to migrate user configs/etc to the new directory in addition to the 32-bit detection.
Not a critical issue now but maybe something to think of down the line? I'm sure this happens in countless other projects too- maybe others have addressed the issue elegantly before.
Can do! Need to work on some projects at the moment but will be sure to
find some time this weekend for you. Great to hear about your progress :)
Hi, I would like to suggest a "Close database" button beside the "new" and "open" buttons.
A better enhancement would be a tab in settings to select active buttons in a list of possibilities allowing users a bit of customization.
I don't know about Qt
I could contribute with code, I have to free up time
текст -> ?????
Howdy
When I add a new field, it adds the field. However I cannot change the name after I save it. It keeps the name it was created with (e.g. field24). I have tried restarting, and I cannot delete the row. Only add. When I try to delete the row I get a popup that says "no error".

Thoughts or advice?
I tried with 3.5 as well, still won't work. I can provide the database.
Oh hey sorry!
I havent used this for over a year. You can close this issue!

Hello,
Congratulations for your software. I'm the lead developper of the project : EduPython (http://edupython.tuxfamily.org/) which is a portable python distribution for French Teachers (this may excuse my bad english ;) ). Edupython is under free licence CeCILL-B.
1 - Can I include your sqlitebrower in my next EduPython distribution ?
2 - Can I help you by translating sqlitebrowser in french ?
Thanks for your answer,
Any help translating is always welcome. Just submit a pull request.
I will leave @justinclift to answer your other query.

Hi,
```
Thanks a lot for this very good new ! Yes I can include it in my
```
python distrib, because it contains, Python engine, IDE (pyscripter),
and tools (see the screen shot). I already do this with a very old
version of SQlite Databas Browser.
Best regards,
@magicvinni if you need help with doing a pull request you can just ask, however the GitHub help, StackExchange and Google should also be useful. My suggestion to you is that you do it all in one commit, so just take your time and do the one commit. If you don't it's fine, we have commit merging instructions on the wiki
Hi,
Thanks. I saw, with the usage, I need to improve it a little...
If no database is loaded it would be really helpfull if you could drag one on the main app window.
But for completeness:
Win 7 Pro
DB Browser Version 3.6.0
Qt Version 5.4.1
SQLite Version 3.8.9
fresh install from today
Self-explanatory: I'm using sqlitebrowser to examine data but only the affiliated software must be permitted to modify the DB in any way! Lest a slip of the mouse occur, I respectfully request that you folks implement an Open Read-Only capability down the road or ASAP. Hey, THANKS!
Y'know, it's actually not a crucial thing. You'd have to be a dumbo to click on "Write changes". So let the reader be the judge of the value of this request.
I have just tried opening a database, issuing some queries and then doing a binary diff, nothing changes, which is good. I then marked the database file read-only and when I tried to add a row I got an error message. So, DB Browser for SQLite does seem to do the write thing. As a workaround I would mark the file read-only to avoid problems. However it would still be good for us to add an enhancement displaying "read only mode" and also handling the UI better.
I tested on Windows by the way.
'Glad to see you're pursuing this. You said as a workaround you could "mark the file read-only". I'll just go ahead and assume you mean by that to enter the appropriate direct command under the program's "Execute SQL" tab. I confess to and apologize for my utter ignorance of SQL command lingo but no matter. You say you may integrate the read-only ability into the UI and I am thankful!
@JoeErsatz sorry, I meant use your operating system to mark the file read-only. So, before you load the database file in DB Browser for SQLite, find the file with your operating system utilities and mark the file read-only
Windows. Hey no, I get you now -- I actually had considered momentarily that was your meaning but concluded otherwise. No I cannot mark the file read-only because it's over a LAN but more importantly the software controlling the DB is constantly running (at that other LAN node).
@justinclift for the scenario @JoeErsatz has outlined the only option is "Open Read Only" within DB4S. Given this is labelled as an enhancement and we have clearly outlined why then we just need to wait for a pull request or similar
Yes, it is still of interest to me. Many earnest thanks for your efforts in regard to my request! But I won't be testing it via the nightly build. Instead, I harbor every confidence that you guys know precisely what you're doing, and if the feature appears in the next release then it will be employed. I presume the implementation of read-only open in sqlitebrowser is a proverbial "walk in the park". Thanks!  OS Windows Prof 7 x 64. Both versions x86 & x64 not prints russian symbols in SQL Window
Found this one while translating. Not sure where else I should change it. (The pt_BR translation already accounts for it).
Will do.
Got other 2!
Wait! @MKleusberg What do you think about csvparser.h line 13? "provde"?
@justinclift Mind issuing a `cat src/csvparser.h | grep provde`? Not sure exactly what is that.
@MKleusberg Agreed. It makes sense now. I am not squashing these commits as it would break their atomicity.
Unless there is stuff that still needs checking or rereading, I am done.
I don't believe there are any other typos left. At least not in comments or strings.
Glad to know that.

@schdub, yes, data is equivalent. [DB](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2957764/Gortrans.db)
If choose point shape Disk on windows build, plot displays similar mac build.
I believe I tested this well enough to be sure. Started browser, opened a DB, closed browser. On next start, browser went back to looking for DBs in generic user folder. Since I mostly use the browser to do quick checks on previously-opened DBs, this is a usability drop.  I uninstalled the latest version and re-installed the previous, so I do not have version 3.6.0 to test further.
This has come up a few times with 3.6.0 and also earlier than that. The nightly builds have some updates in. So I would suggest either using them or go to 3.6.0 and use the "Most Recently Used" database on the file menu. Which sounds like it might work better for you.
Hi,
Every time i start SQLite Browser it pops up with "New version available". I can click "OK" and "Don't show again". Clicking OK obviously warrants the popup to show again when i start the application again (till i update), but the "Don't show again" button should just stop me from seeing the "New version available" popup. Also after restarts. Right now it seems to behave the same as clicking OK since restarting the application will still show me the popup...
And yes, if i update the popup is obviously gone, but that isn't the point of this bug report :)
Regards,
Mark
The values are:
disable : true
major : 3
minor : 6
I've had these same symptoms on two computers. I can only access one, but i suspect the other one also has a patch version in the future. Setting the patch value to 0 seems to fix it for me (for now).
I was using 3.5.1. I just updated to 3.6.0 (i see you folks updated Qt to 5.4.1, nice!).
I think this bug can be closed now. I will open a new one if i encounter this issue again on 3.6.0 or higher.
I run the installer for the 64 bit build, and every time I try and run it, it fails to run and shows the following dialog:
![http://i.imgur.com/ZTo3FeK.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZTo3FeK.png)
I am running windows 8.1 64 bit, and the 32 bit installer version works fine
Was about to raise this issue myself, the 64bit does the same thing on Windows 7. Likewise, the 32bit version works fine.
That was my problem, I had the 2012 64-bit version installed, but not the 2013 version. Works fine after that's been installed on Windows 7.
@justinclift then the installer should definitely be updated to download / include the installer for vcrdst2013, because i'm on the latest 'production' windows operating system and I didn't have those run time components. Let alone anyone on windows 7 or anything earlier.
You should be able to include the installer that is on that microsoft website you linked in the windows installer builds, as the license is meant for exactly that.
Hello,
trying to type Non-English characters and more specifically Greek at the 'Execute SQL' panel or trying to load an SQL file containing Greek characters they appear as English language question marks( ? ). Why is this happening ? I would like to note that data containing Greek characters stored in the database's tables are presented correctly in the Grid when a select statement is executed at the 'Execute SQL' panel. See attached picture for an example of what is going on.
Thank you very much.

Hi again,
thanks for the quick response and sorry for the delayed comeback.
Well, the problem is partially fixed using the nightly build suggested. Now typing Greek characters directly at the 'Execute SQL' panel works as expected but the problem remains when trying to load an SQL file containing Greek characters that is saved using the default Windows ANSI encoding - if it's saved as UTF-8 then it loads properly(Greek characters are shown correctly). This is a minor issue but it would be nice to work either way. I say this because working also with other databases like MS Sql Server for example loading the same SQL file in Sql Server Management Studio using either encoding(ANSI or UTF-8) files are loaded without issues.
Thank you very much.
hi there, I can't write persian words in sql panel and I don't know what should I do? help me please.
Please change dialog title and message to reflect the actual choices.
@justinclift suggested "NOCASE collation does not handle multi-byte characters"
The text didn't change from 3.9.1 to 3.9.99.  :confused:
I'm not sure about that. What will happen if you choose "No"? From a purely UI pov a warning with just one button has the same effect: you execute the query anyway. So what the user (me) needs to know is what effect will the choices have.
Something like:
Title: "NOCASE collation does not handle multi-byte characters. Proceed? "
Message:
"A table in this database requires a special collation function '%1' "
"that this application can't provide without further knowledge.\n"
"If you do proceed, YYY.\n"
"Be aware bad things can happen to your database. Create a backup!"
Replace the YYY and NNN with the effects.

but 3.5.1 is normal.
for example
insert into TextureInfo values ('1','1','1','1','ADDITION','덧셈','加法','jiāfǎ','加','jiā','法','fǎ','','','','','','','1','心算加法','xīnsuànjiāfǎ','덧셈을 암산하다.','20150501','120000','','');
thanks, your rapid reply. I use 3.5.1 well. Later I will download upVersion.
One more question, I hope you see attch file ==> ex01.mp4.
I want to know Only my pc's font problem or bug.
There is no problem on Coding. Only showing problem.
Thanks to your good reply. It's good to know this problem.
I hope  you and your team go well.
In 3.6.0 editor crash but grid is good.
In 3.5.1 editor is good but grid crash.
Okay, Now I downed 3.7.0 and tested.
Everything is OK. There are no problems in both editor and grid.
Thanks to your continuous cares.
move field up sometimes make a crush, and most of the time I have sth like this:

FreeBSD 10.1
SQLBrowser 3.5.1
@MKleusberg sure, I'll check it out soon.
Version 3.6.0
Qt Version 4.8.7
SQLite Version 3.8.11.1
Still the same
Actually I think that I make some mistake.
https://freshports.org/databases/sqlitebrowser/ According this, it should be 3.7.0 version, rather than my 3.6.0. Seems interesting, why `pkg upgrade` didn't catch this scenario.
Doesn't use FreeBSD for a while, so...
Will check and repeat in further.
Sorry for worrying.
If problem still take place, I'll write to port maintainer.
Yes, it continuous even with 3.7.0 compiled from ports.
I invited the maintainer coder@tuxfamily.org, so It's nothing I can do more.
2 years past since.
I'm no more FBSD everyday user ;D  No .qm files are installed anywhere with make install command.
Also, seems like the program searches for "translations" directory only in directory with the executable, e.g. in /usr/bin.
Sorry for my english.

@justinclift  I am preoccupied with other projects and helping my Juniors with their thesis, no promises but i can "try" to look into this by creating a window in my very tight schedule (my apologies).
:smiley:
Yep, now language is selectable and works fine. Many thanks.
Thanks  @schdub  @justinclift , I will package the changes on testing ppa asap. :smile:  :smiley:
Hello.
I've found one instance sqlitebroser returns one wrong row on 3.5.1 and 3.6.0. SqliteAdmin-0.8.3.2 works fine and so does every other software I tested. Unfortunately I'm working under NDA so I can't publish the query or the database but I can send them privately on request.
I suppose I shouldn't be surpised by your response speed any more. :grin:
Thanks @justinclift
It works. Never crossed mi mind to choose 'No' when asked 'Proceed?'. :grin: That dialog is kind of misleading. Maybe handle it as a separate issue?
Anyways, thanks @schdub.
Issue #308
I think that's about it for this issue. Multibyte nocase collation will come in due time so creating another issue for it won't help. Right?
Hello, I had just fresh install sqlite 3.6 64 bit edition and I got 0xc00007b problem. indicates that a 32-bit application is trying to load a 64-bit dll. maybe it's my windows? i'm not thinking so...
oh, sqlite browser is built by Qt!
windows 7 home premium 64 bit (updated)
Good to know that it is known to work.
thank you for replying, @justinclift . I had just known that SQLite 3.6 requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013. I actually have the 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013 for both x86 and x64 architecture.
Oh, okay, my bad that I did not notice the note.
it solves the problem.
would be handy if the installer comes with an installer for VC2013 Redist for VS2013 tho. I had the VC2013 redist only..
thank you for reminding me, @justinclift
No, Installing Visual C++ 2013 Redist (x86 / x64) does not fix the problem.
but,
installing Visual C++ 2013 Redist (in my case is x64 (I take 64-bit version)) **FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2013** fixes the problem.
marking as solved.
thank you!
@justinclift Hello again..
weird, why do I need to reinstall (repair) my Visual C++ 2013 Redist for Visual Studio 2013 every time I reinstalled (in my case, I updated) SQLite Browser.. does the installer replace any file?
Scrolling in one direction at a time is not possible. Very difficult to stay in same column when scrolling down because it scrolls left or right at the same time. Locking first scroll direction would be a big improvement.
Sorry, my laptop fan just died so can't retrieve version. But just update to latest release a few weeks ago on OS X Yosemite.
Trackpad for scrolling. I'll have to wait about a week for my new fan, then I can try latest release.
Yes, wide and tall databases
OK, just received my new fan and MBPro is working again. Found that my installed sqlitebrowser version was 3.6.0. So already had the newest (other than nightlies which I haven't tried yet)
Just wanted to comment that i'm still seeing this scrolling behavior in v3.7.0
But it may actually be more of an OS X issue.
edit: I've made some adjustments to (almost all) of my trackpad settings and the scrolling has become much better. As I suspected, something in the OS was causing the issue. After a reboot, and reopening the database, scrolling is much more responsive and not as "wild" as before. Please consider this issue closed for me.
Since 3.6.0 sql editor font is not monospace. Please support font customization.
Wow! You just broke about every response time record I've ever heard of.
Indeed! :clap: @MKleusberg
How do I set the font manually?

Thanks. I'll let you know you nailed it as soon as I can. :smile:
Nailed it. Not that there was any doubt about it. :grin:
:+1: @justinclift, @MKleusberg
Previous versions were all build statically. So I could have exe file in one directory.. The 3.6.0 is build dynamically with a bunch of files which is not very nice. You should also link to the msvcrt statically.
As the title says I'm having trouble registering the `*.db` file extension. When I double click such a file I'm asked to select the program to open it with. When I navigate to `C:\Program Files\sqlitebrowser3\bin` and choose `sqlitebrowser.exe` it is not added to the "Open with" window and thus I can't select it as the default option.
It seems like the same issue, but I didn't find it using the search. I'll attempt the solution later this week and let you know.
Yes that solution has worked for me. I changed the value of `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\sqlitebrowser.exe\shell\open\command` from `"C:\Program Files (x86)\SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser.exe" "%1"` to `"C:\Program Files\SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser.exe" "%1"` and the extension can once again be registered. Thanks for the help.
Hi.
What can I do to import my database on my website?
Thank you very much!
Hi guys,
I've got tables with fields marked as NotNull. Tried to add a new record which returns "Error adding record: NOT NULL constraint failed".
I'm guessing the logic defaults everything to NULL for the user to change.
Current workaround: uncheck not null fields, add new record, populate with requisite data, recheck not null fields
HI. I want to create a sqlcipher database. Is it support or not ???
Thanks

It's only create a simple database,not create a sqlcipher database (encryption).
ok. i will download the sqlcipher version. and try it latter.
Thanks.
ok. i have download SQLCipher Version 3.8.6 .
But when i create a database it also tips a simple database and then create a table .
how to create a SQLCipher database with my custom key ????
Thanks
like this https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher
I have now started a Wiki page on this, happy for others to improve it
yeah.great job~ thanks.
Look for an installed antlr v2, and if available use it instead of its embedded copy.
Just installed for the first time. When attempting to run it, I get "sqlitebrowser.exe is not a valid Win32 application". No warnings about DLLs or other dependencies missing. I downloaded the correct binary for my CPU/OS architecture (both 32-bit) and I have MSVC redistributable 2013 installed. Is Windows XP not supported anymore?
Well, as I am sure you know, Microsoft don't support Windows XP any more. I don't believe there was a conscious decision to drop it though. Can you confirm you have SP2 applied? Oh and could you try the nightly download for Windows from the repository home page?
Even though I am on XP I stay as up to date as I can on things, so I have the latest service pack and all other updates available of course. I will try the nightly build and report back.
EDIT: Yep, the nightly build runs.
I also run XP SP3 with VC++2013.
just wanted to confirm that the nightly build 3.6.99 works fine, but sqlitebrowser-3.6.0v2-win32.exe fails with same error that Nisto previously reported.
Will there be a nightly build of 3.7.7 for us to try?
Yes indeed, am perfectly happy to keep using the nightly version for now, thank you.
I can confirm that sqlitebrowser-3.6.0v3-win32.exe works on my win XP sp3. Thanks :+1:
Testing a bit around with the portable version, I just noticed, that version 3.9.0 (to be precise: the portable launcher) on Windows XP shows an error message, that it requires at least Vista.
Is this a bug or has support of Win XP officially been dropped? I couldn't find an info about that in the release notes.
Improve the build and run of tests:
- allow the build of tests within the main build, so there's no need for a separate build for them, and ctest works with them
- split the `sqlb-unittests` in two separate (and different) tests
> This is failing in Travis CI btw.
I guess that's because the build instructions still do the old build way. Is it something I can fix, or you need to adjust something in travis?
> Can you maybe rabase them
Yep, done.
That's ok for me.
In 'Execute SQL' tab:
If I copy or type the following SQL and execute it:
``` sql
```
it becomes:
``` sql
```
and the result is `63` (Unicode value for question mark(`?`)).
I'm using 3.6.0 on Windows 8.1.
All right, the nightly build fixed the problem.
In the 'structure' as well as the 'DB Schema' (aren't those two not the same ref to the table called 'sqlite_master' and therefore can better carry only one of aforementioned names [my suggestion 'Schema', bc it's called like that in most books and RFC's] ?) window is a column 'type' (may be one of the four on the left - 'table', 'view', 'index', 'trigger' [ eventually 'meta', but in practice I've never seen such a type... ] so to save space and avoid confusion to others and me you may safely remove it. My €0.02
Sorry I forgot the column-name 'Schema'. One may call it by name in sqlite_master  'SQL' (or lower case 'sql')
Another thing: it seems that the version with sqlcipher when created with 512 byte page_size is automatically changed to the default 1024. Is therefore a reason?
Data type isn't decided by column type, but user's decision on 'Edit database cell' dialog.
Note : This topic is discussed on issue #239.
I see. I missed such a case.
At any case, `using QAbstractTableModel::setData` is a bad solution.
`setData` mehod I modified should be implemented as another method (not as overload), I guess.
The another method is like following.
``` cpp
bool setTypedData(const QModelIndex& index, bool isBlob, const QVariant& value, int role);
// or
bool setTypedData(const QModelIndex& index, int dataType, const QVariant& value, int role);
```
@justinclift Sorry to be late. Now, I don't find another issue about this.
I'll modify code based on current trunk soon.
[progress report]
Now, I'm checking current branch for merging this feature.
Maybe, I'll finish all by next Sunday.
I fixed 2 bugs that pointed by @MKleusberg.
1. prevention of in-place editing
2. the lack of tr()
@justinclift Sorry about dirty commit history.
I packed these commits to one.
Sorry for the lateness guys, I'm moving from one country to another so those last days are being pretty busy. I'll get back to this next week but no problem if you guys want to merge it :)
SEP has flagged at as fraud software and was reported on 5 users machines
I have used SEP to scan the installers and extracted versions as well as Norton Internet Security (NIS) and no issues are found. However on a SEP box when I run the installer I get this:
![sep_scan](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1067355/7428265/7d5be9b8-efe5-11e4-91ae-2ba285957e0a.jpg)
Once you go past that everything is fine. All the above shows is that SEP has not seen this very much and is being cautious.
Where do you see this "flagged as fraud software"? A screenshot might help us.
Click More info
Be interesting to see if someone has compromised the code or the exe file
I also know that SQL light was featured on Hak5. Popular online tech show
I clicked "More Details" and can see this:
![sep_scan2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1067355/7429868/7690045e-f001-11e4-96ae-f65e377b1c12.jpg)
This tells me it is a "reputation" issue, it is unproven but some evidence it is trust worthy, less than 5 SEP users have seen it and it is new. All of which I would expect for a new release of software like this. I am not seeing the link to fraud software to be honest.
Eg someone makes there own executable and then find a way to uploads it to
the official website
To me SEP is just saying I have not see this very much before. If you are concerned it is compromised then I suggest you download the code, study it and compile it yourself. Clearly if you find a problem in the code please open an issue
I thought about the SHASUMS but if a hacked can replace the exe then replacing the SHASUMS is no big deal right?
For me Synamtec is doing the right thing, it is warning you of a low reputation file, but I guess we could ask how to avoid this, which is probably a good question.
Geoff is getting the same error message as me. So the reputation and sha
hadh should be the same. and someone would need to label it as fraudware
its concerning. You can open a file these days and find your entire data
wiped, stolen or executable remotely phones home :)
I think generally Adam we all share your concerns, however this problem is not unique to this project, I have seen SEP (and NIS the consumer product) do this with other software, particularly with new releases.
@justinclift I suggest we close this issue and query Symantec about reputation warnings to see what, if anything, we can do? I am happy to pick this up with them if you want me to.
No problem, happy to pick this up. Do you want me to provide any feedback in this issue, or close this and I'll raise a new one with any actions?
@justinclift my conclusion is we would need to submit our new binaries to https://submit.symantec.com/whitelist/isv/ which seems worth a try to me. Would you like me to do this for the v3 files?
PS http://sqlitebrowser.org/ is pointing to the v2 Windows exe files, which needs updating
@justinclift website looks better now, thanks! I know we mentioned e-mail via sqlitebrowser.org before but I can use my work e-mail, which is probably better, if you are okay with that?
Leave it with me then and I'll see what happens, might be a "fire and forget"....
Just been reading and...
```
To prevent false positive detections we strongly recommend vendors to
digitally sign their software with a class 3 digital certificate.
```
My guess is we would need to do so with the installer and executable. Any thoughts?
Not forgotten but going slowly, sorry.

Version 3.6.0
Qt Version 4.8.6
SQLite Version 3.8.9
Mac OS X 10.10.3
```
With large CREATE TABLE statements, the interface kinda messes up in those two interfaces (Database Structure tab, and the right side window, DB Schema), as it tries to show the full CREATE TABLE statement with all the newlines, tabs and spaces included. These CREATE TABLE statements are created by SQLAlchemy, so thats why they are formatted that way, but it theoretically could happen with manual written statements too if people like them to look pretty in the code.
Easier to show a screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/8bCmexZ.png
I would suggest making it so that the Database Structure tab, all the 'tables' are not so far apart (as it shows the large Create Table statement by default, and maybe have that as a drop down arrow as a child of the table, so it doesn't mess up the formatting/spacing of the table by default?
And also for the DB Schema side window on the right, i dont think there is a need to show the full CREATE TABLE statement anyway, as you are already parsing out the individual columns anyway and showing the relevant part (per the column) right next to the column anyway. Maybe add entries for Foreign Keys and you won't need the whole CREATE TABLE statement?
That option does exist! thanks.
I guess i just don't understand why we even have the 'text' schema there at all, what does 'column_name VARCHAR(200)' tell us that already parsed columns with the 'name' and 'type' information in the respective columns don't? I would support just getting rid of the text schema (except for maybe one place), and just have everything be available in the graphical tree view, including foreign keys, NOT NULL constraints, etc
Another picture, this of MySQLWorkbench, a program that is basically like sqlitebrowser only for mysql, and it sorta has what i'm envisioning for the schema views, where everything is available in a tree like fashion and we don't really need the giant CREATE TABLE string...
http://i.imgur.com/KGfYq4m.png
Copyin text from sql-results with non-ascii (cyrillic symbols) it displays wtih ????
The problem resolved. Thanks a lot.
Click Open Database, then choose database file. Next click on Open Database - you'll see the User sesttings folder again, not previously selected folder. Actual for version 3.6.0
https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions
It seems you cannot alter columns after they have already been made. Yet I don't see an option to set OnDelete actions for the Foreign Key.
Do you know how I can set this up so if a foreign key is deleted in a parent table then all columns with that key will have those values set to null?
I'm trying to use ON DELETE CASCADE but it's not working.
![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6231277/9027507/905a1502-3960-11e5-8531-e283c5dc8021.jpg)
eg. I have an order in Orders with order_id=3 and some rows in relationOrderProduct  with that order_id.
When I delete the order with id 3 in Orders shouldn't it delete the corresponding rows of relationOrderProduct? For some reason it doesn't.
Have I made a mistake somewhere?
Thanks!
Yes, foreign keys are enabled and the layout is as you say.

On the 32-bit version of sqlitebrowser for Windows (W7P x64), I can set sqlite files to automatically open with sqlitebrowser. However, I was unable to do this for the 64-bit version. Just letting you know. Thanks!
I right click, "open with...", "Browse...", then select the sqlitebrowser executable "C:\Program Files\SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser3.exe". Normally, the application would then appear back in the application selection screen. In this case, however, it doesn't appear, so I can't select it. It would be useful to get confirmation.
p.s. I also just tried using the "Default Programs" route, but same issue.
Had the same issue for the 64 bit version. I figured that the registry entry is still pointing to the wrong directory. So in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\sqlitebrowser3.exe\shell\open\command the value needs to be changed from "C:\Program Files (x86)..." to  "C:\Program Files..."
If I remove HKCR\Applications\sqlitebrowser.exe and then associate with "c:\Program Files\sqlitebrowser3\bin\sqlitebroswer.exe" windows keeps the association. But if there is an exisiting shell\open\command (with an incorrect path) for the application it does not.
Maybe the installer made by cmake nsis generator works in a similar way. Without an explicit removal of that key it just leaves the exisiting?
I had the same issue (Couldn't register the 64-bit as the default program after having the 32-bit).
The [solution](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/279#issuecomment-98643971) by @hko-gh worked for me.
Well its _very_ basic but here's a start. I didn't know how to do a pull request on a wiki so https://github.com/maxslimmer/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Windows-File-Associations
Having first edited @maxslimmer copy of the Wiki I have now coped this to the sqlitebrowser wiki and added the link.
@justinclift let me know if we need anything else doing but I think we can close this issue now like #296
I have seen other software do one of two things:
- put a check box in the installer, so users can opt in to file association if they want
- options in the preferences for file association
Pretty sure this is possible either way, another option is both. However I think we need to support multiple and possibly custom file extensions given sqlite files don't have a standard extension
I guess we need a good wiki page and a Tweet? Or something like that anyway. Maybe http://sqlitebrowser.org/ should link direct to the wiki, as well as GitHub, some people might not know there is documentation in the form of the wiki on the GitHub site.
Thanks, an option in the installer sounds excellent.  This would also help the users who had created associations by hand that subsequently got broken with renaming.
You will need to decide what extensions to use.  As a starting point for that, according to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/808499/what-is-the-best-extension-name-sqlite-database-files
> Emacs expects one of db, sqlite, sqlite2 or sqlite3 in the default configuration for sql-sqlite mode
A user preference in the program would be convenient.  However it needs to be done carefully because changing file associated settings needs temporary escalation to Administrator access.
I feel that the developers should choose either install time or a subsequent preference depending on implementation factors.  As a user, I would welcome and can adapt to either.
Excellent.  One other thought - if possible please can the installer allow a reconfigure option to change the setting of any config options without forcing a reinstall.  Often when I am evaluating software, I don't want to take over existing extensions.  But then when I decide to use it to replace my existing software, I want to go back and enable the extensions.
See bellow results of query.

> По поводу того, что в 3.6.0 отображается надпись BLOB вместо текста самого BLOB-значения - это ожидаемое поведение после приведённого выше фикса, если бы тип колонки был TEXT, то все бы отображалось верно.
Очень жалко, так как искал специльно программу которая позволит быстро просматривать и копировать поля с типом BLOB.

I downloaded the latest 3.6.0 and is reporting this missing .dll
the Open Database button does not restore the last folder opended. It's allways opening on the same folder: my user folder.
OS: windows 7
In my opinion, the last version's behaviour is more correct: allways open in the last folder selected but, someone else might not like it that way. It might be a matter of personal taste, I don't know.
I reckon we might need a preference checkbox to keep everyone happy. Personally I expect "default location" the first time I ever use an app. Then on each subsequent start of the app I expect either default or last used. However once I have open a file I then expect the next open to start from there.
Anyway, how about a preference which is a combo box with some options:
"Open Database" directory
- default location as specified
- same as last file used
- same as last but default for new session
Ok, so not great UI design but just some thoughts.
Thanks @MKleusberg I shall look forward to testing that in the nightly build.
Hi justin, I installed version 3.7 and it works great! Everybody's happy!
Howdy
I have two tables:
characters
weapons
My characters table has a column: weaponId
This I need to reference to the id in Weapons table.
In my weapons table I have made sure there is an id column, and its the primary key.
When I go to edit table, on the Characters table, and I click the 'weaponID' column, and I type in for the foreign key weapons (id) my SQL log looks as follows:
```
CREATE TABLE `characters` (
`id`    INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
`weaponId`  INTEGER,
);
```
However when I click OK, the foreign key is not there at all. Its never saved (and I've tried weapons(id) as well to check if it was a formatting issue).
Can you advise what the issue may be? :)
PS I tried doing a manual SQL query too:
```
(
);
Error Log: near "(": syntax error:

Updating to 3.6 fixed the issue. Closing this.
You guys work fast ^_^
Running Windows 7, 64-bit OS.
I had a 32-bit version of 3.5.1. This time around I decided to go 64-bit for 3.6.0v2. I uninstalled the 32-bit version (which wasn't registered in Windows 7's Add/Remove Programs list, so I had to find it and use uninstall.exe), but unfortunately it didn't get everything.
I installed 64-bit, and double clicked on a .db file. It brought up the 32-bit version that I thought I had just uninstalled. I did this a couple times and then uninstalled 64-bit, searched my hard drive manually deleting every sqlitebrowser.exe I could find.  I re-installed 64-bit, but now I could not double click on my .db files and make them open in sqlite browser. It associated with the next program on the list (just happened to be 7zip, and 7zip choked...).
In any case, digging into the registry, I found that the key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\sqlitebrowser.exe\shell\open\command\Default was still set to  "C:\Program Files **(x86)**\SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser.exe" "%1". This confused Windows 7 and would not let it associate the new, 64-bit install with .db. Once I whacked that and re-installed 64-bit, it was shiny.
tl;dr: Make sure that the uninstall whacks that reg key so an install with a different target (32/64/ia/etc) will not confuse Windows.
Other than that, great job with 3.6.0v2. I like it. :-)
Ah. That's why it didn't unset them. :-)
My bad.
During testing the 3.6.0 v2 release, I noticed that the icons for the Windows 32 bit and 64 bit were different. Should they be the same? Maybe one was left over from a prior release.

Thanks.
Out of town for a few days. Will check them out when I get back this weekend. Currently running Windows 10 Pro 64 bit and Win 7 64 bit on box and laptop.
I am running windows 7 64 bit and when i install the 64 bit version i keep getting "This application failed to start because it could not find of load the Qt platform plugin "Windows".
Reinstalling might fix it.
Reinstalled multiple time nothing worked and
Thanks for quick fix :3
minor fix of release version
Sure.  I think this is what you would like.  I am sure this info was was the least of your concerns.
Btw. The reason this was an issue for me was I had a few versions of sqlitebrowser installed and the help menu was how I choose to identify which is which. FYI.
When trying to update to 3.6.0 in Windows 8.1, I get the following message "This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin 'windows'. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem ".)

Tried to install both the 32 bit and 64 bit versions for Windows. Version 3.5.1 installs fine and runs.
Maybe it is in the build?
I don't know if this will help, but 3.6.0 produces a bin with multiple .dlls.

3.5.1 only has the .exe.

Oops. I forgot to include a pic of the 64 bit deployment.

Only thing that might need addressing are their icons. They seem to switched around. Perhaps one is left over from the previous version?
Also note that 3.5.1 was a single .exe rather than all of the .dlls.
Both versions start up without any errors. Haven't time to check integrity but I'm sure that you wouldn't have released it if you weren't ready to go. ;-)
Thanks for the extra effort. If the icons are an issue, let me know and I'll start another issue.
Great job!

BTW, I have VS2013 Community installed on this machine. Did not get the MSVCP120.dll error message. No problems were encountered with the "v2" installs.
Has the portable app been updated with this fix? I'm seeing this error with the portable app at https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/v3.6.0/SQLiteDatabaseBrowserPortable_3.6.0_English.paf.exe
Was able to open @jgus' portable app on Windows 8.1 machine without any error messages. Did not check it any further. No error message as I first reported in April (see first post).
What version of Windows are you running @jgus? Perhaps you should log it as a new issue with documentation of its problem and your machine's specs, as this issue is closed.
Ping me if you need me to run some quick tests.
Windows 8.1. Though, the exact same set of files _does_ work on another Win8.1 machine. Not sure what the difference is. And using the installer rather than the portable seems to work around whatever the issue is on the problematic machine. :shrug:
Perhaps a feature rather than a bug.
I used an open-source conversion program to go from an SQL file to a SQLlite file.  That program left the data types in the table schema in their original SQL form.  One was a "bit" type.  Your browser seems to interpret that reasonably.  It displays as either 0 or 1.  When I run an sql command in your browser to select for 0 or 1, it works as expected.
But when I run the same command in SQLlite3, it never selects regardless of the bit value.
It appears that the browser is interpreting data types in a different way than SQLlite3.  So while the browser's liberal behavior is a nice convenience, it is misleading.  Perhaps the browser should display the type being used?  Or warn?
Otherwise, I'm very happy with it in my rather limited experience to date.
Hi Justin,
It seems to me that the most useful feature would be to display somehow the data type that will actually be used in SQLlite.  For example, my database also includes DateTime data types.  I’m wondering whether those are considered strings or blobs (or …?).
Anyway, it’s not an urgent concern.  I can work around as long as the behavior is consistent.
Thanks for responding,

Can I load the spatialite extension module? I have attempted using "Load extension" but I got "Error loading extension: The specified module could not be found".
I am on Win7 x64. For the DB4S (x86) version, I attach a screenshot with the about:
![dbbrowser_version](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2849257/7254833/67d23f2c-e813-11e4-94a8-93419a8bc757.PNG)
For the spatialite extension, I am using the last stable (4.2.0): http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/windows-bin-x86/
I am not sure that I am properly using the application .. I was not able to find documentation on the "load extension". However, to reproduce my error, I open DB4S, then I create a dummy table and I try to "load extension" selecting the dll in a folder where I unzipped the 7z archive:
![dbbrowser_error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2849257/7254834/69d50e76-e813-11e4-988c-62fd14a1ca49.PNG)
I'm having this problem also. I am trying to load the ST_Geomtry extension for ArcGIS:
http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/databases/spatially-enable-sqlilte.htm
I've added all the PATH's and the command works via command line sqlite3, but not in the browser.
I am having the same problem. I have tried the same directory approach , and no dice..
Win7 x64    db version  3.8.0
I ran into this same issue and I finally got it to work. It has to do with the library search paths on Windows because `mod_spatialite` in turn loads its own dependent DLLs that reside in the same directory as `mod_spatialite.dll`.
I got it working 2 different ways:
1.) Add the directory containing the spatialite `.dll` files to your `%PATH%`. Windows searches `%PATH%` for dll files so it will be able to locate it.
2.) Copy the `.dll` files to the same directory containing `DB Browser for SQLite.exe`. e.g. `C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\DB Browser for SQLite` whichever version you have installed (32bit or 64bit). You will also want to make sure you use the correct x86 or x64 dll files that correspond to the version of sqlitebrowser you have.
This works because Windows searches for .dll files in `%PATH%` and the current application directory. So putting them in either place works.
If `mod_spatialite` were shipped as fat binary containing _everything_ in a single dll file I don't believe this would be necessary and it would just work pointing it at the dll, but until then we have to make sure all of the .dll's are located somewhere Windows will search when loading shared libs. I added a new page.

I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate Edition.
I have just downloaded a Windows nightly build (23-Apr-2015 02:15) and I only see one file filter, "All Files (_._)". So on Windows 7 I get the same. From looking at the code it would seem the filters were removed for all platforms but I might be wrong.
Just to make sure, you are talking about the dialog from "File > Open Database...",  right?
I was and I assume @jonorozcoc was as well. However don't forget, it needs to be Windows and Linux only @samir-aguiar as per the comments from @justinclift
Alright, could you guys test it please? :smile:
Oh, tomorrow btw, after the next nightly build.
What version of Qt are using?? This issue is solved on MacOSX in the latest version.
Yeah, but I think it's only fixed on Yosemite. Could you confirm that, @justinclift? I don't run Mavericks anymore. :smile:
I have tested the latest nightly build (24-Apr-2015 02:19) on Windows and I get a filter in the open dialog when I do "File -> Open Database...". I guess @justinclift someone needs to test on Linux and Mac.
So, apparently the bug we had on #230 is gone on Yosemite, but I'm not sure if that's due to some Qt update and if it's also fixed on Mavericks. I'll send you a release of DB4S through e-mail, then can you please test if the bug from #230 is still there?
To perhaps clarify a bit more outside of the twitter character limit!  We have a SQLite DB in our Unity project, and a requirement was encryption.  sqlcipher wasn't supported by the SQLite Unity plugin we used (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/4334), so we had to use their "PRAGMA key = X" to encrypt the DB on devices.  We would love a way to then use sqlitebrowser to decrypt the contents of this DB after pulling it off a device and entering our key.  I grabbed the latest nightly build of sqlitebrowser as well as the cipher-enabled version, but neither of them will decrypt our DB. (though i'm unsure if changing the "page size" value in sqlcipher version would help, I have no idea what value I'd use there)
The format of key we're using is:  0x5c516e4e21a65b8fee841db84b462367
(some digits changed to protect the innocent, but length remains the same as what we're using)
Will you develop Cipher for Windows?
I wish I can, but my skill is not good. Exactly I don't have experience. :)
Simple suggestion (perhaps too simple to be a true solution)
First decrypt with your key;
@justinclift Has been made any progress on this?   This is occurring in the latest nightly Windows build.
When modifying the order of fields, the 'move up/down' buttons are disabled when at the top/bottom of the list. But if you click on another row, then hold down the mouse button and drag to one of the end rows, the movement buttons are not properly disabled. So you can click to move the top row up and the bottom row down, both of which crash the application.
The inverse also works, so if you click the bottom row, then drag up one row, the "move down" button will be disabled even though you should be able to move the field. So basically it seems like the listener for disabling those buttons triggers on the mouse click, not the actual final selection after dragging around.

Alright, looks good now! Thanks for the quick response :+1:
Okay so I'm not sure if this is the appropriate place to do this, but I didn't see any other place. There may be a way to do this already, But if there's not just want to put my two cents in that it might be a good idea. I'm on Mac OSx. I have set up an Automator service that lets me right-click an SQLite database and then open SQLiteBrowser. However, when I do so it doesn't actually open the file in question. Is there a way for me, perhaps using a shell command or some other way, to open SQLiteBrowser and pass in the filename of the database I wish to open?
I was able to do this using finders normal file handling capability. Although, I kind of want something that won't make opening a database as simple as a double-click. Right Click > Open in ... would be nice.
Yeah. It should be. I made a similar Automator workflow to do that with sublimetext. It opens the file or folder that I have highlighted. With sqlitebrowser, it seems no argument gets passed in, because it opens only the App not any database file along with it.

Okay. I figured out how to do this. Create an Automator service that runs a shell script. I even included a notification center to prompt with the filename as it opens. But that's not necessary.
```
for f in "$@"
do
osascript -e "display notification \"$f\" with title \"Opening file:\""
open -a "sqlitebrowser" "$1"
done
```

It would be convenient of pressing 'tab' in the SQL editor when multiple lines of text were selected indented all of the lines. The current behavior replaces the selection with a tab.
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT BlahField FROM BladDb WHERE foo=0;
begins a transaction when one is not required.
When using the DB browser to execute certain queries it enables the "write changes" and "revert changes" options when this is not required. This means DB Browser creates a transaction that is awaiting a COMMIT or ROLLBACK but no such thing is required in this case since the explain verb does not write anything. In journal DELETE mode an empty journal is created.
SELECT BlahField FROM BladDb WHERE foo=0;
works as expected and no transaction is creating awaiting a COMMIT or ROLLBACK.
Thanks for the quick response.
Adding "END TRANSACTION" can have catastrophic consequences if my main app is running at the same time which sadly is how I found this problem in the first place.
But what are your thoughts on one of these fixes:
Option 1: It appears the sqlitebrowser understands that there are times when a transaction is not required.
SELECT BlahField FROM BladDb WHERE foo=0;
executes without enabling the "write changes" and "revert changes" buttons. So since sqlitebrowser knows not to start a transaction in that case why not add statements like "EXPLAIN" to the list of cases where a transaction is not created similar to how "SELECT" is handled? In fact instead of having a hard-coded list, as I am suggesting, why not call
int sqlite3_stmt_readonly(sqlite3_stmt *pStmt);
on the prepared statement to determine if changes will be made by that statement. Then only start a transaction in the cases where changes will be made.
Option 2: Since Transactions cant be nested perhaps DB Browser should consider using (SAVEPOINT, RELEASE, ROLLBACK TO) instead of (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK). This might work better in the cases where I am using sqlitebrowser to look up something in the DB while my main app is running. Note to self: I should perhaps make this same switch in my app too.
Option 3: Let the user control the creation of transactions. Add an option to disable the current transaction approach built into sqlitebrowser thus forcing us users, who choose that option, to manually create transactions via the BEGIN or SAVEPOINT in those cases where we feel it is required. And if we don't then we get the default SQLite automatic transactions on every statement.
@rp- I have always thought that SQLite handled multiple processes accessing the DB perfectly fine. But after fooling around with the explain query in SQLiteBrowser I eventually wound up at a place where my main app stopped running complaining that it could not prepare a SQL statement. Closing the DB in SqliteBrowser resolved the issue and allowed my app to continue. Maybe this is something unrelated to the unrequired transactions topic so I should do some further investigation.
@justinclift Yes of course I would be willing to contribute some code. I am not familiar with the ins and outs of contributing code on GitHub but I am sure I can figure it out. If the desire is for Option 1 I can certainly put something together. BTW: in another thread I saw you were looking for a Visual Studio person to help with 32 to 64-bit code. I am willing to help there too. I currently build SQLite3 from the source into a 64-bit DLL that gets used by my 64-bit app. I am a windows coder.
@justinclift  Adding such a checkbox would be fantastic. Leaving it on by default would preserve the current behavior and when people needed it to be off they could turn it off. Perfect.
I think it would be handy if a value could be set to null by highlighting it (single click, not edit mode) in the data browser then pressing "delete" or "backspace" (equivalent of double clicking value to open the editor then pressing "clear").
Currently values can be edited without actually opening the editor window, but they still require the edit window to be opened to set them to null. If this were added it'd nicely round off the editing actions that can be done without having to open the editor.
How do you set a value to null in the data browser, aside from doing it directly with a sql query?
I couldn't find anything in the wiki or browsing around through the application.
Sorry, but I was unable to find a way to contact you besides filing a bug report.
Thanks.
Thanks. The "clear" button was the first thing I tried, which didn't work. But I tried again after reading your reply and realized there's a bug that if the value is non-null but empty, "clear" doesn't change it to null (it only works if the current value is not empty). That's what got me. I'm going to file an issue report, unless that's the bug you were referring to?
Thanks again,
J
Good news: It works properly in the current nightly build.
@schdub if you need help merging/squashing your commits then I have just documented this in the wiki at https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Merging-Commits because it took me a while to figure out, @justinclift did explain it but now it seems to make sense to have it in the wiki.
@justinclift please can you check the new wiki page and update it if it is wrong, this seemed like a good use of the wiki to me
Thanks @justinclift appreciate your improvements, to me this is collaboration and open source at work, so thank you. I will keep looking out for stuff to add to the wiki, as well as trying to get round to the outstanding stuff!
@schdub you're welcome, but we are all helping each other, you prompted me to write a wiki page, @justinclift improved it and now we can easily refer people to it, rather than people going through pain!
Also nice seeing the Travis build is working now and you have 1 commit, so, looking cool!
Nice link by the way, have to check that out, just to see if it is my kind of thing....
I have tried this on several databases with similarly sized data and have encountered the problem on each. If I create the same database layout with a smaller blob then it is loaded fine.
Running Windows 7 Professional SP1 64-bit
2.7GHz i7
12 GB ram
It is very simple, just a TEXT column with the "filename" and a BLOB column containing the data. This is for an octree structure, one blob stores a tree's structure, and the other stores data accessed by the nodes.
I'll try it out, thanks!
Thanks, I am now able to open these databases without this crash... Though it is a bit sluggish on opening.
I'll go ahead and close this, as I feel the problem is adequately fixed. I don't know if anything can really be done about speed. This is dealing with large blobs after all =P
Desktop shortcuts were being copy to /usr/local/share/ instead of /usr/share/. According to the FreeDesktop.org specification (see http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/ar01s02.html) it should not be a problem since it uses $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, but it does not really work in GNOME. In their help files (see https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en) they guide developers to drop desktop files in /usr/share/ or ~/.local/share/.
I am running CentOS 7, with GNOME and the current directory works just fine for me. I don't object to the change of directory just saying it might not be needed or might be different for different distributions
@glawrence Although I tested only tested Linux Mint 17.1 (which uses Cinnamon), it seems to be a Gnome related problem. Did you check if there are cached desktop/icon files in your Gnome? (maybe from previous sqlitebrowser installations, dunno)
Also, it is important to note that, after this change, the sqlitebrowser icon just disappeared in my computer. If that happens to someone, just run "sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor/" to force the icon cache to update.
@justinclift Yes, the problem is with the current git master, I did not use the package manager from the distro because it is outdated. Also, I tested the installation with this proposed change, and everything worked as expected.
According to FHS (see http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/fhs-2.3.html#USRLOCALLOCALHIERARCHY), the correct place to store sqlitebrowser is /usr/local, and according to the FreeDesktop.org specification (see http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/ar01s02.html) it should be also OK to store desktop files under /usr/local/share if it is listed on $XDG_DATA_DIRS variable (which is usually True).
So sqlitebrowser seems to be following the specification.
But, despite what these specifications says, Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon does not show desktop files stored under /usr/local/share in the menu (fortunately I installed the system yesterday, so I am with a clean installation). We still need to confirm if this issue affects other Debian based distros, or just Linux Mint.
Anyway, I am reporting this issue to Cinnamon developers, so we can track the source of it.
@DiegoQueiroz when I tested this I renamed sqlitebrowser.desktop to sqlitebrowser.xxxx when I did this the menu entry disappeared, when I changed the name back the menu entry returned. So I think this is probably a Mint issue. I don't have another GNOME install to hand, my openSUSE is running KDE.
I just confirmed that this issue also affects Ubuntu with Gnome (thanks to Professor J. Kinoshita, USP who kindly gave me access to his computer to test), so I think it's safe to say that this problem is not related only with Cinnamon or Linux Mint.
Hmm, sounds to me like some GNOME installs are adhering to the standard and others are not. So whilst DB4S is doing the right thing, it might be as well to take the pragmatic view and make the change
Well. If there is a set of systems that do not use
/usr/local/share/applications folder and a set that use it, so we need to
check the OS first and decide based on this.
Anyway, I am still not sure what systems really use
/usr/local/share/applications folder. Although I described it as possible
according to FreeDesktop standard, all tutorials and documentations I can
find around the web say to store .desktop files under
/usr/share/applications.

@justinclift Do you mean about the hardcoded path? I don't think there is anything wrong with the Makefile, since it ok to copy application files to /usr/local, no?
I'm not sure, but it seems to be also hardcoded somewhere when Gnome is installed (at least on Debian based systems).
I think the best workaround is to hardcode the path.
I understand it is a bad solution, but it should treated as a workaround, since some systems appear to be checking /usr/share folder only. We won nothing keeping the "right" relative path, if it does not work in Debian-based systems.
Another possible solution is to check if the /etc/debian_version file exists, if so, use the hardcoded path.
@justinclift just a thought, if problems are related to different base systems, we can check it via running "dpkg" command or "rpm" command to detect the base system (debian or redhat, but for other can be applied too). If cmand returns non-zero code means we are on wrong system. We can use nested if else with it.
But as I can see the problem is related to desktop entry,
1.  do we update cache after adding file to applications folder??
2. Permissions of. desktop file must be set to (acc to my knowledge 755).
3. ~/.local/share/applications is the diectory where only one user can have access to that entry, on the other hand /usr/share/applications will creare a global entry for all users.
For 1. Refer to below commands
desktop-file-edit
is used to modify an existing desktop file entry.
desktop-file-install
is used to install a new desktop file entry. It is also used to rebuild or modify the MIME-types application database.
desktop-file-validate
is used to verify the integrity of a desktop file.
update-desktop-database
is used to update the MIME-types application database.
Well... so why close the issue if it was not resolved yet?
Well On Linux Mint 17.2 it is working properly. So what is the problem ?? :)
Create a file "header" containing licence header .
Then :

do
cat header $file > $file.new
mv $file.new $file
done

Not needed, except (perhaps) in cases where the header is already present in a file you take in whole or in part from some other project. There are arguments for and against per-source-file notices; practice around this issue varies quite widely.
According to README.md, "DB Browser for SQLite is bi-licensed under the Mozilla Public License Version 2, as well as the GNU General Public License Version 3 or later." - it is not clear if this means that conditions of both licenses must be met at same time or that one or other license must be followed.
Thanks for clarification
Yes, thanks a lot for quick reply.
Hope you don't mind @justinclift but I have added this to a wiki page now at https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Licensing as I thought this was worth documenting

Export foo table to SQL using "Export/Database to SQL file" function. This SQL Statement generates error on "Inf".

I think that this is right. What do you think about this?

I have tested using 11-Apr-2015 02:15 nightly build. Everything's OK. Thank you. @justinclift @schdub
It would be great if the column order during csv import could be changed. If the order of the columns in the target database doesn't match the source database, swapping the columns around manually is somewhat difficult.
Well, the problem is that csv import ignores column names in the csv file
and assumes the order is the same. In my situation this was not so. I
resorted to fixing the sql export as fixing the csv file was too much work.
But as a csv importer is already present, a dialog allowing the user to
arrange the csv columns before import would make sense.
I'm able to change the column order during a csv import in the latest master.
When exporting the database to SQL with the purpose of importing the data from one of the tables via SQL to another database, it would be extremely helpful if the columns were named in the INSERT statement. This would make the insert work even if the columns were in a different order in the target database (my situation),
I can solve it by replacing the INSERT word like this:
INSERT INTO `SomeData` VALUES (1,34,37,463);
to:
INSERT INTO `SomeData` (col1,col2,col3,col4) VALUES (1,34,37,463);
I would be nice if this tool could do this automatically.
It would be nice to select multiple cols and get them all resized in 1 go as has been implemented here:
https://forum.qt.io/topic/16047/solved-qtableview-resize-of-several-columns/6
SqliteBrowser allows using WITHOUT ROWID only for INTEGER column.
SQLite does not have this limitation:
https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html
![](http://markac.home.pl/pub/sqlite.png)
Of course.
My current table schema:
```
CREATE TABLE `test` (
`Field1`    TEXT NOT NULL,
`Field2`    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
PRIMARY KEY(Field1)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```
When I try modify the table schema and check Unique checkbox, application not respond and crashes.
![Screen1](http://markac.home.pl/pub/sqlitebrowser/bug1.png)
Inserting data from Browse Data tab don't work, I don't know why...
When I click New record I received:
![Screen2](http://markac.home.pl/pub/sqlitebrowser/bug2.png)
Manually insert works:
```
Query executed successfully: insert into test values('bla',1); (took 0ms)
Query executed successfully: insert into test values('bla2',1); (took 0ms)
```
Look on SQL Log on right panel...
SELECT MAX() from TEXT field??
I am usung now SQLiteStudio since two weeks (sorry guys :)) and works like a charm :)
Editing and deleting also doesn't work :)
Even if I change Primary key to NUMERIC.
```
UPDATE `test` SET `Field1`=? WHERE `Field1`=0;
DELETE FROM `test` WHERE `Field1`=0;
```
Field `Field1` always equal 0.
When I create new table with NUMERIC key, then it works.
Many functions operates on numeric keys, and now... all must be changed? :)
Maybe I'm wrong and the key can not be text...?
BLOB data imported from file is not typed BLOB but TEXT.
We can replicate by following way.
1. create table
``` sql
CREATE TABLE 'Sample' ('ID' INTEGER, 'Image' BLOB, PRIMARY KEY(ID))
```
1. add new record on "Browse Data" tab
2. update 'Image' data by importing image file(e.g. jpg file) on 'Edit database cell'
3. query type of 'Image' data, and get TEXT type
``` sql
SELECT typeof(Image) FROM Sample
```
Maybe, the reason of this issue is DBBrowserDB::updateRecord(sqlitedb.cpp) method.
Imported data for update bind by sqlite3_bind_text without reference to actual (or estimated) data type.
Thanks for response.
Yes, I guess #229 is caused by same problem, too.
Thanks. That solves my problem, completely.
But, I worry about column that has multiple data type.
Now, we cannot insert TEXT data to BLOB column.
I think that use of such column is not good practice.
But, SQLite accepts such column by right.
For example, if we execute following SQL to last DB,
``` sql
INSERT INTO 'Sample' (ID, Image) Values(2, 'some text');
```
We get text value on Image column.
I think best solution is data type is switched according to 'Edit database cells' dialog.
Maybe, data type should not be decided by column type, but user's decision.
PS : I'm trying such a solution on my local code.
@justinclift Sorry, I missed your request.
Now, I confirm that this has been fixed.
Thanks for your nice release.
It will be better if we get a version for Linux, However windows version can be executed using wine.
My apologies for not knowing that and my laziness :sweat_smile: . I am using Linux Mint 17.1. Can you please maintain a ppa for that.?
If you say i can maintain the ppa. :smiley:
Good :+1:
I will be free in next few weeks, i will be right to it.
Yeah sure , i will be free by then. :smiley:
@rp-  Thanks for the refrence that helped a lot. I will be using same code for packaging from previous ppa :smile:  And here is link to testing ppa
https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser-testing
Feel free to tag me with packaging issues. I will be happy to help and contribute to project as much as possible :smiley:  And as i don't use Sqlitebrowser in depth, it will be great if somebody can test ppa builds (or alternatively tell me how can i test (stress testing or other)  my build :P ).  Thanks .
Running the query:
`SELECT * FROM address WHERE house_number LIKE '%3';`
runs a query like
`SELECT * FROM address WHERE house_number LIKE '20';`
Nightly build works! Sorry for the trouble. I swear I searched first. :frowning:
As per issue #178 I have created an AppData file and got it to install
to /usr/local/share/appdata/. I believe the license and updatecontact
E-Mail address now removed, I assume you are happy with the licenses I referenced? I stated "Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal" for the appdata.xml file itself which is usually different to the project and one of the four permitted ones and then said the project is licensed under "Mozilla Public License 2.0" and "GNU General Public License v3.0 or later".
Mostly okay, but a few issues:
```
appstream-util validate sqlitebrowser.desktop.appdata.xml
sqlitebrowser.desktop.appdata.xml: FAILED:
• tag-invalid           : <url> type invalid [unknown]
• style-invalid         : <image> has vertical padding [https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/raw/master/images/sqlitebrowser.png]

• style-invalid         : <li> is too short [Search records]
Validation of files failed
```
A url without a type is invalid (perhaps you meant type="bugtracker") and the other issues are just style warnings that would go away using validate-relax. Thanks!
@justinclift We rely on there being no alpha padding around the screenshot so we can scale it to fit the application area. This means the screenshots have to be taken without any kind of "fuzzy border" -- or you can remedy this in GIMP/Photoshop. Also, the screenshot is supposed to be what it looks like on Linux :) See http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/#screenshots for more details; thanks.
@justinclift Any screenshot is better than no screenshot, but I'd really like the application installer to look sexy and coherent. If you need space I can host a static image somewhere, although I'd much prefer this was in your control for obvious reasons. If it helps, about half of the apps with AppData have the screenshot in the VCS :)
@hughsie I understand what `<li> too short` means but inclined to ignore that, the text is a direct copy of the website. Is there a list of valid url types, I could not see anything at http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/ ? I did try using the validator on the web page but it did not work.
@justinclift thanks for the new repo, do you know someone who could trim the existing image or make a new one?
@glawrence You can ignore the two short style warning in this case, it's a little redundant. The URL types are defined here: http://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-url
@hughsie thanks. I was thinking of adding GitHub repo as a second homepage but it is easy to get to from the main website, so will add a link to issues as a bugtracker. I guess once I fix the url we could run with this right? Or should we really fix the image first?
By the way, the xml file lands in /usr/local/share/appdata/ so is that okay?
@glawrence Fixing the screenshot can be done whenever, but I'd obviously prefer it not be forgotten about :) /usr/local/share/appdata/ isn't ideal, but if if you install the .desktop file to /usr/local/share/applications I'm sure the packager is just doing a simple mv to get things in the right place already.
@hughsie thanks, understood, I have updated the xml now
@justinclift happy for you to merge this or wait for an updated screenshot
@justinclift thanks, would be nice to roll this in and then we go see how well it all works. If you let me know when the screenshots are in I will add them to the xml. Ideally we need a default one showing a good overview, like the current one and then we can add more. Just for information:
"Ideally, all screenshots should have a 16:9 aspect ratio, and should have a width that is no smaller than 620px. They should also be in be in PNG or JPEG format. PNG is the preferred format; JPEG should only be used when screenshots include large photographs or other images where a lossy format like JPEG may compress better."
Will take a look as soon as I can and update the XML, will be all good after my next commit!
@justinclift everything is ready now, in that I have added the new screenshots. I am happy to merge the commits into a single one but I can't fathom how, I have searched and tried a few things but failed. So, if you want me to merge them then I will need some steps please, sorry!
Yes, it was fine, once I figure out `git push --force` was what I needed. Hopefully this is good to go now!
Thanks guys!
You're welcome. So @justinclift I now need to find the next thing I can help with!
Thanks to you and @hughsie appreciate your support
I will take a look and see what I can do, thanks
Why sqlitebrowser write "cannot VACUUM from within a transaction: VACUUM;"? When I select "VACUUM" query.
Starting application with no database open, a click on the "save file" icon on the "Execute SQL" button then leads into crash.
Anyway, great piece of code. Thank you!
This should be fixed now, thanks! :)
Hi Justin,
I took the version from 21.03.2015 (http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/), the problem still occures...
Regards,
Hi Justin,
yes, now it's ok, thank you!
Cheers,
There are some issues with the paging arrows in the bottom left.  One thing is just a little confusing at first.  You are doing something that is not typical UI.  I've never seen software that lets you scroll, and also tells you which lines are being displayed in just the viewable window, and also lets you page through the scrollable view.  Once I figured out what was going on, it is actually pretty cool.  But then I found that if I change the window size, then use those paging arrows, they don't give me correct results.  They seem to skip large amounts of records.  I would suggest first, of course, to fix that errant behaviour.  And then maybe add the word 'Viewing' before the range of rows displayed, or something to make it clear the user can either scroll to see more records, or use the arrows to jump scroll.
V3.5.1
OSX Yosemite 10.10.2
I think it might be a OS X thing, because I couldn't reproduce on Fedora. Will try on OS X when I get home as well. :)
Yeah, the buttons are supposed to scroll 100 records up/downwards, no matter the size of the window. So if the window is very small, it will appear to skip a lot of records, but it's just moving the selection by 100 records.
The arrows in the column headings to indicate sort direction are incorrect.  They are the opposite of what they should be.  An upward facing arrow means the sort is from smaller to bigger (or alphabetic).  A downward facing arrow means the sort is from bigger to smaller (or reverse alphabetic).
Take a look at the arrows in the column headers of folders on a PC or a Mac, or in Outlook, or any other common software that allows sorting by columns, and you will see they are using them the way I am describing, which is the opposite of how you are.

INT = short for INTEGER it's written full in 'list_id' to make it (synonym) of ROWID
ref. https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#rowid
It is sorting incorrectly for list_id too

The arrow shows the order you can change the current one to so the opposite of what is the "status quo"
Ok, I think I got this fixed.
Apparently the problem happened when opening a table for the first time (either by opening a database file or switching tables) and clicking on a header. Then the data were sorted correctly (based on the order from the SQL query), but the arrow was upside-down.
Would be great if you could do some tests :smile:
Sorry, I don’t see how to install the nightly build.  Instructions please?
Eureka!  You did it.  Sort arrows are working perfectly now.  Nice work
gentlemen.
I think it's a Qt bug on OS X, because it works on Fedora:
![save_as](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3753623/6735536/1e5d94a4-ce5f-11e4-9fdf-c447a9f9bc13.png)
Will do some research when I get home :)
So this is really a [bug in Qt](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-38427) on OS X. It also affects older versions like 4.8.5, although it's not mentioned in the bug report.
The files become clickable if you leave and enter the directory again after changing the filter.
Another workaround is not use the native file dialog. That works, but it will look a little bit weird.
Or perhaps subclass QFileDialog and force a refresh when changing filter, but might be too much for something not so critical.
What do you think? :smile:
Done :smiley:
When I create a BLOB in the field while maintaining it through the client software size of file twice as much than the original. Fix please.
Here are two files https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1rJ9TOTvh-VcHBKSWdFSFJaTFE/view?usp=sharing
One original and one saved by the client (connected to the base of this SQLITE3)
I downloaded your files and 'file *'-result:
clientopen.jpg: data
original.jpg:   JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01
Editing filetype seems a bad idea
Sorry, Justin, I misunderstood, my bad.
Apparently it does matter if the type is real or anything else of numeric nature.
Try one with type BLOB (eventually TEXT)
Perhaps this is helpful: https://www.sqlite.org/intern-v-extern-blob.html
Hello,
Start with a new DB and go to SQL tab and execute:
CREATE TABLE customer(
id INTEGER,
firstName TEXT,
middleName TEXT,
lastName   TEXT,
address TEXT,
contactNum TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE item(
id INTEGER,
name TEXT,
description TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE orders(
id INTEGER,
customerID INTEGER,
date TEXT,
);
CREATE TABLE item_order(
id INTEGER,
orderID INTEGER,
itemId  INTEGER,
quantity INTEGER,
);
After you execute this, save the db.
Now switch to the "Database structure" tab, and SQLite Browser will simply close!
Now anytime you try to open that DB, the browser crashes!
I forgot to mention, I am running on Windows.
Thanks for the efforts. I will try that Monday when I am back in the office.
thanks. it works. much appreciated.
Added one more item :grinning:
Just corrected a page :)
@justinclift I have written a wiki page on Regular Expressions at https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Regular-Expressions and update the wiki home page. Please feel free to improve as you see necessary.
@justinclift you're welcome. I am glad you tweaked the wording, my writing usually needs a tweak or two, so thank you. I will try and remember to add screenshots next time, they do help.
Seems we both had the same thought! Let me know if what I have done does not cover it enough, very happy to have it updated/corrected/improved.
@justinclift my default OS is Windows, so no. I have a Linux VM but have not built with SQLCipher yet, currently working on something else. I also don't have your image editing skills with those soft borders you add!
I'm trying to open sqlite database. It is working with some databases, with others there is error:"Invalid file format"

It's fine, thank you :)
After Opening a DB, then Opening an additional DB the Browser should start from the directory where the last Successful Open occurred
Your default directory will be opened by default. Works for me. Another way is to open one of the last five opened databases.

I agree with https://github.com/rp-
Perhaps the uploader used some pre-UTF8 codePage
To check go to http://mysharepoint.org/Accounting/Lists/Client%20List/AllItems.aspx
This is really a problem with the data. In the header of the file it says UTF-8, but the characters are encoded in Windows-1252 or ISO 8859-1. Navicat probably uses one of them as fallback or something. But the specification states that only 3 encodings are valid, namely UTF-8, UTF-16le and UTF-16be.
Hmm I don't know much about encoding, but it's possible to detect invalid UTF-8 characters, yes. It could then default to some other encoding instead of invalidating them (which is what I think is currently happening). So I think it's doable, however it will probably require a lot of changes.
It's indeed rather tricky to make an educated guess. There are so many ways to encode/encrypt data. Navicat was lucky since 8859-1 (Latin-1?) is (almost was) one of the most common. If the developers are able to detect let's say four of five of those, they deserve a prize. I don't think it's worth all the effort though besides an increase in size...
Allow copying of info in About DB Browser, so it can be copied and pasted when sending bug and enhancement requests 351, 486, SQLCipher386 version and 351, 486, SQLite 3.8.8.2.
Also should in SQLCipher Version mention OPENSSL version?
Hi
I am trying to add a column constraint in order to restrict a column to a certain set of values
Field1 IN ("one","two")
However, when I enter this in the 'Check' column in the table editor I see it in the SQL but pressing OK makes it disappear
If I open an existing database with such a constraint I am unable to add a row
What is happening?
I've changed this and added options (not commited yet) for a custom text and custom foreground and background color, as suggested by @glawrence in #163.
However, I can't find a nice layout for the fields. I've added them to a new "Data Browser" tab, because I thought that putting them somewhere else would be misleading.
Thoughts? :smile:
![null_fields](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3753623/6561287/4ed57470-c690-11e4-8ec8-fbf6786fcdd6.png)
P.S. those colours won't be the default, of course :smile:
Indeed it was too small, @justinclift. Here's how it looks in the end:
![browser_settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3753623/6605025/0bdc8462-c82d-11e4-80eb-d6c4cd336e76.png)
The default colors and text are the same as in the first implementation by @MKleusberg. I think this way is better because it's more neutral and won't change much for those accustomed to the old appearance, but no problems to set it otherwise :smile:
Done :smile:
Ahh I thought you meant the field in the settings pane. :grin:
Yeah, that's doable, but won't that look out of place when the others are left-aligned horizontally?
Have a look:
![screen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3753623/6607961/66f674e6-c843-11e4-8f20-a281b2cceea8.png)
So @justinclift I've commited some changes for this bug of not being able to set the value to NULL. Now the clear button should set it permanently :smiley: Also, when it's NULL the type in the edit dialog will be shown as "Null", so it's possible to tell empty from NULL.
If you could test it would be great :smile:
Dear contributors, I'm reporting an issue with sqlitebrowser related to exporting table from database. When I view the table from sqlitebrowser, all the alignments are in place, but when I try to export the table to as a csv, the rows and columns are get misaligned. I'm using sqlitebrowser for mac. I updated the install to the latest "night" install from March 8. Input file: the database is "example.db" within http://web.mit.edu/aizhan/www/twitter_api_workshop/docs/ the table name within the database is called "result"
In the same directory there is a file 'example.sqlite'.
@justinclift  it is just my Uni uses a bit slow servers, hence is a lag :(
I put 2 screenshots: "csv_screenshot.png" and "sqlitebrowser_screenshot.png" to http://web.mit.edu/aizhan/www/twitter_api_workshop/docs/ . You can see misalignment there. I used excel to view the csv file. Sorry for the delay, had lots of classes.
@atoregozh can you try the nightly build tomorrow to see if the issue is fixed? The problem was that some of the values end with the CR character ('\r'), which was not escaped when exporting. Because we now accept it as a line ending character, I've changed the code to also escape them.
Hi @samir-aguiar! I tested the last build and it works perfectly! Thank you so much for a quick fix :+1:
Some background info here, skip over to get to the problem.
-------Before yelling at me, please understand the new 3.x versions of sql arent compatible with my mac version 10.6.8 for some reason. I have no programming experience, but i have used this program before to edit some integers for an iphone app a few years ago, however it isnt working now, even with the same app, the same software, and the same .db file.
Here is why i am confused as to why i cant use the updated 3.0
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser
"OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) - 10.10 (Yosemite) are tested and known to work"
yet it doesnt.--------
So, i have a file "Cashe.db" that has integers in it that i want to modify, that should be in a table. So i >file>openDatabase>Cashe.db and nothing shows up. it's blank. on the top bar it says as follows "SQLite Database Browser  - /Users/me/Desktop/Cashe/db". I assume this means that the file is open, but not loaded, perhaps due to an encryption? I tried using other .db editors but they dont get me to the table due to one reason or another, again, because of the possible encryption.
You're sure it's a made with a version after 3.6.12 (the standard of 10.6.8) I can imagine 2.\* databases can't be handled by sqlitebrowser, not even with sqlite3. I suggest to dump the old db and load it with a version after 3.7.\*
Normally DB4S can handle practically all sqlite3 databases.
I have 10.6.8 and normally use (or convert to) the newest version (now 3.8.8.3)
If you need help you may send your db to me, though I can't handle version 2.\*
Version 3.6.18, as it says from the about dropdown, not sure if that is what you meant by 2.*. I do remember though, i was able to load the database document with no problems and edit in the past.
This issue has 2.0 in the title.
More about release 2 here: http://slackbuilds.org/repository/13.37/system/sqlite2/
It's about 2.8.17_6
Probably I misunderstood the title. When you open your database in Terminal\* do you get an error message?
*
Finder > Applications > Utility > Terminal.app
You mean SQLitebrowser 2.01b
with http://www.sqlite.org/changes.html#version_3_6_18 ?
yes, i did mean 2.01b, sorry for the confusion.
I went into terminal and here is what i have
SQLite version 3.6.12
Enter ".help" for instructions
Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
sqlite>
I sent the file justin. i have no idea if it is encrypted or not, but i have heard SQlite shows an error instead of showing up blank.
@justinclift re-emailed to you.
Good to hear that it isnt encrypted :)
i believe i downloaded every version and tried to use them, however they "arent supported on this mac"

Did you ever changed the database with a version after 3.6.18? In this case you absolutely need to upgrade. Let's hope it's not corrupted.

@Oldimac10yrsold try the following: right-click on sqlitebrowser.app, click "Show package contents". Now go to Contents > MacOS and double click on the sqlitebrowser file (I'm not sure if the path is correct, can't check now). See if the app opens or if not, what message appears.
@samir: On Apple we don't right-click, but ctrl-click
the rest of the info is correct:

You're right @Z4us, thanks. I have mine customized for so long that I forgot the original behaviour.

@rp- i believe so
@justinclift I can wait, i dont modify these files often, maybe once a year if i use them to begin with.
@justinclift to my knowledge, yes.
@justinclift I'm not sure, I don't have any 32-bit system either...
I'll do some tests tonight :wink:
Yes sir
:)
403 forbidden when i clicked the link. Interesting.

in terminal,thats what it says when i open it.
when opening normally, it gives this error message:
"check with the developer to make sure sqlitebrowser works with this version of macosx. You may need to reinstall the application. Be sure to install any available updates for the application and mac osx".
doesnt even open :(
Any output from the console?
Try the following, put sqlitebrowser.app in your downloads folder.
Supposing that the downloads folder is in `/Users/< your username >/Downloads`, open Terminal and run:
`cd ~/Downloads`
Then:
`otool -L sqlitebrowser.app/Contents/MacOS/sqlitebrowser`
And paste the output here, starting from the line that says `sqlitebrowser.app/Contents/MacOS/sqlitebrowser`.
so i just right clicked and opened its contents, macos folder, right click >open with terminal:

If you're sure using the 32-bit version there might be a bug in it.
When I do the same I see a similar message (without 'Bus error')  B4S is launched

FWIW it's this 64-bit version I believe the buikd of yesterday
Version master_git
Qt Version 4.8.6
SQLCipher Version 3.8.6
BTW: is there a way within the GUI to see which build you're in?
That error is related to memory issues, as to accessing invalid addresses. That's probably some library incompatibility, but I don't know what. I've compiled Qt with libstdc++, the target as OS 10.6 and the arch as i386. I've also linked a universal build of libsqlite, that contains both 32 and 64-bit instructions.
With the .dmg file mounted, open Terminal and run:
then:
`/Volumes/src:sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.app/Contents/MacOS/sqlitebrowser`
Then check the folder `/cores/` to see if a core dump file was generated for the process. If there is a file there with the creation date just after you ran DB4S with the command above, can you send it to me?
@justinclift That would be great!
"Bus error (core dumped)"
cant find the core folder. Also, what is DB4S? i just want to check my knowledge.
Hmm I think that folder it's hidden by default.
Run this on Terminal:
`mkdir ~/Downloads/cores`
then
`cp -R /cores/* ~/Downloads/cores`
Then check your Downloads folder, a new `cores` folder should be there with the interesting files. If you could upload them somewhere and send the link it would be great :smiley:
DB4S is our acronym for DB Browser for SQLite :)
Okay, i have one file in it, how shall i send it to you?
Like Samir said: Upload it somewhere e.g >> https://gist.github.com/
and post the link here.
OK I got through most of this stuff but I'm now met with this, when trying to `brew install qt`, on the `make` step:
```
make[2]: *** [.obj/release-shared/qtestcase.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
make[1]: *** [release] Error 2
make: *** [sub-testlib-make_default-ordered] Error 2
READ THIS: https://git.io/brew-troubleshooting
```
It's worth noting that I don't have all of XCode installed, just the GCC tools...
@Z4us gist caused me a lo of frustration trying to upload the file. any other method?
the original file is 600 megabytes, the .zip is 101 megabytes.
Perhaps upload it to Dropbox, Drive or something of the kind and send us the link? I think it also works :smile:
i can do google drive. just give me an address to send to and ill get it done asap.
Thanks :)
Thanks, I was checking and it seems to be a problem with the Qt libraries. I'll build Qt again overnight with some other flags set and we send you another binary tomorrow... Let's see if it works this time :grimacing:
Thanks guys :)
Hey all, sorry about the delay. Built fine once I got XCode installed. I have a .app but not the .dmg ... what would you like me to do?
That's great, @cbredesen!
I was going to send another version but I dug further and I didn't think that would work either. I'm running some tests with Valgrind and Xcode Inspector to see if they can find leaks, but they are not helping much.
It would be great if you could upload it somewhere or send it to @justinclift so he could upload to his server. To build the .dmg, Qt comes with a deploy tool. You can run:
`macdeployqt sqlitebrowser.app -dmg -verbose=2`
It will generate the .dmg with the libraries added to the bundle.
Thanks a lot for helping :smile:
Here you go:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12092928/sqlitebrowser.dmg
Thanks @cbredesen!
@Oldimac10yrsold can you try this version?
the good news, it works! the file loads and everything is cool.
the bad news is that i cant seem to find the data fields i need to edit :)
I have a DB with Table Id as text and kwd as Text
Id has values
3.1.1.a
3.1.1.b
...
If I make a query:
I see the result as:
No records displayed.
Problem (a): When I ask for '%3.% why it is taking as '2.%' ?
Problem (b): 6 rows returned, but the records not displayed
Hi,
it would be very relieving if there was the possiblity to store/load table definitions which then can be applied to tables which are imported from csv files.
It suits to my use case where a bunch of people are managing data in a csv file on google drive (since concurrent access is possible) which then needs to be imported in a certain sqlite databse. The data belongs to a certain table of that databse but everytime I import the csv file I also need to modify the table definition fitting to the original definition (and of course rename that table and remove the older table, to perform the replacement). This is a tedious progress :(
One alternative solution would be to somehow enable importing of csv data directly in a already existing table (column name matches needs to be checked and eventually duplicates omitted of course).
You can use the first line of a CSV-file as table definition with column names. No need to worry about types since SQLite does it "autodramaticcaly"
https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#csv
thanks for the advice!
"questionPool.csv:1: INSERT failed: datatype mismatch"
[edit] the import yet worked. I guess the failure is just related to the first line where the column names are listed.
I created scripts which make the process a lot more easier and faster. Thanks for the advice again!
Wow, quick turn around on that inquery. I will look into tesing it out soon (probably tomorrow).
As for why SQLite does not implement the function I suspect is just to keep the lib as small as possible for embedded purposes where REGEXP is rarely needed. Hooking to qt implementation is what I would expect for sqlitebrowser.
Thanks again,  I will let you know how it works for me.
Took a few minutes to download the nightly and give it a whirl. Its working as expected. Thanks again for the feature support!
Nice! :+1:
More info please? :smile:
Can you try closing the app, removing or renaming the settings file and trying again?
It's this one:
`~/Library/Preferences/com.sqlitebrowser.sqlitebrowser.plist`
Maybe that's it, somehow it doesn't get the new values. Perhaps the stored settings are corrupted.
If that doesn't work, send me the database, I'll do some more tests. :grinning:
Thanks Justin!
The fields are actually empty as they can't be NULL (because of the constraint), but right after adding a new record the table was getting it wrong.
It should be fixed now. :smile:
Yeah, that's because of the PK constraint, it doesn't insert NULL values as PK.
That's true, @justinclift, I'll commit some changes related to that later. :smiley:
BTW, apparently it should be possible to add NULL fields as PK, so that's also a bug. Not related to the color stuff though.
Hi
I'm importing 3 CSV's. The first 2 worked ok but the 3rd shows:
![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8420596/6459769/8f9d4dcc-c189-11e4-9880-47a04e20a29a.PNG)
How can I find the error, to fix it?
@MKleusberg I've added two tests, one for CR endings and another for empty strings between separators. Any ideas for other tests?
I had a small table in csv format that had 3 columns and I wanted to import that into sqlitebrowser (create new database then file -> import -> import from CSV file). The import doesn't look right as instead of having multiple rows, it just imports everything into 1 single row. I was teaching a workshop using sqlitebrowser today and everyone who had a Mac had the same issue. We downloaded the most recent version of sqlitebrowser that is available on your website. Windows users didn't have this issue.
@rp standard line ending of Mac is LF since the beginning of 21st century :-)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#Representations
Perhaps for next milestone you may create an option in the menu where users may choose the EOL symbol of their system?
I forgot to add that this bug wasn't just for csv files but also for text files as well. When I tried importing a text file, I had the same 1 row with many fields instead of several rows and several columns.
@atoregozh could you provide a sample file?
The code works with LF and CRLF line endings, even if the file uses both. However, as @rp- mentioned it doesn't work with the old CR line endings, so perhaps your editor has that as default. TextWrangler, for instance, offers the ability to save with the three.
Also, could anyone enlighten me and explain how to know what line endings were used in a csv file? In order to create the file, I just manually typed the rows in excel and saved it As .csv file.
Yes, that's using only CR.
The easiest way to check is to use a editor that shows that information (Sublime Text does and IIRC so does TextWrangler) or open Terminal and run:
`$ file <filename>`
The output for your file is:
`handle.csv: ASCII text, with CR line terminators`
However, apparently this is a bug (or a feature?) of Office for Mac when exporting to CSV. I don't know if there is a setting to change that, but you can convert the line endings to a more common format by using a text editor that supports it (like the ones I've mentioned) or checking [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#Conversion_utilities) for some command line tricks.
Hmm I did some searches and apparently there's no setting in Excel to change that. Don't know why would they choose this behavior though...
Anyway, from what I've seen it would be easy to also accept only CR as the line-ending character. What do you guys think?
As for Sublime, it's showing correctly: Windows uses CRLF. CR was used by Mac OS until version 9 and starting with OS X it switched to Unix line endings (LF).
I think it should be working now.
By mistake I referenced and commented in the other CSV issue... it's right next to this one :smile:
@justinclift we already cover cases where there's a non-empty string between the separators :wink:
@atoregozh Yeah, you can test tomorrow with the nightly build. It won't be in the stable version though -- if everything works out it should be in the next release.
The line endings are actually part of the file contents, so Sublime is telling you that this file uses the character '\r' to indicate a line break. OS 9 text editors added that character to the files when saving them to represent a newline. OS X editors now add '\n' instead, which is the same character used by Unix systems. So Sublime just shows what character(s) the file contains that represent a newline, along with the most common OS family to first set that character as the default for files read/written by that OS family tools.
@justinclift sure I'll install it later tonight. Per link you gave, what's the difference between sqlitebrowser vs sqlitebrowser-cipher? And which one should I install (sorry maybe that's not a relevant question)
@justinclift Thank you! I downloaded the last built (from March 8) and it works! I appreciate your fast assistance with this. And I learned a lot myself )
No worries :smile:
I don't quite understand why this statement is an error, should you review the documentation or is it my mistake?

The only statement not supported is the 'IF NOT EXISTS', at least so I deduce.
The syntax should be
create table if not exists customer (customer_id...
Indeed if you suspect a bug RTFM
https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html
I need to know the ranges of data that can be used for numeric data, if it is possible to update the article at https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html,
Floating see http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html
Integer from -(2 ^ 64) to (2ˆ64) -1
Well, @Z4us already said the ranges and we can't edit their documentation, so I'm closing this. :)
On a more serious and on-topic note: increasing user-friendliness is always a good plan for any software OS, commercial or something in between.
The registry key HKCU/Software/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/checkversion/disable doesn't seem to have any effect for every release I've been using in the last year -- the program always checks and always throws an annoying popup if something new is available. Clicking "Don't show again" does seem to change the registry value, so I guess that works. Just kind of annoying.
Also, it'd be nice if you used a flat file (.sqlitebrowser perhaps?) or INI file in the AppData folder for user selected preferences to make installations more portable. I don't mind the last window size and version number being in the registry, but I'd prefer to be able to backup chosen preferences without exporting registry keys.
Great response; thanks for the update.
Keep up the good work!
Thank you for developing sqlitebrowser. I use it several years. I get databases from mobile device and often I need to reopen them to see changes. Can you make menu item which:
1. close current database,
2. open it again
Oh, thank you. I did not see database history. Much time I used old version without history.
It would be great to have the possibility to paste SQL code in the "Execute SQL" tab. Either having a history browser or a simple snippet manager where you can add the current code to would be very supportive. At the moment I have a text file where I paste often-used statements, which is not very comfortable.
What do you think?
Another useful thing might be to not close "Execute SQL" tabs when closing connection to the database. I often have a need to execute same ad-hoc query against couple databases and lose the query when closing one database and opening another. Maybe disabling the "Execute" button is enough?
Desire to learn. Never worked with Qt and github repos. Last C++ was first
year of college, 15 years ago.  First: great piece of software!
Second: The auto-completion is not updated when SQL statements are executed "Execute SQL" tab. So when I add or remove tables there, auto-completion is not up to date.
Win7 64bit using the sqlitebrowser 32bit win installer. Noticed that behaviour in the last 3 versions (3.4.0, 3.5.0 and 3.5.1)
Sorry, still not working for me. When I rename a table in the 'Database structure' tab, everything works as intended. But when I rename a table manually using the 'Execute SQL' tab, I do not have the correct auto-completion afterwards. (Version 3.9.1. 64-bit Win7)  So they should be there... Was trying to find the languages in the dropdown menu and thought that it was a bug in my installation. Hope someone figures this one out.
3.6.0 (release)
Oh, thank you for pointing this out. Should this issue be closed then?
Table:
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE `table1` (
`Field1`    TEXT
);
INSERT INTO `table1` VALUES ('testing');
INSERT INTO `table1` VALUES ('123');
INSERT INTO `table1` VALUES ('87654');
COMMIT;
Query:
select \* from table1 where CAST(Field1 AS Text) LIKE '%2%'
1 Rows returned from: select \* from table1 where CAST(Field1 AS Text) LIKE '2%' (took %3ms)
The % in front of '2%' is dropped and no results are returned.
Ver 3.5.1
SQlLite version: 3.8.8.2
Did another test and ran from the sqlite3 cli - working fine.
sqlite> select \* from table1 where CAST(Field1 AS Text) LIKE '%2%';
123
Running Win 10 Preview build if it helps. (10.0.9926) - 64 bit.
Some more info which hopefully points to where the problem could be:
like '%6% - working.
like '%3% - is changed to like '6%';
like '%2%'; - is changed to like '2%';
like '%1%'; - is changed to like '7%';
Very odd. :) Also tried on Win7 - same issue so it doesnt seem to be OS related.
I think I've got it. :smile:
The "%2" was being seen as a placeholder by QString::arg() when doing replacements.
Great stuff. That was quick - thanks. Will check in the nightly tomorrow.
Tested on the latest nightly. Now working. Thanks a lot guys!
Depends on the file system. If they still use FAT32 nothing helps
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_file_support
Just to help dodgy memory @justinclift as I suffer the same, I believe you mean Visual Studio Community Edition, which is better than the old Express Editions and more information is at http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx
With last update I can't manually edit sql query in Edit Table wizard.
I think this option is required!
What do you think about it?
sorry. editable sql text is in Execute SQL tab.
Nice one, working here as well. Those Qt roles are tricky :smile:
I would suggest coming up with a pattern rather than a name. For example, I worked for a company once where projects were named after letters of the alphabet, starting with A of course and their theme was alcohol, so the first project might have been Ale for example, however I worked on Guinness.
It might be better to use something that won't have copyright or trademark issues! Just in case. There is no need to get too clever, so we could use towns and start with Aberdeen, then Birmingham, Cleveland......
Anyway, that's just food for thought
Following glawrence's suggestion we would start with F being the sixth letter of the alphabet.  Combination with mine 'Frühling' (German for spring) or his own 'Frankfurt'
Referring to China to avoid political correctness ;-?
What about famous people provided:
1 they are dead
2 equally use artists, champions in sports, politicians, (fe)males etc.
3 perhaps they have something to do with the date e.g. day of birth, death, victory, dissertation, speech etc.
example: if a release is planned April 4 one may think of Martin Luther King
I also find interesting the name of stars/galaxies, famous historical
battles or Greek/Roman mythology characters.

<b>OS : OS X 10.10.2
SQLitebrowser Version : Feb 06, 2015 nightlies</b>
It is as the title suggests, null value is become empty string when I tried to import from CSV file which has a null value (etc,10,,10,). I tried to import using other SQLite app the null value (etc,10,,10,) become <i>NULL</i> instead of empty string. Oh, and the preview when importing a CSV file (after choosing the CSV file) btw, also display an empty string rather than <i>NULL</i> value. I have already checked when I import using SQLitebrowser and open with another app it becomes empty string for the <i>NULL</i> value.
I don't know if this is a feature or not, but maybe you can add an option when trying to import you give a checkbox and textfield for the <i>NULL</i> value, so when the user check the box but leaves the textfield empty the <i>NULL</i> value becomes empty string or the value of the textfield if any. And when the user does not check the box, the textfield is disabled and the null value becomes <i>NULL</i> when imported.

On second try, I think when importing from a CSV data to current table that exist in the sqlite database ignores whatever default value the table has. Maybe this is why, when importing from a CSV the value of the table become empty cell rather than the table default value NULL.
I already tried using other default value other than NULL, and the result is also an empty cell rather than default value.
Yes, actually I also prefer to have an option for what to do with the empy value (',,') than to set the field to default value by default.
Anyway, Thanks for the responses and keep up the good work!
Hi,
My usecase is probably not supposed to happen, but it happened: I unfortunatly added a table with no name. Having this leads to a software crash at startup.
Hi @justinclift , I just tested it, it works. Thanks @MKleusberg for the fast fix !!! (And I corrected my own software as well, so this should no longer happen :+1: )
OS : OS X Yosemite 10.10.2
SQLiteBrowser Ver : 3.5.0
There's a bug when importing CSV files to database that the last record is not imported. Say that I have 10 records, then only 9 of them is imported, 20 records and only 19 imported. I use another SQLite browser app and the import works fine. Maybe you can work this bug out, I really love using your app for simplicity and easy to use.
This case is not always btw. I also have another CSV file that has 5 records in it, but all of them is imported. Maybe the bug occurs when the total records number exceeds certain number.
Also one more, when let's say I have 60 records in CSV file, when I click import there's a preview (when I was asked to name the table that is imported) of the records that's inside the CSV. But the preview only shows 19 of them, not all, even though the preview is in a scroll view. Maybe you can work this too so that it shows all of the records in the preview. Obviously when I import, only 59 of the records imported.
Thanks for your work on this app! Keep up the good work, and have a nice day!
Ok. Here is the CSV file with 10 records, and only the first 9 is imported.
CSV file is generated using Apple's Numbers app on OS X.
https://www.dropbox.com/s/e8pad14efeki5e7/ZWATCHACTIVITY.csv?dl=0
Thanks for the fix!
Oh yeah, I already tested using the Feb 06, 2015 nightlies, and the problem is fixed but forgot to post here. Silly me!
Anyway, Thanks again for the fix!
Is there any update on this issue? The ability to add foreign keys would be really helpful.
....... I am an idiot. Thank you. .____.;
Example
I tried to attach a database with another database, but nothing happened after attachment. I want to attach a database with another to copy the data from one's database to another database table.
https://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html
and https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/open.html#urifilenamesinsqlite3open
I'm also not understanding this.
I've tried to google about merging two databases together, and pretty much all of them talk about using the attach function of SQLite.
However, I am too stupid to know what the code is to do this.
I attempted to use this program to just attach the database for me, but when I select the one I want to merge it asks me what to call the database.
This is where I hit a wall and don't understand.
I don't want a new name for the database, so I attempted to name it the same as the old.  Nothing happened.  It showed a log saying it was attached, but nothing changed within the database.
I tried to name it something different.. same thing, no changes.
I left it blank, nothing happened. (no log this time)
The translations were not being added to the bundle when
deploying the Mac app and thus no language other than
English could be loaded.
No worries :)
Yeah, I've noticed that too. This happens with other languages as well (IIRC Russian is one of them). Perhaps the translations retain the menu layout of the system used generated them? I think that having the "Preferences" menu under "Vue" is the behavior on Linux and Windows.
How can I increase the Maximum Number Of Columns?
As far I understand the limit is 2000 but I need 8000.
Thanks
Thanks for your prompt answer. I just tried to compile and it works very well if I use Homebrew.
However, in my case I can not use Homebrew because I have to change the value SQLITE_MAX_COLUMN in the source code of sqlite before to compile and after, to compile sqlitebrowser. The first compiling (sqlite) was fine but the last one (sqlitebrowser) was unsuccessful.
Then, I think the problem is because I missed some parameter when I compiled the source code of sqlite. Which parameters I have to pass to compile sqlite? I am using
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/src/sqlite3 --enable-dynamic-extensions
On the other hand, the last lines of error message when I compiled sqlitebrowser is

Thanks in advance
In addition, the new tab that I created also holds the "default location" option as suggested by @MKleusberg.
Hmm the initial code had a "System Language" entry, but I removed it for some reason I cannot recall now. But I'll put it back, I think it makes sense to have it.
(closed by accident) :grin:
Oh, I remember the doubts I had when I removed this option.
Tell me what you think:
I thought about two cases, one where the user's locale has a corresponding translation and the other where it doesn't.
For the first case, supposing that the language is German, I thought that it would be more informative to just show "German" selected instead of "System Language", because there's a German translation and the application would be in German. For the second case, I thought that showing "English" right away instead of "System Language" would also be more informative because it indicates clearly that there's no translation in the user's language and that it has defaulted to English.
And the language names will always be in English. This was meant to prevent cases where the users couldn't find their languages because the program somehow started in a strange language (perhaps it would be better to show the name of the languages in the native version?).
(BTW, I have to add some comments to the code about this).
@rp- I reverted the changes but unfortunately using the native version turned out to be a no can do. That would break compatibility as the methods were introduced in Qt 4.8.
That's right, @justinclift, the user is the ultimate tester I guess :smile:
Thanks @MKleusberg!
Yeah, I plan to open some other pull requests soon :smile: I was looking at the issues to see what needed to be done, but if you've got some suggestion just let me know :grinning:
And appending those strings is a great idea -- I'll do some tests later.
I use SQLiteBrowser in Windows Vista
1. I clicked in saveSQL file in execute SQL tab
2. In select file name window I press Save button and browses all folders (browse/hide folders option) instead of saving.
3. When it browses, I press again Save and nothing happens
You have a SQL-statement correctly executed in the screen?
If so then click save-SQL-icon, type a filename
then save
No i didn't I am still getting this bug
Hello,
I don't think I solved it. Actually I quit being à programmer And I don't
think I am dealing with this anymore. But thank you for your interset
anyway
The argument count (first parameter) is a reference, and thus must be kept alive for the whole lifetime of the QCoreApplication instance, as also the Qt apidocs say.
Also properly create a "string array" for the actual args, instead of badly casting a string to that.
This fixes sporadic crashes in this test, for example as seen for some architectures in the Debian build of 3.4.0: https://buildd.debian.org/status/logs.php?pkg=sqlitebrowser&ver=3.4.0-1 & http://buildd.debian-ports.org/status/logs.php?pkg=sqlitebrowser&ver=3.4.0-1 (click on texts in the "Result" column to see the logs).
I've noticed that the types available when creating a new field in a table are limited.  Is there any goal to support datetime?
SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times.
"Error adding new record: near ")":syntax error". I don't know where to search the problem.
Please make a repair function, fix this or show the position of the illegal record. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13673400/test.sqlite
After "compact database" the button "write changes" is disabled.
The problem is probably in your schema SQLite does not recognize the types 'BOOL' nor 'DATETIME

@rp:
thank you for fixing!
Writing the changes is ok, but if you open a db-file and compress it you need to change anything in db to be able to save the compressed one.
@justinclift The "compact" function seems to have effect if a record between records was deleted. Description of behaviour of 2 Versions before, step by step what I did:
- remove record(s) between other records (in "Browse Data")
- write changes
- press compact
- write-button is greyed out, but at this time nothing was saved and filesize is still large
In Version 3.5.1 DB is written to file immediately after clicking on "compact database". I would prefer to save manually, but issue is fixed. :)
I believe it would be quite useful to be able to change the application language in the preferences dialog.
For example, my system language is German because I'm trying to learn it, but I like to use some applications in English because otherwise I have no clue of what they are saying.
I could work on this if you like.
From what I saw, DB Browser would probably need to be restarted to apply the change (as does Qt Creator when changing the language).
One problem would be where to put this option in the preference dialog. I thought about creating another tab (e.g. "Interface"), but I'm not sure if a tab with only a single drop down menu would look nice.
Perhaps all text to be translated in a seperate dynamic file
@justinclift Can you please test if you can change the language on the Mac (by changing the environment variables) with the lastest version? While working on this I found out that I cannot change it and I think it might be a bug.
@MKleusberg great, I'm working on this :grinning:
I've just opened a pull request, but let's leave there while we decide on this then. :)
But I don't know, although this can happen most users will probably use that option once (if ever) and leave it alone for good. In such cases I think it would be strange to have it on the main screen.
I think if any app opens in a language you can't understand there is something very wrong, so I would kill it and then check my OS settings and search for known issues. If that is still not fixable I would try it on another machine or read someone's advice, probably from a ticket here, to navigate in the language I don't know to select one I do. So, my personal view is not on the main screen but in the preferences, somewhere.
Note: just giving a point of view, in a friendly way, to help
Much better to think out loud @justinclift and have the discussion in public, especially for an open source project. @samir-aguiar I think the key is getting it working, then we can all see it, test it and you or someone can always comment, suggest or tweek it later. I always prefer to get functionality in and then tidy up afterwards.
Keep thinking out loud @justinclift, ideas are always welcome. :smile:
I couldn't agree more, @glawrence. The current pull request is for a working version if you want to give it a go.
Please if possible wait until I make the changes suggested by @MKleusberg because I might ask for suggestions. :smile:
So I've implemented the changes proposed by @MKleusberg and the behavior is the following: it adds the suffix "[System language]" when the language has a corresponding translation and, if that's not English, it adds "[Default language]" to English. It also moves the selected language to the top.
However, for English the resulting text is "English (United States) [System language]", which seems kinda ugly to me. It's also a little long, so the combo box width would need to be increased. Any suggestions here?
Okay then!
What about some flags? :smile:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3753623/6118080/2783eb5e-b0ba-11e4-8d2a-e3a19fd8c18d.png)
It's actually quite easy to add them; QComboBox supports passing a QIcon() along with the data, so it would be a matter of including the images in the resource file. Of course, a image file would need to be added for every new translation.
I've found [this pack](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/world-flags-icons-by-osiris.html) that contains a lot of flags and is free to use according to the license. There's also [some repos](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=country+flags&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults) here.
Yeah, that's good. I'll be doing some tests and commit later this week.
Well, I guess it's done.
The system and default language (when the former is not American English) now have a suffix appended to them and the chosen language stays on top.
I've done a lot of testing with those flags and couldn't get them to look nice when building with small resolutions, so I've just built 320x240 images and manually rescaled them with Gimp.
If someone could test the width of the combo box under Windows that would be great. I've tested under OSX and Linux, but I couldn't find a setting that would make it look aligned with the QLineEdit above it, so I increased the minimum size of the QLineEdit. Not sure if that won't look weird on Windows as they don't look the same under different OS.
Hi,
I am pleased to announce that it's done! I created the ports and it was commited.
https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=196365
You can install it via FreeBSD ports system:
# make -C /usr/ports/databases/sqlitebrowser install
Yes,
You have two choice for install it:
#make -C /usr/ports/databases/sqlitebrowser install
Using package:
#pkg install quiterss
Regards
Sorry...
I works on quiterrss package too..
Remove pkg install quiterss.
It's:
#pkg install sqlitebrowser
Yes, I will update the port.
Done with a patch for translations: using Datadir (/usr/local/share/sqlitebrowser/) when installing instead of binary dir (/usr/local/bin).
Waiting for approval https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=197253
Hello, I do not think that this patch is to be applied in the code base, it was necessary for me to make a clean install on FreeBSD. Nevertheless, it may be possible to perform a modification of the code to be compatible with all systems. Indeed, SqliteBrowser search the directory "translations" where it is installed (local dir or install dir /usr/[local]/bin).
Now it is in my view a mistake when it is installed, it must be in the directory of application-related documents (/usr/[local]/share). If the patch is to be applied, it should probably create a variable in CMake replacing %%DATADIR%% the right path (/usr/share/sqlitebrowser, /usr/local/share/ sqlitebrowser/, ./ etc.)
What did you think?
sqlitebrowser 3.5.1 commited on FreeBSD :)
https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=197474
Hi!
I'm running DB Browser for Sqlite 3.4.0 on Windows 7.
- run test1:
<pre>
CREATE TABLE "a" (
`b` TEXT CHECK(`b`='A')
);
</pre>
and visit the Database Structure view: 1 table "a" with 1 column "b", that's OK.
- delete table "a" and run test2:
<pre>
CREATE TABLE "a" (
`b` TEXT CHECK(`b`='A' or `b`='B')
);
</pre>
and visit again the Database Structure view: 1 table "a" but column "b" is not shown.
Can you please confirm if bug is reproducible for you as well.
I guess the problem is in the Database Structure parser, even if sqlite3.g seemed correct to me at first sight (i.e. "CHECK LPAREN expr RPAREN"). Thanks for your work, your time and your product, kindest regards.
Hello Justin,
May I please ask to you (and/or to who reads here and has some time and patience) to execute test2? Just to exclude that my setup is wrong. Thanks and kindest regards,
I downloaded the latest build and re-ran test2, now it works correctly. Thank you guys!
Please consider writing and installing an AppData file with the application description and some screenshots, else sqlitebrowser looks really bad in the GNOME and KDE Software Centers. We'd love to showcase more applications, but without the extra data file we can't.
See http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/ for details; thanks!
Richard
I believe you can do this yourself via a pull request, so why not do it yourself, you seem to know what is required?
Rather than use developer time on this, I reckon someone else could help with this, if you. I would be happy to give it a go if there are no other volunteers and it is agreed this is a good thing.
Right, I could indeed do a pull request. There are three main reason I've asked upstream maintainers to do this rather than just submit something myself:
- You probably know the application inside out, e.g. how to take screenshots to fully show off all the features that would take many weeks of me using to find out.
- You can update the description and screenshots yourself when you add new features or port the UI to a new toolkit.
- Time; so far 473 upstream projects[1] have written AppData files, and I simple can't scale myself to do all that.
Also, according to https://alt.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/screenshots/f22/matrix.html sqlitebrowser doesn't have any keywords in the .desktop file, which means that searching for it in the software center is going to be harder.
[1] https://alt.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/screenshots/f22/status.html -- warning, BIG HTML page
Yes, ok, I will give this a go. Do you have a target date for the next release?
I have created a pull request, please see my comments in the request as I believe it needs to be checked.
@hughsie could you take a quick look too please?
When I try to export as CSV the output from a query with delimiter set to ',' (comma), it does not quote fields that contain commas.
Yes, the latest nightly build fixed this issue.
Hello,
I want to re-create an index for a database file and it has to be similar to the previous formatting. To have that, I want an option "None" for sorting of an index. Now there are "ASC" and "DESC" only. I don't want any sorting. Please add this. It's very important. Thanks! :)
Before:
(
key_from_me,
key_id
)
After:
(
key_id, ASC
)
Thanks a lot. :)
Hello, I checked it out right now. Works great. Thanks. :)
I know that the preferred method for compiling is cmake, but I tried to compile through Qt Creator with qmake and had problems with the libraries because I was using shadow build.
Besides, of course, disabling shadow build, another solution I found was to use the OUT_PWD variable instead of the PWD variable when declaring the libs path. The code looks like this:
``` qmake
LIBPATH_QHEXEDIT=$$OUT_PWD/../libs/qhexedit
LIBPATH_ANTLR=$$OUT_PWD/../libs/antlr-2.7.7
LIBPATH_QCUSTOMPLOT=$$OUT_PWD/../libs/qcustomplot-source
```
This variable is equal to PWD when shadow build is disabled and equals to the build directory when it’s enabled, so it should keep the current behavior but add support for shadow build.
Of course, although it worked on OS 10.9.5 with Qt 5.4, I’m not sure whether this variable is always valid in every version. This would require some checking (if empty, if valid, etc.).
Anyway, what are your thoughts about this change?
If this works only for higher versions of OSX (I for one have 10.6.8) DB browser for SQLite can't claim anymore to be compatible for 10.6 thru 10.10; in and of itself not a bad idea. Happy holidays y'all!
The age old problem of moving forward and remaining backward compatible, which has no simple answer! Personally I would vote for sticking with one release branch, ie not maintaining multiple major versions, moving forward to Qt5.4 etc and maybe leaving an old release available for those that need it. Allowing easy building in QtCreator might actually help with development and new comers getting started.
@MKleusberg if everything is good, here it goes :)
If main is encrypted the version with SQLcipher seems to think all databases to attach are encrypted even when they are not.
I took like 10 minutes tit test the build of MMXV-II-V and it works of course. I expected no less of MKleusberg. You guys rule! Keep up the great work on DB Browser4SQLite. Can we expect a 3.5.1 soon?
Program (3.4.0 as downloaded 2014-12-11 from sourceforge) immediately phones home to an IP hosting suspicious sites such as 5monkeys.se (see http://reverseip.domaintools.com/search/?q=23.235.43.133). It shows no opt-out or autoaupdate options.
This is what happens when I try to delete this entry,
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `Instances`  ORDER BY `name` DESC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `Instances`  ORDER BY `name` DESC LIMIT 0, 50000;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `Instances`  ORDER BY `name` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `Instances`  ORDER BY `name` ASC LIMIT 0, 50000;
DELETE FROM `Instances` WHERE `_rowid_`=0;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `Instances`  ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `Instances`  ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC LIMIT 0, 50000;
nothing is deleted...even in edit mode clearing the cell does nada. The row in question is empty yes, but still has an id (type of data currently in cell: text /numeric 10 char(s)) so I want it gone, seem impossible =/ actually nothing can be saved to these entries it seems???
Sorting is also reset after "delete record" is pressed, very annoying =)
@justinclift Win8.1 and latest version DB Browser for SQLite at that time. @rp- thats not my fault, this is what the app generated! The db (s3db) comes with this program https://simcitypak.codeplex.com/ I've moved on and using another app SQLite Studio. No problem deleted anything there. So its not a problem with the db itself.
Should be any blank row. I don't have that database anymore. And don't have the time right now to setup it up...
11 days ago, not sure if it were 3.4.0 or any other version at that time. But the issue is real no matter what you say =) keep looking. There are empty rows.
@MKleusberg  Haha good work! I'll have to give it another try just because you spent all that time locating the issue WTG!
sure why not
@justinclift could you link me perhaps, I see nothing called Nightly Builds only the master updated 2h ago =)
SQLite by default uses 64-bit: https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html
<quote>
Except for WITHOUT ROWID tables, all rows within SQLite tables have a 64-bit signed integer key that uniquely identifies the row within its table. This integer is usually called the "rowid".
</quote>
@MKleusberg ok, spanx, I'll test this out later today then =) Or a little later then that =/
Seem to work fine, GJ.
The problem is that the CMakeLists.txt for the unit tests doesn't include the PreferencesDialog class files. I think that including them there would probably cause issues because they include the `ui_PreferencesDialog.h`, which is automatically generated.
I don't know if there are better options, but what could be done is either pass the NULL color to the model once it's set or surround the code that calls `PreferencesDialog::getSettingsValue()` with preprocessor checks, where the checked macro would be defined in the unit tests CMakeLists.txt (e.g. check if this is not a unit test build).
But the code to change the color worked nice here. :+1:
(A fix that I propose: according to the [Qt documentation](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qt.html#ItemDataRole-enum), BackgroundColorRole is obsolete and BackgroundRole should be used instead.)
Ops :smile:
I'm just fixing up some stuff and was about to write here.
No, that's what I was fixing!
I've merged it and rebased to add a commit _before_ the change introduced by @Chuongv that broke the unit tests. Don't know if that was the best option, but I thought that it would be better to do it this way because we can keep the history without having a commit changing multiple stuff (which would happen if I had amended one of his commits to fix the unit tests build).
I've also amended the last commit to use Qt::BackgroundRole instead of Qt::BackgroundColorRole, as the last is deprecated.
What do you think? :smile:
No worries guys! :smile:
BTW, I've decided to add the PreferencesDialog files to the unit tests (didn't realize it could be done at the time of my comment about this) because from what I've seen it leaves space for further customizations of the data shown on "Browse Data" tab (e.g. change the font size, font type, etc.).
Attempting to export a SQLite table to a CSV file. Table contains text fields with carriage returns. Instead of properly wrapping the carriage returns, they're included in the output file. This causes issues when opening the CSV file. This happens in the export to SQL file as well:
INSERT INTO `SqliteArticleV3` VALUES ('04a2cca8-ab3c-47bd-bd6b-66be299c88b7','2012-12-28 00:00:00','Lazy day','0','Lazy day today. ',NULL,NULL,'0');
INSERT INTO `SqliteArticleV3` VALUES ('23e40c94-a559-4e71-9940-7499f6b39e49','2013-01-07 00:00:00','xxxxxxxxx','0','10:25 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
10:28 xxxxxxxxxx
',NULL,NULL,'0');
INSERT INTO `SqliteArticleV3` VALUES ('22153e94-3b09-4c58-9ff9-6dd3b3f99157','2013-01-08 00:00:00',NULL,'0','xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.',NULL,NULL,'0');
(Output edited to replace original text) This occurs in the current version, but not v2b.
Doh! I should've included such information! Sorry :(
I've done some further testing, and I must apologise profusely! It is a wetware error on my behalf. In my defence I do have a neurological condition. But there is nothing wrong with your output. Very sorry. I should have triple checked before I leaped.
Do keep up the good work. This is a wonderful tool. :)
If the dataset is too big, I want to navigate to the head and the end. So I add two buttons to do so.
¿hay alguna forma de introducir funciones como valor DEFAULT para un campo?
Lo que necesito es el valor de hora UTC como entero con este esquema:
```
`timestamp` INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (strftime('%s','now'))
```
veo el código y parece que no es posible.
Sería útil una ampliación que aceptara esta funcionalidad.
Por ejemplo, Visual FoxPro usa el "=()" para reconocer funciones:
```
=(expresion)
```
en mi caso en particular podría entrar
```
=(strftime('%s','now'))
```
Un cambio en EditTableDialog.cpp (lineas 347 y 348) podría ser este:
```
if(!( (ch == '\'' || ch == '"') && new_value.trimmed().endsWith(ch)  ))
{
if ( ch == '=' && new_value.trimmed().endsWith(')') && new_value.trimmed().at(1) == '(' )
new_value = new_value.trimmed().substring_function_I_dont_know(1);  // get rid of '='
//...
```
No conozco QT ni C++, pero es algo así.
He modificado el formato para darle claridad al código, también emparejo comillas simples con simples y dobles con dobles (la implementación actual acepta entradas como 'mydefault").
Bueno, la idea está allí.
Gracias.
Hello
DB Browser (DBB) supports default values, i.e. values as defaults, but NOT functions (expressions).
In the example I post, the column name is "timestamp", type INT, and must defaults to the current datetime in UTC, _as integer_. Because type affinity, SQLite converts this expression to integer with this SQL form:
```
timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (strftime('%s','now'))
....
```
But, when I enter the expression `strftime('%s', 'now')` in the "default" column of the DBB **Table Editor** (not in the "Execute SQL" tab), DBB converts this to the text `'(strftime(''%s'', ''now''))'` and then generate this SQL:
```
timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT '(strftime(''%s'',''now''))'
```
of course, SQLite replaces the timestamp field with the literal string (strftime('%s','now')), and not the _numeric_ value returned by this function.
I hope I have been clear,
thanks.
Sorry, perdón por la demora.
Acabo de probar la versión en desarrollo de 13-Dec-2014 02:14
Tiene un pequeño detalle: al abrir la tabla para _modificar_ la estructura, el signo '=' no se lee. Si el esquema se guarda sin editar un campo calculado, el campo se mantiene; pero si se modifica, hay que agregarle el caracter '=' nuevamente para que el editor lo reconozca como una función.
Aparte de eso, que supongo será sencillo de corregir, al parecer funciona perfecto :thumbsup:
Anexo 3 imágenes con la prueba que hice.
Muchas, muchas gracias !!

Hi.
If you mean that it is necessary "=()" to indicate that the default value is a function, I think so.
The point is: When the schema (of the table) is re-open for edit, the SB analyzer does not recover the equal sign, and if the developer changes the default field, he/she must reenter the sign for the analyzer recognizes the changed default value as a function. It is not serious, but it is uncomfortable.
The first time it happened to me I did a quick change to the default for the strtest field, and the query did not returns the results I expected. When I checked the schema, I realized that SB had kept the default value as text, and I to re-edit the schema to add the '=' and remove the duplicate quotes.
ok, I test it tomorrow
@justinclift / @MKleusberg, it is working like a charm :+1:
I am trying to convert an existing MySQL DB to sqlite.  Being an optimist, I first tried an "ansi-compatible" export from the MySQL DB for one table, created (and saved) a new DB in sqlitebrowser and then tried running some of the Export file.  The result is that sqlitebrowser just hangs.
I was hoping to see it report a syntax error or something like that so I could go about massaging the sql exported from MySQL so I could do my conversion.
The SQL I tried to run in sqlitebrowser was the following:
``` sql
SET time_zone = "+00:00";
/*!40101 SET @OLD_CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT=@@CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT */;
/*!40101 SET @OLD_CHARACTER_SET_RESULTS=@@CHARACTER_SET_RESULTS */;

/*!40101 SET NAMES utf8 */;

Ideally sqlitebrowser should report what the error(s) is/are rather than just hanging.
I'm using version 2.0b1, the version that installs when you use "apt-get" in Ubuntu 14.04LTS.  I guess it's out of date.  As I'd not seen this issue in any of the bugs reported here, I assumed it had not been fixed but if it works for you, then obviously it has been fixed in a more recent version.
I manage all my apps via apt-get.  For things that are way out of date, I go looking for a ppa.  I can't find any for sqlitebrowser and my version of Ubuntu (14.04).
While I'm OK with building from source, I find most apps usually just drift out of date that way, even though the opposite is true for some apps, like this one.
Any thoughts on how to get a more recent version into this distro of Ubuntu?
Hi Guys,
Sorry for the delayed response, but many thanks for the ppa and I can report that it worked for me without a hitch (Ubuntu 14.04LTS 64-bit).
Thanks again!
I've re-labelled this issue to something more appropriate to the underlying problem.  I'm happy to close it now, but it doesn't seem like I can do that myself?
then on apt-get update i get :

@justinclift yup on 12.04
build works
thx and kudos!
Hi,
I just have the same very old version 2.0b1 with my new elementary os 0.3 install (ubuntu 14.04 based) with the app manager. I have build my own 3.5.1 version and its works fine but I think that an updated version to the ubuntu app manager could be a good contribution for the community !
```
Linking CXX static library libantlr.a

```
So I cant show you the good UI in Elementary OS, but this is the weird UI with the PPA :

I have almost same UI with both windows version (via wine or on windows) and linux version (debianized), so i can't tell the difference.
If it is some bug in packaging let me know. :smile: , I can use other ways to package files.

I'd normally be happy to help but we're away cruising at present and

When i browsing data in a table, the NULL values are not highlighted. The

@justinclift Glad to see the changes in the new nightly build :+1:,  but I think a different background color for NULLs will be better :-)
@justinclift I pefer the second version, otherwise I have to judge whether it is a cell with the string value of "NULL" or not at the first sight.
As you might expect other folks have been listening to this, so I thought I would throw my view into the mix, hope you don't mind....
It would help if some of the example screens had empty strings as well as NULL so we can compare.
Personally I would like to see something in the NULL column, maybe this: {NULL}
Or some other brackets, and shading also helps but I am not sure I want this leaping out at me in red, it is not the most important thing on the screen and is certainly not a crisis!
I guess in an ideal world we would have the following, roughly, in Preferences:
- show NULL in results
- text to indicate NULL
- foreground colour
- background colour
If software can automatically check for updates, we should have a button [Update] that downloads new exe and then starts installer.
Something that I thought:
The program could check for updates when initializing, and...
- On Windows it would download and run the installer, that should remove the previous version and install the new files.
- On Linux I think the package manager should take care of this.
Yeah, I was thinking about giving it a try. :smile:
But I didn't know that there was a Homebrew formula for DB Browser 4 SQLite (I'm waiting for that acronym). Homebrew doesn't officially support autoupdate, does it? If not, Mac users who wanted that would need to set up a cron job or schedule the execution of a AppleScript/Automator Task.
Yeah, it would be great. Please send it to me :grinning:
Nice @justinclift, I was already thinking about asking you if you used qmake and macdeployqt to generate the bundles and .dmg files because I have another pull request to open related to the translations thing and bundle generation. Thanks!
Just a status update: I've managed to integrate Sparkle into the app, but not without adding code. I needed to add a small Object-C++ source file to call the Sparkle methods. Sparkle also requires packages to be signed and does a bunch of checks to avoid tampered updates so the .plist files required some changes as well.
Anyway, it was just the basic integration; I still need to look at Sparkle's code to see what options they provide and run more tests.
This Feature request comes along issues #114 and #107.
It would be nice if there would be a progress indicator when opening big databases or exporting big tables. `Cancel` button also will be welcome. Currently application freezes and becomes unresponsive until the operation ends. And you keep wondering if it's frozen for good or it's still alive and doing something.
Looks good to me.
A pop up, Justin? There are people who hate them, even block them. Better is IMNSHO a menu item called Staus or Progress with lines for all (sub)processes that take longer than let's say two or three minutes.
Right, some kewl animation if technically not too hard to develop :)
Hi there,
When I import data from a CVS file (exported from excel), one of the columns in the database is a numeric hexColor. some of those hexColors are "000000"(or black), and they are imported as "0" into SQL.Another issue is the hexColor "314659" is imported as "5.57e+92".
ATTACHED IMAGE EXPLANATION:

I will give that a try! thanks
Hey Justin,
This issue was discovered when I tried to remove the hexColors alpha values from, so “FF01273C” to “01273C”. I ended up going back to the hexColor with the alpha “FF” values.

Opening a db file with a table like this crashes SqliteBrowser:
``` sql
CREATE TABLE table1 (
id1,
id2,
PRIMARY KEY(id1, id2)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```
The crash happens at `sqlitetypes.cpp:391`. That line fails because `tab.findPk()` returns `-1` as it can't find a single primary key column.
``` cpp
Table CreateTableWalker::table()
{
Table tab("");
if( m_root ) //CREATE TABLE
{
…
while(s != antlr::nullAST)
{
// Is this a 'without rowid' definiton?
if(s->getType() != sqlite3TokenTypes::WITHOUT)
{
…
} else {
tab.setRowidColumn(tab.fields().at(tab.findPk())->name()); // <-- Line 391, Probably faulty
}
}
}
return tab;
}
```

Looks like it crashes with a table like this as well:
``` sql
CREATE TABLE table1 (
id1,
PRIMARY KEY(id1)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```
This however works:
``` sql
CREATE TABLE table1 (
id1 PRIMARY KEY
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```
A lot of the code seems to depend on the existence of a single column primary key. When there's no rowid, the software kind of emulates one using the primary key (it only supports integer primary keys because of that behaviour). This obviously fails with composite primary keys.
I reckon quite some code would have to be redesigned in order to fix this issue.
So @justinclift unfortunately I don't have enough understanding of SqliteBrowser's inner workings to efficiently tackle this. This may be better done by someone who's familiar with the codebase, as it doesn't look like a simple fix.
I hope I could help you by pointing out the source of the malfunction.
I tried 3.4.0 on Windows (two different machines) and Linux, and the current master branch @1ce33792c534f7228fd888d0b27f5abdc51c8c28 on Linux.
Hm… Are you sure you used a table having without rowid _and_ a multi-column primary key? As far as I can see, the code doesn't handle this case at all.
Weird… Now I can't reproduce it with the examples I posted any more. I still have a db file that crashes though, I'll see if I can strip it.
So I can't reproduce the crash with my examples any more. The following table however still crashes:
``` sql
CREATE TABLE test (
key TEXT NOT NULL,
value TEXT NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(key)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```
``` sql
CREATE TABLE test (
key TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
value TEXT NOT NULL
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```
``` sql
CREATE TABLE test (
key TEXT NOT NULL,
value TEXT NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(key)
);
```
Yes that fixed it. I'm still sure I had crashes with the first examples I posted, but the last one is fixed, and I can't reproduce the others. Thanks!
Possibly add the feature to compare 2 separate database files to find differences in the tables... Possibility? Or just a dream?
Differences in schema or data?
Lol I smell a challenge... First one to make it happen gets extra credit
compare the csv files... but it takes forever xD... I was thinking because
your program is fast and easily navigates through all the data that it
would be a great feature. Differences of the data in the tables

Hello,
I would of course use 4.8+ if we had that on OS/2, but for now we stuck @ 4.7.3
Is there no way to make it working for 4.7.3 ?

I add the diff file.
I also change the win.rc and made a os2 ico
Yes looks ok to me :P
Only i need to send you the Os2 ico and the os2 rc file.
Mayby better change in pro file:
os2:RC_FILE = os2app.rc
To not mixed up stuff, as i had to change the winapp.rc file to make it
I can send you both files
As promised :)

Did i miss something ?
Cause i thought is where fixed now.
I send them last week.
I will resend then when im home
Sure i have sometime to test. I will test tomorow. I can just pull a build

1. Additional space is attached to "VALUES"
2. Integer value is wrapped with ' '
Especially number 2 problem. Is it correct? I suppose it is not.
@justinclift Microsoft Windows 7 Korean. Sorry for late reply. ;)
I just tested using 22-Nov-2014 02:16 nightly build. There's another problem.
In version 3.3.1:
INSERT INTO T_EXAMPLE VALUES('STRING',0,'STRING2','',0,NULL);
In 22-Nov-2014 02:16 nightly build:
INSERT INTO T_EXAMPLE VALUES ('STRING','0','STRING2',NULL,'0',NULL);
'' is mapped to NULL. These two are completely different. Check again please. @justinclift
I just tested using 25-Nov-2014 02:15 nightly build. Everything's OK. Thank you. @justinclift @rp-
I wonder why there is no choice to inuput the password to access the database
I download the windows.exe file from http://sqlitebrowser.org/   .
I create the database  by the SQLiteConnection.CreateFile("c:\test.db3").
SQLiteConnection.Changepassword("newpassword")  to set the password.
Using the dll System.Data.SQLite.dll for .net.
The version of DB Browser for SQLite can not find ,because I have uninstall the software.
I think the version is the latest.
See issue https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/12
I have a big database in mind that will be in sqlite.
And the most common data fill scenario would be the following:
There are 2-3 dictionary-tables that store dictionary entires, lots of them.
And there will be 1 table that will tie these entries together.
Obviously, this combination-table will have only id's from dictionary-tables, but it's so difficult to first input dictionaries, and they jump between tabs trying to memorize id's while pasting them to combination table.
I understand this probably isn't any close to a possible priority, but if there was only a way to say 'this cell of tableA can have only id's of tableB rows', but when I try to type something into tableA cell - show a dropdown of not-yet-added rows from tableB so I would be able to pick a row by the name, and UI would just add a correct id. This will simplify managing data a lot.
Yes, I tried LibreOffice + ODBC for Sqlite, and couldn't find out how to do that. Can you give me the steps if you know? I have no problem using some other software, but I've tried a couple, including LibreOffice, and couldn't do what I wanted
Can be done easily with SQLite and perhaps it is done yet. To re-invent the wheel is a waste of time, isn't it. Post it to SQLiteUserList and you'll get quite a few answers, I suspect.
Would be great if I could see them in UI.
Also, any way to input such symbols? Like, if I write \U0301 in the Edit field, will it read as one symbol in db or as 5?
I'm on Win7 X64 English version.
Version... let me see, probably not the latest, but the one before that.
I have 3.3.1 atm
Latest version is 3.4 and for Windows are nightly builds abailable. I remember from Windows (was pre 7 to be honestl perhaps it's deprecated in 7+?) one can enter characters not on your keyboard via Alt+<numeric keypad values>, but it would be a great enhancement to make this possible for other types of OS like OSX, Linux etc.
It would be really neat if the 'open SQL file' dialog (on Execute SQL tab) would remember the last directory I opened a file from. Now I have to navigate to the correct directory every time.
Also, when I press save it does not remember that I opened a sql file in the first place so I have to find the file. This could be a UX choice though.
One last thing. Some database tools have the option to execute sql that is currently selected. The execute current line option is nice, but often you will want to execute multiple lines.
Hi! Thanks for your response.
About the 'execute currently selected text', wow! I did not know you could do that! Great!!
> With the "Save Project" dialog, it also does that for me. I'm not sure you need to actually do that though when you want to just save your changes. You might be able to use the "Write Changes" button in the top bar for that. Lets ask Martin and Rene, just to confirm. :wink: @MKleusberg @rp- Thoughts on that?
Okay I guess I wasn't clear, sorry. Follow along if you will:
1. open an existing SQL (script) file, eg _test.sql_
2. make some changes to it
3. click 'save sql file' to save
Now, DB browser for SQLite will now ask me to give a name to that sql file, but it should follow that it should just use the file that I opened in the first place, namely _test.sql_. Am I making more sense?
Wow I'm truly amazed by this speedy response. When I wrote it it was more of a 'would be nice if this was implemented at some point or another' but to actually have it coded the next day is something else. Great!
I checked today's nightly and it works great! It would be a great asset to the program to have this in the code base! Marking it complete.
Actually, I mean exactly this behavior that you've shown me.
I created this issue because I didn't see this with "PRAGMA table_info".
For example, there is an output for existing table:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4062234/4992920/d7a5b4fc-69b8-11e4-80e3-864cbdd688d9.png)
But if table does not exist, we have something like this:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4062234/4992925/e528f346-69b8-11e4-8509-b365c2e95d96.png)
I think it will be clearer if the middle pane will be empty after the second query
@justinclift, with pleasure, thank you!
Now I see desirable result: middle pane was cleared after PRAGMA. I think the bug can be closed now.
Thanks for your support! :)
This select is working:
select \* from
Table1 join Table2
on Table1.ConsumerID = Table2.id
where Table1.visibility = 0 and Table2.visibility = 1
This Update is not working:
update Table1
set Table1.Visibility=1
from Table1
Table1 join Table2
on Table1.ConsumerID = Table2.id
where Table1.visibility = 0 and Table2.visibility = 1
The error message is:
First of all the syntax has no error and then the message is not understandable.
Where is the problem?
You are right, sorry for the mistake and thanks for the useful link.
This is a great support!
It would be great if the "Export to CSV" dialog (for queries) would remember the options. I like to export TAB-separated without quoting, so right now I have to click four times every export.
Also it would be great if the file save dialog that comes after would not be restricted. I like to save those as .tsv or even without file extension.
I am on Linux, using version 3.4.0
Remembering settings works like a charm, thanks!
Actually, it would be nice if it would remember the directory too, at least on subsequent exports. But I wouldn't consider this worth re-opening. :)
For example:
![sqlitebrowser_browsedata](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3741754/4948757/c52c1f1a-6656-11e4-866b-bf4b369723fa.png)
If table name in quotes, in query then data is shown:
![sqlitebrowser_query](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3741754/4948765/fd7ece62-6656-11e4-9443-cefc0ca34629.png)
@justinclift I'm using Linux mint latest LTE
@justinclift sorry, I forgot remove old version =)
Would be cool if we can search all the tables. This SQlite file has 25 different item tables... I am trying to find the one that uses 0479 for the id_icon xD
![screenshot_12](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2800945/4947305/52c7e0e2-6621-11e4-964b-d4083bdc1282.png)
Well i could use XYPlorer to search all of the CSV table contents. Either way works lol. Just a built in search would be  faster :)
When browsing the data of the SQlite file can you make it so that its possible to export all the tables into CSV files? Doing one at a time is taking forever xD
Id be honored :+1:   Lol
It Works!!! And so far I don't see any problems. But If I do I will report.
If I try to right-click on a custom file type, and open with, sqlite browser doesn't appear. Even after going browse -> and manually selecting the sqlitebrowser executable from program files doesn't fix the issue.
Also sqlitebrowser doesn't appear in the list of programs to uninstall
SqliteBrowser3\sqlitebrowser.exe instead of
SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser.exe.
I got it working eventually by changing these keys, and possibly deleting

Yeah it was fixed ages ago, thanks
ME AGAIN XD
That tool worked and All the information I need is in here!
Just one problem!
![screenshot_22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2800945/4873405/ee02075a-6210-11e4-9b15-1f16883a94a9.png)
That isn't what I need help with though. When i try to export the table it seems to mess up the korean characters... I don't know if this is a problem with your program or with Excel... do you have any idea on how to fix this?
![screenshot_94](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2800945/4873407/247bacc8-6211-11e4-97f7-61106c060eda.png)
Wordpad didn't work... they looked the same in excel... but it worked when I opened it in Notepad++... and if I copy the korean characters and paste them into excel then it works xD
So no I need to figure out how to bring back the table xD
![screenshot_11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2800945/4946334/f3cdeaf4-6612-11e4-9c9c-3fb1e2a1ad8a.png)
I tried that and it messes up the columns.... no clue why :(
Well is it possible to make it so that the columns and its associated data is seperated by | pipes when its exported?
commas are kind of iffy because in the description field it could have commas in it thus throw off the layout... i dont think that is the case here but meh lol.
Wow lol... Can't believe I missed that xD
Well that still didnt work. https://www.dropbox.com/s/zbaj7u3vlkw3h6n/compact_decrypt.sqlite3?dl=0
There is the decrypted SQlite file... If you can figure it out I will worship you for months!
Well Justin I am true to my word. Every morning I will praise your name xD and ill mention MKleusberg every now and then since he fixed it :)
That Calc program looks like it formats better than excel.... however whenever i try to open the item table CSV file  the program freezes up. What is and how did you get/view that ODS file??? because that looks easier to view than using excel table.
I downloaded LibreOffice but I just don't know where you got that ODS file from lol.
Yep.... and look what i found XD
![screenshot_10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2800945/4961043/29e0bb8c-66ca-11e4-99db-246ba35fb048.png)
Any chance you can give me the localized text table with the fix implemented please.
Its not a bug lol.... trust me. When excel was trying to do anything with the file it took 5-10 minutes to load.... sort... save... ROFL
Whoops... missing the column headers... Ill get that though lol... that took forever as well xD
Thanks again :)
Any chance on getting this fixed problem in a quick release??? Lol... maybe version 3.4.1 xD
Id rather not keep bothering you to convert it for me lol.
Thanks!!!
I am trying to open this sqlite3 file but your program says invalid file format.
Im going to upload it to dropbox and send you the link. I don't know how to use this client your talking about and Id actually prefer to use your program lol... command line programs are usually to difficult for me lol. I prefer GUI xD

Yes the file is from the game archeage. I'm trying to file all the game data so that I can help contribute to the archeage Gamepedia wiki. I prefer using the game files because when they update the game I can use beyond compare to see exactly what changed.  This is the hardest game yet lol...  I managed to find the data files for Farmville... Runes of Magic...  And Atlantic's online...  But this one is killing me xD
I wish I could speak Russian lol... Kudos for finding that.  I will have to give it a shot. There are thousands of files and that DB file is my only hope...  I can't find anything anywhere else...  Why can't they put it in a nice... Organized....  XML file xD
IT WORKED :D

You can install your own home was completed.

If you want to demolish the building while installing the items that the item is destroyed.You can eoneul over large furniture.
Messed up description lol... its just going to be hard to figure out. I hate that games can change it to be the correct translation in English but google translate cant.
Its probably all in the en_us locale file
Every time I start the app, I get a new version available even though I've clicked "Don't show again"
I'm on version 3.3.1
This is a feature request to allow Insert/Update/Delete user interface capability for Views on Browse Data tab.
Views are normally read-only in SQLite, however, SQLite supports using triggers on Views, which handle the write operations attempted against the View. When this is the case, the absence of a user interface for editing the view means you have to write SQL code to do so.
To avoid confusion, you might consider interrogating existing triggers for an "...INSTEAD OF [INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE] on <Viewname>..." trigger to determine what user interface options to expose. But if this is too complex, it might just be better to expose the options and return the result from the database engine, whether that's an error (because the view is read-only and doesn't have a trigger for the action) or otherwise. Of course this may conflict with your easy-to-use design philosophy (some users might dislike having the user interface indicate that edits are possible when they are not), in which case I guess the enhancement should be rejected.
It is been two Years, can we reopen this issue?
Consider this database:
```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE Foo (a, b, c);
INSERT INTO `Foo` (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3);
CREATE TRIGGER update_bar
INSTEAD OF UPDATE OF a ON Bar
BEGIN
UPDATE Foo SET a = NEW.a
WHERE b=NEW.b;
END;
CREATE VIEW Bar AS SELECT a, b FROM Foo ORDER BY b;
COMMIT;
```
With `sqlite3` It is legit to write:
```
```
However, it is not possible to do it so on a View on `DB Browser for SQLite`.
It would be a huge plus for me.  What amount of work this feature would represent? What are the concerned files? If I wanna build DB Browser for SQLite on Windows is there a VS project? It's tough, but well documented ^^ Great!   Wooh that's nice. I should give a try  Hi,
I've been using your SQLite Browser software for about some months and just updated to your new program version. Generally I enjoy your software a lot, but recently I've been a bit disappointed about editing options for views:
Your new program version shows the CREATE VIEW SQL on "Database Structure" tab, but doesn't allow to copy or edit it like in your previous versions. I just wanted to copy the SQL I've recently used for creating a view to my clipboard or something like that.
I would suggest you to implement a context menu option "CREATE TO" (similar to SQL Server) that creates a SQL file with CREATE VIEW SQL. Alternatively you could add options "Copy CREATE VIEW to Clipboard" or "Copy CREATE VIEW to new Query Tab".
Kind regards
Marco Tröster
I feel a bit like an idiot for not trying Ctrl+C before seeing your post. I think it will do what I need but I'd still like to second the request for a clear way to edit the create statement.
Thanks,
Greg
Hello everybody,
I really appreciate your efforts.
I would really like to test your product, but unfortunately I cannot compile the sources myself. I've just installed Qt Creator, but when starting the IDE, it crashes.
Could you please compile your sources for me? (I am using Windows 7 OS)
Thanks in advance.
Marco Tröster
Thumbs up for the one who committed the code. Thank you very much :D
some items are very long, such as "Schema" in "Database Structure" tab, items in "Browse Data" tab.
:smiley: yes, it's better now with 3.4.0. Thanks. But maybe "tooltip" can make it much more better?
Here is what I mean for "Database Structure" tab. Just change `role == Qt::DisplayRole` to `role == Qt::DisplayRole || role == Qt::ToolTipRole`. That's the tooltip I mean. Sorry for my bad English. :smiley:
``` cpp
QVariant DbStructureModel::data(const QModelIndex& index, int role) const
{
if(!index.isValid())
// Get the item the index points at
QTreeWidgetItem* item = static_cast<QTreeWidgetItem*>(index.internalPointer());
if(role == Qt::DisplayRole)
else if(role == Qt::DecorationRole)
return item->icon(index.column());
}
```
That's what I need. Thanks a lot!! :+1:
Hm, i am built once and make out with "no target" error. Now, at second attempt, make working without problems. Sorry, my fall.
About build-essentials and g++ - my fall too. Simply package is calling build-essential (without s) (http://packages.ubuntu.com/en/trusty/build-essential) and depends on g++.
I think this dumb 'request' is unnecessary anymore. My fall, sorry for disturb.
Trivial patch: Application icons should be installed inside the `hicolor/<size>/apps` folder, see [1].

I want to export a reference table from a development environment and import it into the production database.
When I export a TEXT field that contains a string that can be interpreted as a number it is exported without quotation marks. Unfortunately that means that leading '0' characters are lost when I execute the resulting SQL to import it again. The string is changed.
Example of an exported table below. Note: the sensor_id column is TEXT and the value in the first row is '0000000000000001', but during the export the quotation marks are lost and during a subsequent import (executing the SQL) the value changes to '1', which is a very different string. The second row works fine, since it has the string '28C078480500001B' properly within quotation marks.
CREATE TABLE "sensor_descr" (
`sensor_id`     TEXT,
`sensor_descr`  TEXT,
`sensor_nick`   TEXT
);
INSERT INTO `sensor_descr` VALUES(0000000000000001,'Broken Example','broken');
INSERT INTO `sensor_descr` VALUES('28C078480500001B','Working Example','works');
COMMIT;
This problem occurs both in version 3.0.2 that is available in the OpenSuse repository and in the latest source downloaded and compiled from scratch just now (23rd Oct 2014).
Thanks a lot for looking into this so quickly. That's a good motivation to keep putting effort into meaningful bug reports. Thanks for a great little tool!
While editing a table definition, I set a default value and later I wanted to stop using that default value and deleted the content of it, but there's no way to "clear" the default flag, it continues using the DEFAULT clause with empty string as default value. I understand that under determined conditions you could need a empty string value as default, but what if you want to remove that default value?
I see two solutions:
- a new flag column should be added to determine if the user wants to use the default value (and activate it automatically if a default value is added, and stop using the default flag when it's unchecked
- add a context menu so you can revert the default value to undefined via right click over the field
Any other solution is welcome, of course :) I am just brainstorming a little
Workaround: remove the field and add it again (it's not much info to remember, but it's a little bothering if you have data on the table :)
I think this issue can be flagged as enhancement
Sure, will try along the weekend
Cheers

Works fine for me, I am closing the issue!
Hi there,
I am importing a CSV with text fields, and the space between the text isn't importing. It appears to be removing all the spaces?
Is there a solution for this?
Thanks!!!
scott
Hi there, thanks for getting back to me so quickly, and I would happy to try the nightly build. I downloaded the "sqlitebrowser.exe.xz" and was confused when I saw the "...exe.xz" file extension?
I ran my database through the nightly build, and spacing is now working correctly! Hooray!!!
It's simply too small to read - but I can copy the text and view it in the Mac clipboard.

No, it doesn't. Increasing the editor font size works, though.

Tried the nightly build - no effect. Noticed that the Log Font Size setting applies to a different part of the window - see snapshot.

Now that was a speedy fix. Thank you!
While filling a table with records I pasted a large number of INSERT statements (about 1,000) into the "Execute SQL" tab. On executing these sqlitebrowser crashed repeatedly.
Doing the same with a smaller number of INSERTs (about 200) was successful.
sqlitebrowser 3.3.1, Mac OS 10.9.5.
It took about one to two seconds.
Tried the nightly build with 1783 INSERTs - worked like a charm.
While modifying a table it is possible to add fields. These get names like Field7, Field8 and so on. Within the browser these fields can be given meaningful names, but these names never make it into the database - after "Write Changes" the generic names reappear.
sqlitebrowser 3.3.1, Mac OS 10.9.5.
Tried the nightly build - same problem, but I get an error message (see snapshot).

This issue is resolved in the sqlitebrowser_201410151310 build - thank you!
It would be great to a get a form view in the way of Bento or Glom. It would be more attractive and more convenient to enter datas.
> Not a bad thought at all. Do you have design or coding skills, and some time to help? :smile:
i'd like 😞
> Thinking it would be easier to begin progressing this with some concept diagrams / screenshot-type-things. Helps work out features, clarify / prioritise things, and so on. :wink:
But i can try to make screenshots with explanations. That will be easier for me.
Hi
I come back to you with a long time later after the request. I am very sorry, I have been busy and forgot to look after this.
So, to remind the request was to create a simple form view for SQLite browser.
They are working almost the same way, but with a simpler way for Bento with a little more graphic features, so I made screenshots of it with Skitch that let me comment them.
Bento has been discontinued, and Mac users are angry about this FileMaker decision, it was also an SQLite based database set, so a Bento database could maybe even imported in SQLite browser.
It could so fill the need, and also give a mire powerful free product available as a multi-plateforme On Linux, Mac and Windows. Glom for Windows is outdated, the Mac version needs to compiled with Mac Ports, it is unstable and not easy at all …
SQLite browser comes there has a better simple product and powerful anyway. It has a nice GUI, and it is very stable and easy to use or to install. So it could be the way to make everybody happy.
The idea is to have a simple view form to manage the datas and having a GUI which is simple and pleasant to enter the datas for the end user.
It should be possible to organize easily the way the fields are displayed and which ones could be visible.
It shouldn't let you manage complex features.
you can contact me for questions.
There are available as a download in here, the link will remain available for 15 days from now.
Best regards

yes it took me some time, but because I think this little piece of software is good enough to fill the gap.
but I am also aware that'll be a lot of work for the dev(s) behind… and unfortunately, I am unable to help at this level 😞
but I only based my view with a discontinued software. Glom for Gnome is interesting too, but it's less handy, but it has for it that it can manage SQLite databases, but PostgreSQL or MySQL databases as well.
I tried LibreOffice/OOo but the form designer is buggy and not convenient at all to be used.
I think the most important functions in this is a form designer/view before the design.

This database can be a good example as well for a data form GUI.

Steve
PS. Apologies for originally posting this in a deprecated branch, first time using github, didn't realise I was posting in the wrong place.
Hi Justin, thanks for replying. I'm using the following
SQLite 3.8.4.3
Windows Server 2012 R2
SQLiteBrowser 3.3.1-win32 - although I downloaded the executable to fix the CSV issue that you posted on this thread..
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/94
(http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz)
I wouldn't mind having a look myself but I know nothing about Linux. Are there virtual machines available with the appropriate dev environment?
Thanks for the info on daily builds Justin, finding my way around at the moment :)
Steve
Hi, no sorry it doesn't fix the issue. Ignore what I said originally though. After looking at it again I think  it's actually just the second issue I mentioned, all other faults updating the table seem to stem from that.
When opening a table sqlitebrowser adds single quotes to default values: adding a second pair of single quotes if they exist already. I don't know how things work under the hood yet but if sql is being executed it's failing because of the extra single quotes ( eg. DEFAULT ''any data''), giving a binary data error.
Removing the default value or it's original quotes _fixes_ the sql generated so the table can be updated.
Should I delete the misleading info from the OP?
Hi, yep, I can do that :)
Hi, the latest build fixes this issue. However a new problem has been introduced. If you delete a default value then the SQL generated still includes the _DEFAULT_ keyword and an empty value, for columns that have had default values removed.
CREATE TABLE `TestTable` (
`No`    TEXT,
`Nationality`   TEXT DEFAULT '',
`Position`  TEXT,
`Firstname` TEXT DEFAULT '',
`Surname`   TEXT,
`Loan`  TEXT,
);.
In the textbox that had the default value removed, empty single quotes are inserted by the app.
---
On writing the changes and opening the table for modification again, not all the default values have been persisted...
CREATE TABLE `TestTable` (
`No`    TEXT,
`Nationality`   TEXT DEFAULT '',

_`Firstname`    TEXT, missing default_
`Surname`   TEXT,

As you can see, _Firstname_ is missing the app generated default.
Sure, I'm more than happy to check out new builds :)
Apologies, I will have a look tomorrow :)
The issue I faced is that the cursor, '|' is shifted backwards to the position it actually is. Sometimes it is not between characters, but on top of a character. In the end of a string it lags a character behind.

I run SQLite Database Browser on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
Hi,
This is how it looks
![one](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4622272/380d4cb0-5339-11e4-991d-c97a16cc31e9.png)
Now I press backspace and get:
![two](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4622279/483704aa-5339-11e4-98c2-4d993defecac.png)
Once more backspace:

I think  I used apt-get. OK. I'll try.
After manually installing it, I see no problems now.
I have an sqlite database that I created from c# (using the System.Data.SQLite library) and I have created a table using a custom collation function.
When I try to open the database in this program, the table with the custom collation does not work. I can't view the data, and I can't even run any queries on it, not even those queries that don't involve any comparisons, such as "select \* from testtable". I realize that the custom collation function cannot possibly be known by your software, but is it possible to have some kind of fallback?
I have a sample database, should you need me to send it to you.
3.3.1, the current version present for download on your website for windows.
Sorry for the delay. Was on vacation, didn't have internet access.
The build you sent me did open the database and allowed me to browse the table after a warning. Thanks
The discussion on this reminded me of Python, so I have read https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html and they refer to the same RFC4180 from IETF, so that's a good start. However they have an Excel dialect, so clearly acknowledge that you have to do stuff differently with Excel. This might be a useful reference when investigating this issue.
Yes, so my guess is you would have an initial choice of "Standard CSV", "MS Excel Compatible", "Custom", where the custom option allows you to change delimiter, row terminator, etc for those that need it and the first two are easy for most people.
Oh and last I looked when numbers get over 15 digits Excel truncates, so you might need to handle that twist!
Sorry if it seems like I am being a pain but I have had pain in the past so just sharing my experience to hopefully benefit all. For me Python is a good place to look as it is cross platform and well established.
Guys, it’s your call but I think keeping things simple and not overdoing it would be a wise strategy.
- ```
First and foremost the goal should be producing the same default result as sqlite3 does – that is the reference most people would expect
```
- ```
I did not experience Excel breaking the standard CSV, the only problem I ever encountered is that Excel does not auto-detect 64 bit Integers correctly, it treats them as Double. For these cases you can do a custom import in Excel.
```
- ```
The 15 digits truncation may only happen with manually created content – if you export a double and read it back in that problem does not exist.
```
- ```
The double quote character is defined as “, so you don’t really need to have a selection box for it if you elect to make them optional (means only use them when necessary for the field content)
```
- ```
Same goes for line ending. Just stick to CRLF.
```
Thanks
Jens

nightly build OSX of 4 October
Precisely, more logical would be "1 - 1 of 1" in my not so humble opinion and the '<' & '>' don't make much sense either in this specific case, do they?
Good job, MKleusberg. Solved in nightly build of 7 October.
The svg icon didn't work for me in KDE so I chose to use the png icon. Tested and works.
What's up with the version #999 ? An alpha or beta special for the *ubuntu platforms?
Yes, Justin,
We can even build a DataDictionary like e.g. Oracle has: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/server.920/a96524/c05dicti.htm
Great idea, enough to type s for 'select', 'u' for update, 'd' for delete, 'i' for insert etc.
Quisiera saber si su software posee compatibilidad con SQLite 2.x, puesto que es el mas usado por mi grupo de trabajo para realizar web development.
Yes, I tried, but the program crash.
No se puede exportar el archivo que genera el SQLite Browser?
I think the best option is to convert databases of release 2 to SQLite3 format. I don't know if therefore are applications. I never had such an old file.
You're right, Justin. They might have reasons not to change.
Hola, perdón por la intromisión.
quien no use funciones de bajo nivel no debería tener grandes problemas al portar de 2.x a 3.x, creo que alrededor de un 80% de las consultas SQL son compatibles.
De los datos es una simple labor de importación y exportación.
Lo que yo te recomiendo es que el esquema de la tabla te lo muestre en un messagebox o un form para no estropear la interfaz del programa.
No, pero en el DB Schema me sirve para saber los elementos de la tabla. Lo que yo digo es en el data structure
Me refiero a este area
Thanks and looking forward to your update.
In previous builds the application always started in the directory named in preferences. Since today (perhaps before, did not install between 19 and 27, sep 18 was ok) starts in the directory I was some time ago - iTunes...
Now all versions from 7 September and later do the same. Even after closing iTunes. Bug? I expect B4S would go to the directory in prefs regardless of where you were. It always did. Solution is to choose again the default directory.
Work-around yes, definite solution no. Perhaps a 10.6 thingy :-? Anyways no big deal if one has time.
I never had this problem again and update regularly. If Kleusberg is right this may be not a 10.6 thing only, but more a general occasionally occurring bug in the application?
Software works very fine with <1GB files, but I have one sqlite, which is 8.6GB and can't open. The question is: is there any limit of sqlite file size? Do you have experience with large files?
http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html
I have a bunch of data-sets each larger than 1G plus a big one (50G). I tried SQLite Expert and it opens them and scans the data very quickly. So there should be no limit on this I think.
I run SQLite Version 3.8.10.2 (Qt Version 5.4.1) on windows
I confirm that the software is very slow for files above 200 Mo and crashes when the file exceeds 1 GB.
It would be great if files that do more than 1GB where supported, but at least sqlite should warn the user at start that opening files of more than 1 GB can crash the software.
I use the 32 bit version actually but it is the latest one 3.7.0.
And by the way in the SQL shell it would be great to have the number of affeted row when you do an update request, Some thing like:
Query executed successfully: UPDATE table SET field = 's' WHERE field2 = 1
(took 81ms, 5 rows affected)
So i'll deal with it but thank you for the answers.
I just tried a recently nightly and I get a horizontal scroll bar and a hint, so looks good to me and correctly closed.
Non-English (i.e. French) items may contain single quotes and thus require these quotes doubled for sqlite.
It will be useful if sqlitebrowser allowed to search for double quotes, or for that matter any sequence of characters, in a filter. Wild cards may be a solution.
Hi all,
In looking through the README, I noticed there's no mention of Linux. Can sqlitebrowser run on Linux? Are there instructions for compiling it? Do any distributions ship it?
Could this information be added to the README (and perhaps other docs too)? Thanks!
My table:
CREATE TABLE `test` (
`ID`    INTEGER NOT NULL,
`Name`  TEXT NOT NULL,
`ID2`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(ID,ID2)
);
It is not possible to insert a record in Browse Date because there is a primary key with two fields and twice are NOT NULL
In my opinion it is not possible to create a table with foreign keys in the edit create table dialog. If I create the table with SQL and then I make a modification with the edit create dialog the foreign keys will be delete.
Sorry, same like #81
I would like to have a Date field, but it's not possible, as the types are limited to these on the combobox
SQLite does not need a field with date affinity. It's either edited and text like e.g.  '2014-09-20' or numeric (int if you prefer) 20140920. or even epoch.
All about it is in http://sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html
Perhaps the developers of this awesome browser are willing if they have time to introduce some helping hand for you, but there are more issues with a certain form of priority.
I know how data types work in SQLite, the thing is that my database engine uses the field type to know how to treat/convert types to native data
Allowing you to write the field type instead of provide a non editable combobox with fixed values is not a big change at all
Priorities are relative to the importance of the problem to each one, and for me this has a certain form of priority. I also know that I have different workarounds to address this, but aren't straightforward at all
It's curious because on version 2, the product had a [...] button to add custom types! so seems that this feature was dropped somewhere :)
About adding it myself, I feel a little lost with the used tools, I already downloaded the code and QTCreator, but couldn't make it compile, need to investigate a little. I have two long holiday weeks ahead, so I will consider it if I can fight against this laziness :D
That's really well appreciated by me, thanks a lot!
I am not at home, coming back con Tuesday. I will validate it on the latest
night build as soon as I am back and let you know
Thank you for the effort!

Hi! I just tried this feature today with latest night build and seems to work fine, but I just noticed that field is being updated any time I modify the field type name. Wouldn't be better to update the field type on exiting the combobox, just to avoid unnecessary updates? I don't know how heavy is to perform that operation, but when I wanted to change a field to "date", the "updating" window appeared like five or six times
Anyway, it's working so it's a good improvement, thanks!
I will try it along the weekend :)
Thanks!
I tried it and seems to work only if you press "enter". Would be nice if it's fired when the control loses its focus, like default value. It's more comfortable and keeps the workflow consistent
Anyway, thanks for the effort :D
It appears that the table export to CSV builds the export file content first in RAM before writing it to the specified file. If the table is very large the process is hitting the 2GB RAM limit of Windows 32bit applications. Then it crashes. No file gets written at all.
Where do I find the nightly builds?
Ok, I did run the test and the crash is resolved. Monitored the memory usage in task manager all looks good.
However, I see now a different problem: All fields regardless of actual column type are exported as text, means in “quotes”. That could cause trouble when reimporting the generated file in other tools, e.g. Excel but also increases file size substantially. In my case the same export run with sqlite3.exe produces a 341MB csv file while using sqlitebrowser produces 420MB. Other than that the content appears identical.
Example:
1,0,10.1349167,48.0175202,2.758584499,-0.0005592033267,10.1414681,48.01049,2.500045538,0.0,924.6688232,0.0005592033267,1,9,0
1,1,10.1414681,48.01049,2.5000453,0.0,10.1471049,48.0047975,2.675153971,0.0004602147965,760.9866943,0.0004602147965,1,9,0
Sqlitebrowser:
"1","0","10.1349167","48.0175202","2.758584499","-0.0005592033267","10.1414681","48.01049","2.500045538","0.0","924.6688232","0.0005592033267","1","9","0"

Thanks

Yes, that works for my specific case because all fields are numbers. If I remember the CSV spec correctly, the quote character should only be used for fields which contain the separator character, so that the column structure is kept intact. I also just noticed that the line ending of the produced files are Unix style – only \n. Should be platform default.
Thanks
Jens
I think the document should be right, but I am not 100% sure.
The spec says double quotes are optional as long as no special chars are in the field. So the current version is strictly correct, yet it creates trouble with Excel (it prevents automatic field type detection). Since Excel is a widely used tool AND avoiding unnecessary double quotes creates smaller files I would recommend removing them.
1.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:
zzz,yyy,xxx
2.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:
bb","ccc" CRLF
zzz,yyy,xxx
3.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
The spec says all files should be CRLF – means Windows style. There is no ambiguity here. That should be an easy fix.
Thanks

On the Browse Data tab: It would really enhance keyboard navigation to have either (or) both the 'enter' and 'tab' keys move input focus to the next filter field. Currently 'tab' moves to the next data cell and 'enter' does nothing.
Absolutely. I looked for a build last night but I was still a little early
(still @ 017715510f8e559c0c9f0dc25da33a8cabdf50b8). I'll try it now.
@justinclift Just downloaded the sqlitebrowser.exe.xz from the oldsch00l link you provided, renamed it sqlitebrowser.exe (assumed that's the thing to do) and tried to run it. Produced following
![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4123228/4604315/6640d33e-5192-11e4-950d-d4c84d636a86.png)
I'm running Windows 7, 64bit.
And I'm still early. Build log indicates its still 0177155. I'll wait till tomorrow.
The file sqlitebrowser.exe.xz is actually an archive file, so you need to extract the exe from the archive before running. I suggest something like 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/) for doing the extract. I just tried this and it worked fine for me.
Bottom line, tabbing between filter field works as I'd expect. Enter still
does nothing, not sure if that's important.
Thank you for making these kinds of improvements, it makes the tool awesome.
I could go either way. The filter gets applied on each character keypress so it's not like <enter> is required to start the filter. Plus back tabbing is supported with shift + Tab whereas using Enter to move between fields would imply Shift + Enter for moving backward and that does not seem idomatic.
I guess I lean toward leaving Enter unmapped.
Is it possible to make a toggle so that I can use the refresh button and still keep the filters I've entered?
That appears to have fixed it, thank you!
Export Database or Table to SQL or CSV - allow a user to export the schema only
Suggest adding a check box to the existing Export dialog.
Check box label:  "Export schema only"
Default check box condition: Unchecked
Warnings are called liked that, because they are mostly harmless. In this case those parameters are probably placeholders for future features. The developer(s) will know if I'm right.
Will it be possible to access more than one file in a session?
I tried an 'attach', but B4S (Browser for SQLite) seems not to support it. Perhaps in a future version?
Standard one can attach nine more databases and even 124 with runtime-options.
Ref: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html#max_attached
I get
cannot ATTACH database within transaction: attach 'file:../db/main.sqlite:mode-ro' as dd;
I wrote
attach 'file:../db/main.sqlite?mode=ro' as dd;
Cool! Thanks, I'll try it out as soon as I have time enough. Would br milestone enhancement, right?
Where can I find the so-called 'nightly build' for OSX?
Please do, perhaps more users/developers of OSX 10.6+ (5 even?) are interested. I believe you have my e-mail address so a zip, tar.gz or whatever of your newest product is appreciated. What about a s 'Browser4SQLite maillist' with attach capabilities?
It seems to work. Would be cool if we soon have the same advantages as Windows people :) The more testers the merrier. BTW I would not mind a compressed and complete (eventually including sources) version
a tarball or zip with source (eventually), object (or dmg), docs. Don't hurry, only dmg is well enough for now
``` sql
create table foo(id integer primary key, value text);
insert into foo(value) values('foo');
...
```
I run this sql, but sqlbrowser crashed.
Windows7 32bit
Thanks! Solved this issue.
Import table from a CSV file does not handle linebreaks in a field: If a field in the csv file contains a linebreak, the import function handles it as the start of a new record. A solution might be to take the number of fields per record into account as well.
I noticed this while importing a csv file from a third party.
ps. I find the "Import table from a CSV file" function brilliant anyways!
Hi Justin,
Thanks for mentioning this #84, I saw the same thing (spaces being removed) and I thought it had something to do with me Find-And-Replacing linebreaks.
Thinking of #84: it is removing all empty spaces where LEADING and TRAILING spaces is probably meant (and the latter is very usefull!).
Anyways, thanks a lot for this wonderful tool, I find myself using it a lot lately while making my (free!) apps.
Cheers,
Niels Cup
Niels Cup wrote: LEADING and TRAILING spaces is probably meant (and the latter is very usefull!).
I agree, however according to the standard _no_ (i.e.0, the digit) spaces at all should be removed. To be absolutely sure all text fields should be quoted either by ' or "
One time I noticed a CSV-file I copied and changed all commas by |, but there was a field with an unexoected | inside [luckily just exactly one record :-)] in order to create a SQLite-database.
Hi Justin,
I  tried the build below and I had some problems with it: I received a message: “Error importing data. Message from database engine: table table1 has 39 columns but 40 values were supplied”. I would like to see the record number in this message so I am able to correct the csv file. I received this message with the original CSV file formatted like this: “field1”,”field2”,”field3”, “etc…”.
I also have a version of this csv file which I have changed to a pipe separated file (field1|field2|field3|etc…) and I didn’t receive the error on this file, but I noticed the import is now very slow. I have a very large (third party) csv file, 104000 records. I started import, went away and came back after half an hour and the import was only at 52%. The previous version took only 2 or 3 minutes. Performance might not be an issue for smaller files (which would normally be the case).
I know CSV files are often unreliable, I have bumped into these same issues when writing my own import tools. For me the previous version (without the remove all spaces bug) was more workable than this version. In the previous version the import went pretty fast and succeeded. Afterwards I was able to see where the import jumped columns and I could manually remove the linebreaks in Excel.
Cheers,
Niels.
Hi Rene, the “Decoding CSV file..” is very slow. I have just tested (the decoding part) again, with my csv file 104000 records:
- Version 3.3.1 = fast meaning approx. 20 seconds for 104000 records
- Version master_git = slow meaning at 20% after 5 minutes
I have created a test.csv file, with only 10 records and a header (I cant attach the full file, it is 100mb…), just copy the records until you have 50.000 or 100.000 records .
I can’t send you the original file either because it is not my data, but the result is the same with this test file.
Kind regards,
Niels.
Hi, the hail0-2002.csv works fine with me too. I guess it’s the csv file I am trying to import causing the problems: Below I copied 10 (identical) records including the header. As you can see there is a lot more data per record than in the hail-2002.csv. You can copy these records to a csv file and duplicate the records using Excel, (or any other tool). This is the modified version of the csv file (pipe separated), which imports without errors in the 3.3.1 version.

Kind regards,

Hi Justin,
I just imported my CSV file and it looks good. I see the whitepaces are fixed and I don't see any linebreak issues. It is still a bit slow on my tablet (Ativ 700T smartpc pro). I will give it another go tomorrow on my other laptop and maybe on my mac as well with the full CSV file, I will let you know the result.
Kind regards,
Niels.
Just like on APPLE
I hope that makes it easy to set up a port on fbsd (no other patch necessary).
For this it would be nice to have a release including this patch ;-)
Cool. So far the application runs ok on 10.6.8 as well. When will 3.4 be released?
A query with an expression on the limit clause is not shown, for example
select \* from subjects order by subject limit 2*2
does not appears in the results panel. However the status message correctly reads
"4 Rows returned from: select \* from subjects order by subject limit 2*2 (took 1ms)"
Thanks a lot
Hi all,
I did a french translation. Where I can share the file ?
Thanks.
I'll try it...

You'll find the file attached here.
I hope the beta version will help some french users

The input field in a Execute SQL tab with white on dark KDE theme becomes unusable because of it shows white text on white background.
Can you make this field follow system theme?
Auch. Just found it in Preferences. Excuse me.
Im having a similar issue but with the cells  content color

opening new issue since i can't reopen this oen
I had version 3.3.0 installed and working well (except the 'without rowid' issue) with 3.8.6, but changed to 3.3.1 update and reports it's working with 3.7.12. FWIW: I have OSX 10.8.6
Isn't it possible to check if SQLite is in the user's $PATH to autodramatically disable your embedded version so we don't see your mistakes anymore in the future updates? I thought that was happening in 3.3.0, but now it seems that for some reason you downgraded creating the new version. Anyways good job and bugs happen.
Murphy's law of developing: to repair a bug takes always much longer than their appearance
Thank you very much indeed, Justin. I saved the local .app after renaming
it so I can test future queries against >=3.8.2-db's. Hope the team solves
the 'wo-rowid'-issue soon as well. BTW: you could avoid above bug by

1. CREATE TABLE t(x INTEGER, y, z, PRIMARY KEY(x ASC));
2. insert some records
3. try to browse => no data shows up
I am also seeing this problem on version 3.4.0 in Windows 8.1 x64. We have a few tables with INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT and only some of the tables show up in the Browse Data table dropdown. Here's an example of a table that does not show up:
```
CREATE TABLE "SortOptions" (
"Id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
"Name" TEXT,
"SortField" TEXT,
"SortDirection" TEXT
);
```
If you'd like a full sample database I can email you one.
My apologies, false alarm. It was actually user error.
I get the following error No such function: REGEXP
Looking into it a little further the sqlite support for REGEXP looks to be a little different then what I expected.
http://www.ashleyit.com/blogs/brentashley/2013/11/27/using-regular-expressions-with-sqlite/
I've found GLOB which is fully supported able to get the same job done.
Thanks for the quick responses
Evan
Yep please close

Would love to be able to open the app from the command line and pass a path to an existing sqlite database. Does this feature exist?
Guess I just needed to give it a try! I was thinking there might be a special way to pass a db. The following worked for me
```
open /Applications/sqlitebrowser.app my.db
```
Hi! When I import a csv-file into a table every single space was deleted (v 3.3.0). Special characters are not displayed correctly even though in v 2.0 it worked fine. What happened? Is it my fault? Can I make any settings to avoid at least the space-deleting? Thanks a lot for your help!
In fact there is: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180
As is written there spaces should not be ignored and use of double quotes
depends on system/application; M$ExCel goes it's own way...

First commit fixes the test file failing to compile (cannot assign `QPair<Table,bool>` to `Table`).
Second commit updates the test for commit 55678bb9450a0546835b2d86f5124e7efb0a1109
There is still one failing test:
```
FAIL!  : TestTable::createTableWithNotLikeConstraint() 'tab.fields().at(0)->check() == "value NOT LIKE 'prefix%'"' returned FALSE. ()
Loc: [/builddir/build/BUILD/sqlitebrowser-3.3.0/src/tests/testsqlobjects.cpp(244)]
```
Here's my comment for reference:
@jschultz:
> I know I'm weighing in with no idea of the background, but it does seem a bit of a problem if sqlitebrowser falls over on a legal sqlite3 database. Certainly the most common use I make of it is to take a quick look at sqlite databases that are created elsewhere.
@TWiStErRob:
> I second that! The name browser implies that I can open any DB and browse it. The fact the editor functionality restricts opening DBs suggest that maybe the app should be renamed? I mostly just want to see data and not even open the "Data Structure" tab.
> As an analogy imagine an image viewer which cannot open JPEGs with EXIF data, because it can't save the EXIF block, however I want to see the pixels only don't go any further.
@justinclift
Do you have any idea how to approach this?
Original code that created that is
```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE Search USING FTS3 (
_id,
name,
location
);
```
you can probably find the same in the .sqlite file if you open it with a text editor/grep it.
@MKleusberg I would agree that it's acceptable to close this issue if those unrecognized/warned tables are read-only and will be written in the same way even if other recognized tables or data are modified.  Create a table with
```
CREATE TABLE "test"(rowid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
```
Attempting to open the corresponding sqlite file will result in
```
```
and the program segfaulting:
```

Works great, thanks!
Hello folks,
After the excellent service on my last request, I have a couple more:
1. On the 'Database Structure' tab, could the schema be made to collapse along with the field list? As it is, the benefit of collapsing is rather lost when the schema is long and you can only see a few (or only one) tables on your window anyway.
2. On the results from running an SQL query, long fields (varchar and friends) should only be displayed up to some maximum length. Otherwise you have to do massive horizontal scrolling to see all your fields.
3. On SQL query results and table browsing, how about a right-click option to copy the value of the field into the copy buffer. At the moment you can accomplish this with browse data by double-clicking and copying from the 'Edit database cell' window, but you can't do it at all with query results.
Many thanks for your help. And let me know if it makes sense that I work on the code myself - I could do it, but would ultimately prefer to avoid one more learning curve!
Cheers, Jonathan
> makes sense to remove newlines while collapsed.

It seems to work well with the browse table, and consistency is good.

Nothing. I didn't realise you could. :)
But a context menu would be nice to have. Besides copying, you could
also filter on the content of the field, paste over the content, edit
the field, and I'm sure others could think of more.

jschultz: 'Yes, that would be ideal.''
I would say the contrary. Thanks to <Cr><LF> we can see data that's hidden and replaced by ...
Indeed copy and paste to a local text editor helps. Would be nice if the developers replace some whitespace by 0x0d0a internally [of course not in the database file ;-)] to get the same effect.
Hello,
Since version 3.2, sqlitebrowser reports an error on tables with the 'ASC' keyword in its primary key definition. For example, the a database consisting of the following table (created with sqlite3):
CREATE TABLE [Test]([Field] [int] NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT [Test_Constraint] PRIMARY KEY %28 [Field] ASC %29);
cannot be browsed or modified with sqlitebrowser. That is, browsing the table shows the correct number of records but no data in the records. Attempting to modify the table reveals that the entire table definition (apart from the table name) has been lost. Running sqlitebrowser from the command line returns:
I hope that's enough info to help someone diagnose the problem.
Thanks!
Ooops, that got properly messed up by the markdown processor. I'll try again:
CREATE TABLE Test ([Field] [int] NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT [Test_Constraint] PRIMARY KEY ([Field] ASC));
Thanks for that. I know I'm weighing in with no idea of the background, but it does seem a bit of a problem if sqlitebrowser falls over on a legal sqlite3 database. Certainly the most common use I make of it is to take a quick look at sqlite databases that are created elsewhere. For the moment I have rolled back to version 2.0 which works fine.
I second that! The name browser implies that I can open any DB and browse it. The fact the editor functionality restricts opening DBs suggest that maybe the app should be renamed? I mostly just want to see data and not even open the "Data Structure" tab.
As an analogy imagine an image viewer which cannot open JPEGs with EXIF data, because it can't save the EXIF block, however I want to see the pixels only don't go any further.
I'm not sure what an SQLite file looks like but it should be fully accessible through an SQLite driver. I started wondering why you have your own parser did you write a full engine?
Fantastic! Thanks for the rapid response.
Nope I use Linux :)
I already built sqlitebrowser with the patches and it seems fine to me so far.

```
The file causing it: http://temp.twisterrob.net/share/MagicHomeInventory.sqlite
The DB has no data in it, just the schema: tables, triggers, views.
Opening it with _android-sdk-windows\platform-tools\sqlite3.exe_ works, so I tried to narrow it down.
If I drop these:
``` sql
drop table Category_Name_Cache;
drop table Item_Path;
```
I tried dropping only the triggers of these tables, but it was still crashing. So I suspect there must be something in the `CREATE TABLE`s.
Are you sure about that AUTOINCREMENT being the culprit?
The tables I dropped to make it not crash didn't have a PRIMARY KEY like that!
Note: I use `PRIMARY KEY(...)` format instead of `name type PRIMARY KEY` to be consistent among tables with singular/multiple keys. And because of this I don't know if I can put the AUTOINCREMENT anywhere else.
`ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO` should take care of those contstraints, I don't think it's a good idea to restrict. http://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html however renaming a table and updating `VIEW`s and `TRIGGER` bodies would be a nice feature if not already implemented.
@justinclift
Sure I'll try tomorrow, when will it be available (with timezone)?
> Maybe n "Novice mode" option set in preferences, would let us keep stuff simple for novices.
That's not a good idea in general, lot of features will be used by a really small userbase (hard to discover), for example Visual Studio has a nicely hidden "Advanced UI" option in a non-intuitive place: http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC429789.jpg
I'd suggest an expander for advanced features if you decide to go ahead: http://qt-apps.org/content/show.php/ExpanderWidget?content=163843 novice users will see an "Advanced" header of the closed expand and think "Advanced features, beware", others will expand confidently and won't be scared.
@rp- I think if you enter #77 in the commit message github will link your commit to the issue. See https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages . It is always possible to reopen if you see fit.
@justinclift it works as you expected.
I see all the schemas listed, however I can't edit (don't even want to, see my comment on #78) nearly any of them because it would remove all the foreign keys and constraints and cascades. See Category_Descendant in http://temp.twisterrob.net/share/MagicHomeInventory.sqlite
That's really visible and nice ui, but my immediate question is: "what does it do? what is considered advanced? where is the advanced stuff?" That's why I suggest the expander: it's simple, it's in plain sight and in context.
Also: what happens if the editor window is open and you swap advanced mode. (I don't know if it's modal)... the same happens if you have advanced featurs on the main window/tabs, you'll have to rebuild the ui?
Use both of them will crash in SQL log.
The result of LIMIT a,b should be LIMIT b,a.
It'd be a lot easier to write SQL if you could see the schema while you're in the Execute SQL tab. This could be achieved with another pane (like the Plot pane) that shows the current DB schema as a treeview.
Having to switch between the Database Structure and Execute SQL tabs is difficult because you have to constantly refer to this information while writing a SQL statement if you have more than a couple tables and fields.
Tables as root nodes, fields as leaf nodes including data type/primary key/foreign key information in the node text.
That would work too. If you could undock the tabs you could have the db structure and SQL query visible at the same time. That would take care of the issue.
Yes, thank you very much for adding it so quickly.
I am not sure if this is already possible or I am overlooking something but I would like to add a unique constraint to a column and a foreign key constraint.
Currently I only see a way to add a NOT NULL constraint with the checkbox and a CHECK constraint with the input field.
Is this functionality still missing?
Cool thank you I will test it tomorrow :)
Ah I just see that this is a windows build but i only have linux, the changes are not pushed in the repo yet? I could not see a branch for it.
Ah yes I see it now :D this works nice thank you, perhaps in future would be nice to allow composite keys too.
Ca close it thx :)
How to compile the app for linux? I am using ubuntu 14.04
Ah thank you :+1:  It worked, good to hear the package has been updated there is a really old version shipped now :D
Also run
``` bash
$ make install
```
After the make to install the icon, desktop entry and bin file ;)
Being in the root directory cmake needed a path for the CMakeLists.txt - otherwise cmake won't run
(Tested on my ubuntu 14.04)
I have just tried compiling on ubuntu 14.04 but ran into this error:
sqlitedb.cpp:11:21: fatal error: sqlite3.h: No such file or directory
#include <sqlite3.h>
^
compilation terminated.

sorry how do you launch it?
never mind, i got it :)
Oh YES :)
From printf manpage:
z - a following integer conversion corresponds to a size_t or ssize_t argument.
@rp- and thank you for a great project!
I'm glad to help you :-)
Here is compilation warning:
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/libs/antlr-2.7.7/src/String.cpp#L41
PS: warning message was on 64bit Ubuntu (gcc version 4.9). On 32bit Debian with gcc 4.7 there is no warnings
@justinclift  here it is :)
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/66
@justinclift , close it, please :smile: It is the only warning I had. But I will periodically look at the issues :smiley:
I just realized that when I try to modify a table after a default value has been introduced, following changes are just ignored. They appear in the modify table window and the "query" on the bottom is updated, but if you hit OK, nothing else happens. I also realized that you usually get a little window after any change that dissapears very fast (I think that it reads "executing SQL" or something like that) but once you introduce a default value, that window doesn't appear anymore.
If you remove that default value, everything is working fine
I also realized that if you open the modify table again after setting a default value, it now appears as 'value' instead of just value (I mean, quoted)
Here you can see an example
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5297845/3649297/1411fd66-1111-11e4-9248-468a12a2eb51.png)
I am running Win8.1 64bit, SQLite Database Browser 3.2.0 and I have these additional versions on the About... window: Qt Version 4.8.5 and SQLite Version 3.8.4.3
Hi there
I just tried with the link you provided and it's still happening :(
Hope it's fixed soon, doesn't look like something complex :)
Thanks!
I am having an issue when adding a new field to an existing database and I think it is related to this. I have multiple fields with default values and whenever I try to add a new field, the field is always 'Field7' and cannot be renamed. I just tried the Nightly Mac build 09-24-2014. Quickest solution is to revert changes, export the table as SQL, modify the sql and then execute it.
@nealpaze I think it's the same issue, once there's a default value, seems that any further updating stops (maybe some kind of exception is caught later is breaking the execution flow?). The thing is that if you have more than one default value (maybe because you are using an existing database), you will not even be able to remove them to allow it working again
Sure... I still have to try the custom type, I will do both things tomorrow!

Hi
This seems to be working fine, but I discovered something else while
testing it, I am creating a new issue :)

I don't know how to figure out WHY it crashes can anyone point me to the relevant log files? Using the windows binary.
Creating a new database (test) with a field (field1) and then opening my sqlite-database breaks. The same happens if I save the test database before opening the new one.
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]
This particular file won't be possible to share. Customer data.
I have the same issue. Neither 3.1.0 nor the nightly from @MKleusberg did fix the crash.
Here is my sqlite db (savegame from sots2): https://www.sendspace.com/file/40bxfy
How to fix it. Thanks in advance!
windows 8.1. Thanks for your help but i solved my problem with some other software for sqlite...  but i still use sqlitebrowser for everything. i will wait for new version of sqlitebrowser cause i hope that they will solve all problems.
All the best.
Great work man. I just download it and try it. This nightly build version has solve problems with UTF-8 Characters. This is great. Now I can do all my work with this great tool for sqlite.
Keep on doing great work.
All the best.
The `Browse Data` tab shows the correct number of rows but no fields. If I Execute the same SQL as the `Browse Data` tab does then the fields are visible and populated with data.
I've attached 3 screenshots, one from the `Database Structure` tab, one from the `Browse Data` tab and one from the `Execute SQL` tab.

The database works perfectly with PHP and NaviCat.
```
SQLite Database Browser Version 3.2.0
Windows XP SP3 x86
```
Any info on this will be much appreciated, thank you.
This table is created with Doctrine2/ORM running on PHP5.6 PDO SQLite. I've just updated the table (using PHP5.4 PDO SQLite3 3.7.7.1) with new data without a problem.
Here's the table schema:
```
SQLite version 3.8.5 2014-06-04 14:06:34
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE "movie" (
"id"  INTEGER NOT NULL,
"imdb"  INTEGER,
"status"  REAL NOT NULL,
"serie"  INTEGER,
"added"  INTEGER,
"updated"  INTEGER,
"watched"  INTEGER,
"title"  TEXT NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY ("id" ASC)
);
sqlite>
```
I've tested some other databases and none of them has the weird characters, so you're right that that has something to do with it. I've tried to replicate the weird characters without any luck. I've done some operations with PHP and Navicat but also no weird characters.
My conclusion is that most likely there's something wrong with my table, although PHP and Navicat has no problems with it. I believe that this issue can be closed.
About the weird characters in my database, that are just CR and LF instead of spaces in other SQLite3 databases I have inspected. It can be seen on this screenshot:
I took a quick look at the file format on http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html but couldn't find any specifications there about the allowed characters in the creation text.
Maybe someone knows where to find more exact specifications of the file format?
I came across some other databases, tested and inspected them. Table creation text with LF and TAB characters works, data can be seen in the `Browser Data` tab.
Please ask if more screenshots would be helpful and also if you like to examine the database file itself. It's only 1MB.
Thanks for your words! I tried. I hope that I will make still something useful to the project :smiley:

I've tried both building from the latest off master and downloading from other places. Same result. I just downloaded from sourceforge for example (http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser/?source=dlp), the version says 3.2, yet the crash report (similar to above) says `Version:         3.1 (3.1)`
Awesome. I'll get that sent out in the next couple days. Thanks for the
@justinclift email sent
@MKleusberg glad to be of help and glad to hear it's fixed! Thank _you_ for your effort! :wink:
@justinclift Checking it out now!
Working like a charm. Thanks again!
homebrew has been updated with a brew of sqlitebrowser 3.2.0
All that is required to install from brew now is:
`brew install sqlitebrowser`

Oh, i wasn't aware there was a difference in the produced binary. It can be launched from spotlight and seems functional to me, but i just found out about sqlitebrowser so i have not tested it very much. I have no other thoughts on the issue i'm afraid.
looks great!
Just FYI in case you run into this:  After successfully installing sqlitebrowser via brew on OSX 10.9.5 (after performing the usual Brew update/doctor/etc), could not launch via cmd line
$ sqlitebrowser

I have db file from Android and every operation fail with "No such collation sequence: LOCALIZED" error. It is some Android related feature?
Here is SQL code for the table
```
CREATE TABLE channel (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT COLLATE LOCALIZED,
country TEXT,
image TEXT,
category TEXT COLLATE LOCALIZED,
favorite INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
version INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp,
)
```
At least some fallback would be very useful, because of now not exist any SQLite browser that can work with Android DB because of this.
Sorry for delay, I just sent example DB to the Justin
I just tested windows build from http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
And it works great! Thanks you very much. First Sqlite browser with support for Android DB files!
When It will be also in the OS X builds?
Great. Thanks you very much again.
Hi,
Is it ok for you to use non-numeric chars in the tags?
For instance I got this now: sqlitebrowser-sqlb-3.2.0.tar.gz.
Thanks.
Thanks.
I will try.
I am non-professional user that is trying to import csv file that include Hebrew characters.
The file is endorsement of XML file to excel 2010 file and then save as csv file.
After upload the SQL database is not encode Hebrew.
What I need to do in order to see Hebrew in the database?
Hopefully you will help me.
Thanks,
When you try to add a record, it does not use the specified default value for the fields, that are not being entered. To see an example of how this could be accomplished take a look at the firefox plugin SQLite manager (Screenshot added below)
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8113476/3523976/d0586672-0761-11e4-89dc-a66a2a57adfe.png)
So it should indeed use default values? (Because I have a table, where the structure is like this:

Is it possible that your nightly build is only for 32-bit Systems (because
the .exe file [after removing the .xz extension] does not work on my
Windows 7 64-bit System.
Ah, I figured it out (didn't know that .xz was a compression format, now I
do:) ).
And using default values does work with this version now.
Would love to be able to upgrade my sqlitebrowser 3.1 for PortableApps :-)
Done. I see this morning it's now a work in progress (John building...)
Up until now, the DBBrowserDB:decodeCSV used to load the csv-file character by character using the getChar() method of the QFile-class.
Unfortunatelly, this approach caused multibyte-chars as used for UTF-8 encoding to be split and displayed incorrectly.
The fix uses the QTextStream-class to load the file line by line.
Every line is then again iterated character by character, before the old algorithm is applied. Using this approach, the characters are loaded and encoded properly. Splitting multibyte-chars is thus prevented.
Thank you for the feedback. I am happy that I can contribute something usefull to the project. As my schedule permits I will try to add and test your proposed changes and push them up this afternoon.
You are right, this might turn into a problem later. I must admit that I haven't worked with QT for a long time, so I might be a bit rusty ;-)
Exchanging it with inStream.readLine() should do the trick, thought.
I might have found a first bug. A colleague of mine build the program on a mac, and there it seemed to have messed up the separators, as columns are not separated properly anymore. As I've only tested on a windows-machine I didn't know before, but I will investigate the problem asap.
Ok, I've pushed a few more changes.
The line is now loaded using the readLine() command instead of the stream-operator. Also I've cleaned the code a bit up by removing unnecessary if-clauses and moved some of the variables into the outer-loop (as per request).
Finally, I've introduced an additional condition into the algorithm to detect blanks between separator and quote.
EDIT: Made a quick test on my Mac and everything seems to work. Even files with only one line are imported properly.
The SQLite browser program has stopped working every time I try to open a file and shutsdown
After installing version sqlite browser 3.2.0 for Windows, trying to open an existing SQLite database displays a dialog box containing "Invalid file format".
Additional Info:
Qt Version 4.8.5
SQLite Version: 3.8.4.3
OS Version: Windows 8.1 Pro, 64-bit.
It did.  I was using 3.1.0 earlier today.
I confirmed that I was using “Open Database”.  Both the button on the main view as well as the File->Open Database menu item.
Interesting…  For kicks and giggles, I clicked the “New Database” button, just to verify that I could in fact create a new database, closed the new database, and then tried to open the old database and it worked.
Hi, I experienced the same issue just a while ago. I accidentally selected the .sqlite3 file as part of New Database dialog box. It even showed me an alert saying the db already exists which I ignored, then realized it tried creating a new DB with the same name so I cancelled the operation. Then I chose to open the file with 'Open Database' option and got this error. So I guess the New Database operation overwrote the file, but didn't save it properly as I quit the operation.
I  re-created the database (externally) and opened the same in the browser and it opened fine.
I've a sqlite file created with WinCacheBox (geocaching software). However, sqlitebrowser recognizes only a few parts of the file: only for some tables the structure is shown correctly and only for them the contents is displayed. For all others, it knows how many records are there, but cannot display their contents.
I've put a sample file here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9mayzr3stx389hd/CacheBox.db3
Right, the nightly build works well. Sorry... Should have tried before...
This is similar to issue #34, except using the construction `NOT LIKE`. Please note that using a regular `LIKE`, i.e. without negation, does work.
Example:
```
CREATE TABLE not_working(
value TEXT CONSTRAINT "value" CHECK(value NOT LIKE "prefix%")
);
CREATE TABLE working(
value TEXT CONSTRAINT "value" CHECK(value LIKE "prefix%")
);
INSERT INTO not_working( value ) VALUES( "a" );
INSERT INTO    working( value ) VALUES( "prefixa" );
-- INSERT INTO    Working( value ) VALUES( "b" );
```
I'm using the test build posted in the comment by @justinclift in issue #34 on Windows 7.
Confirmed working now, also on my larger database :)
However, it appears to me that the underlying issue is that you are not fully implementing the grammar as specified by SQLite. For example, looking at the possible definitions for table constraints (http://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html -> column-def -> column-constraint -> expr), it seems to me that the same (specific) problem holds for "GLOB", "REGEXP" and "MATCH". Indeed, the following example again fails to display properly:
```
CREATE TABLE not_working(
value TEXT CONSTRAINT "value" CHECK(value NOT GLOB "foo")
);
CREATE TABLE working(
value TEXT CONSTRAINT "value" CHECK(value GLOB "foo")
);
INSERT INTO not_working( value ) VALUES( "bar" );
INSERT INTO    working( value ) VALUES( "foo" );
```
The issue is that all of these expressions (and possibly more in the other comparison operators) may be prefixed by an optional "NOT" operator. However your current fix just allows "NOT LIKE" in addition to regular "LIKE" conditions, but it does not add the generic ability to say "NOT <expression>".
The same holds for the fix for issue #34, modifying the example leads to e.g.:
```
CREATE TABLE not_working(
value TEXT CONSTRAINT "value" CHECK(value NOT IN( "foo" ) )
);
CREATE TABLE working(
value TEXT CONSTRAINT "value" CHECK(value IN( "foo" ) )
);
INSERT INTO not_working( value ) VALUES( "bar" );
INSERT INTO    working( value ) VALUES( "foo" );
```
Which again does not display properly.
I'm wondering whether this is intentional? (and how many more of these examples I can come up with ;)
Oh I see. I do notice that when I open the sqlite file again those shm and wal files reappear. Thanks for your answer!
Stupid question, but is there a way to open WAL files directly? I have a .db-wal file I was looking to browse apart from my .db.
Thanks!
Thanks so much for the help, Peinthor! Indeed there is, would this main db reflect the data in the Write-Ahead log before the commit to purge it? If not, is there any way at all to see what this data is before it has been added to the main db?
@sammarcus wrote 'stupid question'. With the sole exception of the unasked there is no such thing as a 'stupid question'. Stupid answers however there are unfortunately too many...
Back on-topic: like someone said: by opening more than one session (e.g. more TerminalTabs) one can easily have more WA-L and/or SHM-files and investigate them with any tool/language (Perl is an easy example) capable of handling binary files. With the help of SQLite's doc you're able to analyze them and search for nugs and other reasons of corrupted databases.
@rp- thanks so much for that documentation! I had seen it before but gave it another reread, made some new discoveries. appreciate the link!
@Z4us thank you as well!! I'm just starting out so I always like to preface my beginner questions with that disclaimer but the git community has been so friendly. I got it all figured out.. thanks again!

How can i solve this error?
Mac OS X 10.9.3
Qt and Sqlite is installed but homebrew was not. I tried again after installing Homebrew, but still there is same error. Here is output of ls - la in sqlitebrowser directory:
total 184
qmake -d result: https://gist.github.com/0e5a3b7085d16dd634b6
Note: At the beginning 'antlr.xcodeproj' in Users/kutay/foo/sqlitebrowser/libs/antlr-2.7.7 has not current extension.(3 or 4 more file had same stiuation) When i was running qmake, terminal says ¨can't find 'antlr.xcodeproj' ¨ or something like that. Then i change *.pro to *.xcodeproj .. It may be important to know.
I had the same issue installing. I definitely had both Qt and SQLite3 installed with brew with no problems.
This worked for me:
qmake -spec macx-g++
make
I found another way to accomplish my duty. When i have free time i'm gonna try your recommendations. Thanks for now :)
I was also experiencing this problem on my Mac OS X 10.9.4:
``` bash
$ qmake
WARNING: Ignored (not found) '/Users/username/Documents/sqlitebrowser/libs/antlr-2.7.7/antlr.xcodeproj'
WARNING: Ignored (not found) '/Users/username/Documents/sqlitebrowser/libs/qhexedit/qhexedit.xcodeproj'
WARNING: Ignored (not found) '/Users/username/Documents/sqlitebrowser/libs/qcustomplot-source/qcustomplot.xcodeproj'
WARNING: Ignored (not found) '/Users/username/Documents/sqlitebrowser/src/sqlitebrowser.xcodeproj'
```
but this suggestion helped:
``` bash
qmake -spec macx-llvm
make
```
Thanks @MKleusberg !
It seems i'm encoutered a new bug :
I open my database and in a table i click many times on "New Record", many blank rows appears.
I complete theses blank rows then i click "Write Changes" but only the first new record is saved to the disk, all others are cleared !
It appears the same thing if a delete a new record which hasn't be saved or if a i complete the filter, only the first new record appears at the end of the list.
Thanks.
Cool! :thumbsup:
How about "auto open last project" and "open project from command line" :question:
When using a CHECK constraint on a column of a table which uses the IN( ... ) syntax to check that the value exists in a known set of values, the resulting table does not appear to have any columns when viewed at the "Database Structure" tab. Inserting values will still work, as will querying the table manually, but the "Browse Data" tab will show rows without any columns or data.
Example:
```
CREATE TABLE not_working(
_id PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
);
CREATE TABLE working(
_id PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
);
INSERT INTO not_working( _id, value ) VALUES ( 1, 'a' ), ( 2, 'b' ), ( 3, 'c' );
INSERT INTO working( _id, value ) VALUES ( 4, 'a' ), ( 5, 'b' ), ( 6, 'c' );
```
I'm using version 3.1.0 on Windows 7.
Thanks for the quick fix! It now seems to work fine on my database :)
table is create with episodenb ::
integer not null
but show as
TEXT
in
sqlitebrowser (version 3.1.0, Qt 4.8.5, QSLite 3.7.17).
This is what I use :
create table if not exists episode (
episodeid integer primary key references filmitem (filmid),
seasonnb integer not null,
);"
This is what is dumped by sqlite3 command line:
sqlite> .dump episode
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE episode (episodeid integer primary key references filmitem (filmid),serieid integer not null references filmitem (filmid),seasonnb integer not null,episodenb integer no null,title varchar[max],foreign key (serieid) references serie (serieid));
COMMIT;
But sqlitebrowser tells me that:
CREATE TABLE "episode" (
`episodeid` integer,
`serieid`   integer NOT NULL,
`seasonnb`  integer NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(episodeid)
)
Indeed this was my mistake (no vs not), I'm glad that you were actually able to turn this in something helpful for the project.
Thanks for the detailed answer :wink:
Another little detail, when I click "modify table" on a table in the "Database structure" tab, and resize the "Edit Table definition" window, after the resize it shrinks back but the bottom QTextEdit (I think) is reduced a little too much and shows a scroll area which should not be necessary.
This is the scroll bar in the "Edit table definition" windows.
But it seems it's not always happening, it depends on how you resize, so it's maybe more a Qt problem.

I recently added a partial index (a new SQLite 3.8 feature) to my database and noticed that SQLite Browser was no longer able to read it. I'm assuming that this is because the 3.1 Windows binary version is still using SQLite 3.7.17.
Since 3.8 is 9 months old now, perhaps it's time to update the bundled version?
@justinclift: Sure. I just tried opening and browsing the same file (with partial indexes) that didn't work under 3.1 and everything seems to be working as expected. That's about the extent of the testing I can do at the moment, as I happen to be out of town, but it looks good to me....
Is there any reason sqlb does not contain a compiled osx sqlitebrowser.app in its release distribution?
Was thinking maybe a license issue or possibly a security signing which may prevent it running on other machines issue maybe?
You basically can copy the Qt framework files to your app bundle, and that's it. Examine the package for the older (sourceforge) app and you will see how it is done. I think I had some automated routines at one time to do this, but they were for Qt3, probably very different.
One note: in the previous version I used to include the sqlite3 source in the tree, and compile it with the program. But I see now that this has changed (reading cmake). So you are correct that you also need to include the lib.
But, in general, OSX bundles have this ability: you can include the libs inside the bundle directory and they will be searched first, and take precedence over the ones installed in the system.
For the Qt libs, you can use the included tool to simplify this:
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/macosx-deployment.html
Awesome, glad I got a ball rolling. I have forked the repo and uploaded a release OSX build for a friend but I didn't hear back from him if it worked. Going to assume it wont streight off the bat but glad to hear that it may at some point :)
it doesnt even work. I followed all steps and when i run the make it says:

It works for me on on Mavericks. Awesome! Thank you! Just what i was looking for! =)
It starts ok for me (mountain lion). But it crashes when I try to create a new database or open another one, every time. In other words: Qt methods seems to be ok, but libsqlite ones cause a crash. Below is the dump

Same issue here with both versions. The problem seems to be in libsqlite3.0.dylib. How did you generate it? Did you do this on a machine running Mavericks?
Maybe this lib needs to be compiled/linked against an older version of the system frameworks in order to work on older OSX releases.
I am pretty sure the processor does not matter, XCode targets abstract this. The problem is most likely that you used/bundled a system version of libsqlite3 that is incompatible with what I have here. Did you copy this from your sytem folder, or compile it?
That is one of the reasons I used to add sqlite3.c to the builds, so you would have a static version on all platforms. Of course, it makes it difficult to update Sqlite and benefit from fixes (specially in the case of LInux builds). For OSX and Win this is really not an issue as you would have to replace the lib anyway.
Justin, try not including libsqlite3 in the archive, and instead linking to the system framework in XCode. Here are some pointers (the first link is for ios but it should also apply to osx):

The latest one works perfectly here.
make install (invoked in the top level directory, containing BUILDING, ...) doesn't seem to do anything except produce output; no files are installed anywhere.  The program has already been build using make, and seems to work fine.

I downloaded sqlite-browser using the command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.git
```
and invoked make (not cmake or qmake) on sqlitebrowser/Makefile.  The

Provided you have Qt and cmake  installed and configured, simply

When I find a Makefile in a build directory, I assume that the packager
has already run whatever is needed to generate it, and that they have
probably done a better job than I will (at least for a first cut), so in
this cas I didn't run qmake.  If you want sqlitebrowser to be built

Build the binary as instructed.  If "make install" doesn't put the
binary in a useful place (say in /usr/bin) copy it to such a place by
hand.
One field in the database I'm investigating is described as:
dateTime INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
It's actually, as the name implies, a Unix time field containing seconds since the epoch.  If there any way to display it properly in the browser?
Is there any documentation for Sqlite Browser?  If so, where?  In particular, what do the "Filter" buttons do?
Thanks for the tips, i went back to the old version just because the search was so strict !
It would be better if the old Sqlite Browser site on Sourceforge had a pointer to this site.  The Sourceforge site comes up in Google searches much earlier.  I wasted a good deal of time trying to get the Sourceforge version to compile.

I tend to browse/edit the same set of databases and tables much of the time (a fairly typical scenario?). Would you consider an enhancement to save the column widths the user has set for a given database+table? Either automatically or, to avoid an infinitely growing list, via a button or a menu option?
Saving the current session profile would be great too, Martin.  But what if I frequently work on several tables in database A and a couple of tables in database B - when I switch from one table to another it would be fantastic if the column widths I'd set for that table were restored for me...
Works as you describe and does precisely what I was looking for!
Thanks very much!
This is more a comment than a bug report, but I noticed this when testing the fix for issue #16.
Suppose you have a BLOB containing multiple null-terminated strings. When you edit the blob, everything is fine as type:Binary, but if you change the type to "Text" in the EditDialog the length of the data remains the same but only the data up to the first null is shown (understandable, but not what the user might expect). Switching back to type:Binary shows all the data again.
However, if you change the data in the type:Text view it is immediately truncated at the first null (the new length shown at the bottom of the EditDialog window), and switching back to type:Binary only shows the truncated data.
I do think it's a valuable facility to be able to edit text within a blob - editing UTF-8 encoded text in hex mode is only fun once :-)
Yes, it seems to be a very difficult area.  Full function UTF8-aware hex/text editors seem very few and far between.
Perhaps it would be reasonable to settle for disabling Text editing for blobs :-(
By the way, I only discovered by accident that the binary edit mode has the text displayed on the right hand side - it's completely hidden when the EditDialog opens at its default size!
Maybe make the default width enough to show the 16 bytes in both hex and text?
@MKleusberg both commits appear to have achieved what was intended - looks good, thanks!
May I make a couple more (final?) comments? (although I understand you may have better things to do than attend to this level of detail)
1. there is no visible representation of a null byte in the text view, and
2."Select all" highlights all the text, but "copy" only copies up to the first null
Seeing where there is a null means I'm less likely to remove it by mistake.
Being able to copy the entire blob value at least gives me the opportunity to take the data for processing elsewhere (and a really nice feature of the EditDialog is that I can get my binary data back into sqlitebrowser by pasting it as hex pairs).
Here's what I see on Windows 8.1:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7688713/3209796/2d42edac-ee8b-11e3-9574-fbe521985263.png)
To my mind, the best solution is, as you suggest, to extend the hex editor widget if possible to allow input on the right side.
By the way, the hex editor doesn't appear to make any attempt to display multi-byte UTF-8 characters ("café" will appear as "caf.."). Another Qt constraint?
Just started using the much-improved v3.1.0 via PortableApps - Thanks!
However, I now find that columns with a declared type of TEXT with values which are UTF-8 strings longer than 1024 bytes now appear as (BLOB), both in the Browse Data tab and in the Execute SQL tab result pane. SQLite returns typeof() as 'text'.
Not sure what the previous PortableApps version was, but it displayed text values as text all the way up to my longest string of about 13K.
Is this a limit that you could consider raising/removing? (browsing/editing BLOB data is a tad less friendly than TEXT data!)
Sure, I'll try it tomorrow and let you know.
Quick work!
As predicted, Rene's fix works perfectly as far as I can see both for isBinary and for EditDialog::checkDataType() so, from my perspective, this issue is resolved.
(I do have a related EditDialog comment, but will raise a new issue for it)
Many thanks for the super quick fix!
The tool of choice to translate pure Qt applications (like sqlitebrowser) is Qt Linguist. As Rene said, the code is mostly ready for it, as it uses tr() to display strings. If possible I would like to stay away from Launchpad, as it is too specific to Ubuntu/Canonical. We had a lot of problems in the past in KDE, with Launchpad translations taking precedence over upstream ones in some cases.
In issue #57 I made translation to Russian.
Thanks!
It is a nice enhancement, but be aware that by itself SQLite does not include an encryption library. One is available from HWCI (http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/see.html), for a fee.
As sqlitebrowser is distributed with source we can not include SEE with sqlitebrowser. You can, however, license the extension and compile your own binary with SEE included (I have done this in the past for the Arca Database Browser, the product from which sqlitebrowser was derived from).
Hi,
Thanks.
Thanks for all of the comments/suggestions.  I'm pretty sure I don't have the know-how to link in an encryption library and compile my own version of the software for Windows.  If anyone can do this and make it available for download, that would be great.
This is specifically useful for databases/tables containing (or going to contain) passwords like one I'm creating and e.g. Fossil. Of the latter passwords are in normal UTF-8....
Although I don't get a lot of time to play around with this, I have been keeping track of the comments and enhancements.  It's great to see that even with "free" software, there is some support and people that care to enhance it.
I just downloaded what I thought was the latest version for Windows.  I didn't see any of these changes in it.  Is there any possibility of getting a test/beta version that has the new encryption ability rolled up into it?
Thanks!!
I'm testing the version with sqlcipher with success under osx 10.6. One question: can I add a parameter like e.g. a filename when I start via the command line of Terminal?
Of course we don't enter the password visible on the command line, but things like file-path and name, eventually some options like page-size if it's not the default of 1024 bytes. I asked this to get only the question for a password to any user and in case of a wrong answer they have no access (or just read views, their "own" data etc.
Cool @MKleusberg I may have found a bug. When I enter the following SQL-statement:
pragma application_id;
it works well in the GUI (returns 0 - changing it fails), but returns the following error-message to Terminal
2014-12-05 08:29:13.251 sqlitebrowser[20563:903] Failed to get CharCodes from EventRef (-9870)
Not with some other pragmata; didn't try them all yet.
Only with encrypted databases unless the bug was introduced after 25 november the last nightly build normal I installed. I need to do some more tests, but it seems that for an encrypted database the application always returns 0 for application_id even if this field was filled with another value before encryption; I'd like to see this one in the 'Edit Pragmas' tab...
The problem seems solved in the build of 7 December. I changed application_id successfully. Thanks! Good job!!
Just tried the latest version again for Windows.
Is there any hopes for a Windows version that will open an encrypted database?
Thanks!
Unfortunately, no.  I can fumble my way through maintaining some C++ web code, but other than that, I wouldn't be much help.
Hi,
I will try my best to explain in detail my build set:
- Miscrosoft visual studio c++ 2013, but I think any version is ok, link download: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=517284
- SQLCipher: I just try to link with 2 differents versions, and it works all fine:
- 1st one is SQLCipher C/C++ DLL for Windows that I requested for a 30 days trial on their main site (https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/trial/)
- 2nd one is a self compilation (mingw32 + code source: https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/open-source), here's a guide link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29196087/step-by-step-guide-to-build-qt-sql-driver-plugin-for-sqlite-db-with-sqlcipher-ex (part 5)
- These variables in CMakeLists.txt must be modified to match your preferences:
```
+ QT5_PATH
+ SQLITE3_PATH (path to foremost folder of SQL Cipher)
+ OPENSSL_PATH
+ LIBSQLITE_NAME (sqlcipher or sqlite3 depends on the name of your .dll file)
+ SQLITE3_INCLUDE_DIRS (sqlite3.h)
+ SQLITE3_LIBS (name of your .dll file)
```
- Then everything left is just open sqlitebrowser MSVC solution then build
I'm sure that I might miss something, so if there anything wrong, just ask here, I will look back at my build and answer, for now that's all I remember.
Cheers,
Link to 64-bit windows version is broken.
You can try with SQLCipher setup on Ubuntu mentioned here in [SO thread](http://stackoverflow.com/a/25132478/2624806).
Can someone please help me? I don't know what it means "Please enter the key used to encrypt the database". I downloaded the database from Bluehost. Do I call them to get the key??
yes, but there do I get the password? Where do I find it?
is it found in wp-config.php?
Thanks to lulian, Chris, and Justin! Thanks for your detailed reply. I
think I will restore the data to a blank Wordpress setup to verify as
Justin suggests. It's simply to hard to read otherwise. Thanks for the
suggestion!
so any way to decrypt the sqlite file encrypted by sqlite cipher without know the password? if you know please send me the way on roneqwerty@yahoo.com Thank you for your response.
no way? am try to find way ...because always door have a backdoor. newest all companies try to make a program like this . so we have to find way. rone
case: 1. git clone repo.
2. open sqlitebrowser.pro through Qt Creator 3.0.0. (based on  Qt 5.2.0  - 64 but)
3. Celan All -> Run qmake -> Build All
4. thrown error
Resolved by adding major version settings to qhexedit.pro and qcustomplot .pro files.
Major version settings added properly to qhexedit.pro and qcustomplot .pro files.
I tried with qmake now with qt5.2.
Qt throws sqlite3.h file couldn't found.
I tried to find the sqlite3.h file on Linux terminal by using below command:
durga@ubuntu:~/sqlitebrowser$ find /home/durga/sqlitebrowser/ -name "_sqlite_"
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/distri/sqlitebrowser.desktop

/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/images/sqlitebrowser.png
Should I include explicitly add these files(sqlite3.h/.c, shell.c files from sqlite.org) to Qt project?
I used to work with couple of sqlite3 versions on my machine. (including sqlcipher)
I can see this on Ubuntu 12.04 also.
Hi,
I'm going to package it into Fedora 20 onwards, I'd like to know which name is better, sqlitebrowser or sqlb?
Thanks.
Thx.

If you have not changed this from the original version there is probably
