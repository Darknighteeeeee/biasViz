@RoarkeRandall `Line`, `Area`, `Bar`, `Scatter` , etc, have a props `name`, If you have specified props `name`, the `name` will be used to display in `Legend` and `Tooltip`.
Yeah, jsfiddle is the simplest environment. I use it to confirm whether the crash  happens online.

@raspo It's strange to add `onClick` event in `Tooltip`, but  bind event handler in Chart.
@abpai  The `onChange` of Brush is overwrote by internal event handler in [generateCategoricalChart](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L726). Maybe we should refactor  generateCategoricalChart to not simply overwrite.

@email2vimalraj You can check this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/ez3x3z4k/). It just show the actual y axis value by default. What's the problem?
@cephirothdy2j As mentioned in [#223](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/223). In your case, do you want to cut the lines inner the coordinate system?
@tobia  If just so, the height of chart may exceed the boundary of container node.
@kujon
@kujon Thanks for your advice.
@tobia The `onClick` event of `Pie` works. But It will be overwrote by `onClick` of `PieChart`. So It seems strange now.

@HashDot
@HashDot OK! it'll be helpful.
@Moeface Can you support a jsfiddle demo ?
@kaiser-naren
@digorydoo
@susanafcosta Can you give an example ?
@susanafcosta Because we set some default  values of`fill` and `stroke` in `Scatter`, `Symbol` and some other components, so the style you set in css can't be applied to the dots. It's recommended to set such props, like `fill`, `stroke` and so on, in attributes just like svg element.
@squll1 Sorry! `gridCount` is deprecated. I'll update the documentation.
@amay 😭 I can't reproduce this bug.
@amay Thank you! Maybe we should remove span cache.
@cephirothdy2j I want to know which kind of display do you want when some points is beyond the min or the max value of domain.
@oande Only when the areas have the same stackId and yAxisId, these areas can be stacked.  Because different yAxisIds  indicate that these areas have different dimensions, there is no any sense to the sum the values of these areas.
@oande Sorry! It's a bug of stacked chart.
@SachaG Temporarily no simpler solution.
@SachaG  You can set the style of Legend by overwriting the default style.
@SachaG The order of Legend is consistent with the order of stacked bars. So I'm considering whether to adjust the order of stacked bars.
@SachaG  I don't what's the problem?
I will try to support Legend by svg nodes.

@godmar When you use `ResponsiveContianer`, we'll try to calculate the width and height of ResponsiveContainer's parent node.

@bluespore We have looked at a lot of chart libraries before, like echarts, highcharts, c3, nvd3, chartist, dc.js, and so on. Morris.js is also one of them. Most of these chart libraries can't meet our  various requirements.  That's why we develop recharts.

<CartesianGrid stroke='#f5f5f5' vertical={false} />

@marchaos A workaround is setting the `domain` and `ticks` of two y-axes like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/w7qdap9f/1/). But it may be very complex to calculate the domain and ticks.
@marchaos  If the domains are fixed, you can specify the domain and ticks of YAxis like the following:

@marchaos It works fine in [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/znqLLdev/1/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=znqLLdev). Can you show your question in an online jsfiddle demo ?
@marchaos It seems to be the problem of calculation strategy for flex box. You can check this [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7985021/css-flexbox-issue-why-is-the-width-of-my-flexchildren-affected-by-their-content) for detail.
@RichardJECooke  [uv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_user#Unique_visitor) and [pv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_view) are just two indicators commonly used in web analysis. You can search `uv` and `pv` in google.
@RichardJECooke
There are two workarounds:
@eXtremeX In such case, you can set the style of the parent node of responsive container.
[Here](http://jsfiddle.net/vxnhLa14/) is a workaround.
@Algiras   `Area` does not support this function now.
@Algiras We'll refactor the events of some components in a few time.
But when not enough space, this kind of labels can't be guaranteed to render inside the bounds of svg.
It's very strange about your bundle file.
Yeah! `maxRadius = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(width * width + height * height)` is a good idea.
@manuviswam  Which of the following curves do you want to get ?
2. Filled with unavailable dates
@manuviswam As you said, you should use ScatterChart to draw the curve. When you use
@manuviswam
One is that you need to add `color` in your payload of Legend. Otherwise icon will not be filled, so you can't see the icon.
@adrianmc [Here](http://jsfiddle.net/0mgjy8nf/) is a workaround, though I don't quite understand this chart.
You can color the bars differently by customized `shape` in `Bar`.
I wonder why "Fossil fuels" have a different fill color?
@isilweo You mean `paddingAngle` of `Pie`. We will support this feature in the next version. Thank you for your advice.
@isilweo We don't implement `formatter` in Bar. It may be a error caused by copying code from some other file.  And you can implement labels on the top of `Bar` by customized `label`.
@nickstanish  Do you know the version of safari in ios8.3?
@nickstanish It works fine in my ios8.3 simulator. You can add `alert(navigator.userAgent);` in jsfiddle to check the version of safari.
@joshburgess OK! It's helpful for us to find the problem.
http://jsfiddle.net/d0k0rk0m/2/
@Cloudo  Merged! Thank you!
@ycpatel813  You can use customized label to get what you want.
@shakalakatechie
@zhaoyihong
@sankho
@sankho I think it's better to add `style`  which can set all the presentation attributes by a function. But we are still very cautious to add **props**. Because this feature can be implemented in two ways now.
@sankho  Thank you very much for your contribution. I really hope that Recharts will become more and more friendly to developers.
[Implemented by shape](http://jsfiddle.net/8s13xjth/)
@sankho I prefer developers can use the `shape` or  `data` to approach this feature.
@iuriikozuliak  I don't quite understand what's the problem.
@iuriikozuliak Thank you! I have found the reason.
But, I find `getTicksOfAxis` is in a mess.
@ochervak `Bar` don't support min-height now.

@sankho Thank you for your sharing, horizon chart is very interesting. PR is welcome. We don't have guidelines for contribution yet. The most basic is that you should run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` when you finish a chart.
And you can achieve your target by managing the colors outside (http://jsfiddle.net/nbsb32nd/), but it seems to be not elegant.

I found some weird behavior when using a Line Chart.
My Line goes below the X-axis which leads to a weird looking Chart.
I have reproduced the "bug" in this jsfiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/danielh21/7euyzdu6/10/
recharts version is 1.0.0-apha.5. I didn't check previous versions.  I want to use different color for each data point in `Scatter` component, like using different color for each slice in `Pie` component.
```jsx
``` The documentation makes it sound like Cell isn't valid in Scatter, so I'm not sure about your snippet.  I will say that I had a similar issue recently and although it doesn't scale, I solved it by filtering my data set into multiple sets, then having multiple `Scatter`.

@ryanand26's solution seems like a good workaround, but this is definitely a bug. @rafaelc0sta @jgentes Can you create a demo on jsfiddle? The code I had with the issue was really convoluted so not suited to a demo.
Edit: I've made a suggested fix in a PR. @ryanand26 I took a look at your PR. Great Job! But, removing `Children.only` seems altering the code's logic, because after the change, `isSingleChildEqual` (which internally expects two ReactNodes to before shallow comparision, check out [this line](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/9511adcf62ea0d8bb847b6b4c4d90e62b8ee73f9/src/util/ReactUtils.js#L351))  will always return false for single node array. As a result, it in turn affects this line https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/9d42367e658cab6bed0a8f2517f17be9e0cf0957/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L185. The code governed by this condition affects Brush and etc. @ZheyangSong @xile611  I've looked into it a bit more and the root cause seems to be that the single elements return a count of one but are wrapped in an array. The code change in the fork above is probably safer than the first attempt. @ryanand26 Yes, it is the root cause. You can find more details regarding it from my earlier comment in this thread. Glad to see you pin the issue down! 👍   Is there an easy way to calculate the position for each `Label`? I have a line graph with 2 lines, and want to display the label on top for the top line and underneath for the bottom line (the lines may cross, so one is not strictly greater than the other).
This issue also appears to be present in the examples. I am away from my computer but I will try produce a fiddle to reproduce the issue when I get back. Thanks! @xile611 - I added an additional Pie shape to your fiddle and it works fine. So that's not the problem. I also tried changing a few other properties to try to isolate the issue I am seeing in my build and did not reproduce the issue in your fiddle. It seems to be pretty stable.

I was going through documentation & i noticed i have to increase the length by 1. That's odd I just cloned the repo & tried `hostNodes()` & it worked fine, I don't think increasing by one will work
These are not the same objects
@xile611 thanks for taking time to further investigate this!
I join @alexeikaratai question. I have the same problem: when Line draws at first by points its animation works perfectly. But when I try to change points (for example send another data from props) animation haven't restarted from zero point. Is it possible to restart animation when data has changed?
the code should give a custom color but it didn't.

I just think there is a small mistake since the operations are made inside of strings.
Here is a JSFiddle that clearly demonstrates the problem I am referring to in this issue:
http://jsfiddle.net/x1yoboc7/829/ If you use numbers inside your array for the domain, it works perfectly [fine](http://jsfiddle.net/3v6ecrgc/). As soon as you put strings, it indeed causes a weird behaviour since the Y values are numbers. Maybe I am not understanding you well, let me know if this helps.

@xile611 Can you please provide some example of this ?  Can you make the <Bar> component so it accepts ReactElements also? Currently it accepts only Numbers or Strings and I need a ReactElement because of i18n  Is it possible to convert a string to a number for a line chart? I am creating a number of line charts for a reporting tool. Some of the values are numbers and those work great, but others are strings that are actually numbers. Being able to call `parseInt()` or `parseFloat()` on the strings would be enough for my use, I'm just not finding an acceptable place to do so. Any thoughts?

really, need more document or examples! example: <http://jsfiddle.net/agooou/p39k0vwt/>  Now you can pass an explicit `id` to the Pie component in order to better support server side rendering. This is because the implementation of `uniqueId` in DataUtils.js. In server side, DataUtils.js will be imported once but run several times across several requests. So in client side, the id will be much smaller than server side. That causes checksum issue.  Is it possible to have a bar chart with more than two Bars? All I get is a blank chart.

Maybe you can try to create custom shapes

Fabians post is awesome.
But dy doesn't work. Is there a way to control the offset of the label (without a custom function)? I've tried this every which way, but dy still has no effect on the position of the label. Can you show me in a jsfiddle (I essentially did that, using the CustomizedLabelLineChart example as a starting point)?  What's the difference between using iconType with Legend vs using it in Area/Bar/Line?  Chart is being responsively changed according to the size but label (if they're to long) seems not to be considered in the measurements which means they're cut in some circumstances.

I have to say, I really do love this library for ease of use. However, the custom styling of most of these components is a nightmare, and should possibly be rethought, and reworked, as style should not be forced to be the way the creator of the library thinks it should be.

and label from Yaxis, should be 0 ... 20% ... 50% ... 100%
What exactly is it for ? Is it something special ? @evilucifero
On the example that @cemremengu is referencing, `amt` is no shown on the chart.  The data comes from the Stacked Bar Chart example http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/StackedBarChart
<Bar dataKey="amt" stackId="a" fill="#ff0000" />
@cemremengu  Thanks for clearing that up. That was really confusing.  It would be great to have support for axis labels that appear rotated, to the left/right of a Y-axis or the top/bottom of an X-axis. See "Temperature" and "Rainfall" in this link for an example: [Rotated Axis Labels](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/combo-dual-axes) I would like this too - I don't use your axis labels for just this reason. Well, OK, but that feels like a workaround to me. Since axes already have labels (which the should--it's an inherent feature of an axis), I think it should be possible to specify how/where the label is drawn. IMHO, the current (exclusive) default of horizontal text at the end of the axis is just about the least likely place the label should be. @xile611 Your suggestion gives me this error:
From this code:
```jsx
<Label angle={-90} value='custom label' position='insideLeft' style={{textAnchor: 'middle'}} />

@xile611 Also, I know we talked about making this work for candlestick charts, but I actually think they are different conceptually because an error bar is a value you add onto an existing data point (similar to a label) where as a candlestick chart is an actual chart type where each point consists of four values displayed in an histogram like manner. After the error bar PR goes through I can work on the candle chart if you would like. Thanks for the feedback!

Would this disrupt the current codebase much? Based on `dataKey` being a string I suspected that under the hood the data is simply retrieved by something like this:
@xile611 I think passing nested keys misses out on a lot of the flexibility enabled by a mapper function and is also a breaking change, since
@bali182's solution seems ideal. @tarrencev agree, a mapper function gives way more flexibility. By the way, nested paths could be easily achieved with an helper function such as `get` in `lodash`:
import { get } from 'lodash/fp'
introducing nested key strings would be a breaking change. Doesn't affect me, but just wanted to make sure it's considered I see that commit reverted. Any updates for nested data keys? @raviteja83  @erayalakese using a function works for me

@truenorthcreative, isn't React.js supposed to re-render when you update state on components ?
it would be nice if you could post some code or jsfiddle to demonstrate
@jareechang yes, of course. But the re-render will only affect the changed element, etc. my point is the state changing for _anything_ in the parent will re-render, as will clicking sibling components (even if you want to remove the state argument)
http://jsfiddle.net/znqLLdev/1/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=znqLLdev

Thanks you @xile611 .
I have tested this in safari and it works as expected. The bug occurs in chrome 53.0.2785.116.
@xile611 I hear you, do you think there is a better place to put it?
The `onClick` on `Tooltip` definitely feels strange, but it somehow makes sense as the callback is returning the content of the tooltip, and the `onClick` is triggered only when a tooltip is showing.
@xile611 not sure what you mean by that, just renaming `onClick` to `triggerEvent`?
@xile611 Why the tooltip can not be shown when I try it on a mobile phone?  An `onChange` function provided to Brush as a prop does not get called.

Naren.
Also the properties `tickLine` and `axisLine` on `X/YAxis` don't work in the ScatterChart context like it does for `AreaChart`

Thanks @xile611 it's a good solution although ideally there would be wider gaps between major tiers.
Anyone know where the  CustomizedLableLineChart jsfiddle is?    Preview
I would love to know if there's a simpler way to do this, but for now it seems to work well enough.
There's actually one issue with my method: as you can see in the last two columns, the line for "1%" goes _behind_ the blue bar. This is because of SVG elements stacks in the order they are drawn, and I don't think there's any way around it…
<Legend
.recharts-legend-wrapper {
.recharts-legend-wrapper {
Is it not clear that the bars and the legend are in opposite orders?
```javascript
This looks really cool! Does it convert the SVG to PNG right in the browser? I didn't even know you could do that!
**Recharts version**

or add a minWidth(undefined) or minHeight(undefined) or use aspect(undefined) to control the
@xile611  setting min-height to `ResponsiveContainer` worked perfect to me.

But the bars are overlapping(http://jsfiddle.net/ragrbruL/15/). i want it to be on side by side.

Where the YAxis on the right represents a different scale (related to one of the line charts).
hi Xile. You're correct that it does rescale. I believe the problem I'm having is that I have a chart inside a flexbox container. Since recharts is using javascript to compute the resize, I don't think that it will work with flexbox. This isn't necessarily a recharts issue (or d3.js), but I would presume that a change or config on the recharts side would be needed to achieve what I'm doing.
@xile611 http://jsfiddle.net/9tjsb7k2/embedded/result/. You'll see it opens to the correct size of the window, and if you resize from a small window to make it larger, it works, but not going from larger to smaller.
http://jsfiddle.net/oezx3kh2/embedded/result/
Oh, I see. I was hoping they were Recharts values, like min & max.  Thanks for replying.

That is sad :(  I think I might be forced to use chartist then as it can set more complex values: https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/api-documentation.html

I find this to be very strange, because I was expecting the interval prop to mean the base number for ticks to be generated.

Additionally, can I colour the bars differently depending on whether or not they are above the threshold line?

@xile611 There were no console logs. Browser is mobile safari. Tried iOS simulator with ios8.3, and tried an iPhone 4 with ios 6. However, IOS 8.4 simulator worked fine.
This may have to do with how safari is handling the dimensions of the parent element.
@xile611  I'll try to put something together when I get some time.
Here is a fiddle with the problem I am having:

@xile611
Sorry I haven't had a chance to create a jsfiddle for it.
An additional idea would be to set an aspect ratio on ResponsiveContainer and if one of the measures is zero then use the aspect ratio and the other to come up with the initial size.
@nickpalmer What if you use `Math.max` along with the calculatedWidth/calculatedHeight so that percentages are still supported? Maybe aspect should be optional.
fill must be a string

@xile611 - Hey, can we connect to talk ReCharts?
But I may be misunderstanding, and I'm a bit unclear about how to do this w/ `style` - would you mind elaborating here?
Also, thanks for the fiddle's showing alternative implementations. Personally I'd prefer the library I'm using obfuscate such tasks, so I do like the `attrFormatter` approach as it allows my application code to be less verbose.

@xile611 wow! thank you so much!
@xile611 what does the number represent? Percentage? Or pixels?  I am struggling to find a way to allow padding on the Y axis so that the top value is not coming close to the top of the graph itself. This is a stylistic thing that I believe should probably be best achieved while building the svg elements and can not be easily modified using css after the svg has rendered.
@xile611  I saw `domain` and if I understand it correctly the problem I see is that is you can't really say `max + 20px` as `max` could be any number large or small. The designer in me loves how easy c3 allows you to just throw pixel values at it so my chart doesn't look so crammed and I don't have to worry about the data involved as it's merely a style issue.
<CartesianGrid stroke='#f5f5f5'/>

Here is [fiidle](http://jsfiddle.net/mcf1akad/1/)
The fill is the only thing that has my custom color information passed down, and considering it's a reference to a gradient it doesn't do me much good. The closest I can get achieving the look given the information is this:
![weirddot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/996725/16024411/4e02d548-3187-11e6-90f7-2411a6738595.png)
I have made a jsfiddle to demo this:
http://jsfiddle.net/troyblank/ae55bfLm/6/
As you can see `{props.stroke}` is always `#fff` on any custom dot, and there is no stroke information for custom tooltip payloads to use. It would be a lot more useful for both cases to have the stroke color of the actual line in which it is referencing, which in jsfiddle's case is `#82ca9d`. This would allow any custom tooltip or dot work to be able to really leverage the colors set by any gradient area.

Kinda hacky but it seems to work. Thank you @jasonHzq !
@xile611 Ok.
@xile611 Thanks a lot!
@xile611 how do I disable animation?
Oh I see, I didn't realize it was specific to the Bar component and not the BarChart component. Thanks.
The uv is disappeared from Page A, and XAxis is totally wrong, obviously.
Thanks a lot! Do you guys fancy Chord Diagram contribution? Something along those lines: http://www.global-migration.info/
Actually I've achieved this in an hacky way, by wrapping the chart in a component and force a full redraw of the chart by changing the component state inside the `componentWillReceiveProps` callback, but that's not an ideal solution.

@xile611 wow thanks!
In my case I was abusing the charts a little bit, using the dataKeys on a horizontal barchart to be the values so it was a little easier to read, and then color coding the bars for identification below them if that makes sense.
That’s it :octocat:
Both errors reference multiple copies of React, so I'm think that has something to do with it, but I'm unsure how that is happening, especially if `npm run build` is the official way to build this.
I also like to be able to choose the number of ticks for each axis, or precise that I want more of them.
Thanks @xile611
i try to add css

anyways it looks like a typo :smile:

Can we remove `tickCount` from the API doc for `XAxis` then? @itsdeezy PR https://github.com/recharts/recharts.org/pull/66 submitted if you want to add anything.  http://jsfiddle.net/x1yoboc7/15/

Sorry if it seems like I'm complaining. Its a corner case (albeit a confusing one) and the rest of this lib seems pretty :100:. Thanks!
It's very weird that the default config creates all slices with the same colors. For comparison, I'm adding two pie charts. The left one is recharts, the right one is from c3js.
Yeah, to be honest, I think the api should change a bit. I was thinking in something like this:
<Slice name="Mobile" value={70} fill="#9cacf1" />
I believe it is essential to be able to support composition of custom components, at least for all the cartesian charts.
Using custom components, and svg elements on a chart is a solution for many problems that are hard to imagine initially. For me it was essential, since there are so many types of financial indicators that the api had to be capable to accommodate new types.
When using Legend, Tooltip,  XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid I have
