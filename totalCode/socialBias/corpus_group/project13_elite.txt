Technically, I would like to skip the labels that not in a specific month.  @Glitches Can you show more detail about the resizeObserver error?

react-resize-detector@3.2.0 don't support react@15 now, but recharts still support both react@15 and react@16.

So we can't update react-resize-detector to 3.2.0 now.  thank you @JakeDluhy :)  @sesteva Any simple project to reproduce this problem?
And it seems strange: `var if ("development" !== "production") {`  is not existed in my local files.

It's supposed to specify the domain of `YAxis` to be `['dataMin', 'dataMax']`. If you want to fill the fixed height of AreaChart.

  @paulmelnikow 

Do you think the props name can be consistent with the attribute `overflow`? The the values can also be part of consistent:

* `overflow="discard"` (default) – If the reference item falls partly outside the canvas, don't display it. This is the old default.
* `overflow="extendDomain"` – If the reference item falls partly outside the canvas, extend the domain so it fits. This is the old alwaysShow behavior.
* `overflow="hidden"` – If the reference item falls partly outside the canvas, clip it to the canvas.
* `overflow="visible"` – If the reference item falls partly outside the canvas, draw it anyway.
 @paulmelnikow OK! It's best to remain the `overflow` property in `PRESENTATION_ATTRIBUTES`. @paulmelnikow Any idea to update the value of `ifOverflow`:  `keep` to `visible` and `clip` to `hidden`?  Sorry for the bug, It has been fixed in `1.0.1`.  Please fix the failed test cases.  @vincentljn Thanks for your advice. The new props means to show the tooltip by default or not. So I think it's better to rename the  props to `defaultShowTooltip`!  We can't setState in a render function.  @jabsatz Thanks for you suggestion! I'll add a new className to the wrapper element of <Tooltip /> which can  allow you to know the relatively position of Tooltip. And It's recommended to use css to render the arrow or other icon.  @dbMundada  

You can set `interval` of `XAxis` to be `0` which has default value `preserveEnd`(Chech [doc of XAxis](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/XAxis) for detail) to force all the ticks to be shown.
 Meanwhile you may need to set the `angle` of <XAxis /> to rotate the ticks.
  @xnog `ResponsiveContainer` will calculate the height of its parent node, so you just need to make sure its parent node has right height, otherwise  `ResponsiveContainer` can't calculate right height.  @tomorrowface Please show more code and result of you case.  @riwu We use `cloneElement` to pass some props calculation in `Legend`. So If you use `content` props of `Legend`, you should allow the passed props.  @markogresak  The test cases failed.  @markogresak The first test case is timeout.  I'll merge this pr, and try the tests again. Thank you !  @dadamssg Thanks! It's not quite safe to check the points. I'll add `try...catch...` in the code to fix the bug in IE.   @yaroslav-perec Thanks! But this can't fix the problem! I'll fix the bug of `componentWillReceiveProps` in `generateCategoricalChart`  which shouldn't update when all the props are not changed.  @Slngle Don't support gantt chart now.  @Eric24 The behavior of RadialBarChart is same to BarChart's behavior now.  @Eric24 If you don't want to show the `label` in `Tooltip`, you can hide it.  1. Only valueKey is deprecated, we have updated the props in [recharts.org](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Pie).
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6111424/33984658-60dbdb3e-e0f3-11e7-8754-bc11a73e1bf4.png)

2.  LabelList can be used in `<Area />`, `<Bar />` , `<Line />`, `<Scatter />` , `<Pie />`, `<Radar />`, `<RadialBar />`. This'll be displayed in [recharts.org](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Pie)
3. When you add `label` props, a `<Label />` will be created internally.
```jsx
<XAxis dataKey="name">
    <Label value="Pages of my website" offset={0} position="insideBottom" />
</XAxis>
```

equals to

```jsx
<XAxis dataKey="name" label={{ value: 'Pages of my website', offset: 0, position: 'insidebottom' }} />
```
4. When you mouse enter the chart area, the grey rectangle which is called `cursor` of `Tooltip` will appear. You can change the style of "the grey rectangle" by setting [`cursor` of `Tooltip`](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Tooltip).

5. We'll try to update the demos, but PR is also welcome in [recharts.org](https://github.com/recharts/recharts.org). We need more contribution to make recharts better and better.  @Eric24 
Because only one group of bar is supported in Recharts 0.x. We want to support multi groups of bar in 1.0+ just like BarChart, so we move the props startAngle, endAngle to RadialBarChart.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6111424/32935928-306bc4e2-cbad-11e7-9310-a00313d35bd3.png)

And If you have specified the props `starAngle`, `endAngle`, `clockWise` is no longer needed, so this props is removed.

The props minAngle and maxAngle are used to specify the domain of PolarAngleAxis, so they are removed too. Try to set the range of PolarAngleAxis.

All the changes have been updated in [recharts.org](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/RadialBar).  @Eric24 Add `type = "number"` to `XAxis`  @hlehmann OK! So we should maintain `reduce-css-calc` temporarily.  @jshupptechnologies  Add `onMouseMove` to `LineChart`.

```jsx
<LineChart onMouseMove={...}>
  <Line />
</LineChart>
```  @no-mercy Maybe you can render this kind of line by customized shape of <Line />.  @pachuka You can check [the latest doc of LabelList](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/LabelList). You can render customized component by adding props `content` of LabelList.  @lerayne When you render Pie in SSR, you can set the props `id` of `<Pie />`:

```js
<Pie id="specifiedId" />
```
  @KamiGim You can use `ResponsiveContainer` to render a chart which has dynamic height.

[Docs of ResponsiveContainer](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/ResponsiveContainer)  @PJEstrada 

http://jsfiddle.net/oqg00j2j/21/

You should change the `type` of `XAxis`.

```jsx
<BarChart layout="vertical" data={rows}
                              margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>

                        <YAxis axisLine={false} tickLine={false}  dataKey="name" type="category">

                    </BarChart>
```  @hlehmann PR is welcome, `reduce-css-calc` is not necessary.  @flyg101 Thanks! This has been fixed in latest 1.0.0-beta.6.

[Brush.js#L25](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/cartesian/Brush.js#L25)  @richbai90 Thanks! I have a little doubt about the props name `gpuRender` which  is `gpuRendering` in your demo. Maybe `isTranslate3d` or `useTranslate3d` is better.   @adrienpoly Can you create a simple project to reproduce this problem. Everything works in my local project.  @eldyvoon The second dot just has empty stroke, and the default fill `#fff`. So The second dot is  invisible.

@eranhirs It works in the project of recharts.org. I can't reproduce this case.  @guilhermedelucas All you need is the legend should keep visible when all the datas are 0. right ?  @ljwagerfield `verticalPoints` and `horizontalPoints` are the coordinates of vertical points and horizontal points. Only number type is supported now. @ljwagerfield I forget that svg support percentage coordinate. But the percentage means the percentage of the whole viewBox of <svg />, not the percentage of the main chart area now. @ljwagerfield Thanks! We'll consider about this kind of request.  See:
http://jsfiddle.net/ad071owf/
Same Fiddle with beta.2:
http://jsfiddle.net/ad071owf/1/

If you hover over one of the bars, there is a gray rectangle shown at the left side.
I tried a `git bisect` to find the commit that introduced the issue, but I cannot reproduce it in the demo. @jochenberger I can't reproduce it in my local project too. jsfiddle seems very strange now. I can't select texts correctly too. Seems to work again with beta.4: http://jsfiddle.net/ad071owf/2/ No, I must have missed something. It's still wrong in beta.4. Beta 5 too: http://jsfiddle.net/ad071owf/3/  Try 1.0.0-beta.4.  Sorry! My fault! I removed  **  in src/. But the lib/ were not updated. 1.0.0-beta.4 has been released to resolve this. Thanks!  @eldyvoon  You must return a svg element when `value != 0`.

Otherwise you can use `formatter` to return a formatted value. 

[Try this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/1cu9amk9/)  @ZheyangSong Thanks! But we have defined `name` in `Line`, `Area`, and so on.


[propType of name in Line](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/cartesian/Line.js#L36) @ZheyangSong Thanks, I'll add propType of name in `Scatter`. @ZheyangSong `name` is a configuration property of `Scatter`. So I think it's ok!  @JarLowrey Duplicated ticks of XAxis is allowed in LineChart, AreaChart...  In the case of ScatterChart, It seems more reasonable to remove duplicated ticks of category xAxis. I wonder,  is there any case that the ticks of XAxis can be duplicated too.

In such case, we may need a props allowDuplicated in XAxis when the type is `category`. 
  @huei-tan-sociomantic Thanks for your contribution. But I think the AnimationDecorator seems to be very strange now which has some inelegant codes like the following. 
We need to find a best point between code duplication and readability. So I think such kind of `AnimationDecorator` is not so elegant now.
```jsx
+function componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
 +  const {
 +    isAnimationActive, animationId, points, data, baseLine, sectors,
 +  } = this.props;
 +
 +  if (nextProps.isAnimationActive !== isAnimationActive) {
 +    if (sectors) this.setState({ prevSectors: [] }); // Pie
 +  } else if (nextProps.animationId !== animationId) {
 +    if (points) this.setState({ prevPoints: points }); // Line Area Scatter Radar
 +    if (data) this.setState({ prevData: data }); // Bar RadialBar

[Here](http://localhost:8787/#/en-US/examples/BubbleChart) is the demo of s special bubble chart which is rendered by ScatterChart.  @hc1skalyanasundaram Why you want to set the domain of `<YAxis />`.

The behavior of animation is really strange.   @huei-tan-sociomantic  The props `minPointSize` is used to set a visible angle when the value is very small and no bar is visible.  
`minAngle` and `maxAngle` were used to set the `domain` of `angleAxis`. I plan to remove  `minAngle` and `maxAngle`, and developers can set these props by the `domain` of `PolarAngleAxis` which is  same to `XAxis`.  It has been updated.  @huei-tan-sociomantic Thanks for your enthusiasm!  But so far, there is  no other supporters of new file structure. So I close it!

The labels are re-rendered when you change `isAnimationActive`.  @eldyvoon You can get width and height from `this.props`. @eldyvoon Yeah, you can get the width and height of the corresponding bar from the props of `< CustomLabel  />`.  @gplatt It's a workaround to use `customized shape` of <RadialBar />.

If you just hide the first page, PieChart can't check the update. It's right for PieChart don't update when nothing has changed.   @Rahulkr204 Please give a example of what you want.  @Rahulkr204  Set the props `isAnimationActive` to be `true`

 Try to set the range of `PolarAngleAxis` in recharts 1.0.0-beta.3  @Kroderia Svg can't render too much points now. Maybe you can change the interaction of such huge number of points.  @Danielh21 It's recommended to use  type `monotone` which will generate almost-smooth curve

[Check this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/emjnymxy/)  Any idea to reproduce this case ? I can't reproduce this case in my local project. I've been trying, and as a result of trying I somehow got it working, although I don't know what I've done differently. But I'm happy now, so I'll go ahead and close this. Thanks for the help @ryanand26 and @xile611  I'm going to reopen because I was able to reproduce based on what @rafaelc0sta mentioned. If the initial render includes one `<Scatter/>` and a subsequent render adds another `<Scatter/>` it throws the error.

@rafaelc0sta if you move the lines to constructor() then it won't update, so it doesn't really solve the problem for me. I doubt this is helpful, but I tried upgrading to React 16 and it may include better error details:

``` I've tried to recreate here: http://jsfiddle.net/jgentes/sh4vuy4c/12/

It updates the data array after 5 seconds, and it works fine. I can't figure out how to reproduce the problem, unfortunately, but maybe someone else can. Excellent, nice job @hklebs-cs! Maybe @xile611 could take a look now that it's reproducible.

I created a new jsFiddle because yours was using minified libraries and you couldn't see the error in the console. Here's the latest: http://jsfiddle.net/jgentes/sh4vuy4c/22/ Try the latest version 1.0.0-beta.3.  @nc-sjoquistn Try the props `position="top"` and `position="bottom"` for the 2 lines. @nc-sjoquistn Not support yet! I think multiple `<LableList />` are only suitable for some **beautiful** datas.  http://jsfiddle.net/8wLgvst6/

The labels are visible when isAnimationActive is false or true.  The examples have been updated.  @eldyvoon You can use percentage to specify cx, cy, innerRadius, outerRadius.  @reginavlee Use props `shape` which can be a function or react element to render customized shape.

```jsx

<ReferenceDot shape={renderShape} />
```  The examples have been updated.  @ahmedelgabri Thanks to all contributors, I have review part of the codes.  It seems no big problem, I'll review line-by-line once all the test cases are passed. @kamthamc  @ahmedelgabri @dmr  Thanks! Since it's a break change that recharts don't support React 14, I'll release a new version 1.0.0-beta.0 after merging this PR. Do you have any other idea?   The examples have been updated.  @iphonic Just as what @kamthamc has said, you should add a angle to ticks of XAxis, If you want to show all the ticks. 
And I don't quite understand the second question...
  @damianobarbati Thank you for your suggestion. And I have check some articles (like [this](https://shuheikagawa.com/blog/2017/01/05/main-jsnext-main-and-module/)) and some popular repos, all the repos specify `jsnext:main` to be `es6/index.js`.  @sunndeath You can try [`ReferenceArea`](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/ReferenceArea).  the issues regarding pie charts label overlapping and label getting hidden

@xile611 ? is there a fix for this 
  Duplicated to #970   @Tennen You should only change the files in src .... @Tennen Can you submit another PR ?  @alexeikaratai You can add a `key` to chart when you change data.   @klapouchy Maybe you can change the position of the two dots.
[Doc of Label](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Label)  @FEliuyg The props `valueKey` is a props before `Pie`, but this key is inconsistent with other charts. So `valueKey` will be replaced by `dataKey` in 1.0.0+.  @el37 @KuriatoV Can you give an example of the chart you want?  @happysuns Can you create an online demo of your problem? And what's the version of Recharts?  OK~  I'll close this.  Try the version 1.0.0-alpha.5  @manishjohar sort the data before add to the chart.  @klapouchy

[Doc of Label](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Label)  @costagolub How about create another PR for Tooltip?
It's OK for the feature`horizontal / vertical grid lines filled with colors`. But I'm not sure about the `Tooltip` feature now. @costagolub We has a component `DefaultTooltipContent` now, may be we can add some  TooltipContent to support tooltip has `corner`. @costagolub By now, I prefer to create another `TooltipContent`.  @Xeoncross Change the order of <Tooltip />  and <Bar />, the elements of each component is rendered in order.   @nathantn Use horizontal={false}  to remove all the horizontal lines.

How about the version of recharts? Both the onClick of `LineChart` and the onClick of `Line` works in my local project.  @ngxiaoyi Please try again.  @Vijayk93 It's not supported now.

Change the position of label which has default value 'center' which is in the horizontal center and the vertical center of the view box of `XAxis`.

[Doc of Label](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Label)  @kserjey PR is welcome in [recharts.org](https://github.com/recharts/recharts.org).   @swiftfoot  When you specify a strict domain of `YAxis`, the count of ticks can not be guaranteed. Because we think the readability of tick has higher priority.  @darcusfenix `recharts-scale` which is a dependency of recharts isn't installed. Please check the node_modules.  @victorsilent We have fix the bug of unit.It'll released today.  @al3x-huang You can add css like:

  @bcongdon Check the latest version of recharts, I think this has been fixed. Reopen this if it still not works.  @100kristine Change the order  of `<Bar />` and `<Tooltip />`. Move `<Tooltip />` to be after `<Bar />` .  @Krakof The behavior of chart is right, you can try to adjust the data for your visual dimands.  @olegreznichenko You can create a table which render a `PieChart` in the tds of table.   @Poirette Maybe something else is updating the container of chart every time. The chart will update if:
```js
nextProps.data !== data || nextProps.width !== width ||
        nextProps.height !== height || nextProps.layout !== layout ||

Question 1:  You can use css to change the font-size of `Legend` and `Tooltip`;
Question 2 : You can change the `angle` and `textAnchor` of `XAxis`,  `<XAxis dataKey="name" angle={-45} textAnchor="end" />`
Question 3: You can use customized `content` of `<Tooltip />`;  It works now.  @corinnebrady  I don't know why your problem can't be solved by triggering the same event when you mouse enter Bar  1 and Bar 2.

When you specify `ticks={[0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35]}`, the rendered ticks are just what you have specified. If you just want 10 ticks, then 10 ticked will be calculated internally by recharts.

So for the second problem, you can just spect `ticks={[100, 150, 200, 300, ....]}`  @apodaka 

When you update `predictions`, only two BarCharts are rendered in your code. If you want render 4 BarCharts when update `predictions`, you can add a copied attribute of `predictions` in the state. When you update the `predictions`, the copied  `predictions` are not updated, then you can achieve what you want.  @chin-idean When use `connectNulls` for `Line` or `Area`, If the second point is Null, we'll skip the second point, and  connect the first point and the third point now, just like the behavior of `Area`.
There's some bug of  `connectNulls` of `Line` now.

In you case, it's recommended to fill 0 for null entries before added to charts.

<LineChart  syncId="someChart" />
<BarChart  syncId="someChart" />
```  @sh3nan1gans I think this has been fixed. I can't find your problem.  @evegreen Please resolve the conflicts and submit PR again.  Duplicated width #797   @JonathanUsername Please resolve conflicts.  @Swarna-Jain  Can you create a jsfiddle example ?  OK~  @Hegoakerbeltz I think If you can bind events to the `dots` of `Line`, you can achieve what you want.  @Rinoy888 

```jsx
  <XAxis tick={{ fill: 'red' }} />
```  @liubko  You can render customized ticks by specifying the `tick` to be a function or react element.
It's not a bug now.
  @Ziker22 

```jsx
const handleClick = (entry, index, e) => {
  console.log(e.pageX, e.pageY);
};

<PieChart>
  <Pie onClick={handleClick} />
</PieChart>
```  Fixed in version 1.0.0-alpha.1  @imtmh You can add `formatter` to `Tooltip`.  @flamencoflsh Check out [this demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/PieResponsiveContainer).  @alexliu-github Of course, just like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/fdznq2z4/).  @pedroabreu  If the ticks of `YAxis` is required to be integer, you can specify

```jsx
<YAxis allowDecimals={false} />
```

the props `allowDecimals` has default value `true`. @pedroabreu Please create a demo to reproduce your problem.  @lolcookie You can add `ReferenceDot`.

[Docs about ReferenceDot](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/ReferenceDot).  @IanVS You can set `height` of `Legend`, otherwise the chart will update when the height of `Legend` change.


```jsx
<Legend height={60} wrapperStyle={{top: 0, right: 0, width: 'auto'}}/>
```  Fixed in version 1.0.0 + .  @xiaosansiji You can read the source code of Recharts. 

If you have used react, you can use react and d3.
Otherwise, you can use d3 alone.
  solved hence closing   @maurocolella Can you create a jsfiddle demo to reproduce this problem.  @Eric24 Use css or customized tick to omit the first tick.

Css just like:

```css

.recharts-x-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick:first-child line {
 stroke: none;
}
.recharts-x-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick:first-child text {
  font-size: 0;
}
```  http://jsfiddle.net/1509v3gc/


You can set `barGap={0}`. http://jsfiddle.net/1509v3gc/1/

Then you can set `barCategoryGap={0}`.

@Eric24  Maybe you can help us to translate the api of `BarChart` more accurately. OK, thanks~  @durongzhang Please create an online demo to reproduce this problem.  @yokeyang Set the props `isAnimationActive` of `Line`, `Bar`, `Area`, `Scatter` to be `false`.

```jsx
<Line isAnimationActive={false} />
```

[docs](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Line)  @OlegE90 It should not be the bug of recharts. Everything works well in my local project. You can create a simple project to reproduce this problem, otherwise I have no idea what's your problem.  @cmaurer 

Use `Cell` to set different colors for each bars now, just like [this demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/PieChartWithCustomizedLabel)

```jsx
<Bar>
 {
   data.map((entry, index) => {
      return <Cell fill={colors[index]} key={`cell-${index}`} />
  })
 }
</Bar>
```

   You can use `fill = "red"` to set the background-color of `CartesianGrid`.  You can use `ScatterChart` to render this.  @wy19900814 It's recommended to do this kind of messages yourself.   You can bind `onClick` to `Legend`.

[Similar demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/LegendEffectOpacity) Similar to [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/Luk2xapk/). @NischithBopaiah You can just render anything you like when you customized legeng `content`. If you have ever used any react UI project like `ReactBootstrap`, you can use components like `Popover` to render what you want.

I think [http://jsfiddle.net/Luk2xapk/1/](http://jsfiddle.net/Luk2xapk/1/) is what you want.   @Ziker22 Check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/f76d7q18/).  I have no idea now, if you want to hover the lines much more easier, you can only change the strokeWidth of `Line`.  @alexabruck Use customized label function to cover default behaviors.  recharts has used babel plugin `babel-plugin-lodash`. You can check the compiled file of recharts like [this](https://unpkg.com/recharts@0.22.3/lib/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js), the plugin will replace the import of lodash by needed files.

  How about the version of react ? @nbolt Can you create a simple project to reproduce your problem ? It' works well in my project which use react 15.4.2. The jsfiddle is out of date.

[Check this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/qbmg1567/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=qbmg1567)

We have import prop-types now. 
  How about the version of react ? any error message?   @MarkHarper Check the [examples of recharts](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleLineChart). You should import more external pkgs. @MarkHarper How about the version of your react ? OK~  I'm using 15.4 now. I think 15.4 works well.  You can use customized content of `Tooltip` like [this demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomContentOfTooltip).  Thanks! It's a feature in plan. @jzillmann Done in 1.0.0-alpha.0.  @jpmelnik You can specify the domain  of `YAxis`:

```jsx
  <YAxis domain={[130, 200]} allowDataOverflow>
```

About the props allowDataOverflow, you can check the [api of `XAxis`](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/XAxis). @jpmelnik It seems the max value of height is `124.26`. Why do you want to set the domain to be `[130, 200]`? @jpmelnik You can add a `YAxis` which has a different `yAxisId` like `"height"`.

The default `yAxisId` of `YAxis` is `0`, and `Line` has default props `yAxisId` 0. So you need to create another `y-axis`.  

```jsx
<LineChart width={750} height={550} data={this.data()}
          margin={{ top: 15, right: 20, left: 20, bottom: 15 }}>
          <XAxis {...xAxisProps} />
          <YAxis {...yAxisProps} yAxisId="height" />
          <YAxis />
          {/*<CartesianGrid />*/}

``` @jpmelnik Ok~  @codeHatcher It's the event module of node.  @velociwabbit 

You can specify the `height` of `XAxis` which has default value 30.


```jsx
  <XAxis height={40} />
```  @netheril96 Check the [examples of Recharts](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples).  Thanks! I have updated all the demos.

In 0.22.0,

`LineChart.js`  depend on `generateCategoricalChart.js`
`generateCategoricalChart.js` depend on `Brush.js`
and `Brush.js`  depend on `LineChart.js`


so cause this bug.


I'll this soon.
  @lorenzo-pomili Please show me an online example. @lorenzo-pomili  Is the behavior of [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/xtrr8nhw/1/) what you want ?

If so, add props `stackOffset="sign"` to `BarChart`.

The default value of `stackOffset` is `"none"` which'll sum the stacked values.

You can also check the [stackOffset of d3](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#stack-offsets) for more details.  @digorydoo It's a feature I have done in my local project. This feature'll be released in 1.0 version of recharts. In late April. @digorydoo   @jpmelnik 

You can filter the input data first.

```jsx
const inputData = _. uniqBy(dataset, entry => entry.height).


<LineChart data={inputData}>
</LineChart>
```  @nikhilbhawsinka 
Find the className of the outermost div, and add some css to that div.

```
.recharts-wrapper {
  margin : 0 auto;
}
```   @sughanpandita 

You can hide line by css:

```css
.recharts-line .recharts-curve {
  stroke: none;
}
```

or you can done by specifying the stroke of line and dot：

```jsx
  const dotStyle = { stroke: '#8884d8' };

  <Line type="monotone" dataKey="cpu" stroke="none" dot={dotStyle} activeDot={{r: 8}}/>
``` 

  @skvale The `dataKey` can be a function now, so we can only use `child.key`.  @sortsen You can change the layout of `Legend`.

```jsx
<Legend layout="vetical" verticalAlign="middle" align="right" />
```  @peternoyes  You can render customized `Tooltip` content like [this demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomContentOfTooltip).  @sughanpandita Just as your demo, use a `dateFormat` to format the ticks.  @Omortis You can try this:

```jsx
handleEnter = ({ isTooltipActive, activePayload, activeTooltipIndex, activeLabel}) => {
  
};

handleLeave = () => {
  console.log(arguments);
};

handleMove = (chartState, e) => {
 
};

render() {
  return (
    <LineChart  onMouseEnter={this.handleEnter}  onMouseLeave={this.handleLeave} onMouseMove={this.handleMove}>
    </LineChart>  
  );
}
```

And the `showTooltipData` should be a stateless function/ReactElement.  @jasonnathan I prefer [1]. I'm doing this too which is also a main part of 1.0 of recharts. I'll try to release 1.0 in this month. @jasonnathan This feature has been released in 1.0.0-apha.0  @SergeyShablenko Maybe the data of your chart changed.  Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? I have no idea when only have a image. @SergeyShablenko How about the domain of `XAxis`? Reopen this when more clues are provided.  @mehdivk @sonofjack  

You can set the props `scale` to be `point` to achieve this.

```jsx
            <ComposedChart width={800} height={400} data={data}
              margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 5, left: 20 }}>
              <XAxis dataKey="name" scale="point" />
              <YAxis />

It's also recommended to add some `padding` of `XAxis`:

```jsx
const padding = { left: 20, right: 20 };

<ComposedChart width={800} height={400} data={data}
              margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 5, left: 20 }}>
  <XAxis dataKey="name" scale="point" padding={padding} />
</ComposedChart>
```   @neekey Use `<text>` or `<tspan>` of svg.   Similar to [the demo of tooltip](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomContentOfTooltip).

Please check [the document of Legend](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Legend) for detail.
  @seleckis You can render an invisible sector inside the visible sector by customized shape and active shape.  @CalinaCristian You can use customized `tick` like this [demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomizedLabelLineChart).  @jshamley It's recommended to call `parseInt()` or `parseFloat` before passing to `recharts`.  Maybe you mean `ScatterChart` ? @nikolay-g Not support! You can use `ScatterChart` to render this kind of bubbles. But I think you can use `divs` to render bubbles too.  @Omortis Please check this [example](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomContentOfTooltip) for detail.
 Because the payload of `Tooltip` will change when you interact with the chart, so you need to judge whether the payload is existing.  It's a feature I have done in my local project. This feature'll be released in 1.0 version of recharts.  @iambalajive You can change the `height` of `XAxis` which has a default value 30.  @Billy- You can get warning when `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.  Fixed.  @nickpalmer You can check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/xht7qwbj/).

`Treemap` is still very simple now.  Suggestion is welcome.   Duplicated with #365   1. Drop ticklines

<YAxis tickLine={false}  />
```
2. Set default font, color

```jsx
<XAxis stroke="black" fontFamily="sans-serif">
```

or use css

```css
.recharts-wrapper .recharts-y-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick text {

 Just look for [svg styling attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html).  @maryxi Yeah, because we can't calculate the percentage of each items when the denominator is 0.
When I such case, It's recommended to render some message in your project.  @Eric24 You can add two `XAxis` to render this kind of charts.

[Similar issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/439)  @noahwatson Change the order of <YAxis /> and <Bar /> to resolve this.

[Check this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/bbuktzo8/).  @sisiguo I can't reproduce this problem. Please check your dependencies, maybe you have used some third-party PropTypes library.  @dadamssg Use component `ReferenceDot`.

[API](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/ReferenceDot)  @Arrow7000   

You must use component `ReferenceLine` not a customized component.
Check the [code](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L1040) for detail.

When we render `ScatterChart`, we'll check the `type` of children to find out the `ReferenceLine` instances and append some props to the instances. So If you add a customized component to the `ScatterChart`, we can't identify it as a `ReferenceLine` element.

```jsx
              <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={400}>
                <ScatterChart >

            </ResponsiveContainer>
``` @Arrow7000 

The chart will update every time the value of `ReferenceLine` change.
I've no idea now... @Arrow7000 But even when recharts can receive a customized component, your problem can't be resolved.  Every time the props `now` update, the chart'll update.  @kadariyp Can you create an online demo ? @kadariyp You can reopen this issue if an online demo is created.  @loris 
Before 0.20.6, when only one `Bar` has `stackId`, it'll be treated as not stacked bar.
After 0.20.7, event if only one `Bar` has `stackId`, it'll be treated as a stacked bar to fix some bug. 
And stacked bars are stacked from  0, so make the difference.

It's recommended to remove `stackId` in your case.  @kasasi It's seems that `lineKey` has duplicated value.  @JunyuanZheng Can you create a demo to reproduce this problem ? @JunyuanZheng I can't reproduce your problem.

Here is a [simple demo](http://jsfiddle.net/26fqkt0j/).

Can you reproduce the problem in an online demo? Otherwise, I can't help you.  @bigearsenal Sorry. I'll fix this. @bigearsenal FIxed in 0.21.2  This feature has been released in 1.0.0-alpha.0.  @Eric24 I can't agree with your point. CartesianGrid is an auxiliary element in charts. It'll disturb the display of area or bars to put the CartesianGrid. Can you give an example of online chart which need to show CartesianGrid foreground? @Eric24 Props `isFront` is not a good idea. Maybe someday someone would want the CartesianGrid to be in the front of a `Line`, but to be in the back of an `Area`,

But I'm curious about the `100%` area chart. Is that just a background rectangle of chart ? @Eric24 OK! If so, I would close this issue temporarily.  @Eric24 You can specify the radius of label by an object `{ offsetRadius: 10 }`. About the `angle` props, I think the labels of `angle 0` is easier to read than `radial` labels.
And for recharts, not all the features are  appropriate to implemented internally, so It's recommended to implement the radial label by customized labels. @Eric24 
Eh! It's recommended to use customized label for some special cases.
And for the text alignment/baseline, I'll refactor `Pie` to calculate internally.

   @Eric24 When you specify the `x` or `y` to be a function, what about the parameters received ? @Eric24 If so, I think It's almost same to specify the `x` or `y`  to be a calculated value or a calculating function. @Eric24 

In this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/dnstf91y/), we calculate the mean value of 'pv' outside.
If `y` can receive a function, the only difference is that you'll need to bind data outside, and this function will be called inside like the following:

```jsx
function calculateMeanValue(list, key) {
	const cnt = list.length;
  	
  if (cnt <= 0) { return 0; }
  
  return list.reduce((sum, entry) => (sum + (entry[key] || 0) ), 0) / cnt;
}

<ReferenceLine y={calculateMeanValue.bind(null, data, 'pv')} label="Mean" stroke="red"/>
```

So I think It's more flexible to calculate the value outside if  the calculation does not need any  dynamic parameter. 




    @Mohendran In SSR, we can't get the width and height of parent node, so no chart is rendered.

 @Mohendran If the size of chart is fixed, you can remove `ResponsiveContainer `. @Mohendran 

I really can't get your point! 
Because we need calculate all the related coordinates (in pixels) of points, rectangles, and so on, so we need the width and height ( in pixels) of chart. SSR only render chart into a html string, so we can't get the width and height of chart. So we can only render charts after the component is mount.

I wonder why the charts must be rendered in the SSR ? 
If so, you should give a initial width and height of the chart.( New feature)
 @Mohendran   When you specify the width or height of `ResponsiveContainer` to be a percentage, It only means that:

the width of chart = the width of parent node * the percentage

or

the height of chart = the height of parent node * the percentage

 @Mohendran Sorry! We can't use percentages to calculate the coordinates of all the shapes.  @H3katonkheir You can render customized tooltip by specify the props `content` of `Tooltip` to be a customized react component element or a function.

[Here](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomContentOfTooltip) is an example. @H3katonkheir The payload of Tooltip is calculated internally, not allowed to be set by develops.  Duplicated with #446  @GregPhyn  Not yet! @GregoryPotdevin So sorry! 😁  @windsome Any example ?  @davide-giardini Can you give an example why we need to set the `id` of `Pie` in SSR ? @davide-giardini  The PR hasn's been updated for a long time, you can reopen it if any updates is submitted.  @pherris  So many bars which have the width < 1px, so no bars are displayed.  This feature can be implemented by <LabelList /> in 1.0+.

[Doc about LabelList](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/LabelList)

[Demo of ScatterChart labels](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/ScatterChartWithLabels)  @hyunwoona 

You can specify the `animationBegin` of `Bar` like the following:

```jsx
<BarChart 
  width={600} 
  height={300} 
  data={data}
  margin={{top: 20, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}
>
  <XAxis dataKey="name"/>
  <YAxis/>
  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3"/>
  <Tooltip/>
  <Legend />
  <Bar dataKey="pv" stackId="a" fill="#8884d8" animationBegin={400} animationDuration={400} animationEasing="linear" />
  <Bar dataKey="uv" stackId="a" fill="#82ca9d" animationBegin={0} animationDuration={400} animationEasing="linear" />
</BarChart>
```

[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/dhhqquke/)  Recharts has many issues about labels now:

#160 Simpler custom labels
#191 Label in center of PieChart
#472  "Total" bar label for stacked bar chart
#466  Rotated Axis labels

and the labels of components diffs very much now. Meanwhile, some simple features like rotate, location,  can only be implemented by customized labels.

So I try to refactor labels and create two new components: `Label`, `LabelList` (create an array of labels), then we can create labels like the following:

```jsx
  <Line>
    <LabelList position="bottom" /> 
  </Line>

  <XAxis>
    <Label angle={45} position="right">This is a label</Label>
  </XAxis>
```

Then the props `label` of `Line\Area|Bar...` will be removed.
Let me know if you have some different thoughts.

This feature has been released in 1.0.0-alpha.0  @super-cache-money How about add a props `formatter` which can be called format the values ? @super-cache-money  It's a new feature. @super-cache-money Sorry! It's a new feature that ought to be added!  @Eric24 Thanks! It's not a bug, I forgot to update the example. @Eric24 Yeah! You can specify the `label` of `Line` to be a object:

```jsx
const LABEL = { fill:"#82ca9d", stroke:false, fontSize:10, dy:-4 };

...
  <Line  label={LABEL} />
...
``` @Eric24 `Text` don't receive `dy` now. I'll fix it. Thanks!

Do you have any thoughts about new components `Label` and `LabelList` ?

[Discussion about Label and LabelList](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/522)  @Eric24 Both the `iconType` of `Legend` and `legendType` of `Area/Bar/Line` can specify corresponding `iconType` rendered by legend items.   @wkwiatek It's recommended to render labels inside the sectors.  @coreylenertz Thanks! It has been fixed.  @YangZhouChaoFan How about the version of recharts? Can you create a jsfiddle demo to reproduce your problem ? @YangZhouChaoFan OK! I'll send email to you.  @leggomymeggos I can't get what do you mean. `AreaChart` is only a normal react component. If `sd.shallowRender(<OurComponent />` return a fully rendered component, It should be the bug of `sd.shallowRender`, not the bug of `AreaChart`.  @gabrielfnogueira Recharts don't support this feature now.  @kennyx46 Please use the `label` props of `Bar` to render labels. [Here] is a demo.   @OlivierCo We have use `lodash-webpack-plugin` and `babel-plugin-lodash`. I think recharts only require the necessary files of `lodash`. You can check the `lib` of `recharts`.  @adearmas Yeah, customized components of some components, like label, shape, .etc, seems to be complex now. But it's a necessary part to implement complex charts, we'll try to simplify some simple styling. 

About your case, you can use an object to style the ticks:

```jsx
<XAxis dataKey="name" height={60} tick={{ angle: -35, textAnchor: 'end' }} />
```

And you can move the brush down by adjusting the `height` of `XAxis` which have default value 30.

[api of XAxis](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/XAxis)
[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/97oecp4k/2/)  @mvolkmann Please show more informations.  @sankalplakhina Thanks! I think we just need to use lodash.uniqueId to generate the unique id of `Pie`. @sankalplakhina How about add `uniqueId` in the utils of recharts ? I think the `id` is only a internal variable which should be unique in a single page, keep `clipPathId ` as prop is needless.  @sankalplakhina Thanks! I'll refactor this.  @ItsMrAkhil It seems that the imported `Bar` is `null`. Please check the `import` of `recharts`. @ItsMrAkhil Can you check the value of `Bar` ? Maybe you can use `console.log` to log the `Bar`. And how about the version of `recharts` ? @ItsMrAkhil Can you provide a simple github project to reproduce your problem ?  @ItsMrAkhil You can remove your private codes and create a very simple project.  I think this is not the problem of recharts. Please check the configuration of your project.  @oluckyman Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/6eawhfvr/)

When you specify the `domain` and [`tickCount`](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/cartesian/YAxis.js#L75) of  `YAxis`, we can't calculate evenly distributed ticks, so no `end` tick here.

@oluckyman You can check the [documentation of d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_ticks). @oluckyman You can change the `tickCount` of `YAxis`.  @alexanderwhatley You can create two `XAxis`.   @alexggordon I can't quite understand your demands now. Can you provide an example? @alexggordon 

If you want to group the ticks, you can use customized tick of `XAxis` like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/o0ag2nz3/);

And in your case, I think you can format the data and render the charts like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/zh3z3znq/).

<img width="591" alt="2017-02-28 2 28 20" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/23394108/33ed552c-fdc2-11e6-8670-9e88cb7ef8d2.png">  @matheusml You can change the `stroke`  of `Brush` like [this example](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/BrushBarChart). Or you can change the style of `Brush` by css.  @sonofjack  Maybe you can use customized shape of `Bar`.  @jlarso11  Can you submit a jsfiddle demo ? @jlarso11 You can specify `ticks` of `XAxis` to set the ticks. Or you can change `interval` of `XAxis`.  Maybe when the props `fill` of `Pie` is an array, we can use the fill the slices in order. But how about other props, like `stroke`, `strokeWidth`, .etc ? 

 @Eric24 Yeah, these components will pick up all the [presentation attributes](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/util/ReactUtils.js#L6). @Eric24 It seems a good idea!  @akonwi The `Line` was just too thin to be clicked. Please check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/wzpf21f1/).  @JoeRandom Don't support now.  Done in version 0.21.0  @gusdaud You can use `tick` of `XAxis` or `YAxis`  to render customized axis texts.   @Eric24 Yeah, you can use `ticks` to add customized ticks of an axis.   @liubko 

You can set the background color by specify `fill` of `CartesianGrid`:

```jsx
<CartesianGrid 
  strokeDasharray="3 3" 
  fill="green"
/>
```

[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/mbd91kf8/)
  @FrantisekGazo Thanks! Recharts won't support 3D charts.  @ZephD Title of charts diff very much, so no plan to implement this feature now.  @chipit24 It's welcome to submit PR in [recharts.org](https://github.com/recharts/recharts.org)  @cemremengu You should format the data. Or you can create 7 ScatterChart to create such charts. @cemremengu Check [this demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/BubbleChart).  @squll1 Yeah, of course.    Try the component [<LabelList />](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/LabelList).  You can modify icon by pass payload to Legend. Like the code below,
```
<Legend
  payload={
    [
      { id: 'pv', value: 'pppv', type: 'diamond', color: '#8884d8'},
      { id: 'uv', value: 'uuuv', type: 'diamond', color: '#82ca9d'},
    ]
   }
/>
```
http://jsfiddle.net/n8cysgrj/
 We offer some icons which you can use it by change `type` in payload.

`['line', 'square', 'rect', 'circle', 'cross', 'diamond','star', 'triangle', 'wye']` If you want to highly customized, I guess the best way is still to write your own icon by passing content.  Can you provide any code or case? Usually, you can just set props to Recharts components as svg component. ex. `<Line strokeWidth={2} />` It should works fine in AreaChart.
Maybe you can try to pass a prop `strokeWidth` to Area component like `<Area strokeWidth={10} />`.  If still not work, would you like to show me your code? I'll help you figure out it.
  @vaeum Which bug ?  Aha, nothing special :-)

 'amt' is abbr. of word 'amount'. You can definite any property name you like.  @Eric24 It's recommended to use `<Text />` to render label. ```jsx
<XAxis dataKey="name" angle={-45} textAnchor="end" />
```

@Eric24  Use the props angle and textAnchor in XAxis. The feature has been done in 1.0.0+.  recommend use npm and webpack to import or export charts.  @pioneer32 

When the bars are stacked, the minimum value of domain is 0 by default. But log(0)  is invalidate, so the bars disappear.

You should set the `domain` of `YAxis` like the following:

```jsx
<YAxis scale="log" domain={[0.01, 'auto']} allowDataOverflow />
```

[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/kca9npkg/117/)  @patryk0605 I found the problem in 0.20.3, so I try to fix it in 0.20.4. I can't reproduce the problem now. The problem seems to be caused when the [width and height of tooltip change](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/v0.20.4/src/component/Tooltip.js#L111) alternately very small in some cases.

<img width="971" alt="2017-01-17 11 38 58" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/22027928/63fc0bf0-dd10-11e6-8bab-1900fa6544fb.png">

So I [add a tolerance value](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/component/Tooltip.js#L113) to decide whether update the state of tooltip.

Please check again.
@patryk0605 @loris  Fixed in recharts@0.20.5.  Thanks! It's my fault. I forgot to check the compiled files in `lib` of `react-smooth`. I have fixed it. Please check.  Fixed in version 0.1.19 of react-smooth.  @xuerion You can bind event on `Bar` instead of `BarChart`.  `onMouseLeave` bound to `BarChart` is trigged when mouse leave the box of BarChart.  Fixed in 0.20.3.  @AyushSharma91190 IE11 don't support the transform of svg elements. So no animation in IE11.  @cambwang You can use a [`ResponsiveContainer`](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/ResponsiveContainer) to wrapper the chart component.   @OracPrime Thanks! How about the eslint errors?  @chin-idean 

You can use [`transform` of tick](http://jsfiddle.net/e6r4bxf5/) or [customized tick](http://jsfiddle.net/yhp9esbs/).  @GregPhyn When we have just one value, only one point can be displayed.  @GregoryPotdevin Not yet.  Fixed in version 0.22.0  @OracPrime Can you submit a PR ? We have no windows computer... Fixed in 0.20.3.  The events of AreaChart and LinChart are implemented in the [generateCategoricalChart](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L997). @GregPhyn I mean, If touch events can work in LineChart, then touch events must work in AreaChart too, because both `LineChart` and `AreaChart` are generated by a high order component. As you can see in the [code of generateCategoricalChart](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L997), we have bound `touchmove` event in the charts.  [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/j6n54k0r/)

@patryk0605 You can specify the color of text by `label={{ fill: '#fff' }}`.  @kenchengch Can you submit a pr ? Duplicated with #290   @peterhadlaw Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? @loris @peterhadlaw Add props `allowDataOverflow` in `YAxis`, and update to version 0.20.3.

[api](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/YAxis)
[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/ze8c333g/21/)
  @mmmdreg Thanks! Great suggestion!  @mmmdreg  How about this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/k971to6h/) ?   @OracPrime Which chart ?  @with0out You can use customized `tick` like this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/dpvqmgf2/).  @billcreative @ZephD Some bug happens in `Tooltip`, so that `sAnimationActive={false}` didn't work before. And I remove `<Animate>` in `Tooltip`, just [update style to animate the tooltip](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/component/Tooltip.js#L167). 

[demo](https://jsfiddle.net/un16cwkd/4/)  @raviteja83 You can update margin of chart and adjust the width of `YAxis`, height of `XAxis`.  I'll try to optimize problem 1.
But problem 2 seems very strange. what's the purple block?

And If problem 2 only happens in development environment, you can try to remove hot-loader and check whether this problem can be reproduced. @radarhere Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? @radarhere Yeah! sorry... I think problem 1 has been fixed. About problem 2, let me know if you can reproduce it in an online demo.   @francescabassi I think it has been fixed in version 0.20.2.  @giuseppepaul  

You can use `interval={0}` to force all the ticks to be shown. By default, we'll calculate the width of tick and hide some ticks when no enough space. But the calculation may be inaccurate in some cases. We'll try to fix it.

```jsx
<XAxis interval={0} />
```  @atompie It works in this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/r8tr87zh/).  Maybe strokeWidth={2} is still too thin to be clicked ?   @raviteja83 I think it was covered by [parent component](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L925).

How about your use case ?  @guybensh By default, we use width and height to create viewbox ([related code](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/container/Surface.js)).  @geoffreyvd 
Of course.  But you should format the data first, and get the formatted data like the following :

```js
const formattedData = [
  { "data_time": '2016-08-12 10:22:04', 'timestamp': +(new Date('2016-08-12 10:22:04')),  '1_value': 43,}
  { "data_time": '2016-08-12 08:49:04', 'timestamp': +(new Date('2016-08-12 08:49:04')),  '2_value': 14,}
  { "data_time": '2016-08-12 07:44:04', 'timestamp': +(new Date('2016-08-12 07:44:04')),  '2_value': 14,}
];
```
And meanwhile you should get an array of channel_ids like `const channelIds = ['1', '2']`. Then you can create the chart:

```jsx
<LineChart data={formattedData} layout="vertical">
  <XAxis type="number"  />
  <YAxis dataKey="timestamp" type="number" />
  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3"/>
  <Tooltip/>
  <Legend />
  {
    channelIds.map((id) => {
      return (<Line key={`line_${id}`} dataKey={`${id}_value`} />)
    })
  }
</LineChart>
```
 @FJunior225 Yeah. Of course.  [API for LineChart](http://recharts.org/api#LineChart)
[API for ResponsiveContainer](http://recharts.org/api#ResponsiveContainer)

Please check the api of `LineChart`, `LineChart` can't parse percentage `width`.
If you want to use a percentage `width`, please wrapper `LineChart` with `ResponsiveContainer`.

I'll try to enhance the getting started guide. Meanwhile, PR is welcome. You can submit PR in [recharts/recharts.org](https://github.com/recharts/recharts.org). @geoffdavis92 Please check your configuration. You props does not meet he PropTypes of `LineChart`.

[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/n8y3e0ko/1/)  @10n6 How about the version of recharts ? @10n6 The latest version is 0.19.1. @10n6 Can you create a demo in jsfiddle ?  @belgac Do you mean to update the `stroke` of the whole line? or just a part of the line? @belgac Recharts support linear gradient too, maybe you can try create a linear gradient dynamically and use the gradient to stroke the `Line`.

[Here](http://recharts.org/api) is a demo of linear gradient.  @belgac  OK! Thanks for your demo! I'll add it to recharts.org.  @konstantin24121 It's a good suggestion to add throttle delay.  Maybe you can submit a pr ?

And I have a  thought now. The events to show and update tooltip change the state frequently which will also update other unchanged components, like `Legend`, `XAxis`, etc.  If the state about tooltip events could be managed in `eventCenter` of recharts not in `state`, only tooltip will update when mousemove event is triggered. <img width="850" alt="2016-12-21 11 04 20" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/21376365/4cccda56-c76f-11e6-8da9-1b83326ec53a.png">

I try to add `throttleDelay`, but I can't get `event.pageX` every time even I have used `event. persist()`.

[Related issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7778)   @matthewberkompas It's a workaround to set the `domain` of `YAxis` like the following:

```jsx
  <YAxis domain={[0, 'dataMax + 600']} />
```

You can also check the api of [`domain`](http://recharts.org/api#YAxis) and [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/3gdz149g/).

Meanwhile I'll try to optimize this case. Thoughts and suggestions are welcome.
  @ZephD Yeah, the brush will be updated to default props when chart receives a new props. Can you create a demo about your case ?  @squll1  

```jsx
  <Pie stroke="none" fill="red" />
   
   <Pie stroke="none" fill="red">
      <Cell fill="red" />
      <Cell fill="green" />
      <Cell fill="blue" /> 
   </Pie>
```

Just like svg elements. You can change the color of `Pie` by changing the `fill` of `Pie` or `Cell`.

[demo](http://recharts.org/examples#PieChartWithCustomizedLabel)  @McMenemy  Thanks!

I have two kinds of thoughts about ErrorBar and candlestick chart now.

1. Add a new component `ErrorBar`, and it should be the child of `Line`, `Area`, `Scatter`, `Bar`, etc.So we can add error bars like the following:

```jsx
  <Line dataKey="pv">
    <ErrorBar dataKey="pvError"  />
  </Line>

  <Scatter data={[...]}>
    <ErrorBar dataKey="pvError"  />
  </Scatter>
```
2.The new component `ErrorBar` should be the child of `LineChart`, `AreaChart`, etc. Something link the error bar of [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/error-bar). So we just need add ErrorBar like the following:

```jsx
  <LineChart >
    <Line dataKey="a" />
    <ErrorBar dataKey="aError" />
  </LineChart>

  <ScatterChart>
    <ErrorBar dataKey="pvError"  />
  </ScatterChart>
```

And I also want to know whether the value of an error bar will  be an interval like the demo of highcharts?
  @RoarkeRandall Thanks! It should be fixed.  @matheusml By default, we'll hide some ticks of `XAxis` when no enough space. 

[related code](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/cartesian/CartesianAxis.js#L74)

If you want to show all the ticks, you can set the props `interval` of `XAxis` to be `0`.  @batjko You can change the value of  `XAxis`'s props `height` which have default value 30.  @southnan0 How about the version of recharts ? And do you use `babel-plugin-recharts` ? @southnan0 I think the version of `babel-plugin-recharts` is out of date.  You should update the version of `babel-plugin-recharts` to `1.1.0`. @vaeum Recharts have imported polyfills too.  [polyfill](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/index.js#L1)  @southnan0  No. Because recharts works well in IE10, IE11, and we have imported necessary polyfills. @southnan0 OK! You can use `babel-plugin-recharts` too.  @matthewberkompas You can return null when the width of bar is smaller than a specified number. @matthewberkompas Yeah! Just like your demo.  @ZephD It's recommended to add a `ReferenceLine` like this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/b1Lb3kuk/). @ZephD It works well in my broswer.

![refline](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/21211210/9ac465ec-c2bc-11e6-91f5-5e39f1d44a42.gif)
 @ZephD Every time you update the wrapper component of `LineChart`, the children instances of `LineChart` will change. Maybe this's the reason for your case. But in your first description, you mean to click another `table` to interact width `LineChart`, so I don't know why the `tooltip` will hide and show. 

Maybe you can create another jsfiddle demo to show your problem. I'm not sure I have got your problem correctly.
  @ZephD Why set `curSelected` to be `null` ?

It seems `setState` in `onMouseOver` trigger  update of component, so  `componentWillReceiveProps` is  called to update state to be default state. Then no tooltip will display. @ZephD Every time we update the state, the reference of children changes. So I'll refactor the comparison of children in [generateCategoricalChart.js#L93](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L93). This's also the reason of #401 . 

It's recommended to not bind `onMouseMove` in `LineChart` to update `ReferenceLine`, this action is conflict with tooltip. @ZephD I understand your demands now. You can wait for updating of recharts, I have done some optimization.  And a workaround is to add two state, one state to show `ReferenceLine` when hover the map and another state to show `marker` when hover the chart. @ZephD Can you check the latest version ?
 @ZephD Check the latest [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/b1Lb3kuk/12/). I just use a variable `margin` and `activeDot` to keep the static value of margin and activeDot. you know, every time you change the state, a new margin and a activeDot will be parsed to `LineChart`, then the `shallowEqual` of two children will return `false`.

Maybe you can check this [article](https://medium.com/@esamatti/react-js-pure-render-performance-anti-pattern-fb88c101332f#.p7fc9cflz) for detail.  @briice It seems strange to add `className` in  `data`.  @vaeum You can bind `onMouseEnter` to `Bar` like this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/5dtmswmc/). @vaeum If you have two or more `Bar`, It's recommended to use customized `Tooltip`. If You just have one `Bar`, customized `label` can meet your needs.  @VanDavv How about the version of recharts ? Live example or a simple project is required to reproduce your problem.  @ilanus Can you create a simple online example ? It seems you have added two `Bar`, so two groups of labels are rendered.  I'll reopen it if demo is submited.  @matthewberkompas  Now you can center the labels of `Bar` like this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/wa87o60f/3/).
But the callback parameters of `label` seems strange now,  the `width` and `height` are width and height of `rectangle` in `Bar`, the `x` and `y` is the coordinate of `label` .  @McMenemy Thanks! I'll close this pr temporarily.  @tarrencev Thanks! We'll think about this feature. I think it's easy to allow the `dataKey` to receive nested key like `'a.b.c'` now. @tarrencev Nested keys means that we can get data in such case:

```js
  [{ today: { a: 1, b: 2 }, yesterday: { c: 1, d: 2 }, }]
```

by dataKey `'today.a'` or `'yeterday.d'`.

Anyway, I'll refactor recharts to allow the `dataKey` be a simple string, a nested string  or a map function.

 @tarrencev I think the developers should make sure that the `dataKey` can be used to map the correct values. We just provide three options to make it's more flexible to specify the values.  Do you agree?  @bali182 Yeah, I know it's not semantical to call a function as `dataKey`. But I want to use unified props for such case( add data in `LineChart` and specify a attribute in `Line`). Something just like [d3-shape stack](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#stack_keys),  we can specify strings as keys or accessor functions as keys too.

Meanwhile I want to support series-like data too which will bring another props too... 
  @jlubeck This kind of pie animation can be done by customized `shape` of `Pie`. Here is a [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/fvcc6m14/).   @ashutoshjha1409   Do you mean different event for each `Rectangle` in the `Bar` ? @ashutoshjha1409 When you bind click event on `Bar`, you can get the payload of each `Rectangle` when you click it. It means that the event of `Bar` is  actually binded in each `Rectangle` of `Bar`. 

Please check [this demo](http://recharts.org/examples#BarChartWithCustomizedEvent). Ok!  @vyachekg Thanks! I'll fix it.  @patryk0605 Events  are not supported in `XAxis` and `YAxis`. It'll be done in next version.  @bmamouri Are you using recharts in server-side-render ? @bmamouri How about the version of recharts ? @bmamouri  It seems `isSSR` return `false` in SSR.  @matthewberkompas For simple style change, you can use css. But for transform, you can use customized events like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/fwh9Lmg3/).  @matthewberkompas  You only need to add some css like the following:

```
.recharts-bar .recharts-bar-rectangle .recharts-rectangle:hover {
  fill: red;
}
```
[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/fwh9Lmg3/16/) @matthewberkompas In such case, you should use customized events, It can't be done only by css.
In your demo, you only need to add `fill` in `Rectangle`.

```jsx
<Rectangle {...others} x={x - 2} width={width + 4} y={y - sign * 2} height={height + sign * 2} fill="red" />
```

[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/wa87o60f/2/)  @Eric24 Yeah, we're refactoring animation.   @peterwillis Thanks! We'll add more information in README.  OK  Yeah, some bug happens when calculate the height of `Legend`.  @gartz `isSsr` is called at many places. It's strange to initialize this function. Any suggestion for safe `isSsr` ?  How about

```
export const isSsr = () => !(window && window.document && window.document.getElementById);
```  @nilyang Recharts don't support box-plot now.  @Eric24 Can you give a detail example about how to control the content in payload?  Whatever, It's hard for *recharts* to meets all the needs, so customized `content` is needed. @Eric24 Maybe we can export `DefaultTooltipContent` and `DefaultLegendContent`, then you can do the filter yourself, and use `DefaultTooltipContent` and `DefaultLegendContent` to render tooltip and legend. @Eric24 Any suggestion for the props name ?  @Eric24 

You can specify the `scale` of `XAxis` to be `point`( the default scale is `band` )  which'll use scalePoint of [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale).  

```jsx
<ComposedChart 
  width={600} 
  height={400} 
  data={data}
  margin={{top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20}}
>
  <XAxis dataKey="name" scale="point" />
  <YAxis />
  <Tooltip/>
  <Legend/>
  <CartesianGrid stroke='#f5f5f5'/>
  <Area type='monotone' dataKey='amt' fill='#8884d8' stroke='#8884d8'/>
   <Line type='monotone' dataKey='uv' stroke='#ff7300'/>
</ComposedChart>
```

Then the margin will be eliminated. @Eric24 

About question a:
  When the `XAxis` of `ComposedChart` is numerical axis, the scale of `XAxis` is linear scale, no extra space for *bars* will produce. 

About question b:
 What kind of `bars` are not rendered? I create a [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/z3wx6zm3/), it works fine even when I have `Bar` in the composed chart.

So would you please create an online demo?   @supersteves We need more performance data. `className` is absolutely no problem for normal data. For huge size data, we'll do more optimization to omit some nodes,  not just remove `className`.  @krispyp You can add `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`, `onMouseMove`, `onClick` in `LineChart` (or `BarChart`, `AreaChart`, `ComposedChart`), and you'll get `chartX`, `chartY` in callback.  @akvanhar I think this has been fixed in version 0.20.0. Please check it!  @earthinferno Yeah, of course. But no good solution now. Yeah! It should be removed.  @AshworthHub The  `payload` in some charts diffs, so I unify the `payload` to be the original `data` or `entry`. Can you support your case more detail ?  Yeah, the `activePayload` is the `entry` that your mouse in. So I can't get what's the problem ?  @MythlinMasterdo Can you create a simple demo in jsfiddle?  @huozhi In  CSR, we'll calculate the width / height of ticks, and adjust the position of tick If no enough space to display the whole tick. But this calculation can't be done in SSR. @huozhi Temporarily no better way, unless all the components can be implemented by svg elements. Now `Tooltip` and  `Legend` are implemented by html. We'll discuss this question. Thanks.  @truenorthcreative You can fork recharts in github, add create a PR. PR is welcome.  @jlubeck You can specify `formatter` for each `Line`, and the formatter will be used to format value in `Tooltip` like this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/s0kne60e/).  @komplexb Thanks for great advice. It's a workaround to add a `ZAxis` to parse additional information. And I intend to add more information in [payload of Tooltip](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/ScatterChart.js#L231). @komplexb You can get more `props` in `CustomTooltip` without `ZAxis`. Maybe you can console `props` to see detail.  @supersteves  
I arrange your issues:

## A rectangle is rendered for each value of a stacked bar

 Each stacked bar may have different attributes, so we need a node for each value.  I wonder how to colour the rectangle when only draw a single rectangle for all the stacked value ?

##  Render `<Animate>` for empty value

It'll be fixed.

##  Duplicated `Animate` in  `Rectangle`

It's a customized animation of Rectangle, the two `Animation` have different animation attribute.
Check the [code](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/shape/Rectangle.js#L130) for detail.

##  Render `<Animate>` even when `isAnimationActive` is `false`

When `isAnimationActive` is false, `Animate` just return the children ([related code](https://github.com/recharts/react-smooth/blob/master/src/Animate.js#L305)). 
Though I think the performance is ok,  It'll be fixed in the next version. @supersteves Do you mean that the calculation (done by [`getStackGroupsByAxisId`](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/util/CartesianUtils.js#L98)) is inefficient when each `Bar` has unique `stackId`?

It's recommended to remove `stackId` in such case, because no bars need to be stacked.

And the stack will effect the domain of `YAxis`, so *stack* must done before *bars*.  @supersteves 
Thanks.  It seems strange in your demo, I'll think about your case.

And I'll try to remove some needless nodes (like g), still more optimization need to done for large amount of data.  @amnsss Tooltip does have a props `itemSorter` to support sorting payload. But It was missed in document, 😭. I'll update the document. Thanks!
 @amnsss  Done!
  @mwolson Thanks! It'll be fixed in the next version.
  @clementdevos  You can set the `domain` of `YAxis` to be `[0, 3800]`.  
[document of YAxis](http://recharts.org/api#YAxis)
 @clementdevos Maybe there is some bug about `undefined`, I'll check it.
  Duplicated with #267 .
  @godmar Thanks! We're trying to refactor animation.
 The feature has been done in 1.0.0+  @Moeface You should use svg React components, and svg elements can support link too. 

[svg link](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/linking.html)

And dataKey should be a string or a number. I don't know why you want to pass an object to the `dataKey`.
I create a simple [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/vLspjuo2/) of svg linking. You can check whether your demand can be filled.
 @Moeface As you know,html elements can't be rendered in the svg elements, so we can't support non-SVG component.  
 @Moeface In your case, you can pass `href` of button and `url` of image in the `data`, and add a customized `tick` of `XAxis` which can get the original data to display what you need.  @PeteAshworth The label of `RadialBar` was missed.
 @AshworthHub Thanks!  `Text` only show when `x` and `y` are number in 19.0. I should fix it.  @FabioFleitas When the data is empty, we have no information to show in the chart. When the data is not empty, we can show a empty chart like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/qh81naqm/).
 @FabioFleitas Only when you specify the `dataKey` of `YAxis` like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/qh81naqm/1/).
Otherwise `YAxis` doesn't know what to show, or just some fixed numbers.
  @RoarkeRandall `Line`, `Area`, `Bar`, `Scatter` , etc, have a props `name`, If you have specified props `name`, the `name` will be used to display in `Legend` and `Tooltip`.

  @elnygren 

I try to create a jsfiddle [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/32ekyL48/) similar to your demo. And switch different datas quickly, it never crash in chrome. Can you try ?
 Yeah, jsfiddle is the simplest environment. I use it to confirm whether the crash  happens online.

And I found it's really strange. I clone your project and run it, chrome crash every time when I click _Daily_. But after I restart my mac, the crash never happen. 
 @elnygren It's hard to find the real reason. 
 @elnygren I find that my chrome was updated to the version 54.0.2840.98 (64-bit) after restart my mac. Maybe some bug of old chrome cause the crash.
  @sdoomz It needs to be discussed whether to update state when data is updated.  @matthewberkompas You do it right.
  @git-toni Check the jsfiddle [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/x1yoboc7/48/) for detail. You should reference 
 some others js files.

  @ottos13 How about your version of recharts ?
 @ottos13 version 0.17.1  has fixed this problem.
  thank you for @nwhitmont . It's true that the website will down 48h.
you could pull down the code from recharts/recharts.org, and `npm install`, the `npm run start`. That will start the local host.
 Fixed.
  @vaeum 

You can check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/tbs7f59s/) for detail.
  @FabioFleitas Such empty message could be very different. So It's recommended to write the message yourself, because you can judge whether the data is empty. 
 @FabioFleitas  The problem is that nothing can be rendered.
  @kadariyp You can check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/rsy7fva9/) for solution.

Meanwhile it's recommended to create a jsfiddle demo when you meet some problem. 😀
  @colshacol This is duplicated with #249 .
  @patryk0605 `onClick` on `ComposedChart` can be triggered on the _band_ of bar. But it seems some bug happens here, the event will be triggered twice. I'll fix it soon. Please check [this demo](https://jsfiddle.net/xbwwwxfw/). 
  @skullcrasher Thank you for great advice. we'll try to implement this feature.
  @vanthiyathevan Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? I don't know how to reproduce this problem now.
 I think this issue has been fixed. Please check the latest version.  @patryk0605  Legend support onClick, onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave in version 0.18.0 now.
  Fixed in version 0.17.1.
  @patryk0605 Thanks! It'll be fixed soon.
 Fixed in version 0.17.1.
 @nick-barth Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? I can't reproduce this warning.
  @Mannaio The coordinate of dots are calculated in [LineChart](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/LineChart.js#L35). In brief, we would calculate the scale function of x-axis and y-axis first, then calculate the coordinate by scale function.
  @matthewberkompas Can you create a jsfiddle demo ?
  Fixed in version 0.16.1. 
  @doublelduob Can you give an example of your chart ?  Same to [#190](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/190) ?
  @alexanderatallah Thank you! I should add some options in LodashModuleReplacementPlugin.

[lodash-webpack-plugin #9](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-webpack-plugin/issues/9)
  @pcmaffey I think this problem has been fixed in the latest version of React-Smooth, and version 0.16.0  has used the latest React-Smooth.
  @sdevidi  Fixed in version 0.17.1. But some middle ticks may be hidden. Do you have any suggestion about this behavior ?
  @alelepd  
Maybe we can add a new chart to display a single percentage. 
  I'm sorry.
I already publish 0.15.3. Our work is very busy recently.
  @sighrobot  Brush can only work with `LineChart`, `AreaChart`, `BarChart` and `ComposedChart`. Because `ScatterChart` can have several `Scatter`, and the length of `Scatter` diffs. 
  Done in version 0.18.0.

  @truenorthcreative  Can you give an online example ?
 @truenorthcreative Can you support online demo? Your problem can't be reproduced.     @MohammedJaffar You can set 

``` jsx
<XAxis interval={0} />
```

to show all the ticks.
  @excitement-engineer Please see [#172](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/172) for detail.
    @huozhi It's a good idea, we'll try to refactor these components. Meanwhile PR is welcome.
  @sdoomz CartesianGrid only render some lines now. So the props `fill` can the grid of  `CartesianGrid`.

And would you like to fill all the grid by `red`?
 OK! It'll be a feature in the next version.
  @raspo It's strange to add `onClick` event in `Tooltip`, but  bind event handler in Chart.
 @raspo How about add a props `triggerEvent` in `Tooltip` ?
 @raspo I mean add a props `triggerEventType` which can be 'hover', 'click', and the default value is 'hover'.
  @abpai  The `onChange` of Brush is overwrote by internal event handler in [generateCategoricalChart](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L726). Maybe we should refactor  generateCategoricalChart to not simply overwrite.
  @sdoomz 

For your questions:
1. Tooltip is triggered by mouse event now, may be you can use other method to display the new data, for example an `position: absolute;` div or a customized label of `Area`.
2. Temporarily no idea.

3.D3 use path animation to switch path, I have no idea how to add path transition animation when path update now.
 @sdoomz Thanks for great suggestions! We'll try to implement this functionality, maybe through a wrapper component.   
 @akvanhar Yeah, We're trying to refactor the animation part. But it may take some time.
 OK! Both PR and suggestions are welcome. @akvanhar  
  @digorydoo Recharts has added component `ReferenceArea` in version 0.13.4. But the documentation  is backward. I'll update the documentation of  `ReferenceArea`.

You can use `ReferenceArea` like the following:

``` jsx
<ScatterChart width={400} height={400} margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 0, left: 20 }}>
   ....         
   <ReferenceArea x1={250} x2={300} alwaysShow />
 </ScatterChart>
```

``` jsx
<ScatterChart width={400} height={400} margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 0, left: 20 }}>
   ....         
   <ReferenceArea y1={250} y2={300} alwaysShow />
 </ScatterChart>
```

``` jsx
<ScatterChart width={400} height={400} margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 0, left: 20 }}>
   ....         
   <ReferenceArea x1={0} x2={100} y1={250} y2={300} alwaysShow />
 </ScatterChart>
```
 [Here](http://recharts.org/api#ReferenceArea) is the api of `ReferenceArea`.
  Thanks to @billneff79. This has been fixed in version 0.16.0.
  @tomsue This is duplicated with [#249](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/249). 
  @billneff79 Thanks for your contribution. It's really awesome. I'll review all the commits an soon as possible. 
 @billneff79 Thank you for your contribution. It's really awesome.👍  We'll consider about your commits in your master.
  I think we should support different scale functions of axis, like timeScale, logScale, etc, just similarly to [issue#305](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/305).

So I'll close this issue temporarily. 
  When the `label` is a react element, we have no idea to check whether the element is a svg node or a dom node. Do you have any idea? 
  @10n6 You can set the domain of `YAxis`  to be `['dataMin', 'dataMax']` which have default value `[0,`auto`]`.

[Here](http://recharts.org/api#YAxis) is the document of YAxis.
  @McMenemy What kind of error bars ? How about [ReferenceLine](http://recharts.org/api#ReferenceLine) ?
 @Eric24 Yeah, error bars and Candlestick chart are very similar. I have two kinds of thoughts about ErrorBar and candlestick chart now.

Add a new component ErrorBar, and it should be the child of Line, Area, Scatter, Bar, etc.So we can add error bars like the following:
```jsx
  <Line dataKey="pv">
    <ErrorBar dataKey="pvError"  />
  </Line>

  <Scatter data={[...]}>
    <ErrorBar dataKey="pvError"  />
  </Scatter>
```
2.The new component ErrorBar should be the child of LineChart, AreaChart, etc. Something link the error bar of highcharts. So we just need add ErrorBar like the following:

```jsx
  <LineChart >
    <Line dataKey="a" />
    <ErrorBar dataKey="aError" />
  </LineChart>

  <ScatterChart>
    <ErrorBar dataKey="pvError"  />
  </ScatterChart>
```
And I also want to know whether the value of an error bar will be an interval like the demo of highcharts?


@McMenemy @Eric24 @jzillmann Any thoughts?  @patryk0605 `unit` is only used to render `Tooltip` now.
 `label` of `XAxis` just display the content you passed to. 
 @patryk0605 Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? 
 @patryk0605  Maybe you can change the position of label to insure the label to be showed.
  @RobiFerentz How about the version of chrome ?
 Ok! 
 @rogeliog I can't reproduce the crash in both local examples and online examples. My chrome is 54.0.2840.71 (64-bit) (OSX). Do you have any idea to reproduce the crash ? 
 @elnygren I want to confirm if the crash only happens in your local development mode ? I create a [jsfiddle demo](http://jsfiddle.net/jnz2pvze/)  which render a large number of points. But it never crash.
 @elnygren My chrome crashed sometimes in my local development mode yesterday. So I deleted `--hot` of webpack, chrome never crashed then.  I doubt the crash may cause by the hot updating of webpack.
 @konstantin24121 @magalhini I found several [memery leak](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/1724) issues of webpack. For the crash problem, we can remove hot component of webpack temporarily, and wait for webpack developers to fix it.
 @konstantin24121 Yeah, looking forward to stable webpack 2.x.
  @jozsi It's a good idea to dynamically set the maxListeners. And I wonder how many synchronized charts you created in a page ?
 @jozsi So, many charts in a single page?
 😀 OK! I'll fix this. And only add listener when the chart has props `syncId` which means to be synchronized with some other charts.
  @morajabi Can you support a jsfiddle demo ?
 @morajabi The demo you created seems no problem.
  @email2vimalraj You can check this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/ez3x3z4k/). It just show the actual y axis value by default. What's the problem?
  @weita0  Can you describe detail what kind of event do you want to bind to LineChart? 
 @Hectorhammett Could you submit a PR? Then I can check the changes of your code much clearer.  
  @cephirothdy2j As mentioned in [#223](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/223). In your case, do you want to cut the lines inner the coordinate system?
  Done in version 0.15.0
  @tobia  If just so, the height of chart may exceed the boundary of container node.
 @nickpalmer Any thoughts?
 Yeah, In most case, we just want the height to fit the width.
  @kujon 

<img width="459" alt="2016-09-23 8 09 09" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/18785279/f2ae7c86-81c9-11e6-8af4-b7ddc24089e9.png">

Some bug happens for active dot of LineChart.
 @kujon Thanks for your advice. 
In the beginning, we want users to pass data in `LineChart` not `Line`, because we often get a table like data from server side. we would use one column to display `XAxis`, some other column to display a line or a bar.  
But in your case, LineChart seems very hard to use. So I check HightChart for some ideas. I found HightChart support two kind of  data([series data](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/line-basic),  [table data](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/line-ajax)). Maybe recharts should support two kind of data too, but the implementation is to be determined.
 And on this issue, It seems to be gimmicky. May be we can support both XAxis and YAxis to be numerical axis in LineChart, BarChart, and AreaChart.
  @tobia The `onClick` event of `Pie` works. But It will be overwrote by `onClick` of `PieChart`. So It seems strange now. 
  @10n6 It's a bug of react-container-dimensions. I have create an [issue](https://github.com/okonet/react-container-dimensions/issues/7) in react-container-dimensions.
 We use `react-resize-detector` to refactor ResponsiveContainer. I think this has been fixed.
  @squll1 Can you support a  jsfiddle example ?
 @squll1 It turn out  to be the grammar of ES6.

In your example, you return a object by `{}`.

``` jsx
barData.map((entry, index) => {
    <Cell cursor="pointer" fill="#5672ca" stroke="#ff0000" strokeWidth={4} key={`cell-${index}`}/>
})
```

It can be fixed by replace `{}` by `()`;

``` jsx
barData.map((entry, index) => (
    <Cell cursor="pointer" fill="#5672ca" stroke="#ff0000" strokeWidth={4} key={`cell-${index}`} label/>
))
```
 OK!
  @HashDot How about the data you received from server? And can you support your code about Recharts ?
 @HashDot 

I copy your code and create a [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/10gthLf1/), it works.
Maybe you can check the following points:
1. The data received by LineChart is empty ?
2. The entry of data has attributes "max" and "usage" ?
3. What are the values of `text`, `green`, `red` ?
 @HashDot Sorry! I have no idea. I have used Recharts to render live data, It works. 
Do you get some logs in console ?
Or can you create a repo with your problem easily reproducible?
 @HashDot OK! it'll be helpful.
  @neagle Do you mean to remove the 'line' of bar?
  @UnsungHero97 [Here](http://jsfiddle.net/quaph8w8/) is a demo of PercentBarChart. When you set the props `stackOffset="expand"`, `YAxis` will receive a percentage value.
  @techniq Sorry! Too busy these days! I should take more time to review your code!

You can check [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html) for all the styling properties of svg elements.  svg elements don't support `verticalAnchor` and `lineHeight`. 
 @techniq It should be implemented by calculating `x` and `y` attributes of `text`.

And I think `Text` should not replace all the `text` in recharts now, because the computation of text width and height would cost much.
 @techniq  
Sorry. I just have a quick look at your code. I need more time to review every lines of your code.
I feel very tangled about the CSS2 styling  props of Texts, `verticalAnchor`, `lineHeight`. All the props of recharts' components are svg styling props, and the CSS2 styling props can only be added  by the props `style`. I worry that other developers of recharts will be confused.

So I prefer `Text` is a optional component to render labels, not a internal used component.
How about your opinion ?
 @techniq Thanks! 

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/18668718/97863bb2-7f69-11e6-95f9-9cf7617d3516.png)

The test 

``` jsx
  it('Wraps long text if styled and not enough room', () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(
      <Text width={200} style={{ fontSize: '32px' }}>This is really long text</Text>
    );

    expect(wrapper.instance().state.wordsByLines.length).to.equal(2);
  });
```

result in 3 lines when the font-family is set to be "Courier". May be you can set the fontFamily of `Text` in the test case to be a very widely used one.
 @techniq Thanks! I'll try to finish today!
  @digorydoo The default margin of ScatterChart is 5.

[ScatterChart.js#L56](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/ScatterChart.js#L56)

``` js
  static defaultProps = {
    style: {},
    margin: { top: 5, right: 5, bottom: 5, left: 5 },
  };
```

Any suggestion?
  @Moeface Can you support a jsfiddle demo ?
 The image doesn't display because the we calculate the width of each tick to decide whether the tick will displayed.  Because the width of the first companyUrl is too large, so this tick is hidden. So you can set the props `interval` to be 0 to force all the ticks showed.

``` jsx
 <XAxis dataKey="companyUrl" interval={0} tick={<CustomXAxisLabel/>} />
```
  Duplicated with [#198](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/198).
  @kaiser-naren 
Recharts doesn't have any plan to support heatmap, maybe you can find some other libraries like [heatmap.js](https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/).
  @digorydoo 

 You can set the props `isAnimationActive` of  [Area](http://recharts.org/api#Area), [Bar](http://recharts.org/api#Bar), [Line](http://recharts.org/api#Line), [Scatter](http://recharts.org/api#Scatter), [Pie](http://recharts.org/api#Pie), [Radar](http://recharts.org/api#Radar), [RadialBar](http://recharts.org/api#RadialBar) to be `false`.
 @digorydoo In some case, there are two lines in a LineChart, maybe we want one of the lines can animate, and disable the animation of another line. So we think the animation is related the the graphical element. 
  @susanafcosta Can you give an example ?
 @susanafcosta Because we set some default  values of`fill` and `stroke` in `Scatter`, `Symbol` and some other components, so the style you set in css can't be applied to the dots. It's recommended to set such props, like `fill`, `stroke` and so on, in attributes just like svg element.

``` jsx
<Scatter stroke="rgb(0, 157, 249)" strokeWidth={1} fillOpacity={0.25} fill="rgb(0, 157, 249)" />
```

Meanwhile I should remove some needless default props to make overwriting style much easier.
See #210 for more discussion.
 @Rainethief `tickSize` and `tick` work fine. Do you have any demos ?
  @SachaG You can set the `barSize` of `Bar` to be a fixed value.
 Yeah. ResponsiveContainer can't do this now, because ResponsiveContainer don't know anything about the data. Do you have any idea about how to adapt to the length of data ? A workaround is to update the value of height by the length of data in your code.
  Yeah, the default width of `YAxis` is 60, you can change this value. 
  @harshjv Can your problem fixed by setting a aspect (mentioned in [#135](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/135)) or minHeight, minWidth of container?
 OK! 
  @squll1 Sorry! `gridCount` is deprecated. I'll update the documentation.
  @amay 😭 I can't reproduce this bug.
 OK! Thank you!
 @amay Thank you! Maybe we should remove span cache.
  @cephirothdy2j Maybe we can add a props like `domainAccommodate` to decide whether to tweak the domain or not. Do you have some suggestion about the name of this props?
 @cephirothdy2j I want to know which kind of display do you want when some points is beyond the min or the max value of domain.
1. May display part of the outside point
   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/18427561/9694d7f0-78fb-11e6-9f02-1d37f201e3d8.png)
2. cut the outside point directly
   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/18427752/a786cdd8-78fc-11e6-99a6-934100a672d0.png)
 Fixed in version 0.14.1.
  @jochenberger In such case, you can add some click or hover event on the Pie, and display the content in customized divs or svgs.
[Here](http://recharts.org/examples/#BarChartWithCustomizedEvent) is an example of BarChart. 
 @jochenberger Yeah, Thank you!
  @avenger-teamave Can you give an online example ?
 Fixed in version 0.17.1.
  @jochenberger You should format the value yourself, because the format of percent can be very different.
 @jochenberger I thought the percentage `50%` equals to the decimal `0.5`, and decimal is much simpler to format. So I return the decimal.
  @oande Only when the areas have the same stackId and yAxisId, these areas can be stacked.  Because different yAxisIds  indicate that these areas have different dimensions, there is no any sense to the sum the values of these areas.
 @oande Sorry! It's a bug of stacked chart. 
  @supersteves  You can create 2 tier ticks by customized `tick`  in `XAxis`.

[Here](http://recharts.org/examples/#CustomizedLabelLineChart) is a demo of customized tick.
  @reggie3 Can you give an jsfiddle example? You can check [#135](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/135) for some discussion of ResponsiveContainer.
  @SachaG Temporarily no simpler solution.
  @SachaG  You can set the style of Legend by overwriting the default style. 
 @SachaG We use inline style to style the legend, and the style is most general supported. I don't know the problem of inline style we used now. Can you give a more clear example ?
 CSS-Modules will bring a lot of webpack configurations, It seems messy.   @SachaG I think this's reasonable. The bars are stacked from the first group to the second group
 ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/18409771/a871228c-7782-11e6-80d2-01c53975e7cb.png)
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/18409775/b2002dca-7782-11e6-962f-ecadb05ee30e.png)

For vertical chart, the bars stacked from the left (the orientation of YAxis) to right.
For horizontal chart, the bars stacked form the bottom (the orientation of XAxis)  to top.
 @SachaG The order of Legend is consistent with the order of stacked bars. So I'm considering whether to adjust the order of stacked bars.
 Fixed in version 0.17.1.
  @SachaG  I don't what's the problem?
 @SachaG Got it! Thank you!
  @derrickpelletier We use dom nodes to render legend because the layout of dom nodes is much simpler than svg nodes. For svg nodes, we must calculate the width of each text.
I will try to support Legend by svg nodes.
  @sebastianekstrom Yeah, Recharts don't support touch events now.
 @thoqbk Do you want to submit a PR ?  @madshargreave 

 You can add an online jsfiddle example, then maybe I can find the problem.

The first question, you have two methods:
1.Find the css sectors of the tick you want to hide, and set the style of tick by css like the following:

``` css
.recharts-wrapper .recharts-y-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-ticks .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick:first-child {
  display: none;
}
```

2.You can hide the tick by customized function or react element.

The Second question, you have three methods:
1.Set the style of ticks like the following:

``` css
.recharts-wrapper .recharts-y-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-ticks .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick {
  dy: -10;
}
```

2.Set the props `tick` of `YAxis` to be an object like this: `{dx: -10}`.

3.Also by customized function or react element.
 @madshargreave  OK!
  @Nilegfx 

You can set the style cursor by customized object like this:

``` jsx
<Tooltip cursor={{fill: 'red', fillOpacity: 0.05}} />
```

[Here](http://jsfiddle.net/Lpmwoj9o/) is an example.

And [here](http://recharts.org/api#Tooltip) is the document.  But we think the cursor works together with `Tooltip`, so the configuration of `cursor` is a props of `Tooltip`.
 @Nilegfx I would close this issue and pr temporarily.
  @techniq It's a good idea. Do you have any interest to implement this component and submit a PR ? We are very busy now, 😭.
 @techniq 
I prefer to name this component generic `Text` than `Label`.  And maybe a workaround for you is to set the `tick` of `XAxis` to be a customized function.
  @huliyou You can submit PRs to add some components. Our team will discuss whether to merge the pr.
  @gischina You can use [ResponsiveContainer](http://recharts.org/api#ResponsiveContainer) to set the width of LineChart to be `100%`.
 @godmar When you use `ResponsiveContianer`, we'll try to calculate the width and height of ResponsiveContainer's parent node. But If the height of parent node is 0, we don't know how to calculate the height of `ResponsiveContainer`.  We have many discussion in #135 .  Maybe you can set a `minHeight` to `ResponsiveContainer`.
  @jakeorr We'll support it in the next version.
  @nickpalmer Thank you for your enthusiasm.
  @bduff9  If the width and height is fixed number,  you can place some text in the center of donut pie chart by adding svg elements in `PieChart`.

``` jsx
<PieChart width={800} height={400}
   <text x={400} y={200} textAnchor="middle" dominantBaseline="middle">
    Donut
   </text>
   ...
</PieChart>
```

[Here](http://jsfiddle.net/gzzq6jn3/) is a demo.
 @bduff9 We'll try to support centered label. But it may take some time. You can try to fix it. Or a workaround is to use a position absolute text.
 New components `Label` and `LabelList` are arrived in version 1.0.0-alpha.0. Centric label can be rendered by the following demo.

```jsx
<Pie>
  <Label value="any text" position="center" />
</Pie>
```  @eXtremeX OK! We'll try to add a props to support customized base value.
  @eXtremeX  Can you try to update the latest version of Recharts. We used transform of svg element  to animate Area before, but it seems not work some time in safari of ios8.3. So we have refactored the animation area.  
  Recharts will not support react native in a short period of time. Because we think the differences between the charts in pc and in mobile is apparent, we don't have enough experience of mobile development.  And our team have chose to use native ios or android to develop wireless apps after some gays have tried to develop h5 apps hardly. 
  @amitava82 You can check [this issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/171) for two workarounds.
 @amitava82 You can set the `startAngle` and `endAngle` of `Pie` like this:

``` jsx
<PieChart width={300} height={244}>
  <Pie
     data={chartData} 
     cx="50%" 
     cy="50%" 
     startAngle={90}
     endAngle={-270}
     innerRadius="60%"
     outerRadius="80%"
     stroke="none"
  />
</PieChart>
```

[Here](http://jsfiddle.net/vfeoLdp6/2/) is a demo.
Please check [document](http://recharts.org/api#Pie) for detail.
  @bluespore We have looked at a lot of chart libraries before, like echarts, highcharts, c3, nvd3, chartist, dc.js, and so on. Morris.js is also one of them. Most of these chart libraries can't meet our  various requirements.  That's why we develop recharts.
And we'll try to find the performance problem of recharts. Thank you !
  Yeah! It's true. Without XAxis, the tooltip just display the serial number.
 @areski Can you support an online example?
 I have checked LineChart in a table, seems no problem.
  @jacktasia Currently, you can get this only by a customized label which can be a function or a react element. And we'll trying to simplify the labels of recharts components.  Thank you!

And this issue is duplicated with [#160](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/160).
  @pcmaffey Thank you! I'll try to support Area in ScatterChart. And you can check [this issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/154) for the discussion of two numeric axes.
  Thank you ! You can try to fix some it when you find a bug. And discuss some issues width us, or try to fix some. PR is welcome! 
  @patryk0605 Sorry! There isn't any way to force the text to be visible, because the canvas of svg is too smaller to show all the texts. It's recommended to  position the texts inner the PieChart.
You can also check [this issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/160) for discussion before.  
  @malrase  Thank you for your advice! We are just planning to implement the linkage between legend and chart.  
  @ganapativs Thank you! I'll tweak the position of bars for multiple y-axes!
  @kazup0n Sorry I  didn't see your pr earlier until I released version 0.13.3. And this bug has been fixed in 0.13.3. Thank you for your contribution.
  @kazup0n Thank you. It's the bug of stackOff.
 Fixed in version 0.13.3.
  @chocolateboy Thank you! 

It works fine in my firefox browser.
OS: OS 10.11.5

 Ps, the issue of recharts.org is recommended to be submitted in https://github.com/recharts/recharts.org. 
  @patryk0605 

Is [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/sheubr4L/) what you want ?

The example for label is http://recharts.org/examples/#PieChartWithCustomizedLabel. I can access to this page in the most times, but not all the times. It's strange.

And your issue is similar to [#160](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/160).  I'll temporarily close this issue. If you have more questions about label of Pie, you can discuss with us.
  @marchaos [Here](http://recharts.org/examples#BiaxialLineChart) is a demo of LineChart which has two y-axes. 

``` jsx
<ComposedChart data={data} margin={{top: 20, right: 0, bottom: 0, left: 0}}> 
  <XAxis dataKey="name" tickLine={false} axisLine={false} /> 
  <YAxis yAxisId="left" tickCount={10} tickLine={false} axisLine={false} minTickGap={600} /> 
  <YAxis yAxisId="right" orientation='right' tickCount={10} tickLine={false} axisLine={false} minTickGap={600}/>
  <Tooltip formatter={this.props.drawTooltip} wrapperStyle={{display: 'none'}} /> 
  <Legend /> 
  <CartesianGrid stroke='#f5f5f5' vertical={false} /> 
  <Bar yAxisId="left" dataKey='pv' barSize={40} fill='#F7B7B4'/> 
  <Line yAxisId="left" type='linear' dataKey='uv' stroke='#41527D' strokeWidth={3} /> 
  <Line yAxisId="right" type='linear' dataKey='amt' stroke='#F70D1C' strokeWidth={3} /> 
</ComposedChart>
```

 You just need to specify the `yAxisId` of two y-axes, and graphical Component, like `Line`, `Area`, `Bar`.
 @marchaos A workaround is setting the `domain` and `ticks` of two y-axes like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/w7qdap9f/1/). But it may be very complex to calculate the domain and ticks.
How about the data you want to display? 
 @marchaos  If the domains are fixed, you can specify the domain and ticks of YAxis like the following:

``` jsx
<YAxis yAxisId="left" orientation="left" domain={[-4, 4]} ticks={[-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]} stroke="#8884d8"/>
<YAxis yAxisId="right" orientation="right"  domain={[-1, 1]} ticks={[-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1]} stroke="#82ca9d"/>
```
  @RichardJECooke  
The type of XAxis in a vertical BarChart should be `category`, and the type of YAxis should be `number`.
So the code should be tweaked like the following:

``` jsx
<BarChart layout="vertical" width={600} height={300} data={data}
            margin={{top: 20, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>
  <XAxis type="number"/>
  <YAxis dataKey="name" type="category"/>
  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3"/>
  <Tooltip/>
  <Legend />
  <Bar dataKey="pv" stackId="a" fill="#8884d8" />
  <Bar dataKey="uv" stackId="a" fill="#82ca9d" />
 </BarChart>
```

When you code in local development environment, error logs will be printed in the console.
 @RichardJECooke Documentation is weak now. I'll add the detail explanation in the documentation. Here are some examples for vertical chart:

[Vertical LineChart](http://recharts.org/examples#VerticalLineChart)
[Vertical ComposedChart](http://recharts.org/examples#VerticalComposedChart)
[Vertical LineChart which specify the domain of numerical axis](http://recharts.org/examples#VerticalLineChartWithSpecifiedDomain)
  @marchaos It works fine in [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/znqLLdev/1/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=znqLLdev). Can you show your question in an online jsfiddle demo ?
 @marchaos Recharts listens to the resize event of the container node. As long as you add a  `ResponsiveContainer` in to a container node,  and the container node can change size when the browser becomes larger or smaller, then the chart will change responsively. So I think it may be the bug of the layout which wrapper the ResponsiveContainer. It will be helpful to show your case in a jsfiddle demo. 
 @marchaos It seems to be the problem of calculation strategy for flex box. You can check this [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7985021/css-flexbox-issue-why-is-the-width-of-my-flexchildren-affected-by-their-content) for detail.
  @RichardJECooke  [uv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_user#Unique_visitor) and [pv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_view) are just two indicators commonly used in web analysis. You can search `uv` and `pv` in google.
 @RichardJECooke  
There are two workarounds: 
[One](http://jsfiddle.net/vfeoLdp6/1/) is done by PieChart, and [another](http://jsfiddle.net/exjbso5f/) is through RadialBarChart.
 Yeah, the range and domain of RadialBarChart is auto-calculated now. But other charts like LineChart, ScatterChart, RadarChart can set the range and domain.

Thank you for your advice, chartist is a great library.
  @nrkin Can you provide an online fiddle demo ?  You can fork [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/xyw5e9yb/3/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=xyw5e9yb) and update it.
 @nrkin When the props `dot` is set to be `false`, no dots will show. [Here](http://recharts.org/api#Line) is the api of `Line`. And you can check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/16h2935k/3/) for detail. 
 @nrkin  You can set the props `cursor` of `Tooltip`  to be `false`.

``` jsx
  <Tooltip cursor={false} />
```
  @eXtremeX In such case, you can set the style of the parent node of responsive container.
  @mberhorst It will be confused to bind the bar event on the background, especially for stacked bar. Maybe you can set the min height or min width of bar by the props `minPointSize`.
  @LalithKumarN Scatter can't be composed with Area and Line. Because  both the `XAxis` and `YAxis` are numeric axis for scatter. But for Line and Scatter, one of the XAxis or YAxis should be a categorical axis.

> It is similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments. - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart)

You can check [this issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/154) for detail.
  @atyndall You can't use stacked bar chart in such case. Because the stacked chart will display the sum values.
[Here](http://jsfiddle.net/vxnhLa14/) is a workaround.
 @atyndall  😂 I don't consider it as a bug. Stacked chart need to display the sum values, and it works in your demo. Meanwhile stacked chart will vary according to the order of stacked elements.
You can check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/u7949z3f/) for detail.
 @atyndall It's a good idea. We'll add an option `'sign'` to the props `stackOffset` in BarChart and AreaChart which allows the bars and areas to be stacked according to the sign of value.
  @Algiras   `Area` does not support this function now.
 @Algiras We'll refactor the events of some components in a few time.
  @techniq The display of labels in PieChart can be multifarious. That's why we allow develops to customize the labels by a function. Maybe we can export some utils, and refactor `label` in Pie. But we won't add more and more props to meet all the requirements, It's would be very difficult to find the needed props.
 @techniq Thank you!  Looking forward to hear more of your advices.
 @techniq 
We used this kind of PieChart in our products too.  In our case, the height of container is fixed, and the width is responsive which have a minimum width. Then we set the innerRadius and outerRadius  to be a percent value,  and limit the angle of label line.
Here is [a example](http://jsfiddle.net/o39d7va5/).

But when not enough space, this kind of labels can't be guaranteed to render inside the bounds of svg. 
 The label can be must simpler in 1.0.0+.  @BenjaminRCooper  How about your webpack configuration ?
 It's seems that you have imported the components of Recharts by file path like: 

```
import  { LineCharts } from 'recharts/src/index';
```
 @BenjaminRCooper It looks very normal now. I can't find the problem. 
Can you add your project in github?  
It's very strange about your bundle file. 
Because the `main` in the `package.json` of recharts is specified to be `lib/index` which has been compiled. And the `main` in the `package.json` of `d3-scale` is specified to be `build/d3-scale.js` which has been compiled too.

Normally, you should not import the file in src.
  For example, if you want to set the color of `XAxis`, you can set the props `stroke` of `XAxis` just like a svg element:

``` jsx
<XAxis dataKey="name" stroke="red" />
```

Then the stroke color of axis line, tick line and the fill color of ticks are set to `red`. If you want to set the fill color of ticks to be another color, you can set `tick` of `XAxis`:

``` jsx
 <XAxis dataKey="name" stroke="red" tick={{fill: 'orange'}} />
```

So just like `XAxis`, most other Components of Recharts except `Legend` and `Tooltip` can receive props `fill` and `stroke`.
  @GregoryPotdevin 

Thanks! Maybe the max radius of clipPath should be tweaked.
 Yeah! `maxRadius = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(width * width + height * height)` is a good idea.
  @manuviswam If both XAxis and YAxis are numeric axis, you should use ScatterChart. In your case, you should set the type of XAxis to be `category` just like this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/3w1b41yd/).

But I wonder why your data isn't continuous in `date`.
 @manuviswam  Which of the following curves do you want to get ?
1. Remove unavailable dates
   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17315914/4d43bdf6-58a2-11e6-8d11-733feafc5ce5.png)
2. Filled with unavailable dates
   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17315937/80423d18-58a2-11e6-9bcd-fd2d5ae10c1d.png)
3. Skip unavailable dates
   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17316037/49647f62-58a3-11e6-97fb-509f586ca5ea.png)

The first and the second curve can be plotted by LineChart, and the third curve can be plotted by ScatterChart. For simple LineChart, one of the XAxis or YAxis should be a categorical axis. 

>  It is similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments.   - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart)
 @manuviswam As you said, you should use ScatterChart to draw the curve. When you use  
LineChart to draw the second, you should fill the data with unavailable dates:

``` js
const data = [
    {date:10, price:50 },
    {date:11, price:60 },
    {date:12, price:54 },
    {date:13},
    {date:14},
    {date:15, price:55 },
    {date:16},
    {date:17},
    {date:18, price:58 },
    {date:19},
    {date:20, price:53 }
];
```

Because the price of date 13, and date 14 is unavailable, so the line between date 12 and date 15 is disconnected. So a workaround is to use ScatterChart instead.
 @manuviswam  
OK! We will discuss how to implement your case. In my opinion a time series chart is also a line chart, the only difference is that the ticks of x-axis in a time series chart are time strings. So I'd like to implement your case in two ways:
1. Support smooth curve in ScatterChart
2. Support two options of breakpoints display method:  one is `disconnected`, another is `skip and connected`
 @Eric24 Both `XAxis` and `YAxis` can be "number-axis" now. @Eric24 Since version 0.16.0. So can you raise an online demo ?  @kujon I will consider about it.
 Fixed in version 0.13.1.
  @raymondsze  You can set the [domain](http://recharts.org/api#YAxis) of `YAxis`.  
  Fixed in version 0.12.7.
  @adrianmc When a Line has a single point, the length of this Line is 0. Then no animation will be triggered, so the state `isAnimationFinished` is always false. 
It's a bug of Line, I'll fix it.
 Fixed in version 0.12.6.
  @adrianmc The default value of `tickCount` in `YAxis` is 5 which means that five ticks will be generated in a y-axis. If the `interval` is set to 1, then the first tick, the third tick and the fifth tick will be showed, other ticks will be hidden.

It's just like the `tickInterval` in [HighCharts](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#xAxis.tickInterval). Maybe `tickInterval` is a better choice.
 @adrianmc 
There are two ways to solve such kind of accuracy problem.

One way is to add `allowDecimals` option like HighCharts.
Another way is to tweak calculative strategy of step between ticks which should be integer when the minimum and maximum value of `YAxis` are integers.

I'm more inclined to the second way for the convenience of developers.
 Fixed in version 0.12.6.
 @adrianmc 
I optimize the step calculation in [recharts-scale](https://github.com/recharts/recharts-scale/blob/master/src/getNiceTickValues.js#L44). Integers can't be guaranteed for all the input, but the ticks would be more reasonable.
 @adrianmc  OK! recharts-scale can generate readable ticks in the most time. We would add a props `allowDecimals` to `XAxis` and `YAxis`, which will have a default value `true`. 
  @squll1  Of course, you can modify the starting point by [domain](http://recharts.org/api#YAxis) in `YAxis`.
  @squll1 RadarChart don't support tooltip now.
 Fixed in version 0.12.6.
  @adrianmc You have two methods to solve your problem.

One is that you need to add `color` in your payload of Legend. Otherwise icon will not be filled, so you can't see the icon.

```
<Legend payload={[{ value: 'Registered Users', type: 'line', id: 'pv', color: '#8884d8' }]} />
```

Another is using the default `Legend` which only need to remove `payload` in `Legend` and add `name` in `Line`.

```
<LineChart
    width={600}
    height={240}
    data={data}
    margin={{ top: 20, right: 120, left: 20, bottom: 5 }}
  >
    <XAxis dataKey="name" />
    <YAxis />
    <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
    <Tooltip />
    <Legend />
    <Line name="Registered Users'" type="monotone" dataKey="pv" stroke="#8884d8" />
  </LineChart>
```
 @adrianmc Yeah, it's a good idea. I'll update the examples.
  Hi, @NoWay1201 

It works fine in this [example](http://jsfiddle.net/4sqe4625/).
No tooltip content will be rendered when your mouse is outside the chart. You can mouse enter the chart, and the log will work. 
  @adrianmc [Here](http://jsfiddle.net/0mgjy8nf/) is a workaround, though I don't quite understand this chart.

You can color the bars differently by customized `shape` in `Bar`.
I wonder why "Fossil fuels" have a different fill color?
  @isilweo You mean `paddingAngle` of `Pie`. We will support this feature in the next version. Thank you for your advice.
    It seems the bug of latest [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7187);
 @dorsha You can keep this issue open until React fix this bug.
  It's the bug of [React 15.2.0](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6532).
 @dorsha We will check these props. React will check all the props now, you can see [this document](https://gist.github.com/jimfb/d99e0678e9da715ccf6454961ef04d1b) for detail.
  @GregoryPotdevin PR is welcome. And It's compatible to allow both an array of numbers and a number for `activeIndex`.
 Closed in version 0.12.4.
  @isilweo We don't implement `formatter` in Bar. It may be a error caused by copying code from some other file.  And you can implement labels on the top of `Bar` by customized `label`.
  @nickstanish Can you provide any logs?
 @nickstanish  Can you show more about the browser you used ? And how about the version of browser?
 @nickstanish  Do you know the version of safari in ios8.3?
 ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/16608715/adea4418-4380-11e6-93fb-4a754bf1c463.png)

@nickstanish It works fine in my ios8.3 simulator. You can add `alert(navigator.userAgent);` in jsfiddle to check the version of safari.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/16608789/601b9916-4381-11e6-9da6-93cf0a4fc724.png)

And it seems no ios6 simulator in xcode now.
 @nickstanish How about the version of Recharts? The problem of AreaChart in ios8.3 seems to be the bug of Animation. And your case seems to the the bug of react-container-dimensions or the style of parent node. Please check the size of parent node. And If possible, you can create an example of your case in jsfiddle. Then we can find the bug easier.
 @joshburgess  Can you describe your question in a simple project that we can have access to ? 
 @joshburgess OK! It's helpful for us to find the problem.
 @nickpalmer  
We have discussed these two kinds of responsive strategies. Take the display of texts as an example.

The original size:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17723347/fb5ddab4-646b-11e6-82ae-1fe10aaecb56.png)

Larger size and more space to display texts (The responsive strategy we adopted now) :
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17723356/12fc9ac0-646c-11e6-9619-7225919f2920.png)

Larger size and larger texts (scalable SVGs):
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17723418/931bdcb6-646c-11e6-8512-223d1e53f125.png)

And we think this first responsive strategy is now more widely used.
 @nickstanish  
Although I don't exactly know what is your demand. But your problem can be solved by setting the height of "content" node to be `100%`;

``` css
.content {
  height: 100%;
  min-height: 500px;
}
```

http://jsfiddle.net/d0k0rk0m/2/ 
 @nickstanish @joshburgess It seems to be the problem of calculating width and height for hidden parent! Thank you! I'll try to find the reason.
 @nickpalmer 
I don't mean to force users of the library to set heights on all elements of the tree. But if someone want to set the height of a node to be a relative value (a percent value), then one of its ancestor node should have  a absolute height.

And it's a good idea to an option of  aspect ration. And the aspect and minHeight, minWidth should be optional, meanwhile `width` and `height` need to be retained. what @nickstanish has said is a good advice.  
 @nickpalmer PR is welcome.

I have submitted some comments. Hope useful to you.
 @nickpalmer 
I think this issue has been fixed. Thank you very much!

@nickstanish @jasonslyvia 
http://jsfiddle.net/k14xykqv/1/ and http://jsfiddle.net/k14xykqv/ are two examples of ResponsiveContainer used with react-bootstrap which specify the aspect of ResponsiveContainer or specify the height of `.tab-pane`.
 @SachaG Yeah, it's the expected behavior. We'll add this in the document.
  @southnan0 You can see [this issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/43) or  [recharts.org](http://recharts.org/api#Cell) for detail.

And [here](http://jsfiddle.net/xcjLLuej/) is an online example.
  @Cloudo  Merged! Thank you!
  @ycpatel813  You can use customized label to get what you want.

[example](http://jsfiddle.net/xcjLLuej/)
    @shakalakatechie 
Recharts only support simple line in ScatterChart now. [Here](http://recharts.org/examples#JointLineScatterChart) is an example.

Can you share what's kind of Line you want to add in Scatter?
 How about [this example](http://jsfiddle.net/ctu7hbjj/)?
 @jcarian you can connect to us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/recharts/recharts?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)
  @zhaoyihong  
Thank your.
 There's some bug when calculate the width, height of Legend and Tooltip. Because we insert a hidden DOM to body when calculate the size of Legend, and Tooltip. So your global css will affect the result of the calculation. It's a bug.

And it's normal that global css will affect svg elements, css even have higher priority than presentation attributes of svg elements.  You can look [Here](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html#AlternativesForStyling) for detail.
 I found that it's very troublesome to solve the problem. Because we want to get the width and height before `componentDidMount`.

So I temporarily solve this problem by a hack method in v0.12.1.
  @sankho  
This approach can lead to presentation attributes of svg elements  is more and more complex, difficult to maintain. Because each components has many presentation attributes, all these attributes have the same problem.
 @sankho I think it's better to add `style`  which can set all the presentation attributes by a function. But we are still very cautious to add **props**. Because this feature can be implemented in two ways now.
One is add `fill` to the `data` passed to `BarChart`. Another is set the `shape` of `Bar`.
 @sankho  Thank you very much for your contribution. I really hope that Recharts will become more and more friendly to developers.

But I worry that your implementation will bring more and more props like `strokeFormatter`, `strokeWidthFormatter`, `fillOpactityFormatter`, `strokeOpacityFormatter`, and so on. Too may props is also not developer friendly. Meanwhile our code may become something like this:

``` javascript
if (this.props.fillFormatter) {
  const fill = this.props.fillFormatter(entry.value)
}
if (this.props.strokeFormatter) {
  const stroke = this.props.strokeFormatter(entry.value)
}
....
```

So I think what we need is something like `attrFormatter`, which can be a function and can format all the attributes by values. And we may get final  presentation attributes like this:

``` javascript
let attrs = getPresentationAttributes(props);

if (_.isFunciton(this.props.attrFormatter)) {
  attrs = { ...attrs, ...this.props.attrFormatter(props.value) };
}
```

Than It seems `attrFormatter` do the similar thing to `shape`.  `attrFormatter` is only simpler than `shape`.
So I advise you can use `shape` to implement your chart.

[Implemented by shape](http://jsfiddle.net/8s13xjth/)
[Implemented by formatting data](http://jsfiddle.net/wg72e1jt/)
 @sankho I prefer developers can use the `shape` or  `data` to approach this feature.  
  @iuriikozuliak  I don't quite understand what's the problem. 
 @iuriikozuliak Thank you! I have found the reason.
 The [L256](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/c326127737687e0e89d75935c799f3b1e70b8e56/src/chart/BarChart.js#L256) should fixed to the following:

```
const axisId = layout === 'horizontal' ? yAxisId : xAxisId;
```
  @george-cz 
The cause of this bug is that the value of `tick` in `Bar` locate in the left of each band, but the value of `tick` in `Line` locate in the middle of each band.

Your change may cause the bug of LineChart.
 Maybe it's better to fix `getTicksOfAxis`, I change this function in the latest version.
 But, I find `getTicksOfAxis` is in a mess.
 @george-cz We think it's better to fix `getTicksOfAxis`, and we have fix it in V0.12.0. Thank you !
  @george-cz thank you, i'll fix this bug today.
 Fixed in V0.12.0.
  @ochervak `Bar` don't support min-height now.
 Fixed in V0.12.0. You can set `minPointSize` of `Bar`.

```
 <Bar dataKey="pv" minPointSize={10} />
```
  @troyblank  It's a workaround to set the `domain` of `YAxis`yourself.
Here is a [example](http://jsfiddle.net/hqe9c1uk/1/).
And you can see the [api](http://recharts.org/api#YAxis) for detail.

And we'll discuss this feature. 

Do you think this feature is necessary after you know more about `domain`?
 @troyblank  
Thank you for your sharing! I misunderstood the `padding` of C3. It's really necessary for `XAxis` and `YAxis`.
 Fixed in V0.12.0.

`XAxis` and `YAxis` can support domain like `['dataMin - 100', 'dataMax + 50']`.
  @suelspahiu It works fine in [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/sn2j92kq/).  It seems that you may have some css like:

```
li {
   float: left;
}
```

Because we use `li` to write the texts in tooltip.
 Yeah, you can set the value of `type` to 'linear' or remove `type`, because the default value of `type` is `linear`.

```
<Line type="linear" dataKey="any"/>
```

or 

```
<Line dataKey="any"/>
```

You can look at [api](http://recharts.org/api#Line) for more infromation.
 @suelspahiu 

You can see [this example](http://jsfiddle.net/ffh6nobj/) to determine whether Recharts meet your requirement.
 Hello again @xile611 ,
Would you please let me know if there's a way to change the font used throughout the graphs? I've looked for a while and cant seem to find anything. Thanks!

EDIT: Also I've got an issue with ResponsiveContainer, where it adds some space in the bottom of the graph, how can I get rid of that (running recharts@0.12.8):
Here's my code:

```
<ResponsiveContainer width={"100%"} height={"50%"}>
          <ComposedChart data={this.state.data}
          margin={{top: 50, right: 20, bottom: 0, left: 20}} barCategoryGap={40}>
          <XAxis hide={true} dataKey="Date" label="Days" />
          <YAxis yAxisId="left" orientation="left" dataKey={this.state.Value} />
          <YAxis yAxisId="right" orientation="right" dataKey={this.state.Value1} />
          <Tooltip cursor={false}/>

          <Legend legendType="line" layout="horizontal" align="center" verticalAlign="bottom" height={10} wrapperStyle={{ lineHeight: '75px'}}/>

          <Bar yAxisId="left" dataKey={this.state.Value} fill='#00AEEF'/>
          <Line yAxisId="right" dot={false} type="linear" dataKey={this.state.Value1} stroke="red" strokeWidth={3}/>
          </ComposedChart>
        </ResponsiveContainer>
```

Here's what it looks like (I cropped out the top part so I can fit it in 1 screenshot):  
![screen shot 2016-08-18 at 12 07 22 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9028592/17781201/6188e844-653c-11e6-8dbf-ff2143567691.png)

EDIT2: I know the space there happens because of the <ResponsiveContainer height={"50%"] option but if it's 100% the empty space is filled by the graph but the graph takes the whole page.
-Can it be possible to use a ResponsiveContainer that wraps around a Chart while only controlling the width responsively, while the height stays fixed?
 @suelspahiu 
There are two ways to change the font of texts in the chart.
One is through css like the following:

``` css
// set the font of all the texts in the chart
.recharts-wrapper { 
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
// set the style of the ticks of y-axis
.recharts-wrapper .recharts-y-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick text {
  fill: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

Another is through attributes of  components:

``` jsx
<LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data} style={{fontSize: 18}}
            margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>
  <XAxis dataKey="name" fontSize={16} fontFamily="sans-serif" />
  <YAxis/>
  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3"/>
  <Tooltip/>
  <Legend />
  <Line type="monotone" dataKey="pv" stroke="#8884d8" activeDot={{r: 8}}/>
  <Line type="monotone" dataKey="uv" stroke="#82ca9d" />
</LineChart>
```

The styling of svg elements is just similar to the styling of dom nodes. You can check [this document](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html) for detail.

And for the problem of ResponsiveContainer, I'll fix this bug soon. Thank you!
 @xile611 Thank you ! Please let me know when it's fixed!
Take care.
 @suelspahiu  Fixed in version 0.13.4
 @xile611 Thank you.

EDIT: @xile611 hmm should you be able to target Legend such as `<Legend fontSize={16} fontFamily="sans-serif" />`    ?
For some reason it doesn't work for me.
  @troyblank 

The interpolation that C3 use to generate smooth curve is _Cardinal_. And  you can use _Cardinal_ in Recharts too, just like the example: http://jsfiddle.net/hqe9c1uk/.

But I recommend to use _Monotone_ interpolation. Because curve may across the boundary when you use _Cardinal_  interpolation.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/16217403/bff1f728-37a5-11e6-9c94-1e6483653f88.png)

 Ps: You can see more about interpolation [here](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#curves).
 @troyblank Our document is not perfect yet. I'll add this feature in the document.
 @troyblank  Yeah, I should fix the PropTypes of `type` in `Area`. Thank you! 
  @sankho Thank you for your sharing, horizon chart is very interesting. PR is welcome. We don't have guidelines for contribution yet. The most basic is that you should run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` when you finish a chart. 
 Closed temporarily. Looking forward for your pr.
    feat(Sankey): prop name change nodeContent->node;support object to node and link, object contains presentation and event attr
  @Nishchit14 Thanks! It's a bug.We'll fix it as soon as possible.
 Fixed in version 0.11.0
  feat(Sankey): renamed Sankey's link property to make every coordinate name meaningful
  Thank you for your advice! We'll add more information for customized tooltip payload. 

And you can achieve your target by managing the colors outside (http://jsfiddle.net/nbsb32nd/), but it seems to be not elegant. 
 Yeah, we'll fix this in the next version.
 Fixed in version  0.11.0.
  feat: add new chart Sankey Disgram to recharts
 you should rebase the commits.
  @NoWay1201 
Where do you want to attach images?
 @NoWay1201  
Is this (http://jsfiddle.net/nbk125Lj/) what you want? 
If it is, you just need to set `label={true}` in `Bar`.

If you want to attach image to every bar, you can see: http://jsfiddle.net/b6v7730r/
  You should update props `data` in the chart, and the props `data` should be immutable.
  @nightlyop   Yeah, I think it's a good workaround to create multiple data series, just like http://jsfiddle.net/ott0xtdy/ .
If there is anything that can't meet your requirement, please let me know.
 http://jsfiddle.net/ggg0trdh/2/

Maybe you can repeat the value where the line types change.
 Yeah, you are right, you can use customized `content` in `Tooltip`. 
I forgot to remove `type="number"`. You can see: http://jsfiddle.net/ggg0trdh/3/.
And because the default `type` of `YAxis` is `"number"`,  if you want to set the `type` of both x-axis and y-axis to `"number"`, you should change to `ScatterChart`.
  @rainandwind0 

You can set the props `tickCount` in `PolarRadiusAxis`. The default value of `tickCount` is _5_, that's why you always get five circles.

```
<PolarRadiusAxis angle={30} domain={[0, 3]} tickCount={4}/>
```
 My fault! I forgot to add `tickCount` in the API of `PolarRadiusAxis`. 
 Yeah, I'll update the document. Welcome to point our mistakes.
  @joshburgess 

We consider your issue for a long time, found that it's a very different to sync brush and hover events across more than one chart. Because we change the state of a LineChart to track and show the Tooltip now. If a LineChart want to keep synchronous with another chart, the LineChart must receive some props from the external. 
These two kinds of behaviour is contradictory.
 Fixed in version 0.13.3.
  It's a bug. We'll fix it in soon.
 Fixed in version 0.10.7.
  @zvictor How about the problem of initial width and height you have mentioned in [react-container-dimensions#1](https://github.com/okonet/react-container-dimensions/issues/1)
 Great! Thanks! 
 @sbehrends  Can you show your complete code in JSFiddle?
 @zvictor I apologize for my reckless behaviour, I should communicate with you if you are still willing to update the commits.
  The problem is due to we use `cloneElement` to pass props into the label component.

``` js
  React.cloneElement(label, this.props);
```

See [facebook/react#6268](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6268) for detail.
 See [facebook/react#6880](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6880)
  You can set the prop `isAnimationActive` to be false to disable all animation in the Bar/Line/Area... 

Now, the data updating animation is equal to initial animation, later we will support updating animation too. 

Now, we use `isAnimationActive` to control if the animation is valid, later we will add a prop to control data updating animation.

And I'm not clear what do you mean when you say rerender the whole chart.
  Now you can set tick to be a function or a react element to achieve your goal temporarily. In the feture, I think we should let shape attributes, just like cx, cy, dx, dy, can override defult settings.
  Please update the latest code, and fix the build fail problem.
 @ciAnd7 This bug of Brush has been fixed in version 0.10.7
  It's a good idea to customize animation , I'm sorry for Recharts not support it yet.  We will add this feature soon.
 react-smooth will still get bundled If animation is disabled.
 @adrianmc You can set the props `isAnimationActive` to `false` in `Bar`, `Line`, `Pie`, etc.
[Here](http://recharts.org/api) is the document.
 Duplicated with issue #293 .
  This feature is being planned. Maybe you can put your usage scenario described in more detail. It's helpful to our implement.
 @hrbustor 
BarChart support customized event handlers in v0.10.6. You can bind click event like:

``` jsx
<BarChart width={400} height={400} data={data} onClick={this.handleBarClick}>
  <XAxis dataKey="name" />
  <YAxis />
  <Legend />
  <Tooltip />
  <CartesianGrid vertical={false}/>
  <Bar dataKey="uv" />
  <Bar dataKey="pv" />
</BarChart>
```

Or

``` jsx
<BarChart width={400} height={400} data={data}>
  <XAxis dataKey="name" />
  <YAxis />
  <Legend />
  <Tooltip />
  <CartesianGrid vertical={false}/>
  <Bar dataKey="uv" onClick={this.handleUvBarClick}/>
  <Bar dataKey="pv" onClick={this.handlePvBarClick}/>
</BarChart>
```
  Yes, we think the ReferenceLine and the ReferenceDot are auxiliary so we render them before chart.

In AreaChart or BarChart, the ref lines/dots may be sheltered from the chart, you may set a fillOpacity to Bar or Area.

What do you think？
 of course, you can see what I mean in jsfiddle:

http://jsfiddle.net/hzongquan/435Lf8sa/4/
 We have modified the render order. Chart render before the refs now , so the refs will above the chart . 

And if you want let refs render below chart, you can add a prop `isAbove` which means chart render above the refs. The sample code is as below: 

```
<BarChart width={400} height={400} data={data} isAbove >
  <XAxis dataKey="name" />
  <YAxis />
  <Legend />
  <Tooltip />
  <CartesianGrid vertical={false} />
  <ReferenceLine y={3200} stroke="red" />
  <Bar dataKey="uv" fill="#ff7300" />
  <Bar dataKey="pv" fill="#387908" />
  </Bar>
</BarChart>
```

You can use this feature when the next version is released.

Thanks!
  In fact,  `react-dom/server` package is equivalent to `react/lib/ReactDOMServer` package.

The code in `react-dom/server` is as below:

```
'use strict';

module.exports = require('react/lib/ReactDOMServer');

```

We can't diagnose the problem without your webpack config code, can you show your webpack config code here ?
  You should specify `type` in `XAxis` to be `number`.

``` jsx
<BarChart 
  width={600} 
  height={300} 
  data={data} 
  layout="vertical"
  margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}
>
  <XAxis type="number"/>
  <YAxis type="category" dataKey="name" />
  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3"/>
  <Tooltip/>
  <Legend />
  <Bar dataKey="pv" fill="#8884d8" />
  <Bar dataKey="uv" fill="#82ca9d" />
</BarChart>
```

Because the default value of `type` in `XAxis` is `'category'`.
  Fixed in version 0.10.5.

Now props `type` in  `Curve` supports `'basis'`, `'basisClosed'`, `'basisOpen'`, `'linear'`, `'linearClosed'`, `'natural'`, `'monotone'`, `'step'`, `'stepBefore'` and `'stepAfter'`.
Add `type` can set to be a interpolation function, just like:

``` jsx
import { curveCardinalClosed  } from 'd3-shape';

...
  <Curve type={curveCardinalClosed.tension(1)} points={points} />
...
```
 PR is welcome! But we haven't think very clear whether such charts which are not very widely used should be contained in Recharts.  
  Thanks! It seems to be a bug.
 Fixed in v0.10.4
  Thanks!  We'll consider this feature.
  Yeah,  this feature is being planned. And `Treemap` has implemented this feature.
@jasonHzq 
 Done in v0.10.4.
  Well, I don't think your positioning strategy is very appropriate. Because it can cause the problem of tooltip covering the active dots.
 Yeah, tooltip located at the right of cursor is natural. But when we detect the tooltip will exceed the viewing area, the position of tooltip will be adjusted to the left of the cursor. 
  @michalg42 

In your case, you can set the props `name` of each chart item just like the following example:

``` jsx
<LineChart width={400} height={400} data={data}  margin={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 30, right: 30}}>
  <XAxis dataKey="name" />
  <Tooltip/>
  <Legend/>
  <CartesianGrid stroke="#f5f5f5" />
  <Line name="My X value" dataKey="x" stroke="#ff7300" />
  <Line name="My Y value"  dataKey="y" stroke="#387908" />
</LineChart>
```

Thanks! I'll add this in the document.
  Thanks!
But `getTooltipBBox` is not a misspelling, it means getting bounding box of the tooltip.
If you have used _Raphael.js_ before, you may know `getBBox`  which is a method of Raphael element.
I just borrowed the naming from _Raphael.js_.
 @doublelduob  Thanks~  Pull request is welcome!
  Thanks~ Treemap will support Tooltip in next version.
 Done in version 0.10.1
  This problem has been fixed in version 0.10.0. And this problem was caused because `scalePoint` in d3-scale eliminate duplicate data internally.
But I am curious how can a list data has two duplicate element which have different values. Can you show me an example?
  Recharts support server side render. But some components need to calculate the width or height of a  dom node, so some component can't show in server side, just like `Tooltip`, ResponsiveContainer.

Maybe you  can show  your code, or give me a jsfiddle example.  
 Yeah. It was because animation of `Line`, `Area`, `Bar` was added by default.
You can solve this problem by removing animation.

``` jsx
<ComposedChart width={600} height={400} data={data}
            margin={{top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20}}>
  <XAxis dataKey="name"/>
  <YAxis />
  <Tooltip/>
  <Legend/>
  <CartesianGrid stroke='#f5f5f5'/>
  <Area isAnimationActive={false} type='monotone' dataKey='amt' fill='#8884d8' stroke='#8884d8'/>
  <Bar isAnimationActive={false} dataKey='pv' barSize={20} fill='#413ea0'/>
  <Line isAnimationActive={false} type='monotone' dataKey='uv' stroke='#ff7300'/>
</ComposedChart>

  Thanks! haha~
  It's correct the domain of RadarChart  is specified in `domain`  on `PolarRadiusAxis`, and `fullMark` is a original value. If `domain` isn't specified, then the domain is calculated by the minimum and maximum value of dataset .So I gave two examples in  the example page.

But now we can't support such data:

``` js
const data = [
    { subject: 'Math', A: 120, B: 110, fullMark: 150 },
    { subject: 'Chinese', A: 98, B: 130, fullMark: 150 },
    { subject: 'English', A: 86, B: 130, fullMark: 150 },
    { subject: 'Geography', A: 99, B: 100, fullMark: 100 },
    { subject: 'Physics', A: 85, B: 90, fullMark: 100 },
    { subject: 'History', A: 65, B: 85, fullMark: 100 },
];
```

That means each element in the `data` may have different scale. Now I have thought of two ways to specify the domain of each element in a `data`.

First, specify domain in `data`:

``` js
const data = [
    { subject: 'Math', A: 120, B: 110, fullMark: 150, domain: [0, 150] },
    { subject: 'Chinese', A: 98, B: 130, fullMark: 150, domain: [0, 150] },
    { subject: 'English', A: 86, B: 130, fullMark: 150, domain: [0, 150] },
    { subject: 'Geography', A: 99, B: 100, fullMark: 100, domain: [0, 100] },
    { subject: 'Physics', A: 85, B: 90, fullMark: 100, domain: [0, 100] },
    { subject: 'History', A: 65, B: 85, fullMark: 100, domain: [0, 100] },
];
```

Second, specify domain in `Cell`:

``` js
<RadarChart cx={300} cy={250} outerRadius={150} width={600} height={500} data={data}>
  <Radar name="Mike" dataKey="A" stroke="#8884d8" fill="#8884d8" fillOpacity={0.6}>
    {
        data.map((entry, index) => (
          <Cell domain={[0, entry.fullMark]} key={`cell-${index}`}/>
        ))
    }
  </Radar>
  <Radar name="Lily" dataKey="B" stroke="#82ca9d" fill="#82ca9d" fillOpacity={0.6}/>
  <PolarGrid />
  <Legend />
  <PolarAngleAxis dataKey="subject" />
</RadarChart>
```
  This problem may due to two react in your local project.

If you have used webpack, you can add `resolve` in your _webpack.config.js_.

```
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      'react': path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'react'),
    },
    extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx', '.css', '.scss', '.json']
  },
```
  Thanks! @slestang 
Can you show me your code, and how you want to use recharts?
 Thanks! I 'll think about supporting scaleTime.
 @slestang 
Maybe your case can be implemented by set customized `ticks` and `tickFormatter` in `XAxis`. 

http://jsfiddle.net/ntmm30gk/
  Thanks. This problem was fixed in v0.8.8.

Initially I think that the width and height must be a percentage. But you may need to set the width to be a percentage, but the height to be a fixed value. So the width and height of `ResponsiveContainer` can be a percentage or a fixed number in v0.8.8.
   `transform` is a good way to change the postition of label. Because we can only use css to change some presentation attributes, but we can't change the position attributes such as `x`, `y` in css. 

``` css
.recharts-cartesian-axis-label text {
  fill: red;
}
```

Another way is to set `label` into a function, or react element.

``` jsx
const renderLabel = (props) => {
    const { x, y, width, height } = props;

  return (
    <text x={x + width / 2} y={y - 10} className="customized-x-axis-label">Anything</text>
  );
};
const SimpleLineChart = React.createClass({
    render () {
    return (
        <LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data}
            margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>
       <XAxis dataKey="name" label={renderLabel}/>
       <YAxis/>
       <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3"/>
       <Tooltip/>
       <Legend />
       <Line type="monotone" dataKey="pv" stroke="#8884d8" />
       <Line type="monotone" dataKey="uv" stroke="#82ca9d" />
      </LineChart>
    );
  }
})

```

http://jsfiddle.net/sh2bLsh2/
  It's my mistake, the stage-0 will be splitted to specific packages. I will fix the babelrc
  The default width of  `YAxis` is 60, maybe you can set the width to be a smaller value just like the following example.

``` jsx
   <YAxis width={40} />
```
  Thanks!
The customized payload is overwritten by the legend data calculated in `LineChart`, but the data won't be overwritten in the test file.
Maybe the `payload` should not be overwritten when you have set a customized `payload` in a `Legend`.
 Fixed in v0.8.7
  @kennetpostigo 
I think you should set the `cx`, `cy`, `innerRadius`, `outerRadius` of `RadarChart` and `RadialBarChart` to be  a  percent value.

``` jsx
<ResponsiveContainer  width='100%' height='100%'>
        <AreaChart className="area" data={data}
              margin={{top: 10, right: 30, left: 0, bottom: 0}}>
            <XAxis dataKey="name"/>
            <YAxis/>
            <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3"/>
            <Tooltip/>
            <Area type='monotone' dataKey='uv' stackId="1" stroke='#8884d8' fill='#8884d8' />
            <Area type='monotone' dataKey='pv' stackId="1" stroke='#82ca9d' fill='#82ca9d' />
            <Area type='monotone' dataKey='amt' stackId="1" stroke='#ffc658' fill='#ffc658' />
        </AreaChart>
      </ResponsiveContainer>

      <ResponsiveContainer width='100%' height='100%'>
        <RadialBarChart className="radial" cx="50%" cy="70%" innerRadius="20%" outerRadius="80%" data={data2}>
          <RadialBar minAngle={15} label background clockWise={true} dataKey='uv'/>
          <Legend iconSize={10} width={90} height={140} layout='vertical' verticalAlign='middle' wrapperStyle={style}/>
        </RadialBarChart>
      </ResponsiveContainer>

      <ResponsiveContainer width='100%' height='100%'>
        <RadarChart className="radar" cx="50%" cy="50%" outerRadius="80%" data={data3}>
            <Radar name="Mike" dataKey="A" stroke="#8884d8" fill="#8884d8" fillOpacity={0.6}/>
            <Radar name="Lily" dataKey="B" stroke="#82ca9d" fill="#82ca9d" fillOpacity={0.6}/>
            <PolarGrid />
            <Legend />
            <PolarAngleAxis dataKey="subject" />
            <PolarRadiusAxis angle={30} domain={[0, 150]}/>
          </RadarChart>
      </ResponsiveContainer>
    </div>

```

You can see the [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/0xu0gsgq/).
  The default value of props `interval` in  `XAxis` and `YAxis` is `'auto'`, then we will calculate the width and height of each tick to determine whether there is enough space to display a certain tick. But the calculation can't be done on server side, so led the such inconsistencies. 
Maybe you can set the value of props `interval` in `XAxis` or `YAxis` to be a number, just like the following example. When you set the `interval` to be 0, then all the ticks will be drawn.

``` jsx
  <LineChart data={data} width={400} height={400}>
     <XAxis dataKey="name" interval={0}/>   
     <Line dataKey="a"/>
   </LineChart>
```
  Thanks. Recharts will support React 15.0 in next version
 we already support react 15.0 in v0.9.2 
  Thanks! We plan to release a stable version in April. But we will do as soon as possible to support wireless.
  Fixed in v0.8.6
  Fixed in v0.8.6.
And SSR and CSR is unlikely to be completely consistent. 
For example when you want to render legend in a line chart. The width and height of legend can be calculated in client side, but such calculation can't be done in server side.  
  When `XAxis` is a category axis, `tickCount` won't affect the count of ticks. 
  Fixed in v0.8.5
  Thanks! Maybe `invariant` is not suitable to be used here. We will add a log util to output some warning messages.  
 Fixed in 0.8.4
  When using custom label element, It wasn't getting rendered next to the slice.
- added label formatter for tooltip. (Ex: date formatting)
- pass the pie slice percentage as part of props for custom pie label element
 Thanks~
Maybe we need to add a props `labelLine` to control the lines between labels and slices.
  Now the color of slices can be set in the data like the example:
http://jsfiddle.net/j8w3176p/
But I don't think it's a good idea.
Do you have any advice?
 Yeah, add presentation attributes in the data fields is not a good idea. 
And put all the different colors in an array is not a good idea too, in such case we may need to add props like `strokes`,`fills` and so on.

I think your suggestion is very good, we will consider carefully.
 @joshafest  Not closed yet! 
 Thanks! PR and advice are welcome! @joshafest 
 Fixed in v0.8.4.
We add a component `Cell` which can be child of `Pie`, `Bar`, `RadialBar`, so that the attributes of each sector in a pie  can be specified in cells.

For example:

``` jsx
<PieChart width={730} height={250}>
    <Pie data={data} cx="50%" cy="50%" outerRadius={50}>
      {
        data.map((entry, index) => (
          <Cell key={`cell-${index}`} fill={colors[index]}/>
        ))
      }
    </Pie>
  </PieChart>
```

``` jsx
<BarChart width={730} height={250} data={data}>
    <Bar dataKey="value">
      {
        data.map((entry, index) => (
          <Cell key={`cell-${index}`} stroke={colors[index]}  strokeWidth={index === 2 ? 4 : 1}/>
        ))
      }
    </Bar>
  </BarChart>
```

And we still can specify the attributes of each child node through `data`, but `Cell` is of higher priority.
 @steve-taylor You can set a customized `label` of `Pie`,  which can be a function, a react element.

Here is the [document](http://recharts.org/api#Pie).
  Great idea! Thanks for @rrag. What do you think? @xile611
react-stockcharts is awesome probject too. Maybe we will be worth to join forces, borrow the ideas. :-)
 Thanks for @rrag .

I also thought about what you said when I started recharts.Then in the process of implementation, I began to doubt in what scenario user want to draw a circle, a line or a rectangle with specified coordinates.

So I implement `ReferenceLine` which accept a value as input and draw a line whose coordinates are calculated internally. `ReferenceDot` is similar.

Anyway, limit child type is really not flexible enough.I will consider about the implementation.
  `stroke-dasharray: 0px 1px;` means that you want to draw the line with `0px` dash and `1px` gap repeatedly.
Then of course, the path is invisible. You can view the following example, and you will find that normal behavior of the browser always been this way.
https://jsfiddle.net/dv8b287f/

You can also view the following documents about `stroke-dasharray` further:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dasharray
https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#StrokeDasharrayProperty
 Sorry for  misunderstanding what you mean.
And of course, rendering behavior should be same on server side and client side.
Some bug happens in  server side rendering when `stroke-dasharray` is set in `Line`.
 Fixed in v0.8.0
 @isilweo Can you show you code here? I do not quite understand what is your problem now.

And  I will add the apis about animation in the document.
 @isilweo 
I have found the reason. The paths have attributes `stroke-dasharray="none"`, `style="stroke-dasharray: 0px 1px;"` because we need to hide the path before animation of paths start, otherwise paths will blink in client side.

And It seems impossible that the behavior of SSR and CSR is exactly the same when paths have animation.
Maybe you can set `isAnimationActive={false}` in `Line` when you need SSR.

``` jsx
<LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data}>
  <Legend />
  <Line type="monotone" dataKey="pv" stroke="#8884d8" isAnimationActive={false} />
  <Line type="monotone" dataKey="uv" stroke="#82ca9d" isAnimationActive={false}/>
</LineChart>
```
  Fixed in v0.8.0
  `ResponsiveContainer` will calculate the width and height of parent node after `componentDidMount` or   resize of window. If width or height of parent node is 0, or the props `width` for `height` is `0%`, then no chart will be rendered.

So you have to set the `width` and `height` of the parent node in style or css.
  PR is welcome!
`AutoSizer` is more perfect than ResponsiveContainer. 
 But I am worried about the size of Recharts.js now.
You can run  `npm run bundle-analyse` after improvement. 
 Fixed in 0.8.6
  Now I need to set three props ( `type`, `value`, `xAxisId` or `yAxisId` ) to describe a reference line. Just like: 

``` jsx
  <ReferenceLine type="vertical" value="Page C" xAxisId={1} stroke="green" label="Min PAGE"/>
  <ReferenceLine type="horizontal" value={4000} yAxisId={1}  label="Max" stroke="red" strokeDasharray="3 3"/>
```

I think the props names are a bit obscure. And in order to be consistent , the `value` props of   `ReferenceDot` (Planning Component) would be an object or a string:

``` jsx
  <ReferenceDot value={['someVal', 12]}  xAxisId={1}  yAxisId={2} stroke="green" label="Min PAGE"/>
  <ReferenceDot  value={{x: 'someVal', y: 12}} xAxisId={3} yAxisId={1}  label="Max" stroke="red" strokeDasharray="3 3"/>
```

 Maybe we can describe a reference line like this:

``` jsx
  <ReferenceLine x="Page C" xAxisId={1} stroke="green" label="Min PAGE"/>
  <ReferenceLine y={4000} yAxisId={1}  label="Max" stroke="red" strokeDasharray="3 3"/>
```

It's just like we describe a horizontal line by `y = 10;`, or a vertical line by `x = 1;` in mathematics.
Then we can describe a reference dot similarly:

``` jsx
  <ReferenceDot x="Page C"  y={1000} stroke="green" label="Min PAGE"/>
  <ReferenceLine x="Page C" xAxisId={2}  y={1000} yAxisId={1}  label="Max" stroke="red" strokeDasharray="3 3"/>
```

@arcthur @vanthiyathevan @bkniffler @Cloudo 
 The mathematics formula is great. The `ReferenceLine` has not only two kinds of types, 'vertical' or 'horizontal', but that is most useful. That may be a formula types, such as curve and discontinuous lines. So we can combine formula, and custom render option.
 Implemented in v0.8.0
  When a reference line is present, the yaxis domain should include the `ReferenceLine` value. Right now the reference line get rendered out side the domain. See the screenshot where the goal value is at 10%

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1296183/13154813/ccd5f142-d648-11e5-9086-2f75304e5857.png)
 Thanks!
This bug related to two problems:
1. A warning should be given when the value of `ReferenceLine` is not within the domain of axis. 
2. The domain of a numeric types axis which has positive values should be minimum 0 by default. 

So I plan to change the default value of domain in `XAxis` and `YAxis` to `[0, 'auto']`. If the domain is specified as `['dataMin', 'dataMax']`, than the max of the axis is the maximum value of the input data, and  the min of the axis is the minimum value of the input data. And if the domain is specified as `['auto', 'auto']`, comprehensible scale ticks will be calculated, and the final domain of axis is generated by the ticks.
 Good idea! A `alwaysShow` props can be added to `ReferenceLine`.
 Yeah. Of course.
 Fixed in v0.8.0
  Fix in 0.7.0
  Actually, recharts didn't depend on whole lodash. The build config include [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash). That could be transformed the lodash import. The whole lodash file size is 400k+.

But the file size of recharts is really the problem. We will check the built file, and check d3-scale and lodash import. I planed create babel plugin like babel-plugin-babel to reduce the size. It will do after 1.0 release.
 The recharts ver 0.7.0 has reduced the lodash filesize, but the whole library size is bigger ;-) 
Now the webpack don't support ES2015 modules. Otherwise, we will reduce the smaller size.
I will take that to 1.0 release plan for new issue.
  I did an experiment and found no problem. Do you depend on `react-router` or any other packages which define history as a peerDependency?
 So that's it. My local npm version is 3.3.12, so no problem. 
 Yeah, it's really strange! I have used 0.6.3 for a long time .
 Thanks! I will fix these problems soon.
 It seems that the bug was resolved in npm2, but not properly fixed for npm3.

See the issue of react-router-redux:
[react-router-redux issue](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux/issues/133)
 I have try v3.4.0 and v3.7.3, the bug happened again.
So I checked the file [utils/tar](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/v3.7.3/lib/utils/tar.js#L75) in all the 3.x versions. Then I find that the bug wasn't fixed in any 3.x version.

So I submitted a [issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/11582).
Hope fixed soon.
 I fix the release script, and fix the history pack problem. We will publish next version to remove the package.
  Thanks! It's really a good idea.
We will add label of ReferenceLine in the next version.
 Fixed in v0.7.0.
http://recharts.org/api#ReferenceLine
  You can set the props `type` to be `monotone`, just like the following example

```
   <Line type="monotone" dataKey="pv" stroke="#8884d8" />
```

The props `type` of Line means the interpolation used to generate the curve.
We will optimize the api document in the few days.
  Have implemented In v0.7.0
http://recharts.org/examples#TwoSimplePieChart 
  Have implemented in v0.7.0.
http://recharts.org/examples#ComposedChartWithAxisLabels
  First of all Awesome library. I am trying this chart, so far very impressed at the ease of use.

But the following errors
- line chart `Cannot read property 'coord' of undefined` is being thrown when data length increases. Tracked it down to `getComposedData` function in `LineChart.js`. 
- `Cannot read property 'getStyle' of null` is being thrown when data is updated in `handleStyleChange()` function in Animate.js

This is my chart so far

``` jsx
<ResponsiveContainer>
  <LineChart data={data} margin={{ top: 15, right: 20, bottom: 5, left: 15 }}>
    <XAxis dataKey="date" strokeOpacity={0}/>
    <YAxis width={10} tickFormatter={() => {}} strokeOpacity={0}/>
    {
      graphs.map(g => (
        <Line
          key={g.name}
          {...g}
          label={<Labeler {...g} lastIndex={data.length - 1}/>}
          dot={g.dot !== false ? <Dotter {...g} /> : false }
        />
      ))
    }
   </LineChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>
```

Thank you
 Thanks! Can you give the full code in jsfiddle? 
Maybe you can fork one of our demo in http://recharts.org
 The first error is due to forget to update some states when data is update. 
This bug is fixed in version 0.6.3.
The second error is likely due to the props `strokeColors`  in `Dotter` is `undefined`, and the exception seems to be catched in React.

http://jsfiddle.net/rezxmfxm/5/
 I find that `strokeDasharray` doesn't  get applied because we change `strokeDasharray` to generate the animation effect of line. @jasonHzq 
We will consider this problem.
 Fixed in v0.7.0.
http://recharts.org/examples#DashedLineChart
  Initially I think the calculation of the with and height of the legend is very troublesome and expensive. so, I left part of location task to the user.Just like your example, adjusting the value of margin to {top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 35} can fix the problem.

But this's really not too convenient.
How do you look on this problem?
 Legend has been refactor in version 0.6.3
 Yeah, I  just want to get the width and height of `Legend` before the `Legend` will be rendered, so that it can avoid the change in size of a chart.

`Recalculating` like `react-dimensions` may bring a lot of callbacks. Is that right?
 I think most users should know that the `PropType` of `wrapperStyle` is consistent width `style` in `React`.  so I didn't add any format requirement in `PropType`.
It's repetitive  to add the `PropType` of all the css properties.
Remove 'px' in your example, the chart show normally.

http://jsfiddle.net/fxtwg1k7/3/

I wonder why no warning when the value of `bottom` and `fontSize` is wrong.
 @Cloudo 
Can you give me an example in  jsfiddle ? Or you can paste you code here. 
 I know you problem.

``` jsx
<PieChart width={300} height={300}>
  <Pie isAnimationActive={false} data={data01} fill="#8884d8" label/>
  <Tooltip/>
  <Legend/>
</PieChart>
```

The default value of props `cx` in Pie is `'50%'`, the default value of props `cy` in Pie is `'50%'`, and the default value of props `outerRadius` in Pie is `'80%'`.
When `cx`, `cy`, `outerRadius` are not specified, default values are used.
If I add a lot of restrictions of `cx`, `cy`, `outerRadius` internally, it will affect the flexibility of `PieChart`.

Maybe this problem can be solved by adjusting some parameters.
  It's really a problem.The state of LineChart is changing  when mouse is moving in the chart, because we keep the location of mouse in state.
 The most condition is the reference of array or object. I use lodash isEqual function to re-write pureRender. It works faster.

```
Line              yes: 1023      no: 0
Layer             yes: 1955      no: 2197
Curve             yes: 1245      no: 253
LineChart         yes: 556       no: 81
Surface           yes: 556       no: 0
CartesianGrid     yes: 0         no: 354
CartesianAxis     yes: 1215      no: 0
Legend            yes: 0         no: 47
Tooltip           yes: 481       no: 7
DefaultTooltip    yes: 481       no: 0
Dot               yes: 493       no: 497
```
 Thanks @Cloudo to support the project, and welcome to provide the better codes to improve the recharts. :smile:

Actually, `isEqual` isn't a better method that I may not spend much time to think about the problem. but the original `pureRender` is too simple that didn't satisfied most conditions, such as complex object. I will custom the better `pureRender` function to divisive the difference for next few days.
 Thanks @Cloudo  for  your enthusiasm.
I plan to refactor the chart components in the next period of time.
I think the components can be optimized in the following two points:
1. Store some auxiliary objects (axisMaps, offset and so on)
2. Don't store the position of cursor in state

The job involves so much components, may take longer.
P.S.  I'm sorry I didn't reply to you at the first time. We are on vacation for Chinese New Year, and we will start work next week.
 We optimized the pureRender function above official pureRender, that may be solved more problems. Always thanks!
  Hi, @checkraiser 
please share `package.json`, we could be check the problems.

Thank @Cloudo for help!
  Thanks for great advice! We will change `AdaptionWrapper` to `ResponsiveContainer` just a moment.
 Thanks~ Fixed in version 0.6.0
  Thanks!
Fixed in v0.5.1.
  I think the adaptation should be a concern of the container component, just like the example (http://jsfiddle.net/cmx66300/).

Maybe we can provide a component to wrap the chart. The wrapper component can do the event binding. 
 We add a wrapper component AdaptionWrapper in version 0.5.0. 
Here is an example (http://jsfiddle.net/Lpk2ky66).
And in the future we need to support percentage value of cx, cy, innerRadius, outerRadius in polar coordinate charts, such as  PieChart, RadarChart, RidalBarChart. 
 Support percentage value of cx, cy, innerRadius, outerRadius in v0.5.1
  Thanks ! We will constantly improve the library. We expect that you will use the library and give us more advice. 
  yeah, I add  this badge just now.
  @Cloudo 
Thank you very much!
Recharts is not prefect yet. util now, recharts do not support XY LineChart of C3 yet.
We will consider about XY LineChart.
 @Cloudo 
I think XY LineChart of C3 is much more like ScatterChart with line jointed by all points.
Add the points in the demo of C3 are ordered by x-coordinate.
So we add curve in scatter, and the type of line can by 'joint' and 'fitting'. 
The 'joint' curve in scatter just joint all the points.
The 'fitting'  curve is more difficult which we will support in the future.

Maybe you can look for  the demo in ScatterChart.
