  ### Details for the issue

I tried downloading the nightly windows installer (64 and 32 bit) so that I could get json support that is not currently available in the release version.  When I double click the executable in windows explorer (or choose open from the context menu), nothing happens.  If I run the executable from the command line, the installer runs and the nightly build is correctly installed.   I'm not entirely sure why the executable will not launch.  I do not get any kind of indication that the process started, nor do I see anything in process explorer that indicates that the installer started.

 I "unblocked" the app in the properties pane and it's working.  I didn't even think about digital signatures.  Sorry about that.  I so appreciate the help.  I guess windows 10 must not show that dialog that it does on windows 7, or I have some setting that suppresses those things.  On the Browse Data tab.  I have a table with 80 rows.  When I scroll to the bottom it reports "65-0 of 0"

2 pictures are the same table but the top is not scrolled to the end.

Further comment;  the button "Jump 100 rows", I would have it expected to jump only a page, so 16 rows.  If not for the tool tip I would have called it a bug on this 80 row database because it jumped to the end. Hi.

 Oh right, I forgot.  At work I'm on the last release.  At home I have a
night release.  I'll take a look later when I get home.  :)  ### Details for the issue

If there is a way to set all selected field to null (in brownse data), I did not find it. I have seen that I could delete all the entry in once, but I'm not shure it's the same as setting these field as NULL. So I did it one by one manually using the buttons "set as null" and "apply", which was quite a job.

It would be intuitive to have a right click option : "set as null"

thanks for your awesome job!

PS: " fill out the correct check boxes": I don't see any checkbox , just raw text.

 By the way it would even better to implement a "replace all fields by", so you could set to NULL or whatever.

ps: I'm impressed you already looked at it. Thanks a lot for all you have done (even if you don't implement that!)  ### Details for the issue

I often use a db instead of a spreadsheet, and I would use the possibility to hide columns in order to focus only on certain fields. Views don't seem a solution to this because they cannot edit data.

 How would one go about showing back the hidden column, do we want to selectively hide columns and then have a mass show all hidden? Or maybe put them in a list? Mass show works for me, if you want to make it simple.
For hiding, would be good if one could select several columns, and hide all at once.   ### Details for the issue

Windows 7 Sorry my fault, after update to 3.9.1 sw worked fine.

Thx.  ### Details for the issue
I have a table with lots and lots of columns and when browsing data it's very difficult to see column names that are on the longer side, so I've been double clicking the spacer between columns, which adjusts the column width to the name.  Is there any way to do this across all columns without having to manually double click each spacer?

If not, is that something you'd consider adding in a future update?

Thanks.

 @justinclift Exactly! :)  I don't like the selection model available for tables, it doesn't respect `Ctrl` and `Shift` as one would expect and instead treats everything as a `Shift` selection. @justinclift Sure, when I get the time if someone hasn't done it yet. To clarify, I'm talking about the edit multiple cells feature, the underlying column selection is an issue to itself and would require some non-trivial structural changes.  Changing the page size has no effect when done either in the GUI or in SQL query window. Database is brand new, no tables yet. Have tried with all different journal modes too, no change.

PRAGMA main.page_size = 8192;

Fixes #1002 

Code could be a lot slimmer, didn't poke around as much as I could, "first timer" so a bit of reuse and ideally we should be able to fetch headers without running through the entire file (so the last commit was more of a poc) but would make for a more streamlined experience. Suggestions and improvements welcome ofc.

> How did you add the files? (Did you associate .csv files with DB4S? If so, is there any limit, by the OS, on how many files to open like this?)

The way this feature worked initially and still does with this multiple selection variation is that it fetches the list of names first (that a user can then cherry pick from) then opens a stream, parses and performs actions after in a sequential order over the selected files. The open dialog filters what formats are allowed and the internal parser will warn/skip/err on bad files (invalid csvs). I had a folder with ~7k files with thousands of rows and including decoding and inserting took a little over half hour on a Dell XPS 15 running x64 Win 10.

> What if the user add a file using File > Import > CSV? (Can he add more once this dialog is open?)

I added an (experimental until review) feature to *Match similar* files by checking headers (the green highlight in the gif above) so once you have selected a list of files there is no need to manually sort them before to ensure they are in the same format, hence no need to prompt for more files.

@chrisjlocke Anything below WinXP was hardcoded due to memory constraints and dependent on runtimes. IIRC WinXP itself had a limit of `1024 * 2` and I'd like to think modern OSes limits are more denoted by available memory *(don't quote me on that ;)*. @MKleusberg Ah! Thanks, forgot about that and looking forward to it.  ### Details for the issue
Unexpected behaviour.
Seems like the "Execute SQL" and "Execute current line" buttons are crossed.

I want to run this code
```
SELECT * FROM Transactions 
WHERE [Date] Between '2017-05-23 00:00:00:001' 
AND '2017-05-23 23:59:59'
```
If I select the first line "_SELECT * FROM Transactions_ " and click the Execute SQL arrow >  
`This is the output:  4 rows returned in 0ms from: SELECT * FROM Transactions`

but if I click the Execute Current Line the output is:
```
2 rows returned in 0ms from: SELECT * FROM Transactions 
WHERE [Date] Between '2017-05-23 00:00:00:001' 
AND '2017-05-23 23:59:59'
```

 Hi.

I only discovered and downloaded your app yesterday 23 May 2017. sorry the screen grab image didn't show.
it's///

Version 3.9.1
Qt Version 5.7.1
SQL Cipher Version 3.11.0 As a fellow developer I'd be happy to :) I can't download it from that address here at work.  I'll try it in a few
hours from home.  :) Version 3.9.99
Qt 5.7.1
Sqlite 3.18.0

Same problem.

Ok so using only the tool I created a new db with "Table1" with fields
(Integer) Id, (Text) Name, (Integer) Age
I inserted 3 rows:

Insert into Table1 (Id, Name, Age)
Values (1, "Ray", 1),
(2, "Bob", 2),
(3, "Pierce", 3)

Now I query the table:

Select * from Table1
Where Age <= 2

but highlight just the first row *Select * from Table1*

Execute SQL F5
3 rows returned in 0ms from: Select * from Table1

Execute Current Line Shift+F5

2 rows returned in 0ms from: Select * from Table1

Where Age <= 2 It's a good tool.  Keep at it.
I'll add more comments as I play about with it some more.

In Visual Studio 2010 all "bit" rows are returned as "False" even when the
values in them are mixed "False" / "0" etc.  That's why I went looking for
another tool.  It was with the help of your tool that I could see what's
happening.  VS was hiding the problem. Just tried it there.   Highlighting is required.

Anyway I woke up this morning thinking that there should be only 1
button.   If nothing is highlighted then it runs the whole script, but if a
selection is highlighted then only the selection gets run.  This, I would
consider to be expected / normal behaviour.  This is how it works in
SSMS or Rapid for Sybase.


As I was saying, I think it's a very good little app and I think as I'm
just moving to SQLite (for mobile) that I'm going to rely on it for working
against the db since as I mentioned before Visual Studio is doing a botched
job with the bits so not great for a learner.   Also marks against VS it
gives me the usual suspects for field data types; money, double, float,
etc... when SQLite has only 4.

 1)  If I put this code in it will fail no matter where I put the cursor.  I
think that it should, this would be expected behaviour

select * from Tags where Id <= 2
select * from Tags where Id >= 3

If I highlight a single line it will run with F5.   Shift+F5 will result in
error.

2)
If I split the lines

select * from Tags
where Id <= 2

select * from Tags
where Id >= 3

Only F5 will work as expected.  So if I select just "select * from Tags"  I
get the full result set.   If I include the 'where' in the string it works
as expected.
Shift + F5 does not work.

My vote is to get rid of the Shift+F5 button.

 I think we might be over complicating the problem now at this point.  Might
need to remind ourselves to keep it simple?


Yes I understand that it concatenates the lines.
Is adding the ; is bogus?  Is that how it's done in the other 'big player'
apps? I know I don't consciously use it when I'm scripting outside of C#.



select * from Transactions (*C1)
where Id <= 3; (*C1)
select * from Transactions  (*C2)
where Id >= 4;  (*C2)

Placing the cursor at (*C1) or (*C2)   Press F5 = results from only second
query every time = OK it just ran through.

Shift+F5 = result from whichever query the cursor resides inside of.


When I highlight some text F5 will just run the highlighted text.



I see it now but I think the app is running as You expect it to. Is that
good to the end user coming from the big players SSMS etc?  I'd be looking
to nullify the learning curve as much as possible.

Personally I'm happy to select / highlight the code I want to run.  That's
what I know.
In the case of Embarcadero Rapid if I run multiple queries like above then
I get multiple result sets (in the same grid). No semi colon required.

 "*You can't 'assume' that lines beginning with 'select' is a new statement,
as you can have multiple 'select' statements in a select statement.*"  Yes
- very good.  I don't know how the boffins do it.  I've never put my mind
to it.




Hello fellow .Net-er back!
I grew up in VB6 land which ultimately led me to .Net.  I strongly urge
anyone to cross over to C#.  It's not that hard but it does have extra
features and it becomes much slicker to use.  Right now I want to use C# +
Xamarin to create a mobile app across the 3 platforms.  (That can't be done
with VB.NET)   The mobile dev led me to SQLite as a universal data
solution.  I hope I got that right, will it work on win phone, android and
ios?   VS2017 won't develop for Windows Phone 8, only Win10.  So I'm also
developing in VS2015.  I prototype and develop the backend in my free
time at work on an antique VM using XP and VS2010 using WPF + MVVM that I
can take home for porting out to the other apps.   Fekin nuts!  But when
it's done I'll put it up on git then I'll have another little thing to put
on my CV in case Brexit kills off my job - since it's already giving me all
of this free time right now by causing the markets to panic and hold off
spending.

 Back on topic.

I would with a reflex CTRL+E to run the script.   I'm sure I got this habit
from SSMS ;)  Open SQL file dialog should default to the same path as the database; instead it opens home folder (tested on Windows). Suit only if you work on a single directory. If you use multiple databases in different places it is still uncomfortable. I would favor an option to open the directory where the active database is.    ### Details for the issue

- An attempt to open the installed DB Browser for SQLite v.3.9.1 in the Windows XP (32 bit) environment returns error "DB Browser for SQLite.exe is not a valid Win32 application"

### Useful extra information

Since the original topic #893 "was locked and limited conversation to collaborators on 27 Feb", but there are still noob users like me and #986 around, that just wish to adopt DB Browser for SQLite 3.9.1 to their beloved Win32 XP machines, hereby I will provide you with easy to understand "entry-level" solutions to this issue.

@h1618 
> if you are able to operate a hexeditor, just changing offset 0x40 and 0x44 of the sqlitebrowser.exe executable from 0x0006 (Vista) to 0x0005 (XP) is all that's needed

- Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to perform or calculate location for those manipulations, so this link to the image file with the screenshot of hex-code comparison between unpatched (left) and patched (right) files should give you an idea of what exactly is it there to be changed and where it is located within a hex editor: http://www.hadrurus.com/andiutils/DB4S/SQLite3.9.1HexPatch.jpg

or 

@karim

> A quick solution is by editing the .exe file using editbin and change the subsystem right after building it. 

- I didn't want to seek and install all of Microsoft Visual Studio, so for this method you should go to: http://www.hadrurus.com/andiutils/DB4S/EditBinPack.rar and download:
1. EditBinPack.rar

Then extract all files contained in EditBinPack.rar archive to the folder with the installed DB Browser for SQLite (in Windows XP usually at C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite) on your PC. Now [Start] > [Run] > {_type_} **CMD** > [OK] > {_type_} **CD\\** {Enter} > {_type_} **CD PROGRAM FILES\DB BROWSER FOR SQLITE** {Enter} and finally {_type_}:
> **EDITBIN DBBROW~1.EXE /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.01 /OSVERSION:5.1** {Enter}

After that manipulation is done, check your "DB Browser for SQLite.exe" for runnability, and if all is OK, you're set to use program as usual. 

At last, just like me, enjoy latest DB Browser for SQLite v.3.9.1 on your Windows XP!

P.S. I could provide here a link to the patched file itself, and this way it would be even easier to just substitute one file with another, but I am not sure whether I am allowed to do so here.

 Hey, @chrisjlocke! You are welcome! I felt very happy too, when both solutions worked. ) OK, I'll try attaching the image with the 1st solution to this comment. Let's see if it works. Once again:

 I am not sure whether during compilations data in the PE header is always written into exactly the same addresses, as yet I have no experience in this at all. But I think with basis given by the screenshot next time it would be easier to spot the location of wanted data (at least I would have an idea about what am I looking for). To the 'Hex' method I actually came from executing 'EditBin' method, and then replicated changes performed by editbin.exe manually in my hex editor. So I agree with you that 'EditBin' method looks more reliable and sounds like the correct one. As I've read further, it looks that there are differences in link.exe files and that newer generations of that file won't let editbin.exe to set a version prior to what was limited in its code by Microsoft, instead saying something like "LINK : warning LNK4241: invalid subsystem version 5.01". Again, I might be wrong. Anyways, the link to the three files I gave in method 2, do allow to write a program's OS compatibility to subsystem 5.01. The correspondent option would be:

`editbin.exe "$(TargetPath)" /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.01 /OSVERSION:5.1`

Like I said before, I am totally noob in programming, though sometimes I manage to put some parts of puzzles together, and even in this comment I mostly rely on the information obtained from: https://supportxpdotcom.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/editbins-dirty-little-secret @chrisjlocke, I really don't know where did you get it and why did you use that command shown in your CMD prompt screenshot, i.e:
 
`link "DB Browser for SQlite.exe" /subsystem:windows, 5.01 /osversion:5.1`

as I've never suggested that. It is totally wrong! Though I must agree that my syntax explanation could be a bit complicated...

So next I'll post a series of screenshots, to make sure that you know exactly what to do (what I was doing), without extra strange symbols in my syntax. I won't even rename "DB Browser for SQLite.exe" for anything else, as I have suggested earlier, so that you see step-by-step exactly how it happens.

- Pack of 5 files for EditBin's smooth run, though I don't think that mspdb100.dll is necessary. All of these files have been copied to "DB Browser for SQLite" installation folder:

 Mm, sorry, I cannot see a single instance of "**editbin.exe**" in your screenshot, I see word "**link**" instead. Well, it doesn't matter. I've supplied the more clear example of EditBin use, without any of that somewhat confusing syntax. Also, I think that one cannot run commands on long filenames in CMD environment, that is why I suggested to use short name at first. Short name for **DB Browser for SQLite.exe** would be **DBBROW~1.EXE**



 I'll try latest nightly this weekend (getting pretty short on time by now, soz), I'll let you know if I'll come with the similar result. )))) Installed both on a 32bit Windows XP box. Good news is, both installed without problem, and both had PE's subsystem set to 5.1. Bad news is both raised an error popup immediately after start: "The application terminated as a result of a CTRL+C." This very error I have seen already with other new Qt apps, and I think it is because qt5core.dll has two missing imports, one being CancelIoEx in kernel32.dll - I think this missing import is misinterpreted as having hit Ctrl+C. The Qt libraries all have version 5.8.0.0, and The Qt Company states that the last version that runs on XP is 5.6 - seems they're right. Hey to everyone! With the latest build for tests by @justinclift same here, on Windows XP.

 Again tested on my 32bit XP box: installs and works like a charm, no issues found playing around a little bit with my sqlite3 databases - thanks a lot! Dear @justinclift the latest test published by you about two hours ago **works flawlessly**! I want to thank you and everyone in this topic for their contribution to this issue! I've originally started this topic only because the support for Windows XP by DB4S wasn't officially dropped, while the solutions I've read in #893 initially were not exactly clear to me in terms of their application. Sorry, but unfortunately I have almost no knowledge of programming and coding, and I was unable to contribute more to this issue myself. I've updated links in my original post to my website's server, so that people, if that would be of their interest, won't have to go through strange "dodgy" foreign websites, but rather use direct links instead. Thank you all, once again! Here goes the happy screenshot of the latest test:

 Aye, @justinclift and it looks like @karim has an eagle eye as indeed with Qt 5.7 both of your Win32 linked files still function perfectly within Windows XP 32-bit native environment. ))))

 Personally I am increasingly astounded that people still use XP, many Open Source projects have dropped support for it or provide an old version "as-is". I don't believe we should let XP support stop progress. also confirming that both v5 versions (Qt 5.7) installed and work on my windows xp x86 box without issues. Had medium thorough tests with real world test data, editing/inserting/deleting data, encryption, decryption, and all went smooth and worked as it should. Hello everyone! Since I've started this mess, let me explain my position on the Windows XP. Like many, I've been chasing the progress and had always tried to get most modern things at a time. But later I've got fed up with the fact that everything "latest" is also is the most unreliable. You buy a new latest Supermicro motherboard, and hey, they've just found a problem and made a new revision that as well supports your latest Xeons better... - very disappointing, especially after throwing away a few thousands bucks and instead of receiving the quality expected, you're suddenly losing your time on workarounds, anxiously waiting for a newer BIOS release full of hope that it would solve some of your troubles, and feeling yourself a complete idiot. So I've decided to quit being a corporate tester of their newest devices at my own expense, and now I first wait for others to come up with their comparisons and results, letting time for people to draw up their own conclusions, so that later I'd do a wiser choice based on true user experience rather than on bright, promising ads. How is it related to software? Well, similarly: security updates, software updates, patches, service packs, etc., etc., they've caused so many glitches, halts and screens of death, bringing so much unnecessary headaches and troubles, many of which took whole days to recover. You probably cannot even imagine the other world without the "everyday" updates, which are often a threat to your stable work more than any viruses (in fact in 26 years of my PC experience I've NEVER lost a bit of information because of a virus, but I've lost tones of useful data because of unstable and poorly tested updates). Since Microsoft has dropped updating the Windows XP, it became the perfect machine. All of their updates for my Windows XP are pre-downloaded into separate folder, case there would be a need for reinstall, and my PC is finally set to work for me, as opposed of me constantly servicing my PC instead. Plus, I am also a music production related dude, and much of professional (very long life span) music equipment works perfectly on Window XP, while often there are simply no hardware drivers available for the newer operating systems. Another reason that makes Windows XP still popular are laptops, that are pretty slow with vendor pre-installed software, _but hey, I got an old copy of Windows XP lying around.., that's way better_. Last, but not least. I am Russian, and all of the Russian government is using Windows XP only on their PCs. Why? Because Microsoft has provided the open-source of its Windows XP (including patches) to the Russian government, and Kaspersky Labs have guaranteed that there are no back-doors built in that OS. With today's political agenda, can you be so sure with any other modern OS that NSA is not recording your every step?  Maybe it is not of your concern, but some people do care. Who said that hackers and viruses are the bigger danger than governments, corporations and "updates"? xD
Now seriously, today I am finally very sure, that when I switch my PC on, I won't spend time on updates and recoveries, but would simply do my tasks as was planned. **Am I missing anything? Not yet.** Antivirus and Firewall take care of my security, every software instrument that I need is right here, fine-tuned. Hybrid HDDs make my machine crazy smooth. Would I update to the latest Windows when Windows XP would finally fall? No. I'd go for Windows 7.
Why do I use DB4S? Mm, I regularly edit quite a few SQL .db files from my Android, as Android apps that I need and use mostly lack synchronization availability, or require Cloud services. Thus I edit them on my PC in your DB4S and once edited I synchronize them back to my smartphone, kinda Server/Client scenario.
About the Qt 5.7, Qt 5.8 situation and Windows XP. I suggest, if you wouldn't mind, that you only make **official releases** being compatible with Windows XP, like the case with the 4.9.1 pack that originated this topic. I am pretty sure, that most people that use  Nightlies, probably would be the people of different kind, than those slow-pokes with their Windows XP's. It is very reasonable to dedicate yourself to progress, but also keep an eye on your conservative audience. Well, all this is IMHO, so eventually it is up to you folks to decide on that part, just keep in mind that Windows XP is still 3rd most popular OS.

P.S.1 Personally, I'd set a date in my schedule, let's say 01.10.2017 and check how software market is doing. Till the set date I would stay on Qt 5.7 in everything, or if a higher Qt would **truly** become necessary before, I would simply write "_Windows XP is no longer supported by DB4S since XX.XX.XXXX. Last available release that supports Windows XP is X.X.X you can download it in our archives section._", or something of that kind.

P.S.2 "_Windows XP, too good, too old.., blah, blah_". Instead, please tell me why does Microsoft still feature 32-bit version of their latest Windows 10? )  @justinclift maybe name it 4.9.2? Because I would imagine that some XP users have already received their earlier notification within their DB4S of 4.9.1 update, tried it, it didn't work, and they decided to stay with their DB4S 4.9.0 till next attempt (as I would do if I wouldn't happen to come across #893).

 @justinclift  Sorry, I marked the wrong version in the post. I'm using the latest version, 3.9.1, just corrected the same in the post.   Single-line SQL comments cause peculiar behaviour if run in the "Execute SQL" tab.

Say I run the following:
`-- This comment prevents line count working and "changes the database"`
`SELECT * FROM events WHERE logid=81991 AND type='content'`
then 
- I don't get the usual "N rows returned" message
- the database is locked and Write/Revert changes are enabled
- the correct result is returned

Alternatively, if I run:
`SELECT * FROM events WHERE logid=81991 AND type='content'`
`-- This comment causes an error`
then 
- I get an "Error executing query: ..." response
- no result is returned

In this case I can see that the SQL submitted by the application has had the line breaks removed, so the extra `SELECT COUNT(*) ...` that's added to give a line count is syntactically wrong, as the terminating `);` has become commented-out.

Finally (so far), if I try to execute:
`SELECT 40+2 -- get the answer`
`AS answer`
(N.B. `AS` is at the start of the line) then 
- I get an "Error executing query: ..." response
- no result is returned

In this case the comment and newline have been removed completely, with the result that what's executed is `SELECT 40+2AS answer` (no whitespace between `2` and `AS`).

I'd suggest the quick approach is to replace single-line comments with a single space, if you don't mind them being discarded from the submitted SQL. If you want to leave them in then you can't discard the newlines, as they're syntactically significant...

 @justinclift: OK, I've tried the nightly win64 and it fixes the latter two, but not the first one. I'm slightly wrong now in the report title, as the first problem is also caused by a `/* block comment */` at the start, so it's not specific to the `-- line comment`. I've double-checked that the database is locked until I Revert Changes.

I've also found another case:
`SELECT '-- cause error'`
causes an error!  You can have block comments in SQL?! 😲 

@justinclift, Surely it is 😢  But I don't know how to solve other more complex cases like `SELECT 'this -- causes error'`. I don't have the ability to re-compile from source, but I've been playing with regexes a bit in Python, and I think
 `^((?:(?:[^'-]|-(?!-))*|(?:'[^']*'))*)(--.*)$` 
yields two captured groups, the first is the SQL code and the second is the line comment. This relies on NOT concatenating the lines of a multi-line SQL statement (remove the line comments before concatenation, assuming this is being done).

As far as I can tell this is a legal regex in Qt. I tested it against the following:
`SELECT 'string -- not a comment '' - single quote'  -- comment 'not a string' -- not the whole comment`
Note that the regex doesn't match the SQL if there's no comment, e.g.:
`SELECT 'string -- not a comment '' - single quote'  `

@revolter  You can indeed have block comments, see [http://sqlite.org/lang_comment.html](url). I haven't played with removing those but I suspect one could construct similar tricky cases there, too! From what I remember, it doesn't concatenate the lines prior to removing comments.

I hoped for QScintilla to have something to remove comments, knowing it already detects and highlights them, but I didn't find any function that does this.

And, nice regex you have there, could you please explain it a bit? As I only understand them best when I write them. Here you go, @revolter - like any code, regexes are pretty much write-only! I think there are ways to comment them, but I'm too lazy usually...
```
^((?:(?:[^'-]|-(?!-))*|(?:'[^']*'))*)(--.*)$
^                                          $ # anchor beginning and end of string so we use it all
 (                                  )(    )  # two separate capture groups for code and comment
                                      --.*   # comment starts with -- and consumes everything afterwards
  (?:                 |           )*         # code is none or many strings alternating with non-strings
                       (?:'[^']*')           # a string is a quote, followed by none or more non-quotes, followed by a quote
     (?:[^'-]|-(?!-))*                       # non-string is a sequence of characters which aren't quotes or hyphens, 
                                               OR if they are hyphens then they can't be followed immediately by another hyphen
```
   Has this been started by any chance? If you can outline any more specifics on how this should be implemented I can tackle it this weekend. Currently in need of this and first time to the project page. I can work with that, we can always iterate on the PR. Thanks. @justinclift Seemed out of place with the actual issue? (didn't read most of the comments) so I removed it. Yup, I have a basic working first draft. I should have it up sometime later, have some other stuff to take care of. Hi guys, real life hit like a sack of bricks so had to afk for a few. Finishing up and will open a PR shortly. Not sure if I will need to write tests as you will see but added some small additional functionality. Will need some help making it conform better to the org style and cleaning up the code, thanks.

@karim I think the features I added maybe negated the need for folder selection and the need for prompting for more files to import after, let me know however, keen to see this in after reviews as I have just used it to import some ~7000 files that hold thousands of rows of training data for a neural net.

If it turns out this went horribly in the wrong direction however ;), hopefully someone can [pick some useful bits from my code](https://github.com/iKlsR/sqlitebrowser/tree/cvs-multi-import) if I can't find the time to edit.

Some minor thoughts on existing behavior
- Some dialogs could probably be skipped at times (Decoding CSV) if the file sizes are below a certain size as the dialog will flash for a second, makes for a somewhat "disjoint" experience at times.
- Tooltips or the dialog help buttons could help document *exactly* what some of the options do.  ### Ubuntu Rendering Issue When There is a Long View or Trigger

There is a rendering issue on the 'Database Structure' tab when using DB Browser for SQLite under Ubuntu when there is a long view or trigger. I suspect there is some problem with limitless horizontal scrolling.

 It happens before I've loaded any data. The trigger is something I'm
writing and related to Canadian taxes. You could probably reproduce it with
multiple kilobytes of random 'ipsum lorem' comments above a simple select
type view. I can probably make a demonstration database that would exhibit
the error if you're interested.
  ### Details for the issue

I suggest that the user is allowed to scroll 50% of the window height beyond the end of the file. It feels a bit, erm, _odd_ when it doesn't let me.

I'm using a Kubuntu 17.04 system where I manually installed sqlite3.18 and manually libsqlite3.18, for example our JDBC driver now loads the installed system lib which is 3.18.
On opening SqliteBrowser 3.9.1 under the about window I get the information the loaded SQliteVersion is 3.15.2

Where is the browser loading the sqlite implementation? The system one, and if yes where is it loading from the system, because it is not the default one, or is the 3.15.2 included in sqlitebrowser? If yes, can you please upgrade version?

 I have this same problem, too. I don't know qmake/cmake well enough to know what kind of configuration option to pass in to point it to the correct sqlite3 files.

I have sqlite3 installed and compiled from src: `SQLite version 3.19.0 2017-04-29 19:29:49`
  @justinclift That would be really great!! thx a lot! Hi @justinclift,

Have you had a chance to update the docs? The steps provided by @MKleusberg worked great! Now my sqlitebrowser from git master is in sync with my sqlite version.

Thanks!  After updating the row in my database with my own script, and despite my database actually is updated with the correct data, when I view the database in sqlite browser the changes are not reflected. I deleted the original database from everywhere and restarted and I get the same results.

If I uninstall sqlite browser and reinstall, then the changes appear, tried to uninstall again and this time it didnt even work the changes do not appear. -  Version of DB4S is 3.9.1.
- Yes
- Yes
- Yes

1. Pull the database directly from my Android device using ADB. 
2. Close DB4S and delete the local database, before reopening to view the new database.
3. Verified in my application on the device that the data is updated.
4. Use an app browser on the device to verify the data is indeed updated.
5. Check in DB4S, no change.
5. Copy the database from the device, and compress to an archive, copy archive to local storage
6. and repeat from the no2 of the this list. 

Result is always the same: DB4S is not showing the updated data.

Does it not work like this? Can I not pull the database to local storage and view updates?
 Ahh thank you, I did wonder if it was because of wal mode. I think that's
the culprit, will check. Yep it because of WAL mode. When disabling WAL mode everything works great, all updates are reflected just fine when exporting the database from my device. Thanks for the help.

So DB4S does not support WAL mode?  ### Details for the issue

 Thanks for the quick feedback.  It seems that clicking the column header only works in the "Browse Data" tab and not from the "Execute SQL" tab.  After changing the formatting from the Browse Data tab, it doesn't seem to apply to the columns in Execute SQL.

At any rate, I have a couple of options as a workaround.

Sqlitebrowser crashes when viewing an SQL view in the Browse Data tab.

Background: This crash happens when viewing an SQL view in the browser tab.  I can reproduce the crash with a large database but not with a small test DB. To cause the crash, I just open the view, then idle. After a short time (varies), sqlitebrowser will crash.

 @justinclift Ubuntu 16.04 and prior version are effected. 

Ubuntu 16.04 and 14.04 are LTS version. 16.04 End of Life Cycle is in April 2021 and 14.04 is in April 2019. Which is a concern if we are unable to pack our software for these distros.

Meanwhile i will try to find a work around or fix.   ### Details for the issue

I created a simple db with 5 tables.  I can view and update it locally (through command-line or DB4S), but when I try to place the .db file on my school server, I hit the following:

Error:	local: unable to open C:\RIT\ISTE_646\rogue6_project1\RIT-esports\db\sqlite\sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3180000\ESports.db
Error:	Critical file transfer error

None of the other files in the project are having this problem, and I transferred an earlier version of the same db a few days ago with no apparent issue.  When I deleted the entire project from the server and started over, every other folder and file transferred successfully.

 Sorry, should have been more clear.  I originally created my SQLite db from the command-line, and was able to upload it to RIT using FileZilla no problem.  I decided to revamp the schema, so I deleted the file from the server.  In the meantime, I installed DB4S, and recreated the db through the UI.  I have no idea whether that's a factor, but now when I try to upload the file, I get the above error. You, sir, are one of the good things in this life.  I closed out of DB4S and still had the problem.  When I exited sqlite3 from the shell, I was able to upload successfully.  Thanks very much.  Chanches Good)   When I open a new database I'm always asked to enter the key used to encrypt the data base file. but as I've never encrypt the file In don't know what to type?

  ### Details for the issue
Hi,
DB Browser is useful and easy to use. I have one question about the text color.
The default text color in "Browse Data" is black. I always modify the default color to my favorite color, but these changes cannot be fixed. When I restart the application, these colors that I modified before are all set to default color(black).
Please help to solve this problem.
Thank you very much.

 Hi justinclift
Thanks for your help. This problem is solved.
 I downloaded **DB Browser for SQLite_20170330.dmg**, and it works fine.  ### Details for the issue

Similar to #894 The font of the bottom cannot be edited, and I don't have the default font that sqlitebrowser uses, so it shows up as just black squares. The SQL query window above had the same issue, but I was able to change the font of that one to get it to display correctly.

 No, I hadn't. Using DB4S version 3.9.99 (2017-03-30-win64) from the nightly builds does fix the font issue, however, it seems like that bottom log is using the same font as the "SQL Log" but a separate size setting whereas the right-side log is using the same font size as the editor.

- "SQL *editor* font" - affects all 3 locations
- "SQL *editor* font size - affects the editor and right-side log
- "SQL *log* font size" - affects just the bottom log

The naming scheme for the options is very unclear as to what they actually edit. There likely needs to be separate options for each location or a change in the naming scheme.  ### Details for the issue

On german UI under "Hilfe" there is a "SQL Ciper FAQ" item, which should be "SQL Cipher" I guess. The same "SQLCiper-Version" text also shows up in the about dialog for the version (3.11.0)

### Useful extra information

Portable App, if I switch UI language to english it is fine.

 Strange enough I dont see the bug in the translation file, the About dialog seems to be translated correctly and the help menu is untranslated. Is there another place for the translations of Windows Portable DB Browser?

Just to make sure I am not hallucinating:

 Yes I an confirm it is fixed in the nightly build.  Hello. I made full ikrainian translation for sqlitebrowser.

Please test it and add to main repo/

https://github.com/keedhost/sqlitebrowser-ukrainian Yes Can you make for me any screenshots with ukrainian version on Mac?  I don't know why but on FreeBSD 11 same problem like on Windows: after choosing ukrainian and restarting app, locale sets to default. Who knows?  I can recheck all the translation, but i haven`t used this program before. So i cant understand some function even in English :( @justinclift I will try to check it all at the weekends.   ### Details for the issue
Kindly pardon this bizarre interruption. My mind is going fast as I age, though I'm relatively young (66) by popular standards. Really, I have trouble focusing. No, this isn't particularly important since I have minimal use for DB SQLite Browser and my current version 3.8.0 does what I need it to do. I was contacted in January saying that my suggestion for Open in read-only mode was adopted and would I kindly test it. Excuse me but I did not do so. But because I kept getting a message touting a newer version available (yes I know I can stifle that message) I did eventually download your DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.9.1-win32 and it installed without a balk but when I went to run the installed program I got the system error message that it wasn't "a valid Win32 application". This surprises and confounds me some unless it maybe relates to WXP no longer being supported. Of course I tried downloading anew (some weeks later) but the result was identical. Sorry to bother you kind guys.

 Many thanks for that. Sure, I would ditch this machine in a flash and get a W10 PC (this one, I'm fairly sure, isn't W10 hardware compatible). Another PC of mine runs W10 and I'm disappointed I can't get the game Snood 4.10 to operate right on it. But your advice hasn't fallen on deaf ears so just know that - thanks again. Over and out. Thank you for not forgetting about me, though I was content using v3.8. But YES, I was able to make the cited patch (using an old pgm I had called binedit) and now my v3.9.1 works fine under WXP. I don't immediately see where/how one opens a database read-only, but I trust it is there somewhere/somehow, and don't think for a moment that this is any longer the teensiest bit important to me anymore. Thank you nonetheless!!  ### Details for the issue

I can't get a floating window to dock at the main window's borders. Hovering the dock above the main window has no effect.

Double clicking on the title bar of a floating window correctly docks it to the main window.

  Would be great if there was a proper updater instead of the popup that tells me to go and download the latest version when opening the app.
Keep up the good work!
 I'm not arguing about the necessity of the pop-up :-)
Just the trip to the site, download and install which can be done as part of the application.
See Notepad++ for example, and many others.
If a user doesn't want to update he should just click cancel.
For me, the necessity to download something and then install it is what sometimes prevents me from updating an application (just sharing my point of view as a user :-))  I agree with HarelM. It is always nice when you can upgrade so seamlessly. :0) And Notepad++ is indeed quite nice example of that. Although it is downloading installer first but it discards it after that I hope.  I just installed version 3.9.1.
My file association was targeting the previous version (3.8.x) which made me understand that it wasn't removed as part of the installation of the latest version...

   Once I encrypt the .db file from DB Browser, i am unable to read .db file from uwp application.

I am getting error like "**file is encrypted or is not a database**". Please help me.

Note : I am using "Sqlite.net-plc" for connect SQLite DB to UWP application.  ### Details for the issue
I am using sqlite in multi-threaded environment where multiple applications use sqlite queries to perform get/set operations on attributes available in sqlite db tables. Intermittently i am seeing applications crashing when get operation is performed which intern call sqlite3_prepare_v2.
Crash is not frequent. I rarely see this issue. One thing to notice that, I never hit this issue when i was using 3.8.10.2. First time i hit the issue only after updating 3.15.2. 
Following is the GDB back trace for the same. Please let me know if this is a known issue and if its fixed in latest sqlite version.

 @justinclift ,
I downloaded SQLite tarball (**sqlite-autoconf-3150200.tar.gz**) from **https://sqlite.org/download.html** and I am using SQLite as library itself. Not using SQLite browser.
Also, i guess if its a linking problem then i should face the problem every time using SQLite APIs. But i am facing this issue once in a while and its quiet random.    Sure. I will drop a mail to SQLite support group. Thanks for the help.  Just want to know if I can go to next table with some shortcut. When I am browsing the tables, I need to click in their name in drop-down menu. Then, to go to next, need to do the same thing. 

Why not a simple shortcut or icon to go to next table. This will make my life really easier.  @chrisjlocke I am using the Mac OS X. I tried what you say. Here is ⌘+T. But doing the same thing, when I press down, it just go down one cell. Even if I focus the drop-down menu, the down button don't work. 
Maybe this is a specific bug from Mac Os X. Is there a dirt solution to this? @justinclift great idea. How difficult is to make this? I am right now looking a lot of tables and need to do two mouse click to get the next table. I will love have this fix now. 👍 

@chrisjlocke the tab don't change the focus. This is not common in osx, but I thing is about the interface technology they used in sqlitebrowser.  @justinclift thanks for answer. I will wait..  @MKleusberg , I tested and it worked really good! In mac you need to use ⌘ + PageDown or ⌘ + PageUp. Thanks, this makes a lot of difference!   ### Details for the issue

Just upgraded to Win7 from XP. I was working on an SQLite Database for a Unity project using the previous XP compatible sqlite browser. After I install the newest version 3.91 and load my previous database, it asks for a password. I never had a password before, how do I get back into my database?

 It's basically for scratch/testing purposes.
I uninstalled and then reinstalled and was able to open it. If there is 
something funky, do let me know. Crazy things can happen when migrating. Me too One more thing, not sure why or how to fix it. When I tried to add to 
the database, it said is was read only. I can't find anything that tells 
me where that setting is.  Promote Qt and add sqlitebrowser into https://showroom.qt.io/   This PR, when merged, will compile sqlitebrowser Travis CI upon each git push, and upload an [AppImage](http://appimage.org/) to a temporary download URL on transfer.sh (available for 14 days). The download URL is toward the end of each Travis CI build log of each build.

Providing an [AppImage](http://appimage.org/) would have, among others, these advantages:
- Works for most Linux distributions (including Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, elementaryOS, Linux Mint, and others)
- One app = one file = super simple for users: just download one AppImage file, [make it executable](http://discourse.appimage.org/t/how-to-make-an-appimage-executable/80), and run
- No unpacking or installation necessary
- No root needed
- No system libraries changed
- Just one format for all major distributions
- Works out of the box, no installation of runtimes needed
- Optional(!) desktop integration with `appimaged`
- Binary delta updates, e.g., for continuous builds (only download the binary diff) using AppImageUpdate
- Can GPG2-sign your AppImages (inside the file)

[Here is an overview](https://github.com/probonopd/AppImageKit/wiki/AppImages) of projects that are already distributing upstream-provided, official AppImages.

An example AppImage can be downloaded from here:
https://transfer.sh/UiNPi/sqlitebrowser-git.021f836-x86-64.appimage (available for 14 days)  I would suggest to create an AppImage for Linux. 
Several Qt application does it by using https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/ 
Personnaly I prefere compile myself or getting application from the PPA. But for some people appImage would be greate. See http://appimage.org/ Started working on it [here](https://github.com/probonopd/sqlitebrowser/blob/patch-1/.travis.yml). Sent Pull Request https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/969. Instead of storing AppImage builds temporarily for 14 days each on transfer.sh, you could use GitHub Releases to store the binaries permanently. This way, they would be visible on the [Releases](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases) page of your project. This is what I recommend. See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/. If you want to do this for continuous builds, also see https://github.com/probonopd/uploadtool. > We have a server for nightly releases, which could hold those kind of development centred builds.

Excellent. Indeed, https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/ is badly missing Linux builds right now.

By the way, uploadtool deletes the prior continuous build and then uploads the latest one, so that there is always only one "continuous" tag on GitHub Releases.   Fix #965   ### Details for the issue

I cant define pragmas on the run-sql tab. E. g. if I type and execute "pragma auto_vacuum = 1;" and choose the tab "edit pragmas" i cant see my changes.

Its also not working when i modify the options directly on the "edit pragmas" tab, also if i hit the "save" button hundrets of times.

But i found a workaround, if i type and execute this:
end transaction;
pragma auto_vacuum = 1;

and after that I clicked the "compact database" option on the menu strip, then changes were accepted.

 Same issue for the last version. I made you a pull request to fix that.  ### Details for the issue
When running DB Browser for SQLite on my 2016 15-inch Macbook Pro, the WIFI connection becomes very unstable and the ping is moving up and down dramatically. Sometimes it even causes connection dropping. I tested that It happens for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz WIFI. Thanks.

 @chrisjlocke @justinclift Thanks for reply. This is the only application I found caused the problem. I haven't  faced this issue on Windows before with any application. It sounds weird but it happens on macOS for me. 

It shouldn't be hardware issue since I went to apple store yesterday and they checked hardware and the system and it doesn't have any issue. Then I tested WIFI by pinging google and I closed all applications. First the request time is stable. But after I open DB4S the request time becomes very unstable. And it turned to normal immediately after I closed it.  I can upload screenshot when I back home. This happened in both 2.4GHz and 5GHz WIFI. Today I closed DB4S and network works well without any problem.

I will try the latest nightly build to see if it still happens. Thanks. @chrisjlocke Yes the network improve quickly when DB4S is closed. It seems tab doesn't matter. 

Actually I found that I have same issue with another SQLite client. I doubt that maybe my mac has something conflict with sqlite3. That's so weird. I think you may close the issue if you want. I can reopen it if I found the solution later or if someone else has same issue with me. @justinclift @MKleusberg @chrisjlocke  I downloaded from sqlitebrowser.org. And it's a small database. It seems my mac network has conflict with sqlite3 database, not with specific client software. Hope I am the only one facing this, sad. For now I have to stand with it while developing with sqlite. Thanks guys.  When you try to open a database table in "Database Structure" and click right and choose  "Browse Table" in the context menu, it opens the first table instead of the selected one.

 Sorry - tested its works :)  ### Details for the issue

When running `sqlitebrowser` built from source, I am seeing a SIGSEGV on application start. The backtrace in `gdb` looks like:

```
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007ffff303f72c in _GLOBAL__sub_I_qprinterinfo.cpp () from /lib64/libQtGui.so.4
#1  0x00007ffff7dec1e3 in _dl_init_internal () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
#2  0x00007ffff7dde21a in _dl_start_user () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

#4  0x00007fffffffdf58 in ?? ()
#5  0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()
```

Given I know that `sqlitebrowser` used to work under RHEL 7.2, I used `git bisect` to find where the problem was introduced:

* `git checkout c0d2e9131ea1bf9eded26f4c3de868d0fbad000a && git clean -f -d x . && cmake . && make -j12 && ./sqlitebrowser` -- fails

* `git checkout c0d2e9131ea1bf9eded26f4c3de868d0fbad000a~1 && git clean -f -d x . && cmake . && make -j12 && ./sqlitebrowser` -- succeeds

So it seems that the offending commit is:

* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/c0d2e9131ea1bf9eded26f4c3de868d0fbad000a

Worst comes to the worst, I can create a pull request that just adds some words to `BUILDING.md` stating "if your system-wide version of QScintilla isn't built to support Qt5, please build using `-DFORCE_INTERNAL_QSCINTILLA=ON`".  I am working with Arabic Language saved in UNICODE Format in SQLite. I want to implement a search. But there's a problem.

Let's say the text is

```
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      @font-face {
        font-family: "Al_Mushaf";
        src: url('fonts/al_mushaf.ttf');
      }
      @font-face {
        font-family: "Jameel Noori Nastaleeq";
        src: url('fonts/jameel_noori.ttf');
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3 style='font-family:"Al_Mushaf"'>
            وَاۡمُرْ 
    </h3>
  </body>
</html>
```

And it is stored in SQLite Database. Now I want to search `html`, it will return the result and if I search  `وامر` it won't return a result because in actual text, it is `وَاْمُرْ` (with these extra UNICODE).

I want to ignore all HTML tags and these extra UNICODE Characters while searching so that `html` shouldn't return a result while `وامر` should return a result.

What I found so far;

1. Make extra column and put stripped text into it and then search (I can't do it because there are thousands of books and they will take a lot of memory)
2. UDF Like SQL (I couldn't find any suitable example/tutorial to implement it)
3. Using REGEXP (I couldn't figure it out yet how to do this, I just know that I've to implement it myself)
4. SQL query using LIKE and GLOB operators and wildcard characters.

I'm stuck for two days and couldn't find a working solution. Option#4 is desirable but any working solution will do the charm.

Meanwhile, I've to keep application memory efficient and optimized searching.

Any help is highly appreciated.

What I've done so far
1. I've made regex to ignore html tags and text between style tag and used it in query with REGEXP.
Now there are two problems,
    - I want to ignore these extra characters too. I know their UNICODEs, just need to know how to append it in the regex. This is my regex;
`(?![^<]*>)(?!<style[^>]*?>)(TEXT)(?![^<]*?<\/style>)`
    - I've used it in query like
`SELECT text FROM dummy WHERE text REGEXP <myregex>`
It's not giving an error but not returning the desired result too.

2. I've compiled `sqlite3` library in my project. I am now looking for anyone to help me with writing a function for my regex, attach it to database and call it from query.
 Thank you for guiding me. I will definitely do so.  ### Details for the issue

I have 2 Databases as *.db file that I want to merge.

On the first Database I use the export function (as SQL file instead of CSV) and export all tables I want, with NO "INSERT INTO" and NO "Multiple VALUES" seleced.
In the dropdown I chose "only data export" and export it.

In the 2nd Database I try to import as SQL file and it runs without any messages/hints/problems.
After the process is completed, there is only a small part in the new Database.

For example there is one column with an ID that has 2943 entrys.
After the import is "done" it has 507 entrys.
So somehow there are a lot of entrys lost during the export/import process.

I hope you guys can give me hints what I can try to get this working or if there are any knows issues and ways around it.

 I tried the latest nightly (3.9.99) and get this error on importing:

![error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6054234/22694338/2395c35c-ed47-11e6-9d42-01dfd1703092.PNG)
 hey @justinclift ,
I didnt mention of exporting the 2nd database because I didnt export this.

Maybe my way is wrong but I thought I could go like this:
1. Export the first database (as SQL file)
2. Imtort the first database (as SQL file) into the 2nd database
3. Save as new database.
4. Merging completed :)

I have no idea what to change on the export process to work properly.

If I export the first database with  "INSERT INTO" or "Multiple VALUES" seleced or choosing "Export everything" on the dropdown, the import on the 2nd database doesnt work at all because the table is already existing.
So there is no other option then just choose "Export data only" on the dropdown and try to import it like this.

Its also weird that the error on the nightly seems like an CSV file with wrong delimters as I only uses SQL files to export and import (because CSV doesnt work at all).

I hope you guys can give me hints how to merge these two databases because I am somehow lost now. Hello, @Phil1988. Could you send me all necessary files (*.db and/or *.sql) to reproduce this issue? The problem is that I dont have any other databases/files to reproduce this issue and the databases I am trying to merge are Whatsapp databases with a lot of private data that I dont want to share.

Is there anything else I can do, to help you helping me? :D @Phil1988, could you send to me only schema of your tables, without data. I deleted every record of the databases so every data should be gone (hopefully :D ).

Here are the 2 databases, I hope you can find the problem here.

I renamed them to *.png because uploading *.db files are not allowed and *. zip file didnt work...

Just download these files and rename them to *.db (I tested it and its working).







 I believe that the problems associated with the table messages_fts (CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE messages_fts USING FTS3()), which requires support of Full Text Search 3 extension. It is an assumption.

@Phil1988 remove your files by editing last message (databases still contains some of private data (use File->Compact Database next time)). Just use email next time. @Phil1988, Is data lost in any of these tables:

messages_fts
messages_fts_segments
messages_fts_segdir
messages_fts_content

?

If yes. My guess, this is because you can't merge FTS 'Shadow Tables' without understanding how full-text search is implemented.
If no. Could you please research which tables is losing data. Maybe its simple PK constraint? PK must be UNIQUE in merged table. I dont know if one of there tables has some lost data because only the "chat_list" and "messages" tables are  important for that merging and I only tried to export and import these. @justinclift, still not enough data to understand what is going on in a particular case, but it seems to me that the problem is that at the time of import, while inserting rows with existing PK's doesn't output any error messages.

For example, lets create a table and add the 3 rows:

    CREATE TABLE `table` (`pk` INTEGER, `text` TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(`pk`));
    INSERT INTO `table` (`pk`, `text`) VALUES (1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c');

trying to import:

    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    INSERT INTO `table` (`pk`, `text`) VALUES (1, 'X'), (2, 'Y'), (3, 'Z');
    COMMIT;

The import process will take place without any error messages, although it should be an error:

    UNIQUE constraint failed: table.pk: INSERT INTO `table` (`pk`, `text`) VALUES (1, 'X'), (2, 'Y'), (3, 'Z');

@Phil1988, is `messages` table contains rows with the same PK as in imported data? What is "PK" ? Primary Key?

The exported and the imported database have both the "_id" row as "INTERGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT".  Since I am using sqlitebrowser to help me develop iOS applications in Xcode using Core Data, the pathnames to the sqlite files are demoralisingly long and hard to remember. I can easily print the full pathname in the console and then copy it into the paste buffer. I would like sqlitebrowser to have a place for me to copy and paste that path and open the database directly.

At present the only way to select the path is to navigate through the finder-like dialog, which is painstaking and error-prone. Thanks for the suggestion. I'm on a Mac. The trouble is that in the app I
will be developing, the paths are going to change frequently and each
simulator has a different path. I'm on a Mac, and there is unfortunately no such text box. @Logistes On Mac, in the Open Database dialog, hit <kbd>cmd</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>g</kbd>, and paste the full path to your SQLite database file (you might need to use a right-click in the textbox to be able to paste in there for some reason). @gboudreau Thanks Guillaume. I have finally got back to this problem, found your reply, and it was perfect. 
It is hard to remember, but it is the open dialog homolog for the Finder | Go | "Go to folder ..." action, which has its key stroke combination shown in the menu item. So I can recall it from that.  I maybe confused here .. I have an sql file with multiple CREATE TABLEs

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE ....
CREATE TABLE ....
CREATE TABLE ....
COMMIT;

One of the CREATE TABLE statements has an error.
When I execute the sql (using Import) I get the error, however the other tables have been created.

Why?

I would expect the entire transaction to be rolled back. Unfortunately it has made things worse. Now I get a rollback without an error. See the attached.

I think there is still an implied transaction. My sql file has a BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT in it, so a rollback on error is to be expected. However when I remove the transaction I still get the rollback  error which should not happen. If I run the previous build it seems to load the sql just fine (I fixed the errors). But in general this and https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/955 still exist.

  OK, will check again tomorrow – thanks.

Should I raise another issue, that Import should output to the log I think. This error still exists and is not fixed (sorry to say)

Please see the attached, the error should be that a CHECK constraint has failed.

[Test.sql.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/748068/Test.sql.txt)

In addition when I remove the BEGIN/COMMIT Transaction statements in the sql, the load is still rolled back. This should not happen. The Load process should follow what is in the sql.

  I created a table and insert a row with the following

CREATE TABLE `characterSets` (
	`name`	TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	`characters`	TEXT NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY(`name`)
);
INSERT INTO `characterSets` (name,characters) VALUES ('Line Separators', char(10, 11, 12, 13, 133, 8232, 8233));

When I browse the row it shows like the attached png. This is not correct.

![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6769116/22477349/984215a8-e7dd-11e6-8501-296a55bc35b2.PNG)

 what shows browser down on the right lower corner? UTF...? I thought that was a good question - it was UTF8 now it it UTF16le and the result is the same.
  I have the following sql script which when I load it, it successfully commits.
There should be an error. The first INSERT INTO fails with a check constraint and the record is ignored.
Expected result is for the transaction to fail.

BEGIN TRANSCTION;
CREATE TABLE `types` (
	`uuid`	TEXT DEFAULT (lower(hex(randomblob(4))||'-'||hex(randomblob(2))||'-'||hex(randomblob(2))||'-'||hex(randomblob(2))||'-'||hex(randomblob(6)))) CHECK(uuid regexp '^[a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{12}$'),
	`description`	TEXT NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY(`uuid`)
);
INSERT INTO `types` (uuid,description) VALUES ('6d15a5615-0000-43ff-b4f2-762b0dbfb4e6', 'Substitution');
INSERT INTO `types` (uuid,description) VALUES ('615a5615-0001-43ff-b4f2-762b0dbfb4e6', 'URL');
INSERT INTO `types` (uuid,description) VALUES ('615a5615-0002-43ff-b4f2-762b0dbfb4e6', 'Date');
COMMIT;

  CREATE TABLE `test2` (
	`id`	TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (randomblob(6)),
	`name`	INTEGER,
	PRIMARY KEY(`id`)
);

Browse data and the click new record, default has wrong value.

The issue seems to be that the default value is ignored when it's part of the primary key. Its on Windows with the latest nightly build .99 If the user (me) is intelligent enough to create a default value that is random (and possibly a constraint) then do you need to check for it causing duplicates?

If you do, instead of trying to parse it and check if it is random can you do an if exists first?   ### Details for the issue
I created a tiny DB with this application on OSX Sierra.  I installed the app into my appcelerator titanium app and it worked in the iOS sim.  However on the Android emulator and on the android device it does not seem to get recognized - no instal error is reported but the table is missing.  Is the file produced by this application incompatible with android?

 Not sure, but I tried adding the db file in many different places with no luck.     Some people say to put it in the assets folder, some in the Resources folder, some say the lib folder, other in the same folder as my js-script.  If I was just writing for Android I would include the sql to create the  db but the appcelerator best practise is to include the database if it is small so I'm trying that.    I was able to run a create table statement on the database after opening it so a database is getting created but not the one I am trying to install.     In appcelerator the Ti.Database.install(dbfilename) method will create an empty database if it fails to install the one given as dbfilename.  So if the file format is somehow not compatible or if the file is not found it will create the empty db.
    i want save text in right side! but when i click Apply ,text save in left side!
i can not save it right side!
please see video,how can i  save in right side!?help me please
https://youtu.be/LmHSJrNqi6c @justinclift   same problem in  nightly build!  i can not save in right side! The problem is actually that sqlitebrowser doesn't set the direction for that textbox to LTR automaticly. It should do that as all other widgets. I'll check. I think it's because of the text formatting (It's a richtext widget).

And for the bug, it is not. This is the right and correct behaviour. You can't save in "Right side", because you started the text with a LTR direction letter.
It doesn't matter really for the database, but visually, it matters.
You can force the text direction to be RTL when viewing the page (seems to be a webpage). @awi1369 Can you please write the information of your system locale? I tested it in Windows 10 with both English and Arabic locales, and the text in the edit box was aligned to left (And it's direction is LTR).

 This is a duplicate of #781 as far as I can tell Hm. Maybe I’ll fork the project then. Is the issue still related to SQLCipher? Yes line 41 is exactly where it is (and line 80 for x64).

All you should need to do is define the preprocessor flag SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5.

I’m a little unclear as to why FTS4 is even working in your current build since you don’t define those preprocessor flags anywhere, and FTS3 and FTS4 are not enabled by default either. But wherever you’re compiling SQLite, as long as you make sure SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5 (and …_FTS3 and …_FTS4) are defined, that should be all you need to do. Agreed. Although again I’m not sure why FTS is working at all in DB Browser without those flags – and it does work - so I’m curious if this makes a difference. It should though. In the version that has SQLCipher, are you using SQLCipher’s implementation of SQLite even for non-encrypted databases? That would explain why FTS works in the official Windows build. And if so we would need to use the non-SQLCipher version. Both copies can work for me.
I was able to create, rebuild, search and delete the fts5 table(s).

This is great! Thanks. Also confirmed, it’s working great. Thanks so much for getting this done so quickly. And for the great piece of software; it’s a huge time saver for me in optimizing queries for my application. Oh great. Sure would be happy to.

(Incidentally I wish I knew SQLCipher existed two years ago because I would up making a custom SQLite VFS for encrypted databases in Windows. Works great but man was that painful…). Sorry for the lag. Yeah FTS5 is working perfectly! I haven’t tried out more advanced features like ranking or highlighting but I have no reason to doubt they’ll work (or if they don’t it’s an SQLite problem and nothing to do with your code).

Thanks again, seriously.  #941  ### Details for the issue

 Are you able to recreate this issue? (if you still have your Mate VM from the last issue I filed) :) Fair enough.  Like I said, it's probably a bug in VirtualBox but figured
you might have some good insight into it  Support of operator 'BETWEEN'. For example for column with filter '400~500' will be generated WHERE statement 'BETWEEN 400 AND 500'.

500~400

Query tabs can be closed without any prompt to save or warning about lost data. 

I had several queries open for a coding test.  Each query corresponded to an answer to a test question.  I had saved the queries to SQL files, but i needed to close the database.  I closed out of all the open query tabs, not realizing i had made changes to each of them after I had last saved.  To my dismay, when I opened the files again all my changes were lost.  It cost me a couple hours of lost work.  

In other database management GUI, when the user clicks to close out a query they are presented with a prompt like "You have unsaved changes.  Do you want to save before closing?" to prevent lost work.  DB Browser should add this for unsaved query tabs.

Pls help  If I have an INTEGER column I can filter the numbers in it using the supported operators from this page https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Using-the-Filters.

Is it possible to have a filter for **range** (- or \~)? Something like _min-max_ (or _min~max_) to show only the numbers in this range. For example, If I want to filter a column with numbers between 1 and 5 I can type in filter something like **1-5** (or **1~5**). It is like combining _Equal to or greater_ and _Equal to or less_ together.

Also, maybe we can have an **and** (,) operator? To show only specific numbers we can type something like **1,2,5**.

 @MKleusberg Thanks. Yes I will try it and report back. @MKleusberg I tested it and it is working very nice. Thanks!

@schdub Thanks a lot for this! 😄  Maybe DB4S should provide a hint when the `~` (range) operator is being used on a column that is not an `INTEGER`. A tooltip, modeless dialog, or changing the background color of the column's filter?

This should work also with `>` (greater than) and `<` (less than) operators, since they are only used with numbers.  ### Details for the issue
Hi!
Im using sqlitebrowser from the Debian testing repository on my machine running Gnome Shell (3.22.2).
When I have sqlitebrowser opened, it seems like it is constantly requesting focus. I cannot switch workspaces, since it constantly switches back to the sqlitebrowser window.
Also I cannot minimize it, since it instantly gets de-minimized again.

 Thanks guys. I thought it was a valid file, but it was indeed just a dump, plaintext. It would be nice if the program could give a better response to this though.

Hi. Sometimes *.sql files has no instructions for using transaction and importing from them is very slow. Checkbox for forcing transaction import will be very useful in this situations. Sorry if this issue already exists)

  Since I don't know if that bug could also be related to the fact I wasn't using the right version of DB4S when I exported my settings files, here is a summary of the different files I provided.

- [sqlitebrowser.plist.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/701448/sqlitebrowser.plist.zip) are settings files generated using 3.9.1 version that is known to have issues on macOS Sierra (#737).

- [sqlitebrowser-settings-v3_9_1v2.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/701764/sqlitebrowser-settings-v3_9_1v2.zip) is my current settings file using latest version (3.9.1v2) that is working well regarding preferences.

Hope it helps clarifying the situation.

Trying to view and modify an existing database. The viewing and modifying work fine with SQLite Database Browser 2.0 b1 (which I believe is an "ancestor" of DB Browser for SQLite), but with DB Browser for SQLite, things do not work as expected.

The database opens, but using "Browse Data", if certain tables are selected (but not all), the list of fields of that table is not anything like what is shown with DB Browser for SQLite. Selecting some tables produces the expected result, but then if certain other tables are selected, the field descriptions from the previous table are retained instead of being updated to the new table.

So is safe to update the .ts for all the other languages. :smile:   ### Details for the issue

Hi I'm trying to compile the project on my Mac but getting this error. I've followed the steps in the BUILDING.md file for **MacOS X > Building an .app bundle**

I got up to the **qmake** action, but the next step **make** fails with the following. I've attemped the two **qmake** commands in the latter part of the secion:

 That solved it. Also the nightly build worked. Thanks!  Corrects some typos and tildes since the latest update. :smile: @justinclift We could try and see how it works out in the next nightly build. @justinclift I see that now among the 55 strings tagged "unfinished" are those that previously were missing in the .ts.

Should I translate them now? So that we can check before changing them for all the languages, if in the next nightly build also the other strings already translated but not showing in the GUI like "Edit Database Cell" and "DB Schema" are also fixed. @justinclift Done, and [PR ready](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/928). Hope that it works and the new generated files finally fix the missing translations for all the languages. :smile:  ### Details for the issue

I do modification but at next start this issue come back.

 Yeah, it's a bit of a head scratcher

Some data points:

1) Yes, this is under VirtualBox ( Version 5.1.12 r112440 (Qt5.5.1) )

2) The screen does start out that way, at least for that particular database.  When I load others (which are also included in that link I added.  See "/data/databases/" ) they look fine. Is the problem database 
too big, or the schema too long or something along those lines?

3) With the problem database, it is just that one column "schema" in the one pane "Database Structure" which is messed up.  The "DB Schema" panel on the right side, which looks like exactly the same data to me, is not corrupted in the same way. See attached screenshot

4) This is all using the current version as of tonight from the PPA. Here's the "about" info:

    Version 3.9.99
    Qt Version 5.6.1
    SQLite Version 3.14.1 Try this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/fk1uup3zx7sb8r0/data.tar.xz?dl=0

I'm certainly willing to do some work on it.  I do have the guest additions installed and I'll try adjusting a few settings related to graphics.

I can also work on compiling from source if you think there's a difference between it and what is in the PPA.

FWIW, this is the only application I see corruption in and it's only in that one pane (and the one database, of the few I've tried sqlitebrowser with, though of course that may be a red herring) No problem, thanks for all of the help so far.

I've done the following and I'm still seeing the same issue
    1. Clone repository from github

    2. cmake .
             This produced some messages and failed, which lead me to  issue #635 and then to installing some qt5 related stuff

    3. sudo apt install qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools

    4. cmake .
             This produced some messages but seemed to complete (see attached)

    5. make
             This succeeded (see attached) and produced an executable

    6.  execute ./sqlitebrowser
             Same corruption issue

    7. sudo make install && sqlitebrowser
             Same corruption issue

Another note: I tried rearranging the columns so "type" comes after "schema" and it is just the "schema" column that is corrupted


http://pastebin.com/Rbm8HwNT I've discovered something interesting:  I deleted the APT_RWY and APT_APT tables and the corruption is gone!

What is it about those tables?  The length of the schema? Let me clarify that: if I delete the two tables from within the application the corruption disappears instantly I just tried in a freshly created Standard Ubuntu 16.10 x64 desktop VM and
I see the same corruption.

Versions for this VM:
 Db4s: 3.7.0
 Qt: 5.5.1
Sqlite: 3.9.2

Deleting the apt_apt and apt_rwy tables within the application immediately
clears up the corruption Yep, it did help.  On the same stock Ubuntu that had issues I followed these steps along with the install of qt 5.7.0 and I no longer see the corruption.  That's fine with me.  Did you want to look deeper into what interaction is triggering this issue since this is an experience users may receive until the distributions update their qt libraries?  Or did I manage to stumble across some unique screwball corner case that isn't worth bothering with? Sure, it's from a project on github (jlmcgraw/processFaaData) Hey, no air quotes around 'real data'!

  ### Details for the issue

If I changepassword via vb.net and open it in code, works fine.
If I try and open the password protected DB in sqlitebrowser, it asks for the password and other setting (pagesize) I set that, put in the password (a 30 hex-character password) - it crashes.
I tried the nightly build (3rd Jan 2017 version) and now it says "invalid file format" and does not ask for a password or pagesize value.

If I then changepassword(string.empty) - i can then open up the unprotected sqlite db in sqlitebrowser without an issue. Just cannot open a password protect version.

 So, I am using 3.9.99 nightly build ( which says invalid file form) because the 3.9.1 would just crash (closing down the app).

The help about menu in sqlite browser is saying:
Version 3.9.99
Qt version 5.7.0
SQLite version 3.15.0

I am not using any encryption on the database at all - just using the standard password protection built into sqlite, in the case of vb.net, i am issuing a changepassword command to perform this.

attached zip file has two databases, one is an empty (no tables) database and the other has a password of "a password" set against it.  I can confirm that if I open it up with sqlite browser it comes back with "invalid file format" and if i reset the password to string.empty, it removes password protection and the database is fine, so I know the database is not getting corrupt.

Thanks! A Quick question about licensing with SQLCipher - am I able to use its encryption abilities in my application as I want to release it as a commercial product (shareware) and would really like to have the data encrypted - Im not too good at reading licenses, its like reading a contract and it completes loses me :S

[dbs.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/682145/dbs.zip)
 Ah right. Ok. Here's some info I used to do the password - it looks like the .NET components use RSA to encrypt it with a password:

You can password protect SQLite3 DB. For the first time before doing any operations, set password as follows.

SQLiteConnection conn = new SQLiteConnection("Data Source=MyDatabase.sqlite;Version=3;");
conn.SetPassword("password");
conn.open();
then next time you can access it like

conn = new SQLiteConnection("Data Source=MyDatabase.sqlite;Version=3;Password=password;");
conn.Open();
**This wont allow any GUI editor to view your data. Some editors can decrypt the DB if you provide the password. The algorithm used is RSA.**

Later if you wish to change the password, use

conn.ChangePassword("new_password");
To reset or remove password, use

conn.ChangePassword(String.Empty);

I guess I will probably have to either
(1) use unprotected DB until I do a release (as it works fine through VS2015)
or
(2) wait for a possible update as this will affect all .NET users who use sqlite browser.

I'll stick with number 1 and occasionally check it with (2) on builds in case its something that is in the pipework (or has been broken). Im assuming at one point it did work, Sqlite is a great desktop database (much better than access mdb's).

Thanks for your help anyway - at least i have learned something more about Sqlite today :)
 I use VS Community Edition 2015.

The .net SQLite component is the general one (I assume), downloaded via github, using the NuGet package manager for solution, I type in SQLite and the search term, System.Data.SQLite by SQLite Development Team 1.12M downloads "The Official SQLite database engine for both x86 and x64 along with the ADO.NET providers" is in the description.

From what I have discovered, is the switching on a password protected database, encrypts it with RSA as per this link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5669905/sqlite-with-encryption-password-protection  ### Useful extra information

Similarly to #505, it looks like Sqlite has an issue when opening a database with VIRTUAL tables:

```
Sqlite parse error:  "line 1:8: unexpected token: VIRTUAL" ( "CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE TokenizerTable USING fts3tokenize(\n                    unicodesn,\n                    \"stemmer=french\"\n                )" )
Sqlite parse error:  "line 1:8: unexpected token: VIRTUAL" ( "CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE MessageSearchTable USING fts4(\n    body,\n    attachment,\n    subject,\n    from_field,\n    receivers,\n    cc,\n    bcc,\n    \n    tokenize=simple,\n    prefix=\"2,4,6,8,10\"\n)" )
```

This seems to have no effect though except of this in logs. This is a [Geary](https://github.com/GNOME/geary) mail-client database, if needed.

 Hi! I can see that the word VIRTUAL is not part of the list of tokens in sqlite3.g. This probably (have a bit of work to do until I understand things fully) is the reason it is not understood.

To the people that has coded this: is this a conscious design decision, or simply a missed detail? I can do a bit of testing to see if I can update the grammar with the full language description in the next few days (have a little bit of time available). Thank you.
I agree that the grammar thing seems the least difficult, had something in place (probably not as good as your solution).

Modules for creating virtual tables seems to each have their own grammar: the fts5 module as example has quite a few extras. So in order to be simple to use, the db Browser should know the standard modules grammars. Additionally, perhaps, the support tables created by a module could be treated somewhat differently from “normal” tables.

A bit of fun, and a long road for me get up to speed in things I haven´t done for a long time.

  Everytime I try to launch something that uses/shows something about my graphics card, it crashes.

Fault Module Name: atiumd64.dll. Exception Code: c000001d. Exception Offset: 000000000013db71.

- My computer is screwed
- My graphics card is broken
- Atiumd64.dll is failing

Reply with your answer. Not exactly. The fault module name is different and so as the Exception offset. And it also crashes most java programs including Minecraft, Java Settings, etc. Sorry I was replying to the earlier comment. Anyways the thing is my graphics card settings is even crashing. I upgraded my graphics card drivers and now I guess it's failing at something. I got steam on there fine. I tried running a game and it loaded perfectly. The problem is java and graphics card things are crashing. Steam is running fine. I tried running 3D and 2d steam games. Whatever my graphics card is doing, it's something nobody has heard about because I've been searching everywhere and nothing was related to my problem.
My graphics card is a Radeon RX 480 GamingX. I have an AMD processor. My AMD processor is a 6-core. Yes it's an msi. My computer is a custom built gaming pc. Windows works like a charm. Yes, I went to msi.com and downloaded the same graphics card drivers I had. (Updated drivers for the same card I have) Now I can't run java or some programs. so what's with the atiumd64.dll? Thanks, I'll try that, if it works I'll let you know. But there's one thing I gotta say: there are 3 atiumd64 on my pc. Ummm My computer was on a black screen for a second. It's not now Never mind it works No I'm talking about the black screen Ugh these drivers take forever to download x.x Imma just go screw around in mcpe  It's stuck at 66%
 It's not stuck anymore It couldn't install Who are you Anyways it's not fixed Imma ingnore innermous if he's not gonna help.  For linux there is no drop down menu? A bit confused, this means I can't import csv files to the database. Am I missing something? ![dbbrowser](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17105146/21472528/3f4248f8-caad-11e6-929a-c5bb0ac75c73.png)

  I often open een WebSQL database from Chrome to test out a framework or app, which means that it often changes the structure of the database.

But the only way to see those changes is to close the database and to re-open it. It would be great if there was a menu option to reload the complete database. Yes that seems to do the trick, exactly what I needed!  Would be really cool to have profiler feature.

There is no SQLite profiler out there, so would be a first.
 I think SQLite has profiling built-in, like you said, but it's text-based and not easy to use. No SQLite tool right now has proper GUI profiling.

I don't know if SQLite would support that though, because a profiler, when listening, will automatically list queries sent to the db. You don't need to interact with it, just keep the window open and see what is happening.

Can SQLite do such a thing, that is listen for events? @MKleusberg I see what you mean. I guess it's not possible. What a pity!

Not being able to see what commands are sent to the database, makes development and debugging a real pain. @justinclift Unless I'm using it wrongly, I don't think that the log tab does it. What I do: 

  - load sqlitebrowser, open my SQLite database file
  - run my app, perform some operation which hits that database
  - observe the log tab

...and nothing is logged there. Not under "Application" or "User".  Does the SQLiteBrowser support [a-z] and _  wildcards? I have been unsuccessful in getting any results from the following queries, despite the face that my table (Keywords) has the word 'hello' in the Keyword field:

SELECT * FROM Keywords WHERE (Keyword LIKE '[h]%' )

SELECT * FROM Keywords WHERE (Keyword LIKE '_ello' )

There are settings in Preferences to set the font and size for both `Data Browser` and `SQL` but not for `Edit Cell`.

I think this is a continuation of the conversation on [Issue 818](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/818) but I'm adding this issue because I believe that code changes will need to be made to satisfy this issue. Whether or not this is to be considered a bug or a needed feature, I will leave to the development team to decide.

  ### Details for the issue

Tried to install the new DB Browser for SQLite on my win32 XP Prof. SP3 machine, but:
- refuses to load: no valid win32 application, uninstall, reinstall: no change
- load into debugger: windbg/ollydgb: cannot stat, no valid win32 ...

### Useful extra information

- look on PE32 header, and find: optional PE32 has os-version major set to 6 = Vista (minor to 0)
- googled and found: VC2012 SP0 (not SP1) dropped XP support by setting os-version to 6

 and BTW: patching offset 40/44 of the PE Header from 0006 to 0005 allows the program to run flawlessly, so it is no technical limitation, only a political - was this a deliberate decision? there is an easy way, see here:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj851139(v=vs.120).aspx
and if switching to VS 2015, there still is:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj851139(v=vs.140).aspx
it's just a setting ... and BTW:
> XP has practically no users

netmarketshare 11/2016: 8.63%, more than 8.1 and more than all MacOS together, and way more than Linux:
that's "practically no" for you?!? So what version runs on XP or what shall be done to run it on XP? @iRybin: as I said already in comment 2, if you are able to operate a hexeditor, just changing offset 0x40 and 0x44 of the sqlitebrowser.exe executable from 0x0006 (Vista) to 0x0005 (XP) is all that's needed - it is not a technical reason, just a restrictive labeling that alienates XP users ... @h1618 @iRybin ~If that helps, the [nighly builds](https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win32/) run fine on XP SP3, even on CPUs without SSE2. There is a note in the project front page to test them in case of trouble. :smile:~ @justinclift @h1618 @iRybin Hmmm. Unfortunately seems that the new nigthly builds available don't work with XP SP3 anymore. :sob:

The latest version that can confirm that works with XP SP3 is 2016-10-01, but is not available to download anymore.

In my case if I'm doing it right, patching the PE header in the binary as @h1618 suggest doesn't help: the program then loads but crashes immediately with an exception. :confused: @h1618 If patching the PE header fixed the "not a valid Win32 application" error and allowed you to run DB4S without problems, then I believe the fix is very simple.

Microsoft dropped support for Windows XP on newer versions of Visual Studio by setting *SystemVersion* (offset 0x0040) in the PE header for all generated .exe to version 6 (Windows Vista) by the linker. MinGW on the other hand set this value to 4 (Windows 95/NT).

DB4S is built using MSVC (2013) without setting the minimum operating system to 5 (XP) so the .exe gets the default one 6 (Vista). I believe changing `/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS` (version not set, defaults to 6.00) to `/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.01` (for Windows XP, and 5.02 for Windows XP 64-bit) in [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L323) will make the .exe run on Windows XP without problems. This will just change the minimum *operating system/subsystem version* that are set by the linker. More information on [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fcc1zstk(v=vs.120).aspx).

@justinclift I think DB4S used to work on Windows XP when using the old build system because it was **not** using MSVC. @justinclift Unfortunately I don't have much experience with CMake.

`devenv.exe` (Visual Studio) works with `.vcxproj` XML project files, and will not accept that /SUBSYSTEM switch. It is a linker switch and should be added to CMake so it can generate a working `.vcxproj` file for `devenv` to use.

Try editing the `CMakeList.txt` and add the switch there, then look at the generated `.vcxproj` file. You should find something like..

    <ItemDefinitionGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|Win32'">
        <Link>
            <SubSystem>Windows</SubSystem>
            <MinimumRequiredVersion>5.01</MinimumRequiredVersion>
        </Link>
    </ItemDefinitionGroup>

If you found `<MinimumRequiredVersion>5.01</MinimumRequiredVersion>` then it should work.

Another solution is by editing the source files. Something like..

    #ifdef _MSC_VER
    #    pragma comment(linker, "/subsystem:windows,5.01")
    #endif

Finally, a quick solution is by editing the .exe file using [`editbin`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d25ddyfc(v=vs.120).aspx) and change the subsystem right after building it. Something like..

    editbin DB4S.exe /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.01
    editbin DB4S_x64.exe /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.02 

**NOTE:** Windows XP 64-bit was introduced later than the 32-bit version so it got a different version. Personally I don't think the editbin solution is ideal. If something else changes in Qt or elsewhere and we actually drop XP support but then use this to "add it back" then we could be covering up a multitude of issues. So, we should do this with the linker really.

However I would vote for dropping XP support completely. @glawrence `editbin` will not add/remove support for XP. It will just set the minimum operating system version in the PE header so the OS can load it. This is exactly what the linker will do after combining all the object codes into an executable.

It is perfectly fine to set it to a lower value too. The latest version of MinGW set it to 4 (Windows 95/NT), even if you are targeting newer OS like Windows 7 or higher. An application will not work of course if it cannot find the newer Win32 APIs.

Judging by @h1618 solution (patching the exe) that worked for him then I guess DB4S is not using any newer APIs higher than Windows XP, and I don't see a reason to *drop* XP support. In fact, building the same source and using the same build system but with a different compiler other than MSVC will make it work.

I know supporting and maintaining older OS versions is hard, if you have to write code like this a lot..

```cpp
#if (_WIN32_WINNT >= 0x0601)
    // Windows 7 or higher
#else
    // Windows XP and lower
#endif
```
But this is not the case here. It is just changing a couple of bytes in DB4S executable. Using the linker switch, `#pragma` in the source code, or `editbin` will accomplish that. To be honest, I think `editbin` is the best solution since almost everyone here wants to drop XP support.

How about making a new installer just for XP? So, after the build system make windows packages, it copies them, patch them using `editbin` then release as Windows XP only. Even better, make a new release for *older* versions of windows by using 4.00 (Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP) instead of 5.01.

As long as DB4S is not using newer Windows APIs it should work fine on older versions, without making any changes to the source code. If DB4S started using newer APIs then you can immediately stop releasing the older versions package and drop support for it, but not before that I hope.

@chrisjlocke I don't use Windows XP and yes I know it is old but I also know it is still has a large user base. Microsoft tried to drop support (stop making exe that will run on XP) for it in VS 2012 and failed. They were *forced*, by the huge user base, to add support for it in VS 2012, 2013, 2015.

I use Windows 7 and I continue to use it even after Microsoft [dropped support for it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet) about a year ago and I think most of DB4S windows users are on Windows 7.

If you don't want to support older OS then be ready in 3 years to find a way to make DB4S work on Windows 7 when its *extended support* ends in 2020, and Microsoft raises the minimum operating system version to Windows 8/10 in MSVC. @justinclift I agree with you, and that's why I prefer the `editbin` way, since it doesn't mess with the project build system or source code, and no files need to be changed. You can add it in the batch file that create the windows builds, and make a new installer for *legacy* windows.

Anyway, no one can support XP forever while every project is dropping support for it. According to this [comment](http://blog.qt.io/blog/2016/04/21/qt-5-7-beta-released/#comment-1197572) in Qt blog, Qt 5.6 LTS is the latest version to support XP. So keep that in mind when upgrading Qt. No support for XP? Too hard? Yeah, I hear ya. Too hard to use your product as well when there are so many other choices that do work...SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB. Wasn't too hard for them apparently ; )  ### Details for the issue

When SQL is executed in sqlitebrowser, the resulting table can be exportet to csv.
Generated csv-files are difficult to import into e.g. MS Excel, because for each datarow, the trailing separator is missing. When importing, the last column value of the first datarow is not ending with the desired separating character. The next datarow does not start with a separator, so at this point things get messed up.

 Should have digged deeper before opening this issue, found the corresponding issue-threads too late,sorry. Strange things happen in the Microsoft World: If you open the generated csv by double-clicking and excel opens, everything. If you try to import the same file from within excel via "import as text", the described problems arise :-)

  ### Details for the issue

If you open a database in DB4S that is also open in another process, then if you make changes to the database and click "Write Changes", the changes are not written to the database.  The journal file goes away and the changes remain in DB4S in memory, but as soon as the database is closed and reopened, the changes are gone.  There is no warning or error displayed.

At the end of an install, the installer asks if you would like to run the program.  If you leave that checkbox ticked yes, then the installer doesn't drop its own administrative priveleges before running DB Browser.  DB Browser, thus, gets run with those priveleges.

  I think you have just made your own case for waiting at least a month before taking a new release of SQLite! Hence I would suggest waiting at least a month before using 3.15.2. Just my personal view though. Just set yourself a reminder to check in a month's time, maybe 3rd of Jan actually! Then you can reopen this if necessary. Was looking good until 3.15.2 came along to be honest!!   ### Details for the issue

I'm trying to open an encrypted SqLite db and when I enter the key and click ok the dialog just blinks and provides no feedback as to what the issue is.
 
The db is encrypted using leCast128 as the algorithm if that helps.
 
I know the key is correct as the app I'me developing open the db without any issues.

Thanks Yes, other Qt apps work fine  under Wayland, e.g. Frescobaldi (lilypond editor, hosted here in github).

I recently upgraded the system from Fedora 24 to Fedora 25. I've found the solution [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1377616#c11); I installed qgnomeplatform and it's not crashing anymore.  ### Details for the issue

 Yes. it deleted the files and folders related to 3.9.0, and the shortcuts from the Start Menu (according to the log) By the way, the Windows File Association-wiki you linked seems to be outdated for Windows 10 / the current version of DbBrowser.

The Reg-key is located at `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\sqlite_auto_file\shell\open\command` and there exists a key (REG_SZ) with name `(Default)` with the value of `"C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite\3.9.0\bin\DB Browser for SQLite.exe" "%1"` (which i will now update)  When using the modify table option, adding a field (new column) you can select all SQLite types except BOOLEAN. Even if you edit the TYPE field with text BOOLEAN it remains as the default INTEGER.
 Thanks. Interestingly when I initialize the database I use BOOLEAN as the data type which is accepted by SQLite and also displayed in sqlitebrowser as BOOLEAN - hence this threw me off.   ### Details for the issue

The preferences do not seem to update in the data browser section, text colors.  They revert to black on black after closing the app - thanks in advance.

After opening a database having multiple tables, then high lighting a table name OTHER than the first in the list, then RIGHT CLICKING and selecting BROWSE TABLE incorrectly loads the data of the first table in the list, and NOT the one highlighted.
If that table is huge, you have to wait for it to load and display before you can select the table you wanted from the drop down box.

 I didn't look thru them since I only installed the product yesterday.  
Thought it was new.  But now I see the build I have is actually months 
old, so I will investigate the nightly builds as you suggest.

Hard to believe that the author added the right click menu items then 
didn't test them.:-)  My suggestions: when a field is just created, it gets a name like `FieldN` and then after you rename it upon creation, [`bool DBBrowserDB::renameColumn`](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/17369b66a62f748aba6106ce59554096dec38667/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L957) method gets called. However, this method obtains the version of a table which still has the old name of the field because table schemas are loaded [directly from database](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/17369b66a62f748aba6106ce59554096dec38667/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L1186-L1201), therefore [the membership check](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/17369b66a62f748aba6106ce59554096dec38667/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L982) fails. If you move field up, the same [`bool DBBrowserDB::renameColumn`](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/17369b66a62f748aba6106ce59554096dec38667/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L957) method gets called.

Currently I have no idea how to make this right. Here is my traceback when moving a field (truncated for short):

When in the Execute SQL tab, I am unable to edit any of the results returned from a SQL query.

Steps to duplicate:
1) Go to Execute SQL tab
2) Run a query ( e.g. **SELECT * FROM _[TableName]_** )
3) Try to edit any cell from results

Double-clicking on a cell takes the keyboard cursor to the "Edit Database Cell" view, but I am not able to make any changes.  The "Apply" button is greyed out and not clickable.

Is this by design? Or is there there an option I need to enable to make cells editable in the Execute SQL tab?

CoreData —no matter what I tried, showed up an error that my  table did not exist, when it did and I could see it by using SB. 

I was trying to pre-population a store and put it in my app bundle.
Turns out CoreData was creating the store for me and it was empty— no data—no table.

Once I got my head on straight and read their technical bulletin for the hundredth time, I figure out all I have to do was open their store with SB and fill it in with my data make a copy of that store and put it in my bundle, done.

Once again sorry the confusion,

When I try to import a .txt that I exported using Access 2010 I get the following error:
**Error importing data: Error in statement #1: near "33". Syntax error. Aborted execution.**

James

 This is line 1 in the txt file: 33,"Purchase",6/29/1998 0:00:00,$12312.00
Line 1 is the first row and "33" is the record ID of the first record.
Also, how come the import .csv grayed out?
 That was it.
I needed to create a new db with the fields to import to.

Thanks much,

  ### Details for the issue

Clicking on the 'Browse Data' tab always loads the first table or view alphabetically. After selecting the correct table, going to another tab and then coming back to 'Browse Data', it's the first table again. And if it's a big one, it takes time loading data you _weren't_ trying to browse.

So Feature request: 'Browse Data' should remember the last table/view you were on before having switched to another tab. (For that session.)

I'd consider this a bug - not remembering the last table/view in the Data Browser - but if it was never planned/intended, then it's a feature request.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

On the tab "Execute SQL", create a new SQL file and save it to your local drive.
Make a change to the document.
Click CTRL-S.
GET: File is not saved.
EXPECT: File to save.

Click "Save" button on toolbar.
GET EXPECTED: File is saved.

REASON: Every windows user in the world expects CTRL-S to save the current file regardless of the application (e.g. Notepad++, etc.). It is built into our fingers. Thank Microsoft for that. CTRL-SHIFT-S often saves all documents.

 Hi, I think I might be facing a similar issue, I pulled SQLCipher DB (created by an Android App) from an Android Box and tried to open, getting the same "Please enter the key used to encrypt the database" dialog over and over again, even though I have supplied it with the correct passkey. I am not setting page size, so I put page size 1024 in the dialog.

Could this be the same issue or a different one? If this is then please tell me how to _unlock_  the database file. I get this issue too when trying to open a file that's on a samba share yet when I copy the file to my desktop and open it there's no issues. I'm not sure as I have never used this product before and only noticed it on the first time I tried it.

Do you have a link to the nightly builds that I can try?
I'm using Mac OS Sierra if that matters. @justinclift both are working fine for me now. So the nightly has whatever issue I had fixed.  Apologies for the late response, I received the mail on a vacation when I had no tested news to add. But @justinclift unfortunately yes! I got it fixed but I don't know how. I didn't update the software, so unless some windows `exe`, `dll`, etc. files were required to run which were missing from the system previously I have no idea why DB Browser is suddenly working. Anyway the other day a junior colleague opened it because he didn't know DB Browser wasn't working for SQLCipher.

Meanwhile I checked and rechecked versions on both machines, same version (Software and OS both). Opened the file myself and voila, now it was opening the file as innocently as possible.  ### Details for the issue

  Hi, I was working with version 3.7.0 but now it's not working on MacOs.. Just FYI.  ### Details for the issue

I had Windows configured to associate the .db extension with DB4S in version 3.9.0.  When I upgraded to 3.9.1, I removed 3.9.0 and had to reassociate the extension.  To do this I:
1. Double click the .db file
2. In the "Open With" dialog, browse to C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite and double click the exe

At this point the dialog doesn't recognize that an application was selected.

If I replace the spaces in the executable name with with underscores (i.e. DB_Browser_for_SQLite), the association works correctly.

I reinstalled 3.9.0 and found that it has the same executable naming convention as 3.9.1, so I have a feeling that the underscore solution may be a red herring.

 That tool sure spits out a lot of noise,

Here's my procedure:
1. Open process monitor, disabled capturing and cleared the output
2. Got to the Open With dialog, browsed to the path (C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite), and selected the exe (didn't click open yet).  
3. Started capturing in the process monitor, quickly switched over and clicked Open in the dialog, then back to turn off capturing.

I've attached the PML log.  If you want it as CSV or XML let me know.  Here's what I see that's interesting with the Registry and File System Activity enabled.
1. 4:55:13.9534235 - Looks like the first time DB4S is accessed. 
2. There are then a lot of registry hits, some of which look like they may be looking for EXEs
3. 4:55:13.9751138 - It looks like there are a series of registry accesses for DB4S
4. 4:55:13.9767010 - I see an access for the 3.9.0 path that I used to have

I imagine that something is still pointing to the 3.9.0 path in registry, Windows gets confused and just punts.
[Logfile.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/570186/Logfile.zip)

On a hunch, I jumped into regedit and looked at HKCU\Software\Classes\Applications\DB Browser for SQLite.exe\shell\open\command, and that looks like the culprit.  It has a value of "C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite\3.9.0\bin\DB Browser for SQLite.exe" "%1" 

So it looks to me that either the 3.9.0 uninstall didn't clean this up or the 3.9.1 install didn't overwrite it.  Also, the reason that adding the underscores worked is that it pointed it to a new registry key.

Let me know if you need anything else from me.
 In windows 10 is't super simple, but .sqlite and .db association would be a great addition to the installer.  ### Details for the issue

It would be helpful to (have the option to) always have a blank row ready at the bottom of a table for new data entry. This would save the steps of clicking "new record" and then selecting which value to enter.

My use case is for relatively rapid manual data entry during an athletic event. The data will be used for displaying current results. I am using `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIME` in order to match the entry time to the racer bib number that is entered. Processing and display will be handled in R/Shiny.

 @chrisjlocke, I'm considering a custom application, but I figured I would try an existing database interface first. My main sticking point is to be able to change "bad" data in table form; this seems more complicated to code than just accepting a series of bib numbers.

@justinclift, I was thinking of a row that wouldn't actually be written until non-default values were entered, which if possible would mean no rows full of keys or timestamps but nothing else. I don't know how much harder that is to do, though.
    What about using `DELETE FROM `table` WHERE `_rowid_` IN ( ... )` here https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/60e4cb758ed58db3a8d01cb13e82d79cf2d3ef33/src/sqlitedb.cpp#L873-L876 in all cases regardless of whether one or multiple records should be deleted?
 It turns out that the method `removeRow` of `SqliteTableModel` object gets invoked [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/982e4c4d346e066b72e8a8df2d47fa00c0075269/src/MainWindow.cpp#L589), and since [`SqliteTableModel`](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/982e4c4d346e066b72e8a8df2d47fa00c0075269/src/sqlitetablemodel.h#L11) is a subclass of [`QAbstractTableModel`](https://github.com/qt/qt/blob/0a2f2382541424726168804be2c90b91381608c6/src/corelib/kernel/qabstractitemmodel.h#L345) which is, in turn, a subclass of `QAbstractItemModel`, the following code from Qt library is executed:

``` c++
inline bool QAbstractItemModel::removeRow(int arow, const QModelIndex &aparent)
{ return removeRows(arow, 1, aparent); }
```

that is, it forces us to have only 1 row deleted.
My backtrace on deletion looks like this:

``` gdb

It seems to me that we cannot delete multiple records at once if we rely on table model of Qt. 
Should we bypass the `inline bool QAbstractItemModel::removeRow` method call?
  ### Details for the issue

I find it interesting to find out that mac's build of the latest app lacks fts4 support. I use the same app on windows and it has fts4.

So I'm opening this ticket as a feature request.

I also want to refer to already closed ticket https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/762 which is not clear if the feature is already added or not.

 I don't mind supporting FTS5 as it seems to be a more mature version of previous efforts. It seems though like FTS3/4 and FTS5 can coexist.

xerial's JDBC driver at least have both.

Here's the make file https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/blob/master/Makefile

Hope it helps.
 -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3
-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS

Enables both FTS3 and FTS4

see https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html section "2. Compiling and Enabling FTS3 and FTS4"
 I'd be glad to.
 Done.
 Is there anything at this point to do? Just tested on the latest nightly build: DB Browser for SQLite-sqlcipher_20161127.dmg
On fts4 and fts5 databases, both worked fine. I'm glad we got this quickly sorted out.

Now we need fts5 support on win32 as well..  ### Details for the issue

Hello everyone, the latest DB Browser has a weird issue. The default field colors for showing the result table is black. I tried to change that from the app preferences, it works for the current app instance but resets back to black when the app is reopened.

 Same problem :/

Maybe problem with prefences (plist)?
 Workaround: delete pref ~/Library/Preferences/com.sqlitebrowser.sqlitebrowser.plist and don't edit preferences of application.  Hi guys,

I have tables with newlines in them (it is an event log). Old SQLiteBrowser (3.8.0) used to export these tables like a champ.

Now, 3.9.1 breaks the export and Excel/Google Drive is no longer able to parse the file you all are creating. It seems to be coming out as garbage, lines munged together, almost like the memory is corrupted somehow.
 That was it, thanks!
  ### Details for the issue

<!--

If you click on the "Browse Data" tab, select a table and then click to another tab (e.g. "Execute SQL"), when you click back on the "Browse Data" tab the application reverts back to showing the first table in the list and not the one you were previously viewing. i.e. it has "forgotten" the table you were viewing and you have to navigate back to where you were.

Also, in the "Database Structure" tab, if you right-click on a table and select "Browse Table" from the pop-up menu, you are taken to the first table in the list (under the "Browse Table" tab), not the one you selected,

 I duped this one in issue #873.

Re-tried and works, with the last nightly build - 2016-11-18, win64, v3.9.99
 One thing to add to this bug, which is **also/already fixed in the nightlies**: When we right-click on a Table or View in 'DB Structure' and select 'Browse Data', it doesn't take you to that table in the data browser. Instead, it's always the first table/view by sort order. In the nightly I tested against (2016-11-18), this works correctly: right-click on table/view ➜ Browse data takes you to that one in the data browser.

_Btw, this should probably be added to [3.10.0 - A Rubber Cactus Has Many Uses](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/milestone/11)._ Hi Justin,


  yes, sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I can confirm that this bug is fixed in the latest nightly build.


Cheers,

Michael.

We are using sqllitedb browser to maintain a local db on the device. The issue is everytime we close and reopen the device the foreign key constraint/pragma is unchecked and as a part user is able to insert corrupt content in the DB. Please resolve.

 Same issue on windows portable build. Also seems to ignore the pragma after I turn it on (i can still insert invalid rows)

Still seems broken in nightly Yes, it is checked. I'm sorry I can't build myself and check what's going on for you but I don't do any dev on windows  yes I am :) i also tried `PRAGMA foreign_keys = on;` in the sql box and write changes after running that. Still no luck Sorry @justinclift , I won't have access to a windows PC for a while !  ### Details for the issue

Hi,

I'm currently running DB Browser for SQLite v3.9.1 (64 bit) on a 64 bit version of Windows 10. Whenever I click on "New Database" or "Open Database", the program crashes. I've tried both the 32 and 64 bit versions. I get the following message box whenever the program crashes:

 Thanks justin and chris. I'll try the suggestions and report back
 I tried the two nightly builds but they didn't work either. I also tried running the program as an administrator, running windows in safe mode and also trying it in a different windows account (with admin privileges) and it still crashes.

I checked the entries in the Event Viewer, and it still contains the same information. It doesn't display anything different. Is there anything else that we can try?
 I opened the executable in it. When I did so, I got the following pop up, but it still let me continue.

Here's what it looked like after I clicked on "OK" in the popup. I get several errors, but I'm not sure where to start.

I've saved and attached the .dwi file.

[DB Browser for SQLite.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/556666/DB.Browser.for.SQLite.zip)
 So, if I filter out everything that begins with API-MS-WIN and EXT-MS, I'm left with the following:

```
DEVICELOCKHELPERS.DLL
EMCLIENT.DLL
IESHIMS.DLL
```
 It looks like the C++ redistributables were already installed on my computer. When I ran "vcredist_x64.exe", it brought up a window with "Repair" and "Uninstall" options. I tried "Repair" first, but it's still doing the same thing. Next I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, but still nothing.
 justin,

I tried googling, but I couldn't find any leads on which installers are supposed to distribute the dll's.

chris,

That sounds promising. I'll get Process Monitor on my computer. Just let me know where to go from there.
 Hi Justin, sorry I've been busy working on a few other things. I should be able to try it out tomorrow. Sorry for the delay.
 Hi,
i have the same problem as softdev, but on Linux (OpenSuSE 13.1 64bit).
I've tested version 3.6.0 and 3.8.0 from SuSE buildservice and compiled version 3.9.1 myself.
When i start sqlitebrowser as root everything works fine. But when i start it as normal user it crashes with a "segmentation fault" when i click on "Open Database".

libqt version is 4.8.5
 It seems to be a bug in qt4.
I've started qtconfig and set "GUI Style" to "Motiv", everything works fine.
This could be a solution for windows too.
  Set user_version of the new db to current user_version.
Otherwise user_version would be set to 0.
  It seems like it has to do with these lines https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/60e4cb758ed58db3a8d01cb13e82d79cf2d3ef33/src/ExportDataDialog.cpp#L92 and https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/60e4cb758ed58db3a8d01cb13e82d79cf2d3ef33/src/ExportDataDialog.cpp#L113-L116, that is, it quotes the contents of a field only if there are characters to be escaped. For example, if you have the following data:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6525383/19951659/a2dced20-a170-11e6-83f8-acd018e4c9e3.png)
you can export like this:

``` csv
id,flag
a,"E""E"
b,D D
c,C C
d,B B
e,A A
```

 So maybe we should introduce something like `chars_to_quote` alongside with `special_chars`?
  ### SqliteBrowser support for **_extensions:_** "intrinsic (JSON1)" and "externals", and _compiler-toolchain options_: "Windows/`clang`"

_The following is a effectively a direct re-post of the e-mail I sent yesterday to Justin Clift, which I am posting here at his most kind e-mail suggestion._

Hi Justin,

Apologies for directly pinging you, I can't find any other means to inquire on a "posting-board" of some kind.

**SqliteBrowser** is a great project and a valuable community asset.

**QUESTION-1**: I was looking to see whether the _intrinsic_ **JSON1** _extension_ could be turned on _by-default_ in the nightly builds _(at least the **Windows** version)_ of **SqliteBrowser**?

_Side-note on non-intrinsic **Sqlite** extensions_: Given that **SqliteBrowser** is a great and openly available tool specifically for **Sqlite**, it makes sense to me that it also would be a hosting location for obtaining **Sqlite _extension libraries_** that are binary-compatible with its various platform versions. _Which, leads me to the more detailed second question..._

_First, some contextual background_: I do development work on **afm-scm** (afm-scm.org) _[which is a compatible variant of **fossil-scm**]_ and its integrated **TSL** language-engine and its hosting **AOS** object-system-engine. The **T**ext-**S**cripting-**L**anguage (ts-lang.org) is, for the most part, a superset of TCL blended with JavaScript, Smalltalk, Lisp/Scheme and intrinsically supports and integrates **Sqlite**.

**QUESTION-2**: Would it make sense to enable seamless `make` of **SqliteBrowser** _(on any platform, but especially **Windows**)_ using `clang` as a supported _(possibly-default)_ choice for a fully cross-platform compiler build tool for **SqliteBrowser**?

If one wants cross-platform source build compatibility at the C/C++ language and toolchain level there are few natively compatible options; and only one _(_`clang`_)_ that is also _gnu-compatible_.  As it stand now, building **SqliteBrowser** for **_Windows_** is a _non-trivial distraction_ since it requires variations of the _gnu-based_ toolchain to build quasi-compatible **_Windows_** binaries _(or an apparently complex setup of components to build via **VisualStudio** or_ `cmake` _or_ `nmake` _etc)_.

Not having some solution to these questions, in practice, _cripples_ **SqliteBrowser** use with "optional" Sqlite features and extensions. 

The **SqliteBrowser** _default_ releases do not link to a **Sqlite** _(coff)_ library so one has to **_recompile_** the whole **SqliteBrowser** app. I.e., it doesn't reference **Sqlite** via a `shared-library` and its binary depends on the _gnu-toolchain_. Thus, things like the **_intrinsic JSON1 extension_** are "apparently-hard" to build as a **Sqlite** _discrete extension_. This is **quite** "problematic".

_Point in case_: I have various databases with **TRIGGERS** that use and depend on **JSON1** _(an invaluable extension to **Sqlite**)_. The **SqliteBrowser** is _unusable_ with those database tables that have such triggers.

I don't have any _obvious solution_ other than to take the time and effort to create an _alternative_ to **SqliteBrowser** built-on the **_afm/fossil_** toolset. 

But, my real hope and desire is that the **SqliteBrowser** team might be open to a path to enable _intrinsic_ **Sqlite** _extensions_ such as **JSON1** to become accessible via **SqliteBrowser** either by it being built to reference **Sqlite** via a `shared-library`, or making various _intrinsic extensions_, such as **JSON1**, enabled _by-default_ in the **SqliteBrowser** app builds. 

This would be further aided in its simplicity and flexibility with cross-platform support for `clang` as a standardly supported build-chain tool. I assert this would eliminate _(most, if not all)_ special case platform issues for **Windows**.

A bit of other _background_ on `clang` availability: The current **Windows** `clang-tools` are available _freely_, and _natively_ integrated and supported within **Visual Studio** from **Microsoft**; as well as being _freely_  available from the `primary clang team` for use as `standalone` **Windows** based _gnu-compatible_ compiler tools. 

It might _(and probably would)_ be easier to configure the **Window's** builds to use either the _free_ `native` **Window's** **Visual Studio** `clang` tools or the _freely_ downloaded **Windows** `standalone` command-line `clang-tools` from the _official_ `clang` website. 

**SqliteBrowser** supporting a standard model of `clang` based build configuration would allow building on almost every platform with the same _gnu-compatible_ compiler. _This is what I use for building my code on all processors (Arm, Intel, ...) and platforms (BSD, Linux, Windows, OSX, ...); and worthy of mention, is that this also enables the **option** to build **for-all** platforms simultaneously on  single machine - although that is a bit more work :-) to set up._

Thanks for listening,

#### I'm opening this issue because:
- [X] DB4S needs a feature
- [X] DB4S has another problem
 I spent some 4 hours on this and the CMAKE file is difficult in terms of 
the dependency list and what needs to be configured. I am pretty sure 
that doing this right is many days of work to revise the build process, 
easier to start from scratch.

During the 4 hours or so I spent, it required polluting a dev-box with 
superfluous tools and libraries and language runtimes.

I.e., The build steps are fragile. QT is a beast. I ran out of time with 
ANTLR and QT issues and configuring CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, ...

It has hard-coded paths, version information ...

The CMake file assumed explicit versions of many of its dependencies on 
binaries and particular libraries. QT is onerous for many reasons 
including the managerial aspects introduced by their marketing approach 
to make money.

It assumes various tools and libraries are installed that are not called 
out in the material listed on:

https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S

I found the CMake code process complicated with dependencies.

I understand it is portable-UI (around the scintilla-core editor) over 
the portable and easy to build SqLite engine.

For the windows components there is no-need for the redist files, just 
link them into the binary. The libs could be linked in or provided as 
so/dll's and on windows use delay-loaded dlls.

# Could it not be built as: (cmd line for 32/6 bit build)

a) SqLite lib reference (binary download - or discrete C-compiler build)
b) Translation tool for localization of code (perhaps directly invoking 
Linguist tool if that is best option)
c) OpenSSL lib reference (binary download - or discrete C/C++ build) 

## [why is SSL required?]

d) Qt lib reference (binary download - or discrete build)
e) Drag-install with self-installation/uninstallation in Main to avoid 
need for NSIS

The ANTLR reference does not make clear if it is using Java, Python, C#, 
etc; or how it is expecting to access ANTLR.

If ANTLR2 is not available, it is unclear what the code will need or 
will try to do...

# I assume it is just a build:
1. Compile SqLite or use a existing LIB or SO/DLL
2. Compile OpenSSL or use a existing LIB or SO/DLL [which of the 
   components needs this, is unclear]
3. Provide a portable UI using some framework, support locales for 
   globalization
   3.1 QT Chosen, locale support provided by Linguist
   3.1.2 QT compilation (if not using pre-built binaries) requires 
   Scintilla compilation
4. Package the resulting binary/resources into an installer (better if 
   bundled straight into coff-binary)
   4.1 Let app be it's own installer [it does not need to register 
   anything complicated with any of its host-platforms]

I think it might be easier to build and enrich as a Chromium/Electron 
app, or just see if the Linux cross-platform build steps are somehow 
simpler.

 @innermous 

Sorry.
I tried to get nightly build, but http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org is unreachable for me, due to some unknown reason :(
 @chrisjlocke

Yes! I can access chrisjlocke.co.uk, your blog.
It seems that nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org is blocked by GFW.

Could you upload the latest nightly build to your blog? I'll test it.

Thank you for your kind help.

Great! It works! THANK YOU!

  ### Details for the issue

Axis? Axes?

Well, my point is, it would be awesome to be able to change the limits of the axis window.
Right now it uses the current max/min for X and Ys, which is a little bit inconvenient. (Remember I can´t plot lines? So dots get cut in half)

Also, by adding that we would have a "zooming" tool. (I think this feature seems very easy to implement, whereas a true zooming thing seems much more complicated)

e.g. When I plot this:
![axis limits](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19496875/9286c574-9557-11e6-91d5-f976cbbf0a4e.png)

I would rather be able to chose to have something like this:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19496919/d4c1d4ce-9557-11e6-94f9-daa53691ca0a.png)

Or in this occasion:
![axis limits 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19496994/198e81ec-9558-11e6-8f09-a8c88f223261.png)
Where do all the corners (upper left side) that follow a straight line go down to? If I was able to chose "show me X from 0 to 200", I wouldn't be forced to go to EXCEL

  Hi everyone,
I exactly have the same issue on my installation (Ubuntu 16.04 64b)
Version 3.9.99
Version de Qt : 5.5.1
Version de SQLite : 3.11.0 It seems I'm on the testing ppa "ubuntu xenial"
where I can see the file modified date ?
Thank you The error occur all the time.

The error appear if I click "Write changes" on the interface or "Write changes" in file menu.
If I close the database in the file menu. I click yes to save changes made and it's ok.
Database is ok

Database is also saved if I just click on "Write changes" and close the database without saving it.
I got the error but the database is saved..

I don't know if I answer to your question ?
```
Error while saving the database file. This means that not all changes to the database were saved. You need to resolve the following error first.

no such savepoint: RESTOREPOINT (RELEASE RESTOREPOINT;)
```

  Update some obsolete translations. These translations used to work in previous version.
 No problem, I'll translate them soon.
 I created a new PR here: #840

 Ok, I'll try as I have a chance. Maybe today evening.
Thanks for fixing the bugs anyways.

What about the cmake support? I'll test that too.

Lev Unfortunately it doesn't compile on my system. I have an up to date Debian Jessie. It seems that my system got too old.

/usr/include/c++/4.9/bits/c++0x_warning.h:32:2: error: #error This file requires compiler and library support for the ISO C++ 2011 standard. This support is currently experimental, and must be enabled with the -std=c++11 or -std=gnu++11 compiler options.
 #error This file requires compiler and library support for the \

I try tomorrow on a Debian testing with more recent compiler.

Lev Ok. Just a note. Should the cmake/qmake system take care about dependencies? So it shall detect Qt5.7, and refuse to configure the code if it is older. I tried on Debian testing, with recent Qt and compiler. qmake doesn't
complained about my obvious missing dependency:

In file included from sqlitedb.cpp:2:0:
sqlite.h:13:25: fatal error: sqlite3.h: No such file or directory
     #include <sqlite3.h>

After installing the required packages, it installed fine. I suggest using
cmake as the code configuration tool.

Levente One of the major user case of cmake is to detect installed packages. .configure (autotool) did the same thing, but it isn't portable (eg. it is a PITA on Windows). I personally use cmake it to detect SQLite. Here is what I do.

[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/991259/CMakeLists.txt)

I use the same CMakeLists.txt on Linux and FreeBSD, so this is cross platform. I was lazy, and I just detect presence of libsqlite3, but with a small tweak, you can even detect, and require specific major/minor/patch version too.

I'm sorry if this is not the right place to suggest things. And I think we can close this issue, since the original problem is solved now. Thanks.  ...and if you could include  package dependencies for a generic Linux system to use QT5, that would be nice too. It now insists on using QT4. This is just a wish.

Thanks,
Lev
 Okay. I was too fast typing that wish. I read the documentation again, and there is a package list there. After installing those, it does build fine using QT5. I'm so sorry about the former message.
 An documentation update would be very much welcome. I tried to build sqlitebrowser with sqlcipher support longer that I liked using [building.md](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md) on a (K)ubuntu 16.04.1. I could not build the master no matter what I used (cmake, make, qmake -> _/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/QtCore/qhash.h:103:5: error: no matching function for call to ‘qHash(const QVector<QSharedPointer<sqlb::Field> >&)’_)._ The only combination that worked was to use the v3.9.1 Tag, install _qt4-default_ and use _qmake CONFIG+=sqlcipher ._ and then _make_.
Once built sqlitebrowser works flawlessly! Thx for this awesome tool.

 Jepp, just now. :) Thank you. Good luck! That's interesting. Feel free to ask the version number of any package that I have installed. :smile: Totally agree. KDE was glorious in the 3.x days. It hat a pretty rough time in the beginning of the 4.x versions but now it's pretty good looking **and** stable :smile:  Yes, my Kubuntu uses Qt 5.5.1. I got a blackscreen on my machine this morning. After a lot of hassel a reinstallation of KDE fixed things. So much for stable :smile: Maybe the Qt up- and downgrades messed things up. Dunno....
I am totally fine using v3.9.1 and thinks it is the best/easiest solution if you declare yourself to be Qt 5.6 (and above) only. Just updated build-docs and everybody is happy :smiley: 
 Guys, cmake is broken at the moment.

After struggling an hour to get 3.9.1 build with cmake, I found this issue, and switched to qmake.
FWIW, my builds are public: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:frispete:PyQt5/sqlitebrowser

The problem with cmake starts with the first line of CMakeLists.txt:
`project("DB Browser for SQLite")`

Urgh, blanks in projects name. We all know, that build systems are troublemakers, but this is just a way to **beg** for it... ;)

Next hurdle is missing `C++11` support, that is needed by newer Qt versions.
Fixed this by adding:
`set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-std=c++11" CACHE STRING "compile flags" FORCE)`
to CMakeLists.txt.

Next, it generated gems like this in `CMakeFiles/DB Browser for SQLite.dir/build.make`:
```
# Object files for target DB Browser for SQLite
DB Browser for SQLite_OBJECTS = \
"CMakeFiles/DB Browser for SQLite.dir/src/AboutDialog.cpp.o" \
```
Note the macro name. Guess, what make says to such expressions... <spit>
Fixed it with a sed script.

After that, I realized, that you creates files, based on this name:
```
if(UNIX AND NOT APPLE)
        install(FILES src/icons/${PROJECT_NAME}.png
                DESTINATION share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/)

        install(FILES distri/${PROJECT_NAME}.desktop
                DESTINATION share/applications/)

        install(FILES distri/${PROJECT_NAME}.desktop.appdata.xml
                DESTINATION share/appdata/)
```

At this point, I went to qmake, which got it to build at least, and *thankfully* kept the old, but sane name. 

I still have a few things, that I don't like: the build system should allow to use the platform qscintilla lib. I tried that with qmake, but failed, since openSUSE uses -lqscintilla2-qt5 to distinguish it from qt4 builds, and qmake just removes -qt5. Oh well..

It's up and running, but... I think it is not cmake what is broken. It is sqlitebrowser that miss uses
cmake. Correct?

 @justinclift Well, to be honest, I'm glad to have it running "nearly" current. The rename of the binary and all is a real PITA for packagers like me. So even with cmake fixed, I'm inclined to keep the qmake build, because I'm lazy, and sqlitebrowser would be the very first app, that contain spaces in the name (we only have a few thousand other binaries @openSUSE...). Be assured, that this will lead to headaches for about every Linux packager of your package out there. 

It's not a question of "if it breaks", it's a question of where. 

@leventelist: I don't think, that cmake is a beautiful piece of software, but as noted before, the project name alone is a receipt for trouble. You can call your program as you like, but I would refrain from using any spaces in it, at least not in those parts, that face a file system. @justinclift I see, the CMakeLists.txt looks better now. Let's make a deal, you provide some way of using the system qscintilla, and I test, help to fix the fallout, and push the result to openSUSE official.. 

Hmm the qscintilla version is tweaked, but that is flagged as needed from MacOS only, hence it should be fine. Deal? @justinclift BTW, the separate Qt packages are available here: http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.7/5.7.1/submodules/ Good news for [openSUSE:](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/451660)

   ### Details for the issue

Since version 3.9.0 it came to my attention that tables are sorted during save of the database. In version 3.9.0 it was only sorted when you did a refresh of the table, but since version 3.9.1 it always sort the table prior it is saved.

This is very annoying, because I have a config table in the database, which contains configuration parameters for my application which should be saved in the order it was written in the table. Now the table is sorted when saved, I can not read the table anymore, because al configuration items are out of order and my application behaves bad.

Please tell me that this sort option can be switched off somewhere, because I use tables which should not be sorted, but stay in the order the were written.

 Hello,
What I use is:
Select \* from adapter;
If rs <> nil then
Do until rs.eof
  cgf=cfg+1
  Config(cfg)=rs.field("ConfData").stringvalue
  rs.MoveNext
Loop
End if
The config array will be used to configure the application.
These entries in the db should stay unchanged as I wrote them in the db, but the last 2 versions of sqlitebrowser sort them ascending before writing the changes.
That is my problem. 
With kind regards,
Rob
 chrisjlocke, I am sure it is not only the view. If I restart the application after I saved the db changes, the application goes nuts. When I pause th eapplication and check its config, all the values are in the wrong places. This was not the case with the version prior 3.9.0. With 3.9.0 I really also thought that it was only the view, because I saw that refreshing the records sorted the records in the table, but as far as I know it did not save that sorted order. Now with 3.9.1 I am faced with a changed table. Before upgrading to 3.9.1 I never saw my application going nuts.

I dont want an order in this table, I know how to order the table ascending or descending on a certain field, but I want this table unsorted in the order that I wrote the records into the table. Unchanged.
That is the way I do read the table when I start the application, in the order I did write th erecords in the table.
 Justin, I dont want my table sorted. I only want it in the way I did write the records to the table. These are only 14 records and it is read in the way it was saved when setup was used of my application.
 hmmm...ok, then I will use an index from 1 to 14 to keep the table in the order I want it to be.

No, just one field. I use it this way to have just 1 database containing all the files I need and not all kind of seperate files on disk. With only one field I can make changes in the setup of my application without a need to adjust the database fields. If I change something one day and have a config item more, I delete the contents of the table and write 15 records to that table. When something else goes out, I delete the contents of the table again and write 14 records in the table. You see my point, I do not need to add or delete fields in the table. This is by the way the only table I use this way, all other tables are used as you would expect a database is used and do not give any problem. :-)
 Ok, that is what I thought already.
Fyi, Justin, sqlitebrowser is a great application, I use it during development of my application to check if the info is stored in the tables as I want it and also ti flip bits to see how my application responds on the change.
Great work!
  ### Details for the issue

If I want to browse the data which I select from "Database Structure Tab"
It opens the first table of the database, not the one I selected. 

Also when I switching through the tabs, the table that I selected in "Browse Data" tab suddenly relocated to the first table of the db.

  In windows 10, when exporting a single table, all the characters are on the same line, making it impossible to reuse the data for importing.
   @justinclift: I can see that you just found the two links I was going to send you. So, as you may have seen, the latest version of QScintilla that contains the GPL exception is version 2.8.4, which was released in September 2014 (!!). The author of QScintilla has been considering switching to LGPL+commercial for more than a year now, but still hasn't made up his mind.

For my project, we can't afford going back to 2.8.4, so we discussed it internally and we have decided to switch to GPLv3 (see issue opencor/opencor#1301). > @agarny Thoughts? Does the latest qscintilla release solve the problem properly? 😄

FWIW, QScintilla 2.8.10 does indeed solve the problem.  ### Details for the issue

The plot is done in such a way, that the variable selected as "X", is the one that forces the order of the connecting points, So take a look at this nice loop:

 @revolter It kind of makes sense that somewhere in the code there is a line that says, order the rows by X.
Because if not, given the definition of a relational query, the order doesn't matter, so it could be that the results would appear like this:
![wrong](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19350645/9a3e31b0-9126-11e6-923d-78c6308c47ec.png)
Instead of like this:

It's the exact same plot, but the order of the rows is switched.
  ### Details for the issue

I usualy plot x vs y, but what happens when you only want to plot y? Let me put my example:

In this image, I want to see, visually, how the variable "Total Volume" is distributed, Using only what is available:

Most probably there is a SQL command that generates such a column, I idon't know. I still think it would be a neat feature.

 @MKleusberg the first one works like charm (still, not user friendly, on excel you can select just a column of data and ask for plotting series).

The second one adds a row which is probably the original order of the data. The order by clause has to be somewhere else, I guess inside the parenthesis.
![not the same numbers](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19351507/1a84d7b8-912a-11e6-9f80-4fe9e163d546.PNG)
Since the row number and the rownum column are not the same, the result is not exactly what I was looking for.
 Holly cow,
That is already KIND of implemented:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19521840/3498adce-95e3-11e6-97da-8006f8c659f9.png)
Ok, this is strange. I read what that thing does and it is doing something unrelated. (bug)
The interesting thing is that it retrieved a set of columns (that DO NOT appear on the results tab) from what looks like a previous query.
The query I was working on has nothing to do with that set of rows and columns, but clicking on that it added the _rowid_
If I go back to sql, ask for anything else, and click that gear sign again, it happens again, retrieves that magical data from IDontKnowWhere, with my beloved _rowid_ column
 @MKleusberg Hey! no need to ask for pardon!! ;)

So, if you tell me the nightly you mention is here:
https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/
Yes, I'll give it a try.

Sadly though, I am using the DB Browser since I started around August to focus more on organizing the data I was generating for a project and analyzing it. This has been a temporary position and I will be unemployed at the end of November. I am sure I will be around sqlite db browser (I have read so many names, that I don't really know which is the last acronym you use 😆 )  in the near future...

I am sure this will be a great addition for more people to come!!
 @MKleusberg 
Since you didn't confirm that, I completely forgot to check again. Today I needed it, and tried on the nightlies how it works.
It is just what I asked, I think this thread can be closed!

I hope other people find it useful as well!!
Thanks, thanks!!
 Hey @MKleusberg !
I have to say that I found other issues with that nighlty build. For example that between queries that had as an output the same columns, it did not remember the ones that were being plotted.
Before I had column1 as X and column2 as Y and after running a new query the graph got updated. With the nightly I had to select the columns to be plotted again.
Also I remember (it's been a month without playing with it), a significant decrease in performance when selecting the columns to plot. I don't know if that was a consequence of the feature I wished it had, or by some other addition..

And those where PV loops. Pressure-Volume loops of the left ventricle of a simulation of a human heart!
90% of what I was plotting were Pressure vs Time or Pressure vs Volume of all different heart chambers; the most iconic being the left ventricle.

Best regards and merry xmas!  ### Details for the issue

In the latest version (3.9.1) for Mac, the font on the SQL Editor is very small and I can't see a way to change it.

I have a very large monitor, but it isn't a HiDPI display. On the built-in retina display, the font is more readable, but still tiny.

 Well, I'm an idiot. I thought I went through all of the tabs. Shows me for reporting yesterday's issue today before trying again.
 I think part of it was that I saw font settings on the data browser tab and tried them and then had my attention pulled away. Might be useful to group the font settings into one area/tab?

Unrelated, has anyone else had an issue with the data browser font and background color resetting to black on black when the app starts up?
 It was on 9. I bumped it to 12. Part of me thinks it could do with 13 or 14 even, but the rest of me thinks I'm getting to old for my own good if I need that big a font.
 I tried it on a retina panel and a Dell Ultra-Wide (non-HiDPI) and both were small at 9px (same approximate physical size, actually). It may be @MKleusberg has the zoom setting on 125% (seems like that's the default on Windows 7 and above) or 150%? That would low 8px up to 12-15-ish.
 Hi, am not sure if this is the correct thread (if not, I am sorry please let me know where to post this) but "Command" + "-" decreased the font size and I was looking for a way to increase it when I stumbled across this issue.

Wanted to ask if there is a similar command to increase the font size as well?
 @justinclift Yes, I meant for DB Browser for SQLite. I have just started using it for a project and was playing around when i accidently pressed this combo.

And yes, I have tried  ⌘ + + to increase font size, but it doesn't work.
 @justinclift I did go through the thread and figured that out from an earlier comment of yours. Thanks a lot for posting it again though :)

I was just wondering since there appeared to be a shortcut to decrease font size (in the Execute SQL tab), was there anything similar to increase font size as well.
 Hmm.
The code has been changed, but default value is still 9 when I run the program, version 3.9.1. 
Could there be some error in build system, not setting Q_OS_MAC correctly? (Or is this simply not yet in version 3.9.1)

(Code is in Settings.cpp, line 200 and forward).
```

    // editor/fontsize or log/fontsize?
    if((group == "editor" || group == "log") && name == "fontsize")
#ifdef Q_OS_MAC
	// Use 12 pt size as the default on OSX
        return 12;
#else
        return 9;
#endif

Hi,

I don't want to be picky, collaborators of this repo do a great job and I'm very thankful to you.

I just realized that sqlite browser is slower than it should when opening big tables. like 150k rows vs 45 columns (cells with small/medium text size). It seems that the program tries to load the entire table before visualization. Wouldn't be better, if possible, to load just the rows that are contained in the current view?

Anyway, just a suggestion :) if I can help with anything just ask.
Thanks!
 @revolter no, unfortunately it doesn't help.
@chrisjlocke In some tables I might have, but in others I don't have for sure and it still take ~1 or 2 min to open the table.

By the way, my cpu is the i5-6300HQ 2.3GHz.
 @justinclift No, even with 1 it takes a lot of time to load :(
 Off-topic: @justinclift was that image generated by software or did you manually write the text and draw the boxes? Just curious.
 Thanks, @justinclift.
 @revolter I can't send the database since it has confidential data. As soon as I have some minutes I'll create and post a similar dummy database so you can see the problem. Thanks!
  ### Details for the issue

First of all, I want to apologize if I am doing anything wrong. This is my FIRST ever ticket on Github.

When I select one column for x axis, and start selecting columns for the y axis, the automatic chosen colors seem to appear at total randomness:
![order of colors](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19245271/21402e1a-8eee-11e6-8be2-61fb9689faad.PNG)

I selected them in order, one after the other with no other actions in between. This is constantly happening. I think a predefined set of colors should be used, and colors with easy differentiation. Like excel does, it starts with blue, goes to red, and so on. Always.

Next thing about the colors. Please, remove the yellow from the automatically selected colors:
![yellow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19245452/313640a6-8eef-11e6-9577-583e426c875e.png)
here it is "easy" to see because there's a lot of fluctuation, but take a look at the beginning of the graph, there's no contrast with yellow on white.

For the kind of purpose I am using it, I don't save projects. But for your comment it looks like it would help me not to lose my SQL queries, since until now what I do is save a couple of "key" queries, and load and modify them every time. I had no idea that feature existed. Thanks for the info!

I would love to participate in improving the graphing capabilities, since I already have several things in mind that would ease out a lot my workflow. But I don't want to stress the team with tickets.
 I think I found the "line":
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/MainWindow.cpp#L1984

```

            // get a default color
            QColor curbkcolor = changeitem->backgroundColor(column);
            QColor color = !curbkcolor.isValid() ? (Qt::GlobalColor)(qrand() % 13 + 5) : curbkcolor;

```

Wow, you are all going fast!
 @MKleusberg thanks for your nice comments.
I will open then a couple of suggestions!
 Hi @revolter, 
well, I don't want to sound rude or ungrateful, but I am sure we can come up with a sequence of colors that is better distinguishable from one another. One question is, in which order did you pick pick columns? The first three are very similar, and going to the center, the difference between alternate colors is still very similar.

Let's face one thing, usually you will just need to plot two, three, four lines, so for me, apart from allowing that functionality, which from your message I understand that you have already done so 👍 , what is left is choosing these easily distinguishable colors. I am going to throw this out there, as a suggestion of a palette that gets the work done:
![suggerence](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18152095/19335415/161b6718-90d1-11e6-9e6d-4eea3caa9a97.PNG)

I would personally increase the saturation of excel's (except for yellow, damn YELLOW!)

What do you think?
 @revolter The last approach (golden ratio one) from the article you linked, really seems to work! right? Is that the code you used? If so maybe you where very unlucky with the randomness?
  Not sure if I understand how this should work to correctly follow Mac-OS conventions.. I get the following behaviour from 3.9.1v2 on my Macbook Pro.

 cmd backspace = deletes a word (i.e. anithing surrounded by whitespace)
 alt backspace = deletes the whole line

 but here is a bit of special behaviour:
if you first do cmd backspace (i.e. deleting words), the alt backspace changes behaviour to undoing the cmd backspace until all changes have been undone - then it deletes the full line.

I believe all of this is built in to the QT framework. My suggestion is to close this issue.
/gunnar
  ### Details for the issue

The program looks funny on my computer. I think it has something to do with the density of the Surface Book Display. And the program is not programed to respond to changing the density.

 I apologize for not keeping up with the conversation. So this problem is unique to my situation. I have a Surface Book that is docked to two monitors (and also the Surface Book itself).

Also this problem is not unique to this program WinSCP, MPC-HC, Greenshot, and a few others have similar problems.

## Here are some other weird display issues I got:

### This is when I logged on to windows before I docked my surface book.

![001041](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10580420/19256263/12b0b3de-8f1a-11e6-9b62-b870fc7a2eef.png)
Figure 1: This screenshot is taken on my 1080p monitor. Here the title bar that has the program's icon, title, and the minimize/expand/close buttons are really big.

![001042](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10580420/19256260/033b24ca-8f1a-11e6-8546-bb6c71798413.png)
Figure 2: This screenshot is taken after I dragged the above window over to my Surface Book. Here the font sizes are really small.

### Now I logged out and logged in WHILE the surface book was docked. This produces funny looking windows but sort of a reverse of what I saw before.

![001043](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10580420/19256350/0d543cb6-8f1b-11e6-915c-19b3aece04b9.png)
Figure 3: Taken on the 1080p monitor. This is the original screenshot that I put. Here the font size is too big.

![001044](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10580420/19256365/3129b5ee-8f1b-11e6-9c48-24d51b2b975f.png)
Figure 4: I dragged the above window over to the Surface Book. Here the font size is too big and it's cut off.

**I also want to emphasize this problem is specific to high density display laptops docked to regular 1080p monitors on Windows 10.**
 Heh, this hack/workaround fixes the issue: https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=121272#p423989 I find that everything looks a bit small on my hi-dpi display, and there's only an option to change the size of the text in the table.  ### Details for the issue

Make table view's column widths persistent for each database so that when the database is closed and re-opened, the browser view displays table columns in the same width as they were before closing, instead of the default column widths.
### Useful extra information

<!-- The info below often helps, please fill it out if you're able to. :) -->

Maybe the widths can be stored in ~/sqlitebrowser.conf as part of recentFileList or additional entries for each recent file, containing the file name, table name, and a series of column widths. Only those with the column widths that have increased or decreased from default should be saved. There is no need to keep track of all databases, just the ones in the recent list.

 DIdn't realize there is a menu entry to open and save project that does exactly what the issue was asking. Closing as non-issue.
  Just a message to say thank you for developing this tool. I use it a lot and it helps me out tremendously every single time! ❤️

@justinclift is this the standard way to do it? BUILDING.md is outdated then.
 My bisection blames 54dbd62508791da4bbcbc8c5bac4c770a1cc9cd7 for it. However, that commit itself breaks the build because of something completely different (see below).

 Judging by the Git diff, yes, it is done and will not need any changes. Maybe we should create an issue for it.

Why BSD-specific? I am not running BSD here. Also, master works (built from scratch). Rebuilding v3.9.x now to get a better idea, but I am not tracking the project as closely as you are and I may not know what caused the issue. I may, if I have the time, bisect it from v3.9.x. If you need that, tell me.
 @justinclift Let me create an issue with as much information as I can provide later.
  3 minor changes

1) import tables from .sql file: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/411587/kuban.db.sql.zip
2) "Modify Table" level;
3) every row in "Foreign Key" column will be `place`(`id`) instead only for `place_id` field.

 @MKleusberg, after building on Qt5 (Qt 5.7.0) not reproduce anymore. Thank you.   As far as I have seen when translating these strings this should not be necessary.
  Thank you~ =D 
  #389
    Updated translation of the new Spanish terms for v3.9.1 and some coherence changes.

The [issue discussed previously](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/723#issuecomment-242979348) with a couple of translated terms that are shown untranslated seems to persist in the current  nightly build, but hopefully won't affect the v3.9.1 release this time either. :smile:
 OK, can't hurt to check at least if the terms shown untranslated in the nightly build are translated in the release.
 Made 4 minor corrections to the current terms and generated a new pull request, that if there are no more changes seems all good for the release.
 Cool!

If for the master there are any changes, can also take a look at them. :smile:
  ### Details for the issue

When I import large CSV tables memory leak occurs. After import memory should be free. Eg. Now sqlitebrowser is using 10 GB RAM

 +1 GB csv files. It occurs in single import. Aftert import success RAM is still in use. (10 GB+)

One of my CSV:
20 376 731 rows
17 columns
 Also i can add that this bug occurs when all columns are as 'TEXT'.
When i first create table leak is much less. By create table i mean create it with better data formats for columns

Pretty much as the title says. I do not believe this occurred in the previous version. May not seem like a big thing, but when you copy value to paste them into a filter, or into another application you then have to edit the value to remove the quotes. Just really annoying, and so I think I would have remembered this if the previous version had the same functionality.

 So far, all the values I have needed to try :(
 Yeah, I have done that too, although TBH, I'm not sure which is the most irritating. Either way, it is something silly.
 @justinclift apologies for being tardy on this. Yes, this issue was fixed.- current version 3.9.1   Seems good. Do you know what they use to generate the HTML?
 @revolter makes a good point regarding the added maintenance burden.
  ### Details for the issue

There are two related issues:
1) the name was changed to “DB Browser for SQLite” (in 2014, I think) but the spaces (with cmake version 3.6.1) cause a “missing separator” problem when make is run.
2) After a local correction to 1), later. 
sudo make install 
failed because src/icons/DB_Browser_for_SQLite.png, distri/DB_Browser_for_SQLite.desktop and distri/DB_Browser_for_SQLite. .appdata.xml don't exist.
### Useful extra information

For me, the solution for 1) was to simply vi into CMakeLists.txt and 
1,$s/DB Browser for QLite/DB_Browser_for_SQLite/g

For 2) there is a sqlitebrowser.\* for each of them – so I replaced them, after which the make install worked.

 Well I should say thanks to you guys for the product.
Seems to work very well so far as I’ve used it.

It will participate in a significant demo next Friday!
 Sure I can compile from source.

Maybe our cmake is old?  3.6.1…
  ### Details for the issue

I created a field as a autoincrement primary key but it doesn't show in indicies - why
or why not?

 Nightly builds for Windows link goes here...

http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/

... which only contains a build log text file entry.
 Sure, or you can zip up the 64-bit Windows .exe and send it to me at darrel.christensen@tx.rr.com
 I pulled down the nightly build and opened the db I created.

I have a table with a Primary Key and Indices still has (0) next to it.  :/
 Right now it's a single table with 2 fields.  The first is the Primary Key and it's an Integer, the second is just a Text field.

Attached.

NOTE - as your product works with .db files it would be nice if your attachement technology supported that file type.

[miracap.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/491183/miracap.zip)
 Fun fact: just changing the extension to any of the suggestions works too.

[miracap.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/491202/miracap.zip)
[miracap.pptx](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/491203/miracap.pptx)

But obviously actually zipping the files is a better practice.
 Looking forward to a build with this corrected, can't see moving ahead creating my db if indicies aren't being handled correctly.
 True, I'll make 'em by hand for now.

Keep me posted, and let me know if there's any other features/fixes you need tested and I'll be happy to help...
 Yes they're optional, but when I tick a checkbox like "Primary Key" when creating a table where the operative word is KEY I usually get an index no matter the engine or front end I'm using - is hence my original posting.
  ### Details for the issue

Switching to the "Browse Data" tab resets the Table dropdown to the first item. It should remember the previously selected table (if any). I would say this is a bug - it seems to remember the row position when switching to the tab but not the table!

I have no experience with Qt. If this is known or expected, just close this issue. If I am the only one to see this, it may be an installation-specific bug. There seem to be no references to `QGradient` in the tree, so I am somewhat clueless as to what is this.

I don't consider this a bug, but is certainly an odd thing.
 Just to let the little debugging I did in this time recorded somewhere:

If you let the cursor blinking in a state such as the following

```

Trying to open from the command line (and pass a db as a command line parameter), and it's not working. I'm not able to open from the command line at all and was wondering if somebody might have some insight.

```
> open ./DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite.app
The application cannot be opened because its executable is missing.
```

When directly trying to execute

```

Will give that a go and report back.
 What the heck. I followed those steps, and now opening works fine from command line, even without using the newly built `.app`. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 

Thanks for the help!
 Yeah, some configuration must have changed. In my older iterm session, I still get the same error as I initially posted. If I open a new session/tab in iterm, it works correctly.
  Creating fts5 prompts an error.

no such module: fts5: CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE article_fts5_001 USING fts5(content="article", platform, title, segment_text)
### Useful extra information

The virtual table article_fts5_001 is created, but the fts support tables are not.
Also the virtual table cannot be dropped.

 Thanks @justinclift and @chrisjlocke for the prompt response =)

@justinclift i found an old thread during the release of 3.8 (https://discuss.zetetic.net/t/db-browser-3-8-0-for-sqlite-sqlcipher-released/969). Could it would be possible to get the developers at zetetic to compile the updated SQLCipher with the new SQLite extension for FTS5?
 Thanks for sharing the instructions!
I will try to see what I can come up with.

Once again, thanks for sharing :smile:
 Has there been any progress on this? Can I help in any way? Would really like to be able to try out FTS5 using DB Browser. Thanks.  ### Details for the issue

There is a typo in the About dialog of DB4S.
The label "SQLCipher-Version 3.11.0" actually says "SQLCiper-Version 3.11.0" so there is a missing "h" in "Cipher".

Just a very minor issue but I noticed it so I report it :)

 Yes, it's fine now. Thank you.
  Here is the solution:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33728905/qt-creator-project-error-xcode-not-set-up-properly-you-may-need-to-confirm-t
 @justinclift 
I followed the steps then Qt Creator can create & compile GUI project on OSX 10.11.6 and Qt5.7.0.

> = Xcode 8

In Xcode 8, as Bruce said, this happens when Qt tries to find xcrun when it should be looking for xcodebuild.

Step 1:

Open the file:

Qt_install_folder/5.7/clang_64/mkspecs/features/mac/default_pre.prf
Step 2:

Replace:

isEmpty($$list($$system("/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcrun 2>/dev/null"))))
With:

isEmpty($$list($$system("/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcodebuild 2>/dev/null")))
 @justinclift That steps only makes Qt5.7.0 works with XCode8 on helloworld like applications, QScintilla still cannot compile. I got errors like:

```
/Users/joshua/programs/Qt5.7.0/5.7/clang_64/lib/QtCore.framework/Headers/qbasicatomic.h:61:4: error:

    typedef QAtomicOps<T> Ops;

```
 @justinclift Mind giving this patch to qscintilla2 a try?
https://gist.github.com/ilovezfs/dff9d68264e513419e8830a804acb0b5
 Thanks!!!
 Yes, it got me all the way to the Octave GUI built under 10.12 with Xcode 8 and Qt 5.6.1 and 5.7.0 (with relevant Qt patches too).
 Nope, I've not poked qscintilla2 upstream yet with my patch. I'm easily confused when upstreams aren't on GitHub :smiling_imp:

The "revelation" was that all Qt5 reverse dependencies seemed fine except for qscintilla2 so it was actually a C++ issue not a Qt5 issue at all.
 It's most assuredly an Xcode 8 issue (happens on 10.11 and 10.12 with Xcode 8), but it's not a Qt5 issue other than incidentally.
 @justinclift yes that sounds like a good idea. For instance, Xcode 8 supports more of the c++11 standard.
 It would be good to verify the patch doesn't break anything that was working on <= Xcode 7 x <= 10.11, so that we know whether it has to be constrained in any way, but ultimately that's qscintilla2's burden to bear. (e.g., does the patch break Yosemite + Xcode 6 or 7, etc.)
 You're welcome :)
 @justinclift that would be awesome. There's little I like less than "reporting upstream"
 In case this helps: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15583604/implicit-instantiation-of-undefined-template
 I think someone may keep it printed out in binders under their mattress.
 @justinclift Thank you so much :bowing_man: You're great :)
 @ilovezfs @justinclift 

This patch builds ok but cause a serious bug of QScintilla.

Make `QPointer<QsciLexer> lex;` global instead of QsciScintilla's memeber would make lexer be singleton.

If you build an Application with multi-docs, different doc need to have different lexers (for different languages/apis/calltips), not share a global one. So lexer should always be a member of QsciScintilla's.

I made some changes based on this patch and it works fine without damage QScintilla's logic.

Here's the [LINK](https://github.com/joshua-meng/Lunar/commit/751e3f015ecbefe7fcb90f02092574711b6cec3d).
 @agarny do you mind reviewing joshua-meng's patch (https://github.com/joshua-meng/Lunar/commit/751e3f015ecbefe7fcb90f02092574711b6cec3d) vs. yours?

@joshua-meng please test @agarny's patch and see if it works for you equally well.

> Not sure which approach to go with.

@justinclift if both patches work equally well

...
 @ilovezfs 

Surely it works, I reviewed @agarny 's patch and found it totally same solution as mine. 

The only difference is I use std::unique_ptr to wrap the raw pointer of implementation struct.

Use `#define lex (lexerStruct->object)` is a good idea to avoid too much addtions/deletions.
 @ilovezfs, @joshua-meng said it all.
 @joshua-meng @agarny so whose patch are we recommending to upstream, assuming upstream is even remotely paying attention? :see_no_evil: 
 @joshua-meng's patch requires C++11, which might be a problem for Phil Thompson (the person behind `QScintilla`), I don't know.

Anyway, Phil should already be aware of my patch since I posted a message on his mailing list (see https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/qscintilla/2016-October/001167.html).
 @agarny @justinclift @ilovezfs 
I found this bug basically caused by `extern "C++"`, when we remove `extern "C++"` from QsciScintilla.h, and move `QPointer<QsciLexer>` to cpp (because in QsciLexer.h, there is still `extern "C++"`, so we should move it out of .h file), it compiles ok.

Then I tried to remove all `#ifdef __APPLE__ extern "C++" { #endif` and `#ifdef __APPLE__ } #endif`  from QScintilla project (which appears in nearly all header files), compiles ok. links the output libraries to my App, works well too.

The conclusion is: This is all `extern "C++"` caused problem, it may be useful in early versions of XCode, but XCode 8 does not need that. I think QScintilla would not adopt PIMP patch to fix this bug because actually that was a magic skill of C++ to hide things to implementaion, temporary solution which just jump over the problem, not a perfect solution. I suppose QScintilla may remove `extern "C++"` later for the newest XCode.
  A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close bla bla bla ...
 Version 3.9.0, Qt Version 5.7.0, SQLCipher Version 3.11.0

windows 10

when I click "Open Database"
 I have seen the released 64 bit version crash at the "Open Database" on several machines at work. I had to revert these to the 32 bit version. It does not happen on all machines. Other 64 bit Qt applications on the same PCs work fine. The crash does happen on accounts without admin privileges. 
 I tried it a few days ago with a somewhat recent nightly (not exactly sure
of the date) and that failed the same way however the laptop is in the
field and I don't have current access to that.

John  ### Details for the issue

As of https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/7deeb02889e170752bba2aa9ed367fcdb9912cdf, DB4S fails to delete some indexes it creates.
### Useful extra information

If one was to create an index starting or ending with trimmable characters (such as an ASCII whitespace ` `), one would create an index which the browser cannot delete by itself.

This is the type of bug you find when you make typos (such as trailing whitespaces), but I don't think such behavior is acceptable anyway.

#### How to reproduce

In the interface, create an index called "Index " on any table. Then try to delete it using the interface. It will issue

```
DROP INDEX `Index`; -- No whitespace
```

and fail.

Executing 

```
DROP INDEX `Index `; -- With the trailing whitespace
```

works as expected.
 The right mindset to find failures. Similar attempts reveal problems in several non-mature terminal utilities. These problems, however, never happen to an end user until they happen, which may take a few years, or may never happen.
 I was typing and your comment popped up. Damn. Will present a demo soon.
 [How to reproduce the issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp_pzS7FD3c).
 I like that Gnome makes these captures so easy (and working on multiple 1080p screens out of the box). Many examples are show, don't tell and these settle most issues.
 @justinclift on it right now.
 @justinclift it now (8be2c54f51f174e1bf9e728e41f28d5a95b2cdb4) works as expected.
  Corrected capitalization inconsistencies.
Fixed missing spaces in the Portuguese translation.

---

As I said I was going to do, I improved the Portuguese translation to make it more consistent. Some minor spacing bugs were fixed too.

Although some of the terms come from a capitalized English word, they should not be capitalized in Portuguese due to how title case is normally handled in Portuguese.

Some abbreviations were expanded as they are clearer and more natural this way.

---

Unfortunately, after translating a string which I missed last time, something weird happens to the settings page.

![settings-bug-sqlitebrowser](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8271090/18414784/7ea11e3c-77ad-11e6-8303-7d68d8c6c6ab.png)

See the two `[]` "buttons" on the top right corner. Please tell me if they look any better in your desktop environment (it might be an issue with what I am running, not with the GUI itself).

Note that changing "Navegador de dados" to "Navegador" works too, but is clearly worse.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
 Just fixed an important mistranslation. This is what happens when the translator does not use the translated interface.
 > Should these updates be applied to the v3.9.x branch for that too?

I would say so. These do qualify as iterative improvements over the previous translation work.

> Sounds like further investigation is needed?

Yes. Could you help me test a hypothesis? If you could rename "Geral" to something much longer, such as "Very very very really really long string" so I could see what happens when the buttons get too wide for the dialog on your system, it would be great. This would help me decide whether this is a bug with the GUI settings or just a local issue I have to figure out myself.
 Yes. I think it is something with my desktop environment then. Not a problem with the implementation here.

Thanks for your feedback.
 Yes on my side. If I ever find something else that needs to change I will open another one.
 @justinclift I've toggled on watching this repository. As updates to the translation are needed, please let me know. I don't use this so I have no interest into getting acquainted with the codebase, but the Linguist workflow is simple enough so that I will make myself available for it.
  ### Details for the issue

I am attempting to design a DB using foreign keys.  It has already been discussed that there are deficiencies if a column has a FK as well as a non-null, since you cannot add a row.  I thought I might be able to work around it, and discovered (I think) another bug.  I attempted to make my FK "DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED" (https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_deferred)

So my test schema is (create this DB using sqlite3):

```
CREATE TABLE one ( pk INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT );
INSERT INTO "one" VALUES(1,'test');
CREATE TABLE two( pk INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, fk INTEGER NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY( fk ) REFERENCES one(pk) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED );
```

After that, if you open the DB inside sqlitebrowser, turn on the foreign key pragma, click save, then enter a row in table "two" that violates the FK, not only does it not report an error, but the UI and the database get out of sync.  The UI shows the row entered, but if you quit sqlitebrowser and open the DB in sqlite3, it is clearly not there.

 Arrg I don't know where the text I just typed went.  OK again,

I tried to work around the fact that sqlitebrowser doesn't work when you have a foreign key with NOT NULL. 
Using sqlite3, create the following schema (note the DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED, see https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_deferred):

CREATE TABLE one ( pk INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT );
INSERT INTO "one" VALUES(1,'test');
CREATE TABLE two( pk INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, fk INTEGER NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY( fk ) REFERENCES one(pk) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED );

Then open that DB in sqlitebrowser, enable foreign keys pragma, click save.

Now, add a row to the "two" table that violates the FK.  Sqlitebrowser lets you add it, doesn't complain, and shows it added in the UI, but if you quit and look at the DB in sqlite3, it is (correctly) not there.

If you do this without the DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED, you just plain cannot add any data to the table (as discussed in #638).
 Thanks Justin (re the missing text), I thought that might have been the case :) oops.

I just tried master, and it is slightly workable. It seems now new rows are inserted with 1 in the FK column, instead of 0.  That works, as long as I have a 1 in the column the FK refers to, which may or may not be the case :)

If the idea suggested in other tickets to have a manual BEGIN/COMMIT process was workable, and this bug regarding DEFERRABLE FKs was fixed, then I think that would achieve a desirable result.  Users could click BEGIN, add a row, doctor it to taste even if its initial state violates the FK, then find out if it is accepted when they hit COMMIT.

I totally understand though that such a (seemingly) simple task might be very disruptive under the hood.
 IMHO that's better than silently letting the UI and the DB diverge.  If the user is using foreign keys, they should understand what "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed" implies.
 Seems to work at e76e5b3241af5e79474ae32fda393da921696d96 for the test described in the first comment wrt deferred foreign keys.  Thanks!
 Hey Martin, thanks for addressing it!  Closing.
  ### Details for the issue

When I open the application my mouse is frozen outside (in the margin) of the program. The mouse works correctly with every other application.
The mouse actually is working because buttons become selected and I can click on things but I do not see where it is aiming.

It's like the window doesn't get along with the pointer.

The rest appears to work correctly.

 Hi @justinclift & @pchtsp. Do you guys need my help ?? Sorry it took me sometime to respond. I can look into the bug if still exist in 3.9 on debian. may be i will be able to figure it out if it is related to packaging or anything else. Thanks.
 I already deployed packages for that (arm) on my ppa. But dont worry i will
create another ppa for just for testing this bug.
 Hey! Thanks both for the quick answer and the help. I do feel comfortable
building from source. As soon as I plug my phone to an HDMI screen, I will
test building it.

I'll keep you informed. And thanks again!

F.
 @justinclift @deepsidhu1313 .

Just tried compiling with ubuntu instructions. Worked. I have only checked that I can indeed see the mouse over the GUI and load a database I had.

The previous version was 3.8.5 so I guess it could be a good idea to update the repository.

thanks again!

  ### Details for the issue

Add support for Delphi FireDAC's SQLite encryption, if it's not too complicated :)
It uses aes-256 by default (and it alone will be enough), but supported ciphers are:
_aes-128, aes-192, aes-256, aes-ctr-128, aes-ctr-192, aes-ctr-256, aes-ecb-128, aes-ecb-192, aes-ecb-256_

> The encrypted database format is not compatible with other similar SQLite encryption extensions. This means that you cannot use an encrypted database, encrypted with non-FireDAC libraries. If you need to do this, then you have to decrypt a database with an original tool and encrypt it with FireDAC.
> 
> The encryption is provided through the officially supported SQLite approach - custom codec code and compilation with SQLITE_HAS_CODEC defined. All encryption routines are implemented on Delphi and embedded into the sqlite3 code.
> 
> http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Seattle/en/Using_SQLite_with_FireDAC#SQLite_Encrypted_Database

Actually, encryption is based on SQLCipher as stated in [sources](https://gist.github.com/Mikanoshi/a7b92e807967b3af602ee527dfccee0e):

 Look at that source file I uploaded, there are sqlite3_\* functions with cdecl calling convention that are defined in obj file, inside the file there are mentions of sqlite3.c and CodeGear C++ 7.20 compiler.
Maybe it's possible to just convert it to dll?)
 This is an obj file in COFF64 format, maybe it can be linked directly with 64-bit version of DB4S:
[sqlite3_x64.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/455907/sqlite3_x64.zip)
...or make a DLL out of it, somehow :)
 You mean in C++?) No, I can only provide libs, and maybe create a DLL, but it wouldn't be any different, if the above obj can be linked already.
  ### Details for the issue

This is more a feature request/suggestion and is specific to .NET

If you define a column as 'DATETIME', the ("official") .NET DB provider objects can be configured to return actual .NET DateTime Types via SQLiteDataAdapter and SQLiteDataReader.

The "issue" is that DB Browser tends to ignore/discard "DateTime" and use INTEGER (or sometimes the last legal base type selected).  The only way is to use a CREATE TABLE statement in a SQL window.  Once the table is created, 'DateTime' shows in the column type list but **only** for those columns already defined that way.

This would likely be confusing for other platforms, so it might be useful to display 'NetDate` or similar to the user but use 'DateTime' in the CREATE statement.  Another option would be to enable it via a Preference.

 The NET Provider is fully capable of creating/returning NET DateTime variables/DataTable columns.  **In spite of** DATETIME not being listed, it can be used in the table definition and the official NET provider will use it to do so.

It is a DB Browser issue because it wont allow/use DATETIME when creating a table.
 ![sqlitedates](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12514284/18286901/70ac8a1c-743a-11e6-82ea-7f7e20d4d538.gif)

(its a bit snappier run locally)

It relates to when defining a table.  The first part shows how even when I type in `DATETIME` it uses whatever - something from the dropdown list.  The second part shows how it acts with a table which was created in a SQL window. 

I _believe_ "DATETIME" acts like meta-data for the NET Provider.  The actual data format for dates is defined by connection string options.  The default stores an ISO8601 string.  The NET Provider sees "DATETIME" and returns DateTime objects - **only if that column is defined as DATETIME**.  

The NET provider knows to store date data  to an appropriate string which it will be able to parse **back** into a DATETIME type.  

The official DB Provider only does this for columns defined as DateTime **and** data which matches the DateTimeFormat setting in the connection string. Add this '...;DateTimeFormat=Ticks;...' to the connection string and the Provider will automatically save the ticks value for DateTime vars (thus saving the data integer/Int64).  Ticks also convert back to DateTime types (variables, datatable columns etc) provided the column is defined as DATETIME (ticks is less useful because it cannot distinguish UTC from local).

About Type Affinity

From that page: "_The type affinity of a column is the **recommended** type for data stored in that column.  The important idea here is that the type is recommended, not required. Any column can still store any type of data._"   Without check constraints anything goes.  In the case of DATETIME, as I said, I think the Provider is doing all the magic based on the column info and the connection string option.  

As I said in the original posting, this is probably something that only .NET devs would want/need (no one seems to know that it works). Other platforms may well choke on it, so it might be something that is enabled as an option.

I have a working demo and decent explanation, but I cannot find a recent, applicable StackOverflow post to attach it to.

Hope this helps
 I think using something from the list is generally a good idea, since the list is complete except for this one (?) case.   There might be other types allowed - who knows,  I cant find this latent ability documented anywhere.  

Since other platforms might choke on it, is the reason I suggested an option.  When _Enable NET DateTime_ is on, add DateTime and Date to the list (I am not sure it actually treats Date differently).

[Obsolete]
Here is a reason this could be very valuable:  if you execute a CREATE TABLE statement from your NET app, Type Affinity apparently kicks in and also changes **DATETIME** to **TEXT**.  That means for NET devs they **need some sort of tool** like this to create tables that support DATETIME types.  The Execute SQL tab works perfectly.

It is also probably why so few know the capability exists.

I had an error in the SQL - they do get created correctly from code
  I'm using the latest version of sqlitebroswer (3.9.0) on OSX 10.11. I need to run a query that uses FTS to do a full text search on one of my tables. However, when I actually run the query I get the error: "no such module: fts4". Does the version of sqlite that comes with sqlite browser  #not include fts3/4 support? If not, is there some way to add it, or to at least point the program to the sqlite version I have installed on my machine?
 I'll give that a try. Thanks so much.
 Hmmm... No luck. I opened the newly built app file, pasted in my query, and tried again and I got the exact same error message. If it helps, I think the issue is actually coming from the virtual table that the query is running against. The create statement looks like:

`CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ZSKUINDEX USING fts4(content="ZSKU",ZOPTICS_MATERIAL_TYPE,ZOPTICS_GENDER,ZBRAND_ID)`
 I'll try it and see.
 I suspect that solution is not going to work now that I think about it. The virtual tables are being created by an iOS app and I'm pretty sure the version of sqlite that xcode uses does not support fts5 yet. Is there a way to build sqlcipher with fts4 instead of fts5?
 It does indeed work. Thanks again for all your help.
  I have a database of size 90 MB. SQLite browser doesn't seem to handle it too well. It has a huge lag while browsing or updating the db.
 It is a local database. I have just one table with 260 rows.

My table create statement is as follows:

```
CREATE TABLE "slides" ( 
`slide_no` INTEGER NOT NULL,
`slide_type` INTEGER NOT NULL, 
`text_size` INTEGER NOT NULL,
`heading` TEXT, 
`sub_heading` TEXT, 
`img` BLOB, 
`string1` TEXT, `string2` TEXT, `string3` TEXT, `string4` TEXT, `string5` TEXT, 
`read` INTEGER, 
 PRIMARY KEY(slide_no) );
```

All the fields are small (less than hundred characters) except `img` (of type `blob` with approximately 33000 characters in every row) and `string1` (of type `text` with approximately a 1000 characters in every row)

By 'updating the db' I meant, adding new rows to the db or editing existing rows in the db.

When I open SQLite Browser and open the 'Browse Data' tab from any other tab, UI freezes and it takes about 5 seconds to load. Once it loads, when I try to scroll (up/down or left/right), it lags, UI freezes for about 4-5 seconds again (sometimes it even says 'Not responding' for a while). When I click on any field to edit it, it takes quite some time to get selected.
 I'm using 3.9.0 on Windows 10. I've faced the lag since version 3.8.0. It was infact why I updated to 3.9.0 recently.

I shall try the latest nightly build soon and let you know!
 I **must** mention that 3.9.0 has been significantly faster than 3.8.0! But still not fast enough
 It's for a client and I can't share it publicly! Even I'm beginning to wonder now if my PC is starving for resources with Android Studio and Chrome browser open in the background! If you can email me, I might be able to share it personally! abhilash1in@gmail.com  :wink: 
 I emptied the `img` column in a copy of the database and browser got lightning fast!

I cant seem to figure out a suitable `WHERE` clause for the `img` attribute to empty only **some** of the records. Assistance please?
 @innermous just the UI
 @innermous you can use @chrisjlocke's[ bloat1.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/453013/bloat1.zip) and [bloat2b.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/453013/bloat1b.zip) to reproduce it. I verified with those db's and it's the exact same problem as originally described.
 @chrisjlocke the memory usage is a bit strange! Was it with the bloat1, bloat1b or with the original one I shared? On my PC, 
1. bloat1 contantly takes about 173 MB of memory. Only the CPU usage raises from 0% initially upto about 20% (sometimes lesser) when I scroll (up/down or left/right) in the browser or if I click on a menu item (say File) or if I switch from another application to the browser. Took about 6 seconds to open the Browse Data tab once the db was opened in the browser.
2. bloat1b contantly takes about 340MB of memory. The CPU usage raises from 0% initially upto about 22 - 26% (sometimes lesser) on similar circumstances as above. Took about 12 seconds (twice as much as bloat1) to open the Browse Data tab.
3. my original db contantly takes about 75-80 MB of memory. The CPU usage goes upto about 23%. Took 3 seconds to open the Browse data tab. 

One interesting thing that I noticed is that when the field with large text is not in the viewable area of the browser (when I resize the browser and scroll away from this field), the browser is fast and CPU usage is under 5%. When I scroll right towards the field with large text, that is when all the problems seem to occur. While scrolling right, it scrolls fast till the field is encountered and then hangs/freezes for a couple of seconds and then loads and completes the scroll. Once this field is in view, the problems are as described initially.
 @innermous may I know the problem and your approach, if you could put it down in words? Just curious :smiley: 
 @innermous should I build from the application from source? I'm not sure how to do it. I had a look at [this](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md) and it looks slightly complicated and I don't have enough time to figure it out. Is it possible to share an installation file?

First I click on Browse data and choose a table, then I select another tab like Execute SQL.  When I then click the Browse Data tab, the selected table reverts to the first table in the database.
This is very annoying.

Hoping to get a nice new feature/capability.  Routinely when I am working on writing complex SQL queries, I use the 'Execute SQL' tab to refine them as I like being able to type and hit ctrl-enter to see the results.  Even better, doing so with a specific selection only executes that code making it a joy to use.

However, many times I have to routinely go back to the 'Browse Data' tab to check on some things, and every time I do, not only do I hate being switched away from my code (making a lot of tabbing back and forth) but on every return to the 'Browse Data' tab, it's reset and I have to go looking for what I was after all over again.

Now one solution would be to somehow persist the state of the Browse Data tabs, but from other bugs here, I see the coding pattern has been a dump-and-reload model, making that a non-trivial task.  BUT... if we could somehow float the SQL windows (and their results) into new windows, we could look at the data side-by-side with the SQL code.  Actually, being able to float multiple windows would be the best so I can look at several result sets all at once.

For instance, this would come in handy when I'm trying to see the results of a temp table and the results of a join on that temp table.  I'd like to select out the results, leave them on screen for reference, then execute other code against it.

As an alternate to floating windows, and for that matter, preferable to them, I'd actually love to see a truly tabbed interface, similar to how VS Code handles its tabs.  You can open groups of tabs, then split them horizontally or vertically as you see fit. If you could then save these as workspaces, perhaps with your open SQL statements in a metadata file alongside the open database, that would be epic!!

But heck... I'd even settle for simple side-by-side tiling of what's already there.  Point being, being able to see both your code, its results, and the Browse Data feature all at the same time is IMHO a sorely-needed feature.

 @chrisjlocke, that's not really a feasible option as when you change the structure in one side, you can't tell the other to easily refresh.  That and two different instances would be two different transaction scopes too (i.e. where you have to commit or revert your changes with the buttons on the toolbar.)  In a perfect world, it would work like Visual Studio (or VS Code) where you can create tabs and do whatever you want in each... browse the schema, run SQL, whatever.  You could split them, stack them, group them... you decide.  Honestly, if it had that feature alone, I'd gladly pay $50+ for it just thinking of how productive it would make me.
 Sounds like an excellent plan to get started.  One-each of the main windows is fine for now. That would solve my personal problem/desire to browse the data while editing SQL in another window.  
 Here's another thought... to keep things simple, pre-load the 'tabs' with the four main areas you have now.  Let us close them, move them, etc.  Then, have a 'New Tab' button that when you click it asks you do you want a new schema view, browse view, SQL view, etc.  A simple drop-down prompt under the button would work.  Point being if you design it so each 'tab' is its own thing, but which can post notifications that other tabs could listen to (i.e. for schema changes, etc.) then you'd have both a very easy interface for newcomers, and a powerful interface for pros.

This could also simplify what's already there.  For instance, currently in the SQL tab, it allows 'sub-tabs' if you will to open additional SQL windows.  That entire thing can be removed since if you want another SQL window, just open a new SQL tab.  Cleans up the interface even more.

Anyway, just ruminating on the designs.  I'd be happy to mock them up in Sketch/Photoshop to better show what I'm thinking if it would help.
  If not already known, the nightly windows build is broken:

After de-installing the former DBBowser, which did work well, I installed DBBrowser 3.9.0 and found that my database does not recognize DBBrowser anymore as it's default program to start with. I tried to associate *.db (extention I use for a long time) with DBBrowser, but 3.9.0 does not appear, even after browse and select, in the program list to open the files with. 
Is there something wrong with the registry settings or so?

Now I have everytime to start DBBrowser, open a database, select my database and then I can work, while with the old version I only had to click the database file and it opened with DBBrowser.

This situation happened on 2 different PC's I work on: one with Windows-7 and the other with Windows-10. Same behavior.

 Hi Justin,
I could assign the db to DBBrowser 3.9.0 now, all my db's do have the new icon now.
Thanks for your help.
Rob Valk
  ### Details for the issue

Not really a bug, but a request. 

In File -> Open Database, could you please add to the OpenDialog filter the
_**.sql_\* file extension, in addition to what you now have (*.db, *.sqlite, etc.)

 Here's what I see. I'm hoping you can add *.sql to the four file 
extensions you already have.
 Hope this comes through

 They are sqlite3 files. I don't like such a long file extension and have 
been using just .sql for a few years. Thousands of file from all the 
users of my app have been created.

http://www.bridgecaptain.com/downloadDD.html
 I understand your reasons for not adding .sql to the list. Makes perfect 
sense.

At the moment I just have one extra step - changing to the All Files (*) 
view in the open dialog. I can live with that until #659 is up and 
running.  I'll also consider use of the .db extension instead.

When loading a db with a custom page size, the dialog only allows a max value of 8092 (seams like a typo for 8192), yet a page size up to 65536 is valid.

 I'm running 64bit Windows, but I'm in no rush. :)
 I tried the build provided but I'm still not able to open the DB.

I suspect it's a different issue tho as the db I'm trying to open it's created using the c# wrapper System.Data.SQLite.dll from what I can see there is no password and the db contents don't look encrypted when opened in a hex editor. But I do know they exec "PRAGMA page_size = 32768;" which Is how I came to report this.

I can verify that it lets me set 32768 in the dialog tho.
 Yes I'm a c++ developer, but I personally use the native sqlite code so the browser works just fine for my needs :smile: 

I just decided to have a browse of a db created by a 3rd party tool that happens to use the c# wrapper, so unfortunately I don't feel like implementing support :disappointed: 
  A few more terms translated to Spanish.
 No. `&oacute;` is the html entity for 'ó'. Fixing now with the utf-8 character that worked previously for other terms.
 You are welcome. Glad to help. :)
  Hi Justin! This was the same issue I described to you earlier.  As mentioned, while in QT4 you can see all the data, the paging controls are wonky there too (i.e. I don't know of _any_ version where they work correctly.)
 [OddPagingInDbBrowser.mov.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/446295/OddPagingInDbBrowser.mov.zip)
Movie attached.  You can see that while only eight rows are shown (sizing changes this amount), it's still paging by up to 100 places, meaning if you want to see anything between 9 and 90, you can't use the paging controls.  Paging size should match the shown number of rows, always.
 Yes, different than the QT5 issue of not seeing all the rows, which I did see as well. This issue exists in both QT4 and QT5 versions.
 Just jumping in here with zero experience with this code, but reading the thread so far, could it be an issue of an internal window's frame not being properly constrained by the outer 'viewport' window (and by 'window' I mean control, whatever).  I've seen cases where people have tried implementing their own scrolling mechanism and the math has gotten mixed up between what you're seeing, what you're supposed to see, and what was actually going on behind the scenes, but was obscured visually.

Again, just a complete guess, but based on something similar I'd seen in the past, so again, check the actual bounds of the various windows/frames.
 So is the fact that the other bug was closed also saying this one is now too?  If so, when are the next binaries going to be made available?
 No, no rush. Just wondering! :)

  ### Details for the issue

DB4S has a default font that it is using for the "Browse Data" tab. You can see it in the next image.

![db4s_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8761081/18008694/6887ef3c-6ba9-11e6-87dc-b8876c7d2cff.jpg)

However, if you open the "Preference" window to change anything, or simply opened it and closed it without changing anything, it will change the default font and make it look like this..

![db4s_2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8761081/18008733/a15a8298-6ba9-11e6-91c7-92a5bbc72a9d.jpg)

This only happens if you click OK, whether you changed settings or not, but not if you click Cancel.

In both cases, there is no font selected in the "Preference" window. It is empty like this..

![db4s_3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8761081/18008945/71a00748-6baa-11e6-8ba2-c8531b220222.jpg)

To go back to the font I want in the first image, I have to edit the registry and delete `font` value from `HKCU\Software\sqlitebrowser\sqlitebrowser\databrowser` key, then restart DB4S.

What is the default font that is used in the first image? I think this will be fixed if I set it manually.
### Useful extra information

I think this is related to #589.

 @innermous Yes.

![db4s_4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8761081/18013302/b7fc91ee-6bbd-11e6-9eec-ea17e11115dd.jpg)

There is no .conf file. Everything is saved in Windows Registry.
 @innermous Only if you are going to build it, cause I don't know how. :smile: 
 @justinclift Let me know when you build it so I can test.
 @justinclift Thanks. :+1: I saved the link and I will give it a try later.
 Sorry for the delay, and.. yes, it works! :tada:

It is no longer blank and it is now set to "MS Shell Dlg 2".

Also, and like @justinclift said, we need to change the font for the "Execute SQL" tab too.
 @justinclift I don't use the "Edit Database Cell", I edit fields directly which is very fast. I move around with the arrow keys and start typing on a highlighted field to edit. It is one of the things I like a lot about DB4S.

Thanks for making me a working build, and thanks to @innermous for making a quick fix.
 @justinclift Yes, I see now that the font in "Execute SQL" tab has changed. It is much better now, like it used to be. This font doesn't change when you change `font` in "Preferences" window, right?
 Ahhhh, yes. :smile: I see it now. It is like you said in the "SQL" tab in "Preferences".

No no, it is not important at all. I was just wondering, that's all. Cause I changed the font like I normally do in "Data Browser" and it was changed, but then I switched to "Execute SQL" and it was the same, so I thought something was wrong. I didn't notice it has its own font settings in "SQL" tab, sorry.

I tested both (changing font in Data Browser tab and Execute SQL tab) and they are working very good. Thanks a lot for all your help. :+1: 
  Steps To Reproduce:

1) Open any database with one or more tables
2) Expand any table in the "Browse Data" view on the right
3) Change the tab from "Browse Data" to "Execute SQL " and back to "Browse Data"

Actual Results:
The selected table is reset to the first table in the DB.

Expected Results:
The selected table stays the same as before you changed tabs.

I cant start  the browser using this command "sqlitebrowser" in terminal, but I could start it with that command before update ?
 It work when I type DB then hitting TAB and I did update using .tar file ,also I used the same file type for installation before the update...
This command does not work 
`ln -s "/path/to/new/DB Browser for SQLite" "sqlitebrowser"
`
and by the way I saw some error message after "cmake ." command, should I share?

 I think I have to get used to "DB" with TAB. :) You can close this issue if there is nothing to work with "sqlitebrowser" command. Thank you
  ### Details for the issue

I had hoped to be able to open files directly from outside of sqlitebrowser - e.g. from Windows Explorer, another file manager, or the command line.  For this to work, it would need sqlitebrowser to register for some file extensions: *.sqlite, and maybe others.

Is this something that you would expect to work?  If not, please can I request it as a feature?

Thanks

 Thanks for a very quick reply, and let me know if you need me to test a Beta
   **Steps To Reproduce:**  
1) Open any database with one or more tables
2) Expand any table in the "DB Schema" view on the right
3) Change the main tab (e.g. from "Database Structure" to "Browse Data"

**Actual Results:**
All your expanded tables get collapsed.

**Expected Results:**
All your expanded tables stays expanded.

 Just compiled it myself under Linux. 
The described bug (DB Schema view resets on tab change) is fixed.
But there is now a new bug:
Now the reset happened when I clicked on "Cancel" in the "Modify Table" dialog. 
This takes not only in the DB Schema view on the right place. Also in the main window.

I also think it is not the best practice to reset the hole schema. Why not just refresh the changed column? And not collapsing the hole schema.
I think this would increase the user experience and the performance a lot.
 @revolter Ok.
Verified fixed in [684958b](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/684958b29ce3d26684d9142d73df773b11189d54).
  ### Details for the issue

So I'm using Chrome's SessionBuddy extension and once in a while I export SavedSessions table out of the extension's DB to edit out some URL's (from The Great Suspender). And after that I import back the saved .CSV (it's edited on N++) into SQLite browser. It all worked great on 3.8.0. But now on the 3.9.0 version when I tried to export the table as .CSV, edited it, imported back and it is somehow corrupted or incorrectly saved, there are over 140 columns in the screenshot. But there should be 14.
As you can see in the 2nd screenshot which was taken now after I tried to do the same on 3.8.0 luckily I did backups of that DB.

This happened after I exported DB table out of the newest SQLite Browser version (3.9.0) and imported it back in.

This is how it looks when .CSV is exported and imported on version 3.8.0
![capture2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4366810/17951242/505ffb52-6a69-11e6-815e-7ece8eab4046.PNG)

 It's private, but you can easily try this by yourself if you're using Chrome: 
- [link to the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko?hl=en)
- It automatically creates a DB in this location when you save a session. `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\databases\chrome-extension_edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko_0`
- Open it with SQLite browser and try to export SavedSessions table (as .csv) and then import it back, it looks kind of messed up.
  
  I think there's some bug with newest version's .csv saving system, some characters are not saved or something like that (I'm not an expert, it's just my guess) I compared both .csvs and there are some spaces missing in the newest version (in first line, after `filteredTabCount 13` 13 wasn't separated with a space) and probably somewhere else.
 @justinclift Windows 10 Anniversary Update, 64-bit
 @justinclift I just tried it and it works !!! Thanks. 👍 
  Could be considered an installation bug, especially for 'regular' user.
Windows 7 Ultimate SP 1
DB Browser for SQLite 3.9.0, 64-bit

There is no "uninstall" entry in Windows 7 "Programs and Features" Control Panel item. (There was one for v. 3.8.0.)

Workaround is to directly use the "Uninstall.exe" program in the installation folder (the one above the "bin" folder where the program's executable file is located).

![screenshot - 24-08-16 14_47_19](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/454810/17943541/d693f0d0-6a09-11e6-9cfe-8c1aea86270c.png)
 Yep!  The program now shows up in the Uninstall list as expected.

Minor glitch when _uninstalling_ the program : It doesn't check if program is currently in use.  The uninstall goes through without any errors, but leaves the program executable and DLLs in place.
 That's totally fine.  :-)

I found this, which seems to do both the checking and the aborting : http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Check_whether_your_application_is_running

Not sure if it's any help in your case though, I have no idea how NSIS works.
  Not sure if this is related, but when modifying an existing table, adding a primary key to it, even after confirming that the data should support a primary key on the selected fields (i.e. no nulls and when running a group-by with a count on the fields, I never get anything but a '1') it just silently fails and doesn't add the key.  No warnings, no errors, nothing.  The dialog just gets dismissed and nothing actually happens.  Same thing when I tried marking those columns as 'not null'.

Since this is just a db of the public NJ Transit schedules (as imported from flat CSV files) I can send it along so you can try it yourself if interested.  (It's 20+ mb so I figured I'd ask first. If so, lemme know how you want me to send it to you.)
 Definitely have both the time and the interest.  Again, your product is an integral part of me being able to create mine so anything I can do to help I do so gladly! :)  Just post the link here on where I need to go to get the daily to test and I'll let you know, just like I did with the black-on-black browsing issue.
 Oh... and it's your just-released build... again, the one you linked to in the other question about preferences and colors.
 > So should a line mean a text line or an SQL line (up until the first semi colon)?

Pretty much what was said above. Production SQLite code has many queries spanning multiple lines.
 Tip: https://github.com/search?l=SQL&q=_id&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93 may give you a few examples to try.  Completed the missing translations and a few context and coherence adjusts.
 @justinclift  Hope that in the release all looks good. :wink: 
  ### Details for the issue

Yeah.. why not?
You can add the ability to open databases that are protected with RS of System.Data.SQLite (.Net Framework)
Then will be the best SQLite Browser in the world!

 But System.Data.SQLite is not a part of Microsoft.. that come from SQLite DLLs
 Yeah, that is what i mean :)
 I mean.. whit this dll you can set a password to database, but you can only open it again whit the same dll.. not but other SQLite browser.. and.. in internet exists only 1 browser that can open encrypted database with this dlls, but is a very only software (2009), now is pretty bugged.
If i try to open a encrypted database with your browser, i get an error. Becase this dll encrypt files using RSA (not RS, like i write in the first post, was a keyboard error)
Hope you understand what i mean :)
 No, the enrcryption use a personal security system, that is already writed in the System.Data.SQLite.
For set a password you can simply add this dll to a project and use a command:
Connection.SetPassword("MyPass");

I have read something online, and im sure that use not SEE (external plugin) but RSA (internal function).
 That will be awesome, but i dont know C++ language, so... i can't give you a big help.
Anyway.. i think (and is just my opinion).. i think that you will have good benefit if you add the ability to open database that are encrypted with System.Data.SQLite. Because there are many users that use this dll with .Net Framework, by programming in VB.Net; C#, F, etc.. and many of them will use this internal protection to encrypt thier database. I mean.. why use an external dll or plugin if you can protect your database with the same dll that you use for read/write it?

Example:
I made a "Database.db" with System.Data.SQLite.dll and i use it in my app, then i use also your browser for open my databse and watch what contains. But is i set a password to this database, i cannot open it anymore (with your browser).
I (and other users like me) must CREATE a new app that will use only for watch the content of the encrypted database.

Remember that just one browser can open database encrypted with System.Data.SQLite.dll (SQLite2009 Pro) but is not good as your browser :)

With this more function you will have more users.
 My idea was to use the integrated protection, not another external dll. :)
Anyway.. i dont know what i must ask on this forum, so.. i think i will pass :)

When running SQLiteBrowser (now renamed to DB Browser for SQLite) on macOS Sierra beta, because the app is unsigned, it can not find its preferences file and as such, the colors in the data browser tab are all black, meaning black text on black background.  Even if you change them, while they will work for that session, closing and reopening the app resets all of your settings.

My suspicion is this has to do with the new way macOS Sierra handles unsigned applications.  It stores them in a 'random, secure' portion on disk, not simply the application folder even though it _looks_ like that's where it is.  This is part of their new security.  My guess is this is the cause of the app not being able to find the preferences.

That said, even if the preference file isn't found, the defaults should not be black on black.  At least set them to black on white, possibly making nulls gray on white.

All of the above is also pure speculation and I could be completely wrong, but I am not seeing this behavior on earlier versions of OS X, including El Capitan, only macOS Sierra.

 The good news is macOS Beta is now open to everyone, even without the developer network.  Even so, your product has greatly improved my development environment so I would be more than happy to help you with testing, signed or unsigned. Let me know. I don't mind installing out for test builds.

Feel free to reach out to me directly too.  234-248-6275 or Mark@MarkDonohoe.com

Hope I can help!

Mark
 Yeah, just came out today I think.  I'm installing it on my machine too if you want another tester.
 The DMG worked fine for me. As for the app, it worked after I disabled the security prompt.

Even so, there was another issue... if you say 'run it this time' from sys prefs security, it doesn't actually open but instead prompts you again. You have to completely disable the security, run the app, then reenable.

My guess is you're using a boot strap mech which would cause that as the boot strapped part runs, but then the main app gets blocked.  But that's purely a guess.

Again, disabling it temporarily solves the issue.

One thing though, signing, sierra and the rest aside, you should still change the defaults to black on white instead of black on black when prefs aren't found.  At least it's a temporary work-around rather than making a user have to change it every start as I do now.  Of course this goes away with signing, but still... it's a good practice regardless.

 Crap! Missed this.  I'll test when I'm back on my machine in about an hour.
 Just a quick update... both the beta 2 and nightly open fine here on my desktop running El Capitan.  No security prompts anymore so it's recognized as being signed.

I'm currently installing the latest beta (Sierra 7) on my notebook and will let you know what happens there.
 FYI... 3.9.99, the nightly doesn't properly browse data.  It's not returning all records.  I'm seeing paging controls but they don't seem to work either.  Note, this is still on El Cap.
 If it matters, this is a relatively small dataset.  It’s the NJ Transit train times.  Definitely not 100K+ records.  The largest table is 44K but most are < 5K

BTW, even in 3.9.00 and even 3.8 the paging controls seem to be doing odd things.  For instance, right now on my browse data tab, it says 1-11 of 229.  If I hit the ‘next page’ button (the right arrow without the line) it now says 91-101 of 229 (it jumped by 90) but if I press it a third time, it now says 191-201 (it jumped by 100).  I would think one would expect it to jump by 11 in all cases since that’s what’s shown, but if the intent was to always make it jump by 100, as stated, it’s not doing that either.  At least not for the first one.

No biggie as I just scroll anyway, but still...

HTH,

M
 Just tried it.  While I can now browse all the data in the table, it still has that wonky paging behavior I spoke about earlier.

Oh... and the preferences issue is still there.  Here's what I see when I close, then reopen, then go right to browsing data...

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/897883/17920618/a07dcc70-69a3-11e6-95eb-6ef112923287.png)
 re: the nulls... yes... definitely check for that and return the defaults as necessary.  I'm one to always code for any possible value that's compilable (that a word?) 

To answer your question, this isn't a VM, it's the Mac version running right on the hardware.  However, I'm also running Win10 via Parallels 11.  I can check the Win version of the same build if you want to send it over. I also have an El Cap machine here too.  Lemme know if you want me to test on all of them, and if so, what version of the app.

As for setting up the dev environment myself, I'm stronger in C# and Swift and even Objective-C/C++ but am by no means an expert.  I've also never done QT development, although I have liked what I've seen with it. (I actually met the original owner of TrollTech way back before even Nokia bought it.) . Still, perhaps making a debug build where you log stuff to files, then I can send those over to you.  I'm also fine setting up a TeamViewer session where you can take control of my machine and experiment yourself.  Lemme know.
 Also, just ran your 3.9.99 beta 3 (which appears to be signed) on Sierra beta 7 and still got the black cells.  I'm wondering if perhaps there's some bad preferences being held around.  Can you give me a list of all the locations you've written files and I'll nuke them all? (Do you have an uninstaller or script? That would be even better!)
 Ha! Found the cause of the issue!

Using your above references to the prefs, I nuked them, and as I had hoped, the colors appeared as normal even after closing, then reopening the app.

However, as soon as I went and changed from the default colors to match my liking (for reference, I set nulls to 'Moss' and binary to 'Lavender', both under 'Crayons'), while they displayed correctly for that session, closing and opening the app went back to the black-on-black colors I was seeing.  Deleting the prefs again got things back to normal.  Setting the colors broke it again, etc.

Trying to determine if it was a 'color prefs' thing or a 'prefs in general' thing, this time I nuked the prefs file, confirmed the colors were at their defaults, then opened up 'Preferences' and toggled 'Remove Line Breaks in Schema View' (i.e. a pref _not_ related to color). I closed and restarted and sure enough, the colors went wonky again back to black-on-black.  Ironically, the 'Remove breaks' setting _did_ stick.

So... that's how to get to see what I was seeing.  Apparently the prefs for the colors are either being written, or read incorrectly even though the other prefs seem to be persisting and being read just fine.

Hope this helps!  More importantly, I hope it's a quick fix so I can finally use my custom preferences with your app. :)
 Just chiming in.  Does this mean someone worked on a fix for the prefs here?  If so, lemme know and I can test it right now on El Cap 10.11.6. (I'm not set up to build tho so if someone can make a binary, that would be great.)
 My guess is that it is a QT bug, preferences are now saved and retrieved correctly as far as I can see.

I have recompiled on my mac 
 - OS: Sierra (10.12.2)
 - Qt Version 5.7.1
 - SQLite Version 3.15.2

Recompilation from inside of QT Creator as I´m still stumbling around learning what to do. 

/Gunnar Hellquist Absolutely.  I can test. /Gunnar Hi!
In my testing and loading and saving of preferences is correct - the dreaded black data fields are gone. 
I have done a few checks here and there of other functions and they work (not in any way any exhaustive test).
Default size for SQL is still 9, but I guess that is by design (change in next release).
Glad to be of some help.

/Gunnar I can confirm that on my machine (Sierra 10.12.2) the black-on-black issue is solved in the new build (3.9.1v2). Preferences are handled correctly, application downloads, installs and work as expected as far as OS and preferences are concerned. This issue can as far as I see be closed. I downloaded 3.9.1v2 and had to remove my preferences file, found above, before the black background was resolved. I did't try changing the background preferences within the application to but that may have done it as well. The black background issue hasn't returned for me yet! Hi,

Sorry but the problem is still there for me whenever I try to modify preferences.
I am using Sierra (10.12.2) and DB4S from cask (3.9.1v2).

If I don't modify preferences I can restart DB4S and background colors remain correct.
Whenever I change a preference and restart DB4S the black-on-black issue is present.

Please find attached a working and bugged version of sqlitebrowser settings.
[sqlitebrowser.plist.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/701448/sqlitebrowser.plist.zip)

Am I missing anything?
Thanks for your help.

-Nicolas


 @revolter Sorry, I forgot to mention that I did all my tests from a fresh setting file after having deleted the previous one. So deleting the setting file does not help in my case. @justinclift Ok, just found the bug, it's me! :-)
After uninstalling the cask version of DB4S to test a nightly build I realized that another old version (3.9.1) was still installed...
I uninstalled it and reinstall latest version using cask and everything works perfectly!

Sorry guys for the wrong alert, my bad.
And thanks again for the fix. I've been doing some testing using settings from nkahnfr's attached .plist but haven't been able to reproduce the issue. I did notice this part below that diffs from my preferences.

`<key>databrowser.reg_bg_colour</key>
<data><string>@Variant(</string>` Disregard my last comment, just saw @nkahnfr message  Korean Traslation for 3.9.0 release.
Thank you!, @justinclift  =D
 wow ^-^/
 oh... I'll edit strings and resend pull request soon~
your ui testing screenshot images are very usefull!!
 :dart: 
   Should be changed now.
   @justinclift Here you go.

If I did anything wrong (haven't used Linguist in a while), just let me know.
 > With MainWindow.ui, the strings tab for editing Pragmas are a mixture of English and Brazilian Portuguese. It looks kind of strange.

It is wrong. I've pushed another commit which should makes them all English. Some of these simply don't have a common PTBR translation (they would be written in English and italicized). Therefore, I think that it is best to leave them in English.
 Sure. Although this seems like a cheap workaround a bigger problem. I will look into doing this later when I am home. Glad you found out the cause of the issue. If you posted a cropping of the English version I could reply while at University.
 I asked about the image because due to the way verbs work in Portuguese, conjugation may be an issue. However, "Definir encriptação" is likely a good translation.
 I will normalize some capitalization tonight.

Also, Configurar seems a better choice. I think you are going to fix the bug anyway, so it could be kept that way.
 Yes, the capitalization normalization may be done in the future (it is on my TODO list). As it seems more like an improvement than a correction, I will not rush it as I am already quite stressed out.

If I need to sign anything let me know. My translations are donated to the project as-is and may be released under the same license(s) as the rest of the code.
  Hi Justin,

I finished it early this morning ;)

I'll have a look during this WE.

Do you have a dead line for a new release (4.0.00 ? - first picture, 
from 3.9.99).

Some words are defined once but used in different contexts.
In that case I choose an infinitive verb e.g. Autoriser to avoid 
autorisé, autorisée or autorisées.

Thanks for all these pictures. Very useful.

How to compile the program under Mint ?
Qt is OK but it is the 5.x release...

For the view with SQLCipher, is the hight of the window variable ?
I'll add some CR (or <br>, I don't have the file right now).
 Hi Justin,

That looks good.
I'll change Cipher again.

What's about ExportCSVDialog. It seems the list box (field separator) KO. Have
to replace Tabulation bu Tab. ?

In main dialog, I have to change from "masculin" to éféminin" in synchronization
: Arrêtée, Normale, Complète", if these texts are used here only.

I'll send you the file later...
 Done.

I saw "Supprimer la table" I've changed to "Supprimer une table" to harmonize
with the others texts.

Have a good "end of day"... Tomorow; I've to work (again :) )
 Hi Justin

Yes
 Cool ;)
  ### Details for the issue

Reproduction (it should be reproducible w/o Python, but that's what I exactly did):
1. In Python (2.7, 32-bit):

```
import sqlite3 as db
dbcon = db.connect("base.db")
dbcur = dbcon.cursor()
dbcur.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS people")
dbcur.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE `people` (
        `id` INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
        `name` TEXT NOT NULL,
        `member` INTEGER DEFAULT 0
    )""")
dbcur.execute("""
    INSERT INTO people VALUES (NULL, 'John Appleseed', 0)
""")
dbcon.commit()
```

\2. Open `base.db` in SQLiteBrowser
\3. Switch to "Browse Data" tab
\4. In Python:

```
...
dbcur.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE `people` (
        `id` INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
        `name` TEXT NOT NULL,
        `rank` INTEGER,
        `member` INTEGER DEFAULT 0
    )""")
dbcur.execute("""
    INSERT INTO people VALUES (NULL, 'John Appleseed', 100, 0)
""")
...
```

\5. Hit refresh button in "Browse Data"

Result: Table "people" has 3 attributes, and John's membership flag is "100"
Expected: Table "people" has 4 attributes, and John's rank is "100"

 Behaviour as expected in 3.9.99. :) Over and out, waiting for the release (Thanks for this tool a lot!).
 I've tried to be as military as I could (y'know witch their "positive" and "affirmative"), haha. It's not present, the table has 4 columns.

  There you go, Justin. Have checked the new translations and didn't find any obvious error, but may need to see the compiled result to be sure. :)
 Thanks @justinclift for reviewing it and showing the screenshots, have been very helpful!

You are correct about these errors. Have fixed them:
- ../ImportCsvDialog.ui" line="230" removed spurious & that you found.
- ../PreferencesDialog.ui" line="637" corrected the bad capitalization that you found.

Also fixed:
- ../EditDialog.cpp line="460" swapped the parameter %1 order to the correct one.
- ../EditDialog.cpp line="480" removed spurious parameter %1.
- ../MainWindow.ui" line="1782" changed translation to be consistent.

but can't locate where that broken dialog is in the .ts file.
There is no _"Ficheros de"_ string (or substrings of) that I can find anywhere in the file. :/ Do you know in which line is defined?

Also in that same dialog the _"New Folder"_ and _"Cancel"_ buttons are not translated but _"Abrir"_ is, but can't find the source _"New Folder"_ text either.
 Thanks, not me. I'm not seeking any credit but appreciate the offer very much.

Have updated the Spanish translation to fix some incoherences, hopefully all of them. Will be glad to review it before the new version is released to check for any new changes if needed.

Have not been able to find where to fix these shown in the screenshots:

Found these untranslated tooltips but can't locate where are the sources to translate them:
![portapapeles01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14217781/17837194/7ee1ec5c-67ac-11e6-9f7f-415149b1bb81.png)

Are the **Delete Table**, **Delete View** and **Delete Trigger** tooltips configured independently? Seems that all show the same tooltip set for Delete Table. Don't know if it's meant to be this way.
![portapapeles02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14217781/17837196/880884d0-67ac-11e6-9cab-468ca939db51.png)
 Cool! Good luck @justinclift with the certificates. Looking forward for it.

Guess that I wil need to generate a new pull request when these fixes are completed (and then translated)?
 Hmmm. Ok, I'll be sure of that, think that then I better start a new clone because the github webgui is a pain in the neck to sync branches and don't know how to rebase it.
 @justinclift I'll be glad to provide the Spanish translations for 3.9.0 as soon as needed if there is some hurry to release.

Now it shouldn't take me more than 10 minutes once the new .ts are ready if you let me know. I will just fork the new v3.9.x branch, update and generate the pull request including these.

If the other translations are also complete and the release won't get delayed updating them then why not fix all them? On the other hand, a cosmetic fix like this for just one translation probably won't justify much a long delay if new features are available with this release.

About the "Close Tab", if can't be found in the sources then may be is a Qt tooltip? There are also some other untranslated "Cancel" buttons (i.e. in the import/export dialogs) that seems to be the case.
 @revolter yeah, with a local copy is fine, but I was using the github webgui that apparently doesn't support it and the known way is generating a "reverse" pull request, that even if it works and gets the code in sync it makes a mess with the timelines for future pull requests.
 I'm not sure to be prepared to deal with the responsability of translating the Qt5 widgets being such a high impact project and not being a heavy user to understand the exact right context for them. :fearful:

I'll take a look at the 644 unfinished terms of Qt4 to see if are straightforward to translate but not sure if it's going to be a bit of wasted work to translate an old version.

Anyway seems that sqlitebrowser is very minimally affected by them to justify compiling Qt5. :wink:
 Cool! Looking forward to it.

Just issued a pull request completing the missing translations. :smile:
 @revolter well, not sure of that, literal translations of short terms lacking the proper context can be very confusing and become even annoying.

Let me check this weekend the ts source files for how many lines actually need to be translated for Qt5.
Seems that a lot since all but qt_es.ts are missing their Spanish translation. It may take me weeks and a few iterations to complete these, and I'm not sure what I'm getting into.
 Have been checking those Qt links, the documentation and all the Spanish .ts files.
Seems that most of the current translations are already imported from the old Qt4 version but tagged "unfinished" even if also half of them are new terms still untranslated.

So for Qt5 is more about first enabling each term than translating them. And that would requiere to be able to verify the proper context uses for each one. It's difficult to be sure otherwise and will be more work later to fix.

Not developing with Qt to see the results and getting feedback unfortunately I'll be unable to do that. :(
 @justinclift for some reason there are a couple of already translated terms that previouly were displayed correctly in the Nightly builds that in Nightly build 20160828_0218 are untranslated as shown in the capture below. Have checked both v3.9.x and master branches and seems to be correctly translated though.

Don't know if that affected the v3.9.0 release as I couldn't check it.

![nightly build 3 9 99_20160828_0218](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14217781/18034525/7ff2ef40-6d3f-11e6-8da9-9cce3590a329.png)
 Awesome! I'm glad that all went well with the release! :smile: 

Have translated the unfinished terms from the master branch but only could find 4 of them.

Does it worth to make a pull request now for such a minimal update or better wait for something more substantial?
 Done. :smile: 
 Hmm. It failed. Seems that didn't like the &oacute; html entity in the html text. Using utf-8 directly that worked for other terms.
     @justinclift ImportCsvDialog.ui in my system:
![screenshot from 2016-08-10 184559](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1304776/17560727/c5341862-5f2b-11e6-8e43-18218eece98e.png)

Do you mean empty preview at bottom of dialog?
 @justinclift, I think that's because Export CSV dialog allows to export data with empty "Other" line separator value.
  Hello.

In "Browse Data" tab, for FK's with 0 index not work:
- tooltip with text "References %1 (%2)...";
- Ctrl + Shift + Left Mouse Click.

Possible solution sqlitetablemodel.cpp, 261

```
if (column >= 0 && column < obj.table.fields().count())
```

instead

```
if (column > 0 && column < obj.table.fields().count())
```
 @justinclift,
1) import tables from .sql file: [kuban.db.sql.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/411587/kuban.db.sql.zip)
2) open Browse Data tab and select level table;
3) column place_id - it's Foreing Key to place(id) key;
4) try to jump to place table using Ctrl + shift+Click or try to wait tooltip with "References %1(%2).." text - none of this happens.
 @MKleusberg, @justinclift seems to be working as expected. Sorry for late reply.
  ### Details for the issue

as topic says. My procedure:
- opening the database
- fireing an sql-statement updating the table
- browsing the table
- leaving the database without saving

Unfortunately DB4S is changing the writedate of the db file, despite saying "don't save".

I could understand if it is changing the accessdate, and leaving creationdate and writedate untouched.

Regards
 Ralf

 > Does any of the above help? 

Yes and No. You know, just peeking into the file, doing some SQL and leaving without saving is expected to leave the database timestamp unchanged - but is does not. Thus the timestamp of the file couldn't be used as an original information anymore. That's sad. I can remember that EXCEL has some issues here too. 

If you exactly know of the programs behaviour you can workaround as you wrote. But I'm human and I won't take into account each and every programs oddities to do workarounds - I just wanne go ahead with reasonable thinking.

Well, if I cannot argue the developers to alter the behaviour I have to live with it or ... using the workaround.

So, thanks for the workaround ;-)
 Ralf
 if there is no chance of a quick fix of the program - as of saving timestamps and reset them at closing the database without being saved - well, than we can close this issue.

Surely it is not the biggest point out here.
 I thought it could be bad for other reasons.

So I'm fine with the workaround, at least for now ;-)
  ### Details for the issue

Database file that start with "." (hidden by default on OSX) are not selectable by the file picker when you click "Open Database". The following screenshot shows the open dialogue side-by-side with the same window in the finder. You see there are several hidden files that don't appear in the sqlitebrowser window.

Version 3.8.0
Qt Version 4.8.7
SQLite Version 3.9.2
### Useful extra information

The workaround is to rename the file, but this is a hassle and gets even more inconvenient when dealing with frameworks that expect the file to have a specific name.

 Thanks for the shortcut tip. I'll use that in the mean time. Fwiw I already have hidden files visible by default. That's why you can see them in the finder in my screenshot. But that doesn't seem to apply to dialogues so the second of the two solutions does not actually apply to this issue. It's counterintuitive that turning on hidden files all the time DOESNT make them visible in dialogues as well.

  I've changed the language from `ar_SA` (which is wrong) to `ar`
I think we can leave the flag as it is for now.
  On version 3.8.0, OSX 10.11.6

In preferences -> database, manually entering a value into the "Prefetch block size" input does not work.  The only way to get a value to stay is to hold down the arrow key, which takes a very long time.

![preferences](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300484/17383962/7d5ee77a-599e-11e6-9ad2-745fa877afba.png)

It is also possible to manipulate it with the keyboard via page up, page down, etc, but it is still slower than manually entering the desired value.

Thanks for a great project!
 Hi @revolter thanks for the tip!  It seems to be working in the latest nightly.  In the last release I was finally able to get it working after checking and unchecking foreign keys.  I suspect it was just gui-related. Thanks!
  Fixes #696
A comment is needed, but I don't know really why is the problem happening and why it got solved by multiplying the input height!
 I tried but some miss-positioning issues happened here on Fusion, Windows and Breeze themes (Linux).
If someone can try that on Linux, it would be great.
    Hello,

I've been using DB Browser since May and I'm loving it. 
It's too easy to create, import data and manipulate data directly.

I use the CSV export a lot and it works very well for me. But sometimes I need sqlite records to be available in a JSON, as they are as CSV. So, I have to export to CSV than convert manually to JSON.

Certainly I can create a script to access database and export do JSON, but why not have this as a system feature.

Suggestion:
Implement by default a JSON export as CSV and SQL

Extras
Offer a dialog box for choose where to save and a checkbox to be the export pretty print or not.

 Best regards,
 @justinclift Why not? For sure. I'll take a look this afternoon. The crash bug happens in a specific OS?
 I'll love to have this feature!
    @justinclift Right guess I was looking for something Mac-related on the wik homepage, there's good stuff in the building.md though that maybe could be extrapolated to a new article if it's current? The Mac section mentions an issue with 10.9 and was last updated in 2014 so may need a refresh.
 @justinclift Cool, knowing how much Apple loves breaking things I just assumed 🔥

Yes that makes sense!
 Link for reference: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Notes-for-setting-up-your-build-environment-on-OSX
  The filter input row isn't mirrored in RTL locales.
That is because Qt draws from left to right, and the painting wasn't recognizing RTL locales.
This fix does change the position of the inputs to be drawn from right to left (Using `width() - ..`).

According to Qt documentation:

> The position is measured in pixels from the first visible item's top-left corner to the top-left corner of the item with logicalIndex.

For that the size of the column is added to the postion so that it's measured from the top-right corner to the top-right corner.

Fixes #631

   > If we remove the & signs from all of our strings

Accelerators are triggered by `Alt+E` not `Ctrl+E`. They are different than shortcuts :)
Shortcuts are like `Ctrl+C` `Ctrl+V`..
 What you need is `QKeySequenceEdit`. That will make it easier to check weather the shortcut is used or not (Signals/Slots..). You can get it from designer and see how it works :)
  It would be great to be able to run SQL that uses functions from the [JSON extension](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html).
 Ahh, had not noticed that pref pane. I imagine that would work but haven't compiled one of them before (on macOS 10.11 and will accept hints!)

Edited title to clarify as FR; thanks!
 I noticed in another issue that you're on a Mac as well? Some Mac dev docs would be great. Maybe I should open another issue? 😃
 Absolutely! Their (sqlite) extension docs seemed pretty sparse and I wasn't sure where to start. Thanks @justinclift @revolter 
 The JSON1 functions (https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html) will be available in this nightly build?
 @justinclift Looks good so far:

```
SELECT json_object('ex','[52,3.14159]'),
  json_array(1,2,'3',4),
  json_array_length('[1,2,3,4]'),
  json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$'),
  json_insert('{"a":2,"c":4}', '$.a', 99),
  json_replace('{"a":2,"c":4}', '$.a', 99),
  json_object('a',2,'c',json_object('e',5)),
  json_remove('[0,1,2,3,4]','$[2]'),
  json_type('{"a":[2,3.5,true,false,null,"x"]}'),
  json_valid('{"x":35}')
```

outputs

` {"ex":"[52,3.14159]"} , [1,2,"3",4] ,4, {"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]} , {"a":2,"c":4} , {"a":99,"c":4} , {"a":2,"c":{"e":5}} , [0,1,3,4] ,object,1`

Thanks, hopefully flipping on support for other platforms isn't too hard!
 Appreciate it @justinclift - people will probably want a JSON browser too, heh... One step at a time :wink:
 Is any plans to release with the JSON1 enabled by default?
(json1 is a core extension - sqlite should be recompiled with the json1 extension enabled.) It's very easy to to add JSON1 support to sqlitebrowser. Only "-DSQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1=1" is required when building sqlite.  @justinclift, apologies for not replying back. Thanks for fixing the issue. :)
  Qt expects a RTL text, so it sets the text direction to RTL.
An easy fix is to add a "LRM" character to the end of the string, it acts as an English letter and would move the bracket to the right :)
Or forcing the combobox direction not to mirror by using `setLayoutDirection`. 
 That's not what I'm seeing here. While the selection direction is not right (I'll report that upstream), the items direction is correct:
![screenshot_ _](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3509617/17248915/1a144fda-55a6-11e6-87aa-0aa39be1f15f.png)

_I'm building the app right now and would update this when done._
 ArchLinux 64bit, Qt 5.7.
I think you would take some time to finish installing Arch :sweat_smile:

_Done!_

![screenshot_ _](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3509617/17249149/38b2fd46-55a7-11e6-9a8e-2845e876ebc8.png)

So it's exactly as in the designer. I think another bug report should be filed ASAP!

Have a nice meal :)

> For "I think another bug report should be filed ASAP!" are you meaning for us, or for Qt? If for Qt... um... are you ok to do it? I probably wouldn't even describe the issue clearly enough for them to fix it.

[This](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/667#issuecomment-236175247):

It is already reported, and I just updated it ;)
Here: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-55012
  I used to be able to refresh the view of the database in the browse data window and see changes. This appears to no longer be the case. If it's by design, so be it. Just thought it was a very handy feature. Now I have to reload the database.
 Was on Windows 7, didn't work there either. On 10 now. Newest release version, just reinstalled it...
 Funny enough, if I have BOTH versions open at the same time, it works. With just one or the other, it doesn't appear to want to update... I'm clueless on that one....
 I'm using the refresh button in the program window. 

Just did a test. If I open a second instance of the program and open the database, I can refresh just fine. I opened the newer version twice. Going to try now with the older version. I have no idea why it makes a difference, but it does...
 Ok. Exactly same behavior with the release version... Wish I could offer a hint but there's a reason I love your program, I know NOTHING about SQL....
 If needed, you're welcome to Skype in and see it on this end. It's no big rush, I just happened to think of reporting it when I reinstalled and it still didn't work.  :-)
 I am seeing something similar, on OSX. But it just started happening today, and worked fine earlier today!

I just updated to OSX 10.11.6, but only BECAUSE of this problem. (I took a chance it might fix it...)

I don't typically use the refresh button, though, I always forget it is there. I usually switch to a different table, then go back to the table that's been updated.

Other strange symptom is that if I do a query using ExecuteSQL, it will say, e.g. 4 records found, but they aren't shown.

Perhaps a complication is that I am using it to look at databases in an iOS simulator. (I use simPholders to conveniently find the directory, and it mounts the directory using OSXFuse...)
 @revolter, I think I just solved it. I disabled simPholder's use of simPhuse, and now it seems to be working fine.

simPholders finds your simulator images and exposes them in a menu bar window. simPhuse provides yet another convenient way to access them, via a mounted filesystem. In either cases, you can select based on device, version, running app name, etc. instead of an obscure udid.

I rarely actually use the simPhuse mounted filesystem, though.

It's strange it worked until today. 
 I can confirm same issue with the nightly. And once I turned off simPhuse, then no problem with refresh.

So, I have my workaround. But you still have your odd behavior, when using it with an odd filesystem. ;)

Perhaps, though, this will give you a clue as to related issues.
  Would it be possible to add file types to the preferences so that the choices of file types is not just _.db and *._? A low priority item, I realize. But if somewhere in the preference there were a place to add additional file types that would show up in the file open/save dialogs, that would be great. 

Maybe even make those items open automatically in the shell. (lower priority)
 I would prefer an editable list of extensions somewhere in the preference dialog, which is nowhere near as simple as editing a .h file, I know. But. I use various extensions for various different projects and I doubt they are common with other users. *.PACKAGE, *.CFG, *.OBJECT. See, I doubt many other people would need these.
 Only 25+years of C/C++ experience (no Qt experience but I understand the gist of it) but I lack the time to work on the browser. If no one gets around to it in a few months to a year, I might find some time. I agree, though, it is probably a good "get your feet wet" project for someone new to the your code base.
 It doesn't need to be prefilled with my needs. Just prefill it with the current defaults.

Databases (*.db)

And then the dialog also adds All Files (*.*) and if someone wants to delete *.db they can. If they want to add new ones they can. And the up and down arrows are also cool.
  Every time I open up the program it asks me if i want to update, i click "Don't show again" and carry on. When i reopen the program later, the message still pops up asking me if i want to update.
  See issue #621 for details.

I built a new installation package and during installation on Windows 7
I could  see that the previously unquoted path is now quoted.
 I'll be following the development of this issue.
  So, A quick "scan" throught the Arabic file showed me that there is a huge number of logical mistakes, I'm referring to This: `<translation>تصدير(&amp;)</translation>` especially.
I'd say to give the file for someone who really knew what translation (and the technical part of it) is.

Not to mention the grammatical errors and translation mistakes.
 The programmer is NOT responsible for fixing the translation files. You
should contact the translator to fix that, or you simply don't get it
released.

"which doesn't always fit into the translation."
This isn't accepted in Arabic, it is not Japanese/Chinese.

I can work on the translation but my way of my translation is different,
I'm not sure if you accept that, as if will change almost all of the
current translations.
 > When you say your way of translation is different... are you meaning a different dialect of Arabic?

No, it's just another way of translating buttons (To action not noun), and some other Arabic specific rules.
  Added Arabic translation.
 @justinclift Thanks.
@innermous Nice catch, it's truer to be 'ar_SA' instead of 'ar_EG'.
 @justinclift `sqlb_ar.ts` is done. You can merge it. 
 @justinclift Most welcome. No, they should be translated in `sqlb_ar.ts`. Same thing happening with French translation ( and maybe others ), example: `Revert Changes` should be translated ( [here ](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/translations/sqlb_fr.ts#L1069)), but it isn't translated in the GUI either.
  When opening the "Browse Data" tab the first time, then selecting a table from the drop down, it automatically shows the data for the table in ascending order by '_rowid_'.

I can tell by watching the SQL log window, it shows these SQL statements:
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `ConfigInfo` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `ConfigInfo` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC LIMIT 0, 50000;

If I then click on the "Execute SQL" tab, then click back to the "Browse Data" tab, it shows the data for the table in descending order by '_rowid_'

The SQL log window now shows these five new statements:

SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_master UNION SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_temp_master;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `ConfigInfo` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `ConfigInfo` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC LIMIT 0, 50000;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `ConfigInfo` ORDER BY `_rowid_` DESC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `ConfigInfo` ORDER BY `_rowid_` DESC LIMIT 0, 50000;

You can see the last one was ordering 'DESC'.

I believe it should not be changing the order like this, and just use 'ASC' order.
 It was with version 3.8.0, 64 bit version for Windows.  Sorry I haven't tried any nightly build.
 Hi I just tried these two nightly versions.

The Win64 version from http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64-onceoffs/  still has this issue occur.
The Win32 version from http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser.exe.zip seems to work fine.

Again I can see it changing the order by to DESC in the SQL log window.

SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_master UNION SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_temp_master;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `BinaryFile` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `BinaryFile` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC LIMIT 0, 50000;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `BinaryFile` ORDER BY `_rowid_` DESC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `BinaryFile` ORDER BY `_rowid_` DESC LIMIT 0, 50000;

The Win32 version just does not execute these last two SQL statements, but the Win64 version does.
  That's because of: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/b773e77a0c17317c9096728876e2b3c0f29be559/src/MainWindow.cpp#L2487
which leads to deleting all the current fillter inputs: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/FilterTableHeader.cpp#L30

Data should be saved somewhere and then called when repainting..
  1. Open any table
2. Right-click and select "Show rowid column"
3. Move your mouse over this column
4. DB4S crash

DB4S v3.8.0 on Windows 7 (64-bit)
 No crash for me. Tried with a couple different databases.
 Still crashing with the latest nightly build (3.8.99).
 @karim, have you tried using a different database? Can you share the DB?
 @jungle-boogie I have tried different databases, and still the same. This one crash also..

``` sql
CREATE TABLE t(c TEXT);
INSERT INTO t VALUES('x');
```

I can use filter on the **_rowid_** column, and I can click on any row on it too. But only if I do it quickly. It is just that when I keep the mouse over any row in this column for more than 1 second, then DB4S crashes.
 Hi @karim, I still can't get it to crash. Maybe I'm not doing the same exact thing as you. Also, i'm on WIndows 8.1. Can you try a different profile on your windows computer? Do you have linux or mac to try?
 I just tried it on another PC (Windows 7 64-bit also, but without Service Pack 1) that I never installed or used DB4S on before, and it is still crashing. Unfortunately, I don't have Linux or Mac to try.
 @chrisjlocke This is exactly what I'm having, and I don't think it is the database problem. Also, **_rowid_** wasn't showing for me sometimes, but I wasn't sure how to explain it properly. Thanks for recording it! 
 @chrisjlocke, that video great. thanks for recording it and illustrating the problem.

@karim, I apologize for misunderstanding what you were indicating as the problem.
 @revolter Thanks for the fix. I was waiting for it to be merged to test it.

@justinclift I'm unable to run DB4S after installing the file you linked. It is showing me this error..

![](http://i.imgur.com/6MTZCc4.jpg)

I have vcredist_x64.exe installed on my system.

![](http://i.imgur.com/v2NMqy4.jpg)

Also, it seems that DB4S installs it during setup too.

![](http://i.imgur.com/FJSOBnL.jpg)

The missing dll is MSVCP120**[D]**.dll and not MSVCP120.dll. Is this the debug version?
 @justinclift Yes! It works! :smile: 

@revolter Thanks for this fix!

And thanks to everyone here for helping with this issue. :+1: 
 @justinclift Sure. I will report back after checking it.
 @justinclift I can confirm that this issue (the crash) is fixed in the latest nightly build. But I noticed that #510 is not fixed in this build.

The latest nightly build only fixes the crash bug. Showing _rowid_ column doesn't refresh it until you switch "Browse Data" tab and switch back to it again, or if you click on any of the columns filters.

From nightly build..

The installer you linked has _both_ fixed. It doesn't crash _and_ **_rowid_** column refresh instantly after showing it.
  Tried creating a relational database with 3 tables; one parent and 2 children. Went to the Edit pragmas tab and clicked on the Foreign key checkbox. As soon as I return to the Database structure tab that pragma was turned off. Cannot create the db within the application.

Same problem occurs trying to import the db schema from a .sql file; the foreign keys are not recognized or accepted.

Wish there was documentation for this application.

Justin,

   That's certainly understandable. I know that docs are often a much lower
priority than coding, but something on the wiki about what works and what
doesn't work would be helpful to folks like me.

   Yesterday I tried building -3.8.0 (I use the SlackBuilds.org scripts for
most of my additional software), but it apparently requires a newer version
of QScintilla than that distributed with Slackware-14.1. However, -14.2 was
released a week ago and may have a QScintilla version that works. When my
DVD arrives I'll upgrade all the hosts and try again.

   Unfortunately, foreign key support is a critical need for all my
applications; that's why I use a RDBMS.

Thanks for your reply and explanation,

Justin,

   Slackware's going to start mailing out the DVDs with 14.2 by the end of
the month (I guess they're all in production now). So it'll be August when I
upgrade and will try the latest build of sqlitebrowser then.

  Hi, I'm using sqlitebrowser for arch linux. I installed from yaourt. While i try to use, the application is crashing and without any error message, it will close.
  Hi

I'm currently running on a debian 7.11, cmake version 2.8.9 and tried to compile the package by myself.

I checked https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md and made sure that build-essential, cmake, libqt4-dev and libsqlite3-dev are installed.

I'm building it with USE_QT5=OFF. ccmake shows

```
ANTLR2_INCLUDE_DIR               ANTLR2_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND
ANTLR2_LIBRARY                   ANTLR2_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND
```

Which debian package would satisfy that?

I continued the process and executed `make` but it stops at

```

Is there any other package besides `libqt4-dev` that is needed there?
 Hi

If I run `qmake` in the source code directory, nothing happens, `qmake` exists with status 0.

If I run `qmake` in the build directory after cmake generated the `makefiles`, I get an error:

```
build$ qmake
Usage: qmake [mode] [options] [files]
.....
```

Doing 

```
$ cmake .
-- Could NOT find Antlr2 (missing:  ANTLR2_LIBRARIES ANTLR2_INCLUDE_DIRS) 
```

Could it be a path issue? 

You have

```
if(NOT ANTLR2_FOUND)
    set(ANTLR_DIR libs/antlr-2.7.7)
    add_subdirectory(${ANTLR_DIR})
endif()
```

and this is a relative path, I guess relative to current running directiory and not necessarily to  `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`.  I always create a build directory outside of the source code and this could be an issue.

Do you usually generate the cmake-Makefile on the same directory as the source code?
 Oh man, I'm stupid, I only executed `qmake` and didn't realize that it only creates the Malefiles.

Now I get 

```
cd libs/antlr-2.7.7/ && make -f Makefile.antlr 
make[1]: Entering directory `/tmp/test/sqlitebrowser/libs/antlr-2.7.7'
make -f Makefile.antlr.Release

That's strange

```
$ g++ -c -m64 -pipe -O2 -fPIC -Wall -W -D_REENTRANT -DQT_WEBKIT -DQT_NO_DEBUG -DQT_GUI_LIB -DQT_CORE_LIB -DQT_SHARED -I/usr/share/qt4/mkspecs/linux-g++-64 -I. -I/usr/include/qt4/QtCore -I/usr/include/qt4/QtGui -I/usr/include/qt4 -I. -Irelease -o release/TreeParser.o src/TreeParser.cpp

Last time I had a `segfault` with GCC it was when I discovered that my RAM was faulty and had to change my ram. That's strange because I have to compile quite a bit of C++ code and I usually don't have these problems.

// edit:

when compiling with cmake, `TreeParser.cpp` is compiled without a problem.
 > The trick will be figuring out what and why. ￼

I'll take a look at that later when I get back home (right now  @work). I have some projects using CMake,  I have some experience with it. 
 I'm not sure, I think I have a problem with my RAM. I'll let memtest run over the weekend.

When I use `qmake` to compile as `root`, then the build was complete. But `sqlitebrowser` crashes immediately with a `segfault`. If I run it with `valgrind` (might give me a clue as why it dies with `segfault`) the QT app window is loaded, rendered but after a couple of seconds  it dies with `segfault`.

As I said, I'll let run `memtest` over the weekend and see what happens.
 I didn't forget this issue but I was on holiday and this week has been crazy, lots of deadlines.

I executed memtest over the weekend as I planned, it run more than 60 hour straight without interruptions and not a single error was found. I don't know why gcc fails with segfaults.

I'm still running on a debian 7. I will install debian 8 on virtualbox and see if I can reproduce the same results.
 Hi

I'm so sorry, I have been terribly busy in the last couple of weeks and I had an operation two weeks ago and have been recovering since then.

I did find out however that the reason I got the segfaults was not my RAM or debian buildchain. Some time ago I installed linuxbrew because I wanted to test something. linuxbrew compiled a glibc, gcc and other packages on its own and put them at the front of PATH. I haven't realized that until I was compiling something for one client of ours and I constantly got segfaults. That's when I executed gcc --version and I got a segfault as well. Then I realized that I was executing the gcc from linuxbrew the whole time.

Since then I haven't had the time to experiment with that. But I haven't forgotten it :) 
 So, I make a git clone and the current commit is `684958b29ce3d26684d9142d73df773b11189d54`.

I first tried `qmake && make` and this time it compilied without any issue. The program runs without problems.

I also tried `cmake`. It still complaining about missing `ANTLR2` libraries, but this may be a path issue. `cmake` is able to generate a `Makefile` and running `make` works also as well, the binary runs, everything seems fine.

The only issue I have is that the UI is to aggressive with the focus. If the UI loses focus, it regains automatically again, and this is a problem when you have virtual desktops, because the moment you change to another virtual desktop/screen and the UI loses focus, it regains focus and you jump back at the virtual desktop you've started the UI. I use fluxbox with at 12 virtual screens where every virtual screen has something running. While te UI runs, I'm unable to switch to the other screens.
 Hi

the `v3.9.x` also compiles (qmake/cmake) without a problem. The focus problem is there as well. I'll test it later @home, different system (gentoo).
 @justinclift: it's me, same person, different account (my personal).

I've made an update in gentoo (dev-db/sqlitebrowser-3.8.0) and it works normal, I can change the to my virtual desktops when `sqlitebrowser` is running.

I've compiled the `v3.9.x` version using `qmake` and `cmake` and I had the same issue: If I change to another virtual desktop, `sqlitebrowser` regains immediately the focus and my virtual desktop goes back to that where `sqlitebrowser` is running.
 No, 
- When compiled for the `v3.9.x` branch, the focus problem **is** happening
- When compiled for the `master` branch, the focus problem **is** happening
- When compiled for the `v3.8.0` branch, the focus problem **is not** happening
  Does not open password protected SQLite db created with Navicat!!!
  Hi,

In windows 10, every time I double click a database cell the window opens in the left upper corner of the screen. If I press Esc and try again it opens in a "normal position", at the middle of the screen.

The position of the window alternates between these two. 
Its pretty inconvenient each time it appears on the left upper corner since the upper and left side of it are off the screen, not allowing dragging nor resizing or closing the window (with the pointer).

I'm running SQLite Browser 3.8.0.

Thanks!
 Hi @GHProjects and @justinclift,

This isn't specific to windows 10. I'm on Windows 8.1 and have the same behavior. This is also present on the latest nightly build.

I don't know the behavior on Linux, but I'll bring it up and see what happens. 
 The same issue on Windows 7 :(
 I'm glad this is brought up. I've mentioned it in a previous report (#413).

Since the position of the main form is stored when the application is closed, my suggestion is a new setting in Preferences to also store the position of the Edit-window.

Because of this bug I'm still using a build from August 19th 2015 but I'd like to update, cause I like to be up to date. :)
 This happens on linux. Can someone please confirm? Then will @GHProjects please change the subject to be more accurate if someone else confirms the same behavior on linux?
 > Because of this bug I'm still using a build from August 19th 2015

That's pretty silly. There's been many other bugs fixed since and sqlite has moved on as well.
 @jungle-boogie I created the topic but I don't have the permission to do that. Ask @justinclift ;)
 @GHProjects, why would you not have the permission to rename a thread you started?
 I don't know Qt or c++ very well (I'm a Delphi Pascal guy) but I took a quick look around the source code and I imagine something like this would work:

On show (or initialization) of edit dialog
restoreGeometry(PreferencesDialog::getSettingsValue("EditDialog", "geometry").toByteArray());
restoreState(PreferencesDialog::getSettingsValue("EditDialog", "windowState").toByteArray());

On close of edit dialog
PreferencesDialog::setSettingsValue("EditDialog", "geometry", saveGeometry());
PreferencesDialog::setSettingsValue("EditDialog", "windowState", saveState());

This is taken from "MainWindow.cpp" and I just altered a part of the lines to say "EditDialog" instead. I'm not sure the setting for "windowState" is necessary to save and restore though. Can someone more knowledgable please say that it might work or that I'm totally wrong. :-)
I'm willing to try a nightly build with this (or correction of this) code to help testing.
 Thanks @justinclift I'll take a look at the guide and see if I can set up a working build environment during the weekend.
 I've been experimenting a little.
Altering the event below works for me on Windows to keep the dialog opening centered over the main window. But I have no idea about other platforms, multiple monitor setups and other possible special cases.

``` cpp
void EditDialog::showEvent(QShowEvent*)
{
    // Whenever the dialog is shown, position it at the center of the parent dialog
    QMainWindow* parentDialog = qobject_cast<QMainWindow*>(parent());
    if(parentDialog)
    {
        move(parentDialog->x() + parentDialog->width() / 2 - width() / 2,
            parentDialog->y() + parentDialog->height() / 2 - height() / 2);
    }
}
```
 This works great for me on Linux. the edit cell box stays centered each time on all cells.
 I've had the opportunity to try my Windows build on a computer with two monitors, and I'm happy to say it works great there too. :smile: 

For information, the current official build has problems there which can cause the dialog to appear on wrong monitor,
 A pull request has been made. :smile: 
 You're welcome @justinclift.
Tackling other things.... sure, do you have more dialogs that needs to be centered? :wink: But seriously, do you have anything particular in mind? I'm still new to Visual Studio, C++, Qt, yeah basically everything in your brilliant Windows Build Guide. :smile: 
 @justinclift  If I can find the piece of code that performs the launch I should be able to fix the security issue. Right now I don't know where to start looking, so any hints are welcome. :smile:
 Confirmed this works great on windows 8.1. The edit database cell displays in the same spot all the time.
Thanks a lot for the patch, @DelphiGit!
  Hi,

When I'm working with SQLiteBrowser and I need some additional screen resources, I occasionally minimize the SQLiteBrowser window.
However, when I then need to access SQLiteBrowser, I cannot get the window restored.
I need to Quit the application and then re-open it.

I'm running OS-X El Capitan and I retrieved the following information from SQLiteBrowser:
Version 3.8.0
Qt Version 4.8.7
SQLite Version 3.9.2

Is there something I'm doing wrong?
Is there anything I can do to change this behavior?

Please help as this is a little annoying.

Regards,
Rob.
 Just tried it myself as well.
Minimizing using the orange button on top left indeed.
Clicking on the icon in the Dock doesn't do anything.
When I do "RightClick / Show all Windows" it pops up. Although this works, this is not the default on my system.
When I minimize the Safari window I'm now using to write this answer, I just need to click it once from the Dock to have it restored.
 When I write programs for Windows using VB, if a program is minimised and restored, you not only have to make the window 'normal' again (from minimised) but also have to change the Z order - it might be why the window is restored but behind other windows?  I've never programmed for a Mac so unsure what I'm on about....  in VB you have to 'activate' the required application to bring it back to the front.
 No problems on Sierra (10.12.2) using build 3.9.1v2.
I suggest this issue can be closed. @justinclift Thanks for the update!
Just downloaded / installed this version and it is properly behaving like other apps!
You seem to have fixed the issue!

Thanks!!!!!!

Regards,
Rob.  The filters raw where you can search in the coloumn for a specifc string isn't mirrored in RTL layouts.

 @innermous In Qt5, pass "--reverse" to the app, so it's "sqlitebrowser --reverse"
  Hi,

I need export my SQLite database to sql file with MySQL compatibility, hence I want to use always backtick (`) for CREATE TABLE syntax. For example:

```
CREATE TABLE `Table1` (`ID` INTEGER,`Name` TEXT);
```

however, in the exported sql, the create statement contains backtick (`) as well as double quote (") and single quote (') , which seems to be a random behavior.

for example I have a table with schema:

```
CREATE TABLE `Source` (`Source_ID` INTEGER, `Name_Source` TEXT);
```

if I export this table, it become to: 

```
CREATE TABLE "Source" (`Source_ID`  INTEGER, `Name_Source` TEXT)
```

or

```
CREATE TABLE 'Source' ('Source_ID' INTEGER, 'Name_Source' TEXT);
```

And it's also unpredictable in the CREATE INDEX statements:
in this case I want no quote around the columns like:

```
CREATE INDEX Source_Source_ID ON Source (Source_ID);
```

but the exported sql is:  

```
CREATE INDEX 'Source_Source_ID' ON 'Source' ('Source_ID' );
```

So when I import the sql to MYSQL database, I got syntax errors
 @justinclift it would be great to have user defined quote character for export
 @MKleusberg it would be great if you can implement this feature(tables and indices are enough for me), however I am not able to test the nightly build this week, I will check later ASAP, thank you. @justinclift @MKleusberg thanks, it's now working! I will close the issue  I mentioned something similar in #599 - whenever a field is moved/edited, a whole bunch of SQL is executed.  I can't understand why this isn't 'written' when the user clicks OK, which must happen when a table is created, rather than edited.  If you want to move a field down 10 rows, thats a lot of SQL operations on a live database...
  If you try to resize any column after having pressed 'Add Record' but before completion the addition, then no matter which column you try to resize, all columns are resized in the exact same way losing the original widths for all columns.
 @justinclift this behavior works as expected in accordance with #241. @justinclift after adding new record new row is selecting MainWindow::addRecord(), 568 (I don't know why, since 2013-04-07). If we continue to change width of single column, it will actually change the width of all columns, because new row is selected (every column in row is selected). I see the problem now.  I guess it's a non-issue then other than it's not obvious to the user why this is happening.

So, if the whole row is automatically selected when pressing 'New Record', it could also appear as selected (all highlighted -- instead of just the row number) just as if one selected the row manually by clicking on the row number.  This would at least make it obvious that the whole row is selected at that moment, and it would have a consistent look between manual and automatic row selection. In latest build I just tried, only the row number is highlighted when pressing "Add Record".  The entire row is highlighted only after starting the column resizing, which is too late as you have already messed up all other rows from their previous size.  I have seen repeated crashes when the following actions are taken, and this is reproducible with the most recent nightly build.
1. With a DB open, go to the 'Browse Data' tab
2. Select a blank record (note: when I say blank I mean "", not (NULL).  As in an empty string).  These can easily be generated by a CSV import without all fields populated for every row
3. Ctrl+C to copy the cell value
4. Select a cell with a non-null value in it, Ctrl+V to paste
5. The application crashes

I am using Windows 7 Enterprise
 Sorry for the delayed response, absolutely ill test it at work tomorrow when I use the browser :)
 I have re-tested the issue with the latest nightly build and the crash is no longer observed.  

I tested copying a blank value into a populated cell, copying a blank value into a blank cell, copying a blank value into a null cell, and copying blank values into cells with different data types.  All tests passed.

Note: It is interesting that the Browse Data tab doesn't perform validations on entries into the cells based on data type.  Was this intentional?

Closing this ticket, thank you for the quick response!
 Very good explanation! 
  This PR adds the option to save a password per database file name and upon trying to open an encrypted database for which the password was saved in the Preferences, it opens up automatically, without the need for user input.

Fixed #486.
 I saw that but didn't know why it failed. I'll try that tonight. Or should I pull the latest commits on my fork and then merge the master in this patch branch?
 I can amend to a pushed commit? :O But, I'd keep it as a separate commit because it's another thing.
 I knew that the branch is in sync with this PR, but I didn't know I can edit commits that are pushed to GitHub. I usually edit unpushed commits in my workflow. But thanks for the explanation :smile:
 I didn't test with other than 1024 page size (I don't know what page size is :laughing:). I'll test it these days and let you know if I need the database file.
 Well, I can't encrypt the database. I'm following these steps:
- select `File` > `New Database...`
- `Save As:` > `Untitles2.db`
- click `Save`
- create a `test` table in the `Edit table definition` window that pops up
- click `OK`
- select `File` > `Set Encryption`
- enter `abc123` in the `Password` and `Reenter password` field
- change `Page size` field value to `2048`
- click `OK`
- the database closes
- the `Invalid file format.` popup appears

and I'm left with `Untitled3.db` and `Untitled3.db.enctempold` files.

Am I doing something wrong or is it another bug? Or I introduced it? As far as I understood, the problem with the invalid popup was when trying to open an encrypted database, right? Could you email your test database just to make sure it works with it as well after solving the problem?
 Well, it looks like that's by design. `Untitles2.db` is really encrypted, and I think that `Untitle2.db.enctempold` is just a safety backup.

What do you mean by _".ui sizing"_? The fact that I didn't managed to put the `Add` and `Delete` buttons next to each other? 😂 I did tried a lot but could figure out how to do this.

Also, I solved the _"it should probably prompt using the manual password dialog when the automatic ones fail"_ problem, and I recall thinking of this but forgot about it, it was so obvious.

Another thing I noticed is that you entered the file with the extension. I made it so it needs just the name of the file, didn't think more thoroughly about this.

I think it needs a discussion. It kinda seems more logic to require the file extension too because of these reasons:
1. one could have `test.db` and `test.sqlite3` files, encrypted differently
2. you, instinctively inserted the name with the file extension too, so there's a chance that that will other users do
 @glawrence, I don't have access to a Windows OS.

And, the passwords are saved [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/625/files#diff-5ac1944317cd5ef74bfa5b0c9cfab070R185), but, yes, they are stored in plain text, I guess. I send them without any modification to the [`setSettingsValue`](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/src/PreferencesDialog.cpp#L183) method, which uses `QSettings`. But it looks like `QSettings` is saving them in plain text.

What do you think I should do before saving them? Like MD5 them? Should I make the table cell of password type in order for it to display dots or asterisks instead of the actual password?
 One more thing, why was the travis change needed? Why didn't it fail for everybody else?
 Of course I don't mind. Thanks for drawing my attention too.

I don't have much knowledge of security myself, but I do know that it's very important, even if it's not "enjoyed". So I don't think I can do this all by myself.

Another option is to not get this merged until we fix the plain text passwords problem. Or lose the master password, as it's more complicated than salting and hashing them the same way.
 I understood, but I really don't know to do UI in Qt yet. It's very very very different from Xcode with which I'm accustomed. I don't understand how to increase the table widget's width.
 Well, I already found out where and "how" to edit the UI, but, like you noticed, I can't resize widgets.
 @glawrence, I thought about what you said. I don't think it's possible using hashing, because the password will need to be "unhashed" when tried opening the database. Also, knowing that they are stored on the user's PC, I don't think is such a problem. FileZilla, Thunderbird and others do the same. What do you think?
    I had created a table and used a default value of .5 for a REAL column. When I went to the Browse Data tab and selected the table, no column names or filter fields were shown. When I tried to Add Record I get "Error adding record: no such table: (INSERT INTO '' DEFAULT VALUES;)". Then I tried to modify the table. It brought up an empty Edit table definition window with none of my existing fields. After recreating the table I discovered that if I used a default value of 0.5 I did not see this problem.

 Not only that, but if you add a record via the 'Execute SQL' tab, the record displays in the 'Browse Data' tab.  Hover the mouse over the row, and DB Browser weeps, curls up in a ball and cries horribly.

(This was in the Jun 11 nightly)
 Yeah if you can get me a windows build I would be more than happy to test it.
 A Windows 32-bit one for me please.
I think I have a similar/related crash case.
 No rush.

With Nightly build (17-Aug-2016 02:21) things seems partially fix.

Its not crashing anymore (_when letting the mouse hover to long over a data field_) :smile: 

Table edit still showing

```
CREATE TABLE `subject_data_tmp` (

);
```

on a table created with:

```
CREATE TABLE subject_data_tmp (pid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ASC, pr_id INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT ASC)
```

But that one is in the pipeline if I got it right.

Night night.

---

(_I have spotted that odd "DEFAULT ASC" part on my side._)
 Yea, that `DEFAULT ASC` was the trigger of the problems on this side (_an edit error from me that slipped by_). After changing it to a more appropriate and intended `DEFAULT 0`. sqlitebrowser (_the nightly and the last final version_) went back to behaving as expected/normal.

(_Kept a copy of the original error case database for re-testing, just in case. If needed._)
  This isn't a bug per-se, but more of a 'what do you think?' question . suggestion.

If I create a table with a field set as an integer, DB Browser (or sqlitebrowser) doesn't moan if I try and create a new record and put 'test' in that new field - ie, a string (or text) in an integer field.

This isn't a fault with DB Browser, as you can do it in the raw SQL, so my thought was whether it would be useful if DB Browser had some 'validity' checks...  guess it would only need to be for the interger and real data types (oh, and numeric) so can't see it bloating the program too much...

Just some random thoughts...
 No problem.  Thanks for replying.
  @justinclift I have made a commit with a fix to this issue in my master fork. Before I turn it into a pull request I have a question: I previously made a test commit with my ignore-file, but I assume you will be able to pick just the last commit I made, or will everything always be pulled?
 Thanks for your advice @justinclift. I think I succeeded. Otherwise, please let me know. :smile: 
  I suggest to remove some margin arround the treeview. It's not clear actually and it looks like 90's app. 
I did it for my Qt apps, and it looks better : http://dridk.github.io/cuterest/
 I mean layout margin as you can see here :

In Red, margin to remove. Tree view should fill all the content

 This doesn't happen to me in the sqlitebrowser from this morning (9 june, 2016).
Try making a database, write it, close browser and open it up and see what happens.
 I did not get back to this issue until today, I have been unable to reproduce this failure even with the original file. Perhaps Mars has to be in the right place in the sky? I will continue to use this application and try to get it to reproduce.
  Hello
I am learning SQL, now I am practising with queries that combine data from multiple tables that are related to one another. How I can do it on DB Browser? I

Thank you so much
 Clicking 'File' and 'Attach' should attach another database into the mix.  Might just be the databases I was using, but it didn't do much for me...
You can't use it (the attach keyword) in the SQL window, as that uses transactions and you can't use ATTACH in a transaction.
 Hi Chris
Thank you so much for your quick reply, but i have tried it before and it doesn´t work; I attach the another database but when I do a query the browser doesn´t find that new database.
 No, I must admit, I tried it when I saw your query (never used it before in anger) and couldn't get it to work either, and just assumed it was because there was either a schema clash or the planets weren't aligned quite right... (I was using it on Win 10 ... unsure if that matters....)
I was also using the latest nightly, in case that helps... (thats the usual first reply ... ensure you're using the latest version!)

I assume you're getting the 'enter a name for the attached database' dialog window?

Looking at the SQL log, something is attempted...
ATTACH 'D:/Downloads/Applications/SQLite Database Browser/sqlitebrowser.exe- 7 Jun 2016/1.db' AS `test`
SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_master UNION SELECT type,name,sql,tbl_name FROM sqlite_temp_master;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `test2` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `test2` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC LIMIT 0, 50000;

but not much happens... no errors are displayed, etc....
 Yes finally i have had to create a new table inside the other. It was a simple exercise to query multiple tables that have relationships with each other.
Thank for your time and help
 What were your steps to do that?
 I wrote CREATE TABLE artists(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT); and then I inserted a few registres, for example: INSERT INTO artist (id, name) VALUES (1, Iron Maiden); and it had worked for the exercise which i had to do. Were very simply queries such as SELECT \* FROM albums LEFT JOIN artists ON albums.artist_id = artists.id;
  When deleting a field from a table, the default button in the popup dialog is 'Yes' rather than 'No', which is the usual convention for dialog boxes that have consequences.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/15848978/ebb8ce0a-2c87-11e6-9b29-5dd433784113.png)
 Thanks for the prompt fix.  Was only a cosmetic issue mainly, but nice that
it now follows convention! ;)
Will test tomorrow and report back.  Thanks again.
 On the sqlitebrowser from the 9th of June, I'm not prompted _at all_ when I delete a row. I'll download the latest (even though the code may be the same) and see if there's any change.

Above is still true for the sqlite from the 10th of June. Also, I'm not prompted to delete data from the table or the entire row or multiple rows.

I am prompted if I'd like to restore the deleted table, though, and I'm prompted if I'm sure I'd like to delete a table. The default option on the latter is no and the default option on the former is yes.
 If you delete a row you're not prompted, as I presume if you think 'Oops', you can click 'Revert Changes'.  So thats 'as per design'.

I can confirm though that deleting a field now displays a dialog box with 'No' as default.  Thanks for a prompt fix.
  Hi, I'm using your tool for many years, and it's always been my best choice in dealing with sqlite, but this last version crashes very often, especially if you run this app, change to another with ALT+TAB and then return  by the same keys with the SQLite Browser, app crashes...
Please fix that.

Thank you for your work!
 Just a nod (either helpful or not...) that I've been using 3.8.99 (why don't nightlies have a specific version number?  Even 3.8.99.20160707? Just noticed x.99 is a generic version number) with no application crashes. The version I use every day is dated 26 Dec 2015 (so just after the main release... without the data cell popup) but just downloaded the latest nightly and couldn't replicate it in that either.  I'm using Win 10 64bit.
 I'm not able to reproduce the issue originally reported on windows 8.1. I'm using a nightly build from last week. I don't get a new nightly build unless there's any updates to the github source.
  We could use  dropdown combobox for foreign key cells to make edition even more comfortable.

Cell editor should provide suggestions based on available set of values. Problem is, I don't have idea how to get rid of ambiguity. How do we know, which text to display? In heidi it works so natural and implicitly.
  sqlitebrowser: 3.8.0
1. Create new database
2. Create table with name "test"
3. Add a field named "index"
4. Check "PK" (Primary key)
5. Click OK.

Error message:

```
Error creating table. Message from database engine:
near "index": syntax error (CREATE TABLE `test` (
    `index` INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY(index)
);)
```
 It's fixed! Thanks!
  This is a suggestion for an optional feature to make the whole experience somewhat better.

If the user turns this global option on, any database specific configuration could be saved inside the database itself in a specially named table (e.g., _sqlitebrowser_config_ or whatever -- maybe ever user defined table name).

What do I mean by database specific?

For example, I always resize the column widths in the browser because the default usually truncates data in a way that I can't be sure what the field contains.

These new column sizes could be saved inside the database itself (in that special congifuration table).

When opening a database, sqlitebrowser could check for the existence of that table, and if the needed settings are there, use them, else revert to the default ones.

This configuration table could be used for all sorts of current or future database specific options, not only column sizes.  For example, it could even save the contents of the 'Execute SQL' tab to be remembered across sessions.

What do you think?
 I wasn't aware of that!  I'll give it a try, and report back if I have problems with it.  Thanks.

However, why does the project file have to be a separate file?  (For example, backing up databases now one has to remember to take along all those extra files.)

One of the great things about SQLite3 is that all you need in relation to the database is contained in the same single file.
 Regarding the way this works now, an immediate issue I see is that the related project is not automatically loaded upon loading the database.  I would expect if I load xxx.db that xxx.sqbpro (or xxx.db.sqbpro) would also be loaded to save typing / operator steps.

Even if I tell it to load xxx.db.sqlbpro it works as far as loading the database, but again the settings are not automatically applied.  (Unless, it actually ignores the .sqlbpro final part, and simply loads xxx.db)

A second issue, when I try to save the project, it defaults to the name of the database itself including the extension.  So, one has to manually edit the filename.  I don't like my filenames to have double extensions (e.g., xxx.db.sqbpro).

(This is all under Windows, in case it matters.)
  A little off-topic regarding this PR, but, does this project have a coding style? I noticed that you put the brackets on the same line (I personally prefer this too), while in the rest of the project they are on a separate line. I think it would be a good idea to stick with a single coding style throughout the entire project. What do you think? Maybe we ca discuss this in more depth in #602.
 I personally indent the `case`s :smile:
 My question wasn't necessarily about this PR, it was about the whole project and the future PRs. But it was just an idea :smile:
  Nice work with your c++! You're on the pathway to make sqlitebrowser is more superior. 
  mxe uses gcc 4.9.3, which should support most if not all c++11 features, so shouldn't be a problem here.

but qt5 is a different story, last time I updated mxe i tried to use qt5, but I just couldn't do a static build, either they removed support for it or I made something wrong. but I'm afraid that a switch to qt5 whould require more work for nightlies.
 > I have no idea how well C++11 is supported on MSVC nor how to activate it.

It's even simpler on MSVC, it comes out-of-box.

> don't want to rush this.

IMO, there's really no need to rush this, but lots of boilerplate code could be optimized. What about Qt4 - it  just stinks as 11 year old stuff. It's just outdated, lots of stuff had been fixed and added/removed over this time. Upstream developers do it for a reason.

My suggestion is to start working on Qt5 in another branch, and continue distributing current(Qt4) version until Qt5 version is polished and perfect. More than that,  Qt5.7 is upcoming soon, in that version Qt devs introduce full vice versa C++11 support. More info [here](https://blog.qt.io/blog/2016/04/21/qt-5-7-beta-released/)
  **Edit**: [This is the solution](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/602#issuecomment-393322886).

The [`BUILDING.md`](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md) file mentions how to build this from the command line, but I would like to be able to do this from `Qt Creator`.

When using `make`, it correctly builds the app, and it looks like this on a MacBook Pro with Retina support:

<img width="1149" alt="screen shot 2016-05-22 at 13 26 44" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/15453498/f0860024-2020-11e6-93b2-74daadf4c06d.png">

but when I build from `Qt Creator`, it looks like this:

![screen shot 2016-05-22 at 13 27 16](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5748627/15453506/108af35c-2021-11e6-9990-769fd9317b4c.png)

the text and icons are blurry, and also I noticed that the drag handle to the left of the `New Database` button looks different too.

I'm also not able to `Run` it, just `Build` and then manually open the `.app`, because I get this error:

```

Another problem is that I can't manage to build with SQLCipher support. The `.md` file says to replace `any calls to cmake and qmake`, but doesn't specify in which files. Could this be done by creating a new `Build and Run Kit`?
 Sorry, I didn't have time to look into your wiki. I did manage to get it somewhat working after posting this issue.
1. One of the problems was that the `Qt Creator` project was not configured properly. Having absolute zero knowledge about it, I just "next, next, next"ed in the wizard popups. And, by default, it used a "project configuration kit" (if I recall correctly the name) using Qt 5.6. So I deleted it and somehow imported a kit from the project, which had the correct Qt 4.8.7.
   I currently don't have access to `Qt Creator`, but when I do and have time, I can provide detailed steps, exact labels and buttons names or screenshots for this.
   I now understood it a little better.
   This also fixed the retina problem.
2. I also managed to enable SQLCipher by adding that flag in the same "project configuration kit". Same remarks as above.
3. I'm not able to directly run the project though.

I installed `Qt Creator` using `.dmg`, not `brew`, if it helps. I did install `sqlcipher` using `brew` though.

Did you mean `remove` instead of `remote`?
Also, wouldn't that break OS X stuff?
 > Not 100% sure, but I don't think Homebrew has a formula for Qt Creator.

Oh, I think I said something stupid, I don't think `Qt Creator` is available on `brew`.
I think I meant `qt` alone. Is it only available on `brew`? I can't recall this, sorry for the confusion.

> For me that's workable

Or something like this.
 I am now receiving this error after removing sqlite:

Does [this](https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/34302) help you to help me solve the problem? :D I don't understand much.
 Well, I didn't remove anything else on purpose. But it seems I do have that file:

> But wait, what if you WANT Macport's libjpeg.dyld? Sorry, not possible unless you statically link your program to libjpeg.a. And since I've never done that before, I can't help you if you want to do that :(

Do you think it's ok?
 I managed to get it (finally) working by actually running all the command from [here](https://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macports-users/2010-November/022663.html), not only the jpeg one, but replaced `/opt/local/lib/lib*.dylib` with `/usr/local/lib/lib*.dylib`

This is my `brew list`:

```
/opt/local/lib ❯ brew list
autoconf    chisel      fontconfig  gmp     libpng      libusb      mackup      openssl     recode      unar

```

And, what do you mean by what program?! It's sqlitebrowser, of course 😆
 `brew remove jpeg --force; brew install jpeg` didn't work :( I wonder what could it break if I leave the Apple's symlinks in `/usr/local/bin`
 I don't think it was a problem of missing library. A symlink for `libJPEG.dylib` existed, but it pointed to a different file, which probably didn't have the `__cg_jpeg_resync_to_restart` symbol.

Here is my `otool -L` output:

```
sqlitebrowser.app/Contents/MacOS/sqlitebrowser:

```

Why doesn't it show the `libJPEG.dylib`?! I don't understand.
 Yeah, that makes sense though.

So, to make it clearer, I currently have the Apples `dylib`s symlinked in `usr/local/lib` and it's working (and I'm working to on a PR 😄). I can directly run sqlitebrowser from `Qt Creator` with the debugger attached. So it's all good now. I'll continue like this and see if this overwrite is causing problem somewhere else.
 From the `master` branch? I forked and cloned the project a couple of days ago, should I have the new executable name too? I have `sqlitebrowser.app` and `sqlitebrowser` inside of it.
 Nice name for the setup 😂.

It doesn't upset me. But I remember stumbling upon `DB Browser for SQLite.app` myself while in the trial and error period. And I'm wondering why isn't the project building with this new name too. I do want to have the latest commits.

Oh, I am 45 commits behind 😐. Need to search again on SO how to sync a fork 😂.
 Ooooh, I know what happened, I forked the project from the browser, but I already had a fork, so it just redirected to it, and I happily cloned it locally.

I don't think that works for a fork. I usually go over and over to [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository)
  I have the following schema .. when I click the add record button, I get an error that it failed with foreign key constraint -

```
 @justinclift sure. This issue annoys me aswell.
 I had the same problem when I clicked on new record I got the error message.

I am not an experienced coder but I thought that if the data entered into the fields were held in a buffer and the record would be written after all the fields have been entered into the buffer.  

any idea if a fix is imminent?

 Hi Justin,

I just tried the database again and got the same error.

keep on trying :-),  I’ll give it a try in a few days.

  After deleting a table, the `Delete Table` button remained active and if pressed, it tried to delete table `''`.
 Yaaay, my first sqlitebrowser PR and accepted PR :heart:
 Of course :smile:
 Sure thing, I do have some bugs which I didn't have time to address.

Also, is it a good practice to create a separate branch for every PR, right?
 Ok, thanks again!
  I'm using Windows OS and Qt 5.4.1 (but also happens in Qt 4.8.7 ... laptop here has 5.4.1 but work PC which has a newer build of SB has an older Qt...)
When modifying a table, there are checkboxes for primary key, not null, etc.  If these are double-clicked, text can be entered into the cell.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/15438228/09ab1a62-1ec3-11e6-98de-8685ce4c5b3c.png)

Obviously its only a cosmetic issue as the text is ignored, and I presume you don't want to bloat the code with 'cleanup' code on the off-chance some muppet will enter text, but didn't know if the table cell allowed editing, but disabled text entering for particular columns.
 Yes, the 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' can be entered by double clicking in the cell where the checkbox is.  Interestingly, when editing an existing table, because its a change in the row, the usual 'modify table' SQL process is run (but obviously ignored).
In the 'real world', I can't see anyone double-clicking in the cells, and if they did, they wouldn't enter text...
I presume its because the cell is empty and can contain checkboxes, rather than being solely a checkbox.  Again, on my Windows version, the column can be resized out, but cannot be resized back down to the original size ... as if it 'should' contain text...
 No-one would do it + and it has no bearing on the program + and entirely cosmetic = waste of time!
  Hello,

I downloaded windows nightly with date stamp of the 18th of May and noticed it's built with sqlite 3.12.0. The latest available version of sqlite3 is 3.13.0 but that was just released today. ;) The next most recent version is 3.12.2:
http://sqlite.org/changes.html

I believe 3.12.0 had such a serious issue Dr. Hipp removed it from being downloadable.

Can 3.12.2 or 3.13.0 be used in sqlitebrowser?

Thanks!
 Yes, I'll try this out with the 20th of May's build!
 Much better! Now it's a version 3.13.0!
  If I have multiple tables in a database, let's say they're called `[a-e]`, if I:
- mouse down on `a`
- mouse up on `a`
- quickly move the cursor over `d`

the selected table will be `d` instead of `a`.
 Sorry, the title is poorly worded. This happens in the `Browse Data` tab actually.

When I click the table `a`, it starts a loading process, but if I quickly move the cursor over the table `d` before the process completes or the dropdown closes, it finishes by showing the data of the table `d`.
 > so no chance to click on another one during the loading process

Not click, just hover.

I'm using OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 (15E65) and Qt Version 4.8.7.
  Summary about this patch:
1. One can duplicate record via:
   - context popup menu over the record in table 
   - shortcut Ctrl-" 
2. The very first _copied_ value in new row is focused. Primary keys are ignored.
3. Copied alues aren't written to db instantly until "Write changes"

In #577 there was suggestion to provide "duplicate field". I find this feature ambiguous tho, _especially_ for user. So much depends on which row is currently selected, which row should be copied where and so on. I guess, in this case one should really just Ctrl-C Ctrl-V. 
So, since original feature request was about duplicating _records_, this closes #577 . We can discuss better design for ditto field separately.
 @justinclift all right, I am looking forward to it.
 @MKleusberg I am not sure what view you are speaking about. 
 @innermous, I think that he's referring to [this](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createview.html).
 Patch updated.
Frankly, I wanna say 2 things about code. Firstly, it's sad not having C++11 support. Lots of boilerplate code could be avoided with use of lambdas to connect signals and slots. More than that, check [docs](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots.html), you are using outdated slot interface (I guess it's only for Qt4 support, which has dinged 7 years already IIRC).
 @justinclift everything is done as others requested. Why not closing issue?
 @justinclift okay, I guess we'll make browser even better together :ghost: 
 Cheers.
  Hi,

I really like the feature where you can export various tables in a database to a csv file as it's a quick way to get data out; however, exporting on a linux machine, the file is actually ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators.

That means the export inserts ^M at the end of the line:

```
trip_id,date,dayOfWeek,pickup_time,duration,distance,total,beginning_zip,ending_zip^M$
3b5a4966-f6ce-45e5-a659-448715344dbf,2016-04-18,monday,18:42,1036.8,3.17,6.7,89119,89109^M$
0915dd1f-86cc-440a-ae72-0f12ae0aaef1,2016-04-18,monday,19:05,816.0,3.35,6.31,89109,89109^M$
```

On anything other than windows, these ^M are annoying and difficult to deal with. Fortunately they're easily removed with a sed string. 

Can sqlitebrowser be updated to export to a strictly ASCII file?

You can observe the new line characters (^M) on linux with `cat -e file.csv`
 > @jungle-boogie Would you be ok to compile the latest master code, and verify the fix on Linux?

Wow, that was a super fast commit!

I built it successfully on my linux machine and I'll test it when I'm at home.
 Great job, @justinclift:

```

I'm happy with the results!
 Hi @justinclift,

I was watching the other thread and have recently tested the new changes. They look good and it's pretty nice you made a the other option so someone can make it whatever separator they want.
  Steps to reproduce this issue:
1. Open table with no records at all (or remove them all)
2. Press Ctrl+A
3. Press "Delete record"
4. Watch the world burn

```
ASSERT: "!isEmpty()" in file /usr/include/qt/QtCore/qlist.h, line 335
The program has unexpectedly finished.
```
  Hi everyone, just a feature request, not urgent at all: if could be possible to allow to change the font of the cell editor or to use directly an external editor (like notepad++ or notepad2-mod)

Great project and product, i keep my todo list ordered by the priority thanks to your efforts (portable version).
 Sorry for the delay. Version 3.8.0 . I checked the preferences and there is the font is adjustable for the sql editor or the cells in the table overview, but not in the cell editor itself.

Edit: if in the "cell editor" i switch to binary edit (or hexadecimal) the font that i choose also for the sql editor and for the table overview is applied as well. Only in the text editor mode it does not work.
 ditto.

The 'browse data' tab displays rows in a large font. No way that I can see to reduce it, though that would be desirable.
 I ended up taking a different route to my unreachable goal, old chap. I'm
currently stuck in a crevice. But I shall have a look when I get a chance.;)
  Not sure if there is already a method to do this but if not, then a feature request, to be able to filter records in the browser by NULL so one can see all records that have null in the respective column(s).  Currently, I haven't figured out how to filter records that have no value, other than using a direct SQL statement.

Thanks
 I sure am. I tried just now with the latest available download, and it does not work. Seems to work OK now (both the download and the =NULL).   yeah that's a good point.  How about something like #587 ?
  By using shell magic, you mean to compile the version inside the app, when building it?
 So, SQLCipher is bundled within the app the building for release only?
 I don't fully understand this. For development I had to `brew install sqlcipher`, so, isn't it possible for one user to have a version and one user another version?

Also, the runtime empty database was what I wanted to say next, though it looks a little bit hacky 😄. And it was asked [here](https://discuss.zetetic.net/t/how-to-retrieve-the-openssl-version-in-use-by-sqlcipher/466/2) already.
  sqlitebrowser freezes with 22Gb database file. I can open database, edit the pragmas, view structure, but sqlitebrowser freezes when I try to click on "Browse Data" tab and eats 100% CPU.
sqlite3 CLI client works with that DB file without any problem.

Database structure is:
CREATE TABLE `DATA` (
    `time`  TIMESTAMP,
    `one_get`   DOUBLE,
    `two_get`   DOUBLE,
    `three_get` DOUBLE,
    `four_get`  DOUBLE
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_time on DATA(time)

Ubuntu 14.04
sqlitebrowser 3.8.99
QT version 4.8.6
SQLite version 3.8.2
 > ram do you have in that computer

8Gb. By the way, ram leaks are not observed at the moment of freeze. There is CPU loading only.

> largest SQLite database file I've heard of someone using with this

We are using even bigger DB files from program written in c. It works like a charm.
 Thank you so much for your answers.

I have cloned and built yesterday's git master, because previously I had tried to use very old Ubuntu's version built from [launchpad.net](https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser) Seems, that it was the version 3.8.0. Result was similar for any versions - sqlitebrowser freezes.

Today morning I have built sqlitebrowser up to commit 484206b60c5f57ea8259031af67b3c0f28944e5 Fri May 6 01:23:15 2016 +0200

Unfortunately it did not fix my problem - sqlitebrowser still freezes immediately when "Browse Data" tab pressed.
 Now I know what had happened. Sqlitebrowser does not freeze. Every time when I clicked on "Browse Data" tab It had been waiting when following SQL request would finish execution:
SELECT COUNT(*_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `EURJPY` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);

Perhaps you have reasons to make this request so strange.

Of course it is not solve the issue, but I have made some experiments to get duration of similar requests to that big DB:

$ sqlite3 ./DATA.db 
SQLite version 3.8.2 2013-12-06 14:53:30
sqlite> .timer ON
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `EURJPY` ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
296000329
Run Time: real 340.013 user 136.504500 sys 18.499167

Screenshots are from today's nightly (having the JPEG plugin, see #579):
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2906988/14936787/704b756a-0ef5-11e6-8114-43b319ef97ca.png)
and latest 3.8.0 release:

Regardless of version or image format, sometimes it would be nice to check the binary data even if it's a known image. For example adding Image to that dropdown would be a nice solution.
 This would make it easier to check header bytes without needing to export and open the file in an external editor.
 Cool, thanks for the updates, I'll check it out.
  What is required to support JPEG in BLOB typed columns?

I see there's PNG and BMP, both huge files especially if you store stuff in DB (=you have many rows), what's the reason for no JPEG yet?

The JPEG encoder/decoder at http://www.ijg.org/ works nicely, I just integrated it myself in Java JNI few weeks ago.
 Windows 7 SP1 x64, and I can confirm that the nightly build handles the JPEG BLOBs and the latest release doesn't.

 Holy-moly I thought [this](https://github.com/justinclift/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Notes-for-compiling-on-Windows) was the full docs for that :) Sorry, but I don't have time right now, and I'm planning to update to Windows 10 soon, so you're probably better off setting up a VM.
  I'm just updating from 3.4.0 to 3.8.0 and notice that the current version has a lot of dll files and a `platforms` folder, would it be possible to build a single big exe file like before?
 Hmm, thanks, that's good to know, but it's not a full solution. It only works as long as you don't change your nightly toolchain, also it could be unstable at any time (have to be lucky to get the right nightly).

I personally would be willing to compromise x64 for a single file downloadable from the Releases page (without installer).

Note: I was really surprised when the portable app showed up as an installer...
 Brrr, reading those errors gives me the chills... well done! I'm so used to just executing `gradlew jar` and it does everything (dependencies, compilation, packaging); all I need pre-build is a JDK on PATH :wink:. I would've thought that the situation in the OSS world have changed over the last 10 years, but it's just more different compilers to accommodate and more make-like builders. :disappointed:

You can prioritize this low (if you have prios), it's just a nice to have. I like to have my arsenal of dev tools in one folder (less dirs to add to PATH).
  A 'ditto' function!  I second!  And don't forget keyboard fans (CTRL-" or something, like in some spreadsheets).

Actually, it'd be nice to have two 'ditto' functions.  One to copy just the cell above, and one to copy the whole row.  (OK, maybe the whole row can be done with the mouse only as one can repeat the keyboard way for each cell of interest.)
 @tonypdmtr are you sure Ctrl-" is common shortcut for that?
I picked up the task btw.
 Yes, Excel uses it, for one (see official link below).  The actual combination is CTRL together with a single quote (no SHIFT is needed to get the double quote) but it's referred to as CTRL-" (double-quote).  This is supposedly easy to remember as it resembles the '' (two short vertical bars) used for a 'ditto' notation.  Have a look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark and here: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Excel-shortcut-and-function-keys-1798d9d5-842a-42b8-9c99-9b7213f0040f (look down the page for the CTRL-'  single quote, and its description).  Actually, for Excel it works with both single and double-quote but in one case it copies the value and the other the formula.
 @tonypdmtr 
Thanks for explanation of Ctrl-", that was the thing I never knew.
What about UNIQUE fields? 
I am thinking about UX design of that feature. Should button be greyed out in those cases?
@justinclift how do you think, maybe this should be positioned near "Add record" and "Delete record" instead?
 The unique fields issue is irrelevant in the sense that the ditto operation simply copies the cell (or row) above to this one.  This is either an allowed thing or not.

What I mean is the operation is no different from someone trying to actually type in the respective field values.  This will be either allowed, or not.  How it displays an error is no different in either case.

Regarding the UI issue: (I'm a keyboard person so the CTRL-' covers me).  My idea about it, however, would be to have a right click on the row/field you want to copy and a popup window to give two options: 'Copy Row' and 'Copy Field'.  No special buttons.  What do you think?  This is actually more powerful than the keyboard shortcut in that you can 'ditto' any row/field, not just the one above.
 Just to add a couple more details of how I envision this:
1. CTRL-' (single quote) can be for cell/field copy, and CTRL-" (double quote) for row copy.  Easy to remember: One quote does less than two quotes.
2. Once the 'ditto' operation is complete, the cursor could automatically move to:

(a) the cell/field to the right, when a single cell/field is copied.  (If on last column, go to first column -- i.e., wrap around.)  This will allow repeated CTRL-' to very quickly copy multiple fields, even when not the whole row is needed.

-- or --

(b) the first cell/field, when a whole row is copied, to allow possible edits.

What do you think?
 @tonypdmtr you can ditto field one time. After that it's ambiguous where to ditto another field, cuz new row is already created.
IMO only ditto row matters.
 Ambiguous?  Ditto always works in relation to the field above.  So, wherever the cursor is, that's where (the column) you get your value from.

IMO, if you have to keep only one, then only ditto single field matters.  Because, it will never be the case that a new row is needed that has the exact same information for each and every column.  On the other hand, it's quite common to have the same values repeated for one or more columns in different rows.
 @tonypdmtr ow...
I thought this option should duplicate current row in the end of table... Now I see I imagined everything wrong, sorry.
I wish everyone could have same seeing of the problem  :confounded:
 @innermous You thought right except that it doesn't necessarily have to be the whole row.  If you also take into account the current column (where the cursor is, or mouse click happens), it's the same thing.  You just use both grid coordinates, not just the row, from where to get the source data.

Copying the whole row is convenient when someone wants to keep all but one or a few fields the same (happens less often).

Copying a single field is convenient when one wants to clone one or few fields only (happens more often).

Once the copy is done, the user will most certainly need to work on the fields that need to be different, so it'd be nice to stay on that new row and be allowed to continue editing as usual.
 @tonypdmtr u don't understand what mean. Everything you say is right. But real thing is, what happens when we have K rows and we ditto row N? There are 3 possible outcomes:
1. Some data from N (column or whole row whaaatever it doesn't matter now) is copied to K + 1
2. Data from N copies to N + 1 (following item)
3. Data from previous item (N - 1) dittos to N.
You see how ambiguous the whole thing is? We must consider which one of these we need, then we can proceed further to details and implementation.
 Let's make it simple then.

You press 'New Record' in browser, and a new row appears ready to accept your data.
You position the cursor to some cell in that new row.
You do DITTO function.
The contents of the immediately above row for the same column is copied into the current cell as if typed in by hand.
Then, ideally, the cursor on the current (new record) row, moves to the next column.

This covers the keyboard way, at least.

Now, with the mouse you can be more creative.
Wherever you right-click the mouse, you copy the data from that row instead of the last one to the corresponding column in the new record.

Did I answer your question?
 @tonypdmtr well, at least I see whole picture now.
 I too got lost in this discussion. My initial feature request and actual use case scenario was to duplicate any table row, and, of course, every column value, except, unique fields.
 My use case was quite different from what @tonypdmtr sees.

This:

> Copying the whole row is convenient when someone wants to keep all but one or a few fields the same (happens less often).

was false in my case. I did want to copy an entire row multiple times, and only change 1-2 fields.
 Knowing the "A picture is worth a thousand words" idiom, here are some pictures to better explain myself:

Before:

 Correctly.
 @revolter Hmm. How exactly is what I said different from what you just said?  You say the same thing only worded differently.  (Unless you're referring to the 'happens less often' part. But this is a matter of opinion.)

 @tonypdmtr, I may have got it wrong, sorry. Not a native english​ speaker.​
 So ditto field always dittos current field into the very last record (created with "New record"), right? So it can be called for several fields.
 @justinclift was speaking about Ctrl-' (ditto single field). Everything is clear with ditto row.
 I have ditto row working, not sure implementation is good though.
Working on ditto field.
UPD: In my opinion, duplicate row should create new record with same data, rather than changing it for already created one with 'Add record'.
@tonypdmtr what you think about that? See the bright side of it:you can duplicate row several times with just pressing Ctrl-" several times, no 'Add record' step is needed anymore. I believe this use case appears much more often than that you described.
 @innermous I agree about the CTRL-" ('ditto' for row) that it appears to be simpler when done directly (i.e., without having to do Add Record first).

As for copying the same row several times by repeated CTRL-" presses, I would think that in most cases, it would be practically impossible.  A correctly designed database would not expect the exact same row to be repeated without any changes in (at least) one field.  So, some editing (automatic or manual) has to happen for each new record before going to the next one.  If the change is automatic (like an auto-increment field) then that's not an issue.  But I would think this to be the exception rather than the rule for most tables, which IMO would require manual changes.
 @tonypdmtr i'd stick to @revolter picture, cuz I understand this use case in the same way.
 @MKleusberg Sure thing :D
 @MKleusberg It's working great, thanks a lot @innermous!
  Updating from version 3.7.0 32-bit to 3.8.0 64-bit does not update the file handler registry in: 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Classes/Applications/sqlitebrowser.exe/shell/open/command

The path after update was still 'C:/Program Files (x86)/..' and should be 'C:/Program Files/..'

This breaks the "Open with" dialog such that it ignores your choice.
 It's exactly the same issue :)
 It should be taken care of during install-time.

This is essentially a limited scope version of #332, asking to always open the most recently installed version of SQLite.
  A proposed fix for this issue
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/498#issuecomment-214718575
 Can confirm that the nightly build works on OS X with Retina display.  I tested it on a Mac without retina display as well, no negative effects.

 😄 yeah, just an easy one liner. The process of finding out what to change gave me a chance to see how qt works, which I've never used before. It was pretty interesting, but not too complicated as the code, to my novice eye, is really clean and well organised (so is this app's).  As for what the future holds, I'm just gonna keep learning and programming, hey? 😀
 But I did notice that my professor always has to make some changes to the font size in class (prefs aren't saved because the machine boots from a master OS image on every reboot) so I was thinking about adding a "Presenter" mode checkbox or something to the preferences pane.  Might be a nifty little project for me to dabble in C++.  I won't make any pull requests until that branch is rock solid though.
 Regrettably, I have not.  I did research it, and found a commit stating a permanent fix had already been implemented in v2.8.1 that removes the need to disable bufferedDraw, though the compiled version does not seem to behave as such.  I think it should be brought to the maintainer's attention.
  I added column titles '_id' and 'data' to the end of the first row of a csv file (no data in any row) hoping to make the '_id' column the primary key after importing the file.

The 'PK' status does not stick when modifying the table, unless I fill the column with numbers first.

Adding the column manually works fine (and the column is filled with numbers - perfect).
 When modifying the table and the PK status doesn't stick, is the database reporting any error?  I presume the SQL log would show the commands sent and the errors (if any) returned?
 There are no errors shown in the log page.

However I think I have found the cause.

The file was created by saving from Excel so while there may be no data in the cells there are trailing commas on each row giving an 'empty' cell not a 'NULL' one. 

If I remove these commas the 'PK' status sticks and the column gets filled as expected.

Any chance of a "Add 'Primary Key' column" option in the csv import box?

Should I add a make separate request for this?
  I first encountered the custom option when selecting one of the other available options (hex, octal, round number, etc) on a colum, and then going back to "edit display format". I noticed my selection was not what I previously selected (hex, octal, round number, etc), but rather it was "custom". 
  Added package `sqlite-devel` as a requirement for CentOS, because when I was building sqlitebrowser-3.8.0 from source on my Centos 7, command `cmake .` throwed error: 

```
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
LIBSQLITE
    linked by target "sqlitebrowser" in directory /home/maxim/software/sqlitebrowser-3.8.0
```

Installing `sqlite-devel` from `base` repo fixed the problem.
  This patch allows to view result data from the _Execute SQL_ tab in the EditDialog.

This patch is lightweight and already useful to me - and hopefully other people

Ideally, I'd like to be able to edit the data too, but I couldn't get it to work, because when the user enters freeform SQL, it is nontrivial to determine what the underlying table is (see http://www.sqlite.org/sessions/lang_select.html).
 Ah. I think there is a double-click action missing, so I have to admit it is nonobvious:

To see what I am trying to accomplish:
- open a database
- enable _View -> Edit Cell_
- Go to _Execute SQL_ and enter a select statement suitable for your db.
- In the result table view, click on an item and watch the Edit Cell update the data.

I use this for a db that has lots of JSON blobs that I need to inspect.
 Yes, please.

Also, I'll look into adding a double click action so that the Edit Dialog opens when a cell is double clicked. That would make the new functionality much more discoverable.

(But not today, I'll look into it tomorrow)
 I added the double click action (much better).

But I can not reproduce your bug on my machine. In any case, I don't understand how I could have introduced that sort of bug - this pull request mostly only connects the edit dialog with the result table.

Can you reproduce your bug when browsing the table?
 Thanks for the quick thumbs-up (to both of you)

If you have suggestions regarding code style, do let me know and I will update the pull request
 Hi @MKleusberg: I've made the changes you suggested - thank you for your thorough review.

I'll look into the new slot for multiple SQL tabs this evening, but I'd prefer to open a new pull request for that.
  hopefully a passable attempt to add decimal support per
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/373#issuecomment-211025161

I re-organized the conversion list, too.
 %d is decimal!
  I had a database that threw up an error- 'database disk image is malformed', but DB Browser was able to export the tables to .SQL files.
However, when I created a new database and told DB Browser to import this SQL file, it told me , "Nope" - "Error importing data: Error in statement #1: cannot start a transaction within a transaction.
Aborting execution".

Indeed, the SQL's first command is 'Begin Transaction'...

I presume the import routine should say, 'if the first line is a begin transaction, then I'll do nothing, otherwise I'll add one...' 

Or do we have to delete the generated 'begin transaction' lines from the SQL before importing?

DB Browser: 3.8.0
OS: Windows 8.1 64bit
 It does, yes.  I was going to post that the 'executing sql...' dialog was stuck and didn't update, but its just doing it v..e..r..y slowly.  The .sql has 505,000 lines, and after 3 hours, its on 9%.  The import is going to take a while....
 No, it was a new database, so no indexes ... fresh empty database.
   If I'd know what the problem is ...
 Yes, now I've found the right position inside the TS file.
I removed the `<numerusform>`-lines there as both (singular and plural) have the same phrase. I'm not very familiar with Qt and TS files so therefore I can't imagine if this provoked the problem.
 The problems are occuring with the removed lines.
 @justinclift Just updated the project name, now everything should be ok.
 @justinclift I do not have any overview about this but when looking at newer translations (Turkish for example) there are about 2800 lines of content, whereas in the older ones there are only around 2100 lines.

 Sure. I'll take a look tomorrow or over the weekend

 Not helpful, but I don't get this issue, and happily open files on mapped drives.
I've had this before in other applications, depending on how the drive is mapped.  Or permissions.
Can you access the server in DB Browser via the UNC, eg, \\server\share ?
 The problem went away somehow and i am not sure what did it.

I have set DB4S to open SQLite files by default and when i double click on the database it opens and now that i try even with file > open it works.

It is as if making it the default program it got more permissions.

Yes i can/could open the share when it was not working.

We were setting up new computers recently and they would get this same error window just by trying to open that share before we added them to the proper group.
 It works for me now so if no one else has this problem must be my windows acting up.
Sure close the issue.

When I look at this picture, I don't know what to click, what will happen, and what I should do next. I assume others are in the same boat as me. I think it'd be a good idea to give some instructions that address these questions.
 Oh, whoops, I didn't see it on the right side. Thanks!
  Before last update I was able to set the application as a default application to open .sql files, and after I could not.
 I am sorry but no.
  Awesome. 
   According to [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/table-constraint.html), a foreign key constraint could include multiple columns separated by  a ','.

If I execute:

```
CREATE TABLE to_reference_multi
(
  id1 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  id2 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT Identifier1 PRIMARY KEY (id1, id2)
);

CREATE TABLE to_reference_single
(
  single_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT Identifier1 PRIMARY KEY (single_id)
);

CREATE TABLE test_reference
(
  id1 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  id2 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  id3 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT Identifier1 PRIMARY KEY (id1, id2, id3),
  CONSTRAINT fk_multi FOREIGN KEY (id1, id2) REFERENCES to_reference_multi (id1, id2),
  CONSTRAINT fk_single FOREIGN KEY (id3) REFERENCES to_reference_single (single_id)
);
```

The resulting test_reference table ignores fk_multi and looks like:

```
CREATE TABLE `test_reference` (
    `id1`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `id2`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `id3`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(id1,id2,id3),
    FOREIGN KEY(`id3`) REFERENCES `to_reference_single`(`single_id`)
);
```
 I can confirm FKs with multiple columns aren't completely ignored anymore. However, adding two FK constraints with multiple columns leads to only one mixed constraint.
I downloaded the nightly build from sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com and executed the same commands in the original post.
<details>
<summary>

The resulting test_reference table confirms that one constraint isn't ignored:</summary>



``` sql
CREATE TABLE `test_reference` (
    `id1`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `id2`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `id3`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(`id1`,`id2`,`id3`),
    FOREIGN KEY(`id3`) REFERENCES `to_reference_single`(`single_id`),
    FOREIGN KEY(`id1`,`id2`) REFERENCES `to_reference_multi`(`id1`,`id2`)
);
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>

To test two FK constraints with multiple columns I executed:</summary>



``` sql
CREATE TABLE table1
(
  id1 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  id2 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT Identifier1 PRIMARY KEY (id1, id2)
);

CREATE TABLE table2
(
  id3 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  id4 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT Identifier1 PRIMARY KEY (id3, id4)
);

CREATE TABLE test_reference
(
  id1 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  id2 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  id3 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  id4 INTEGER NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT Identifier1 PRIMARY KEY (id1, id2, id3),
  CONSTRAINT fk_multi1 FOREIGN KEY (id1, id2) REFERENCES table1 (id1, id2),
  CONSTRAINT fk_multi2 FOREIGN KEY (id3, id4) REFERENCES table2 (id3, id4)
);
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>

Resulting in a test_reference table with one mixed FK constraint as follows:</summary>



``` sql
CREATE TABLE `test_reference` (
    `id1`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `id2`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `id3`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `id4`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(`id1`,`id2`,`id3`),
    FOREIGN KEY(`id1`,`id2`) REFERENCES `table2`(`id3`,`id4`)
);
```

</details>
Of course, the rules aren't enforced unless I enable foreign keys. That's the expected behavior according to [sqlite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_enable) but a warning message might be useful.
 Windows 10 Home 64-bit - Version 1511 - Build 10586.545
sqlitebrowser version 3.9.99 - Qt version 4.8.7 - sqlite version 3.13.0
 It works! :smile:
Output for multiple FK constraints is as expected (I also tested a single constraint and it still works fine).

``` sql
CREATE TABLE `test_reference` (
    `id1`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `id2`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `id3`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `id4`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(`id1`,`id2`,`id3`),
    CONSTRAINT `fk_multi2` FOREIGN KEY(`id3`,`id4`) REFERENCES `table2`(`id3`,`id4`),
    CONSTRAINT `fk_multi1` FOREIGN KEY(`id1`,`id2`) REFERENCES `table1`(`id1`,`id2`)
);
```
  I found it so odd that I couldn't open simultaneous sqlite database, that I figured I better ask here before assuming thats true and continuing my search
 I would love to see multiple window support in this fine program.  Is there a feature request area somewhere?
 Thank you for the speedy reply and I can certainly understand there is a never-ending list of things to do (and that are more important).  Unfortunately I'm running on OSX which is not as friendly about multiple copies of a program running as Windows is.

I'll put my +1 on this feature and hope for the best!  Thanks for the consideration, too.
 I appreciate the extra info on an OSX work around.  I'll give it a try.
  Hi

It would be nice to add an option to only export to SQL the records and not the whole structure of the database ie : 
When using menu Export / To SQL add an option like 'Do not export Database/Tables Structure' in order to only have the "INSERT INTO" records in the SQL File.
This can allow exporting full data, make tables structure updates with a blank database, then import new records without having to delete all CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX records in the SQL File.

I'm sorry but I don't have sufficient skills to do it myself...

Thanks a lot.

Sorry if I made any mistake, English is not my mother tongue
 Hi Martin

I just tested the last nightly build.
It works perfectly like I expected!

Thanks a lot !   it'll let me save lot of time !

Just a comment : are the instructions in the out SQL : BEGIN TRANSACTION; and COMMIT; mandatory, since when we import an SQL file created by the Export function it throw an exception : cannot begin a transaction within a transaction ?
Sorry for the OffTopic .... If necessary I'll open a new issue.
Thanks for your reply
 Hi Justin

Sure I'm always interested.
No problem to test this option with my real data.
Let me know when the build is ready in order I test it.

Thanks a lot.
 Sorry,

I had to deal with my car's issues...
Do you have the exe only build..
because I use it as a portable version?
Thanks and please forgive me for the answer dealy..
 OK.
No problem.
i'll test it on an x64 Windows 7 VM with my real data...
 Hi,

I just tested functionnality.
Unfortunately, the message is always here.
I used the following sequence :
- File / Open database
  ******Open a freshly xreated database with empty tables
- File / Import / Database from SQL File
  *****\* Chose the exported SQL file with options : keep column names in
  INSERT INTO and Export data only
- At the question : would you create a new database...   -> answer No
  Then the error is : Error : cannot start a transaction within a transaction

Thanks and sorry for the delay...
 Hi all

I was in vacation till Aug 30th...
After that, had lot of work.

I downloaded stable version 3.9 and all features are in and works like a
charm !!!

Thanks a lot for these improvements... and sorry for my last response
time...
  I've a VB program reading in a CSV and creating the necessary database records, so sqlite is creating a -journal file and squidging this into the database as and when required.  However, if I open the database in DB Browser while this is going, it either doesn't read the database schema (no tables are shown) 
![2016-04-07 112037](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/14348191/cef0bada-fcb2-11e5-9a74-94b0c17e7f4b.jpg)

or (if it can grab a bit of the database in time) the number of records is screwy (but it has read the schema).

![2016-04-07 111223](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/14348136/7c2aecd0-fcb2-11e5-9c25-ab8717186a3e.jpg)

I assume this is 'by design' as the database file is being written to, and so the file can't be read.  However, I didn't know if it was possible to 'work around' (open the database read only?) 

I tend to work on other tables, or need to check on what fields I've added to a table, while another program is adding data.  I appreciate dabbling with a 'live' database is akin to sticking fingers in a live electrical socket, but I'm willing to accept the risk...  
Seeing 'no records' can be frustrating.  The obvious fix is to work on a copy of the database, but this can get messy.
 Thanks for the reply.  The current limitation isn't major ... a pain, but understandable.  I could move the whole database to SQL server, but prefer the 'lite' way of a simple database and only one DLL to distribute for programs.
I appreciate its not a simple fix, but I didn't know if simply opening in 'read only' (a bit like how Word does ... if it can't open the file for writing, it opens it read-only) would work ... but thats no different to creating a copy of the database and working on that.
  Hi

we are getting error when we open the DB. Error as follows

"sqllitebrowser.exe has stopped working"

please advise us how to work on this exe
 Hi Kumar,

I posted a similar issue yesterday, and it's been posted a few times before. I'm assuming you're using Windows 7-10?

Here are the previous threads: 
[Issue #552](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/552)
[Issue #543](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/543)
[Issue #495](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/495)

It appears this is a somewhat uncommon issue with no current fix. However, there is one current workaround using the Nightly Builds [Located here](http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/). Using the nightly build worked just fine for me and others. I hope this helps you move forward, and hopefully they are able to track to the cause of this crash soon!
  When on the "Browse Data" tab, clicking "New Record" immediately inserts a new row containing default values into the database.  This causes the validation logic to run against those defaults, even though it is reasonable for a client to want to edit the values prior to inserting them.  It would be preferable to create a new UI element upon pressing the "New Record" button, but defer the insert statement until:

1) the row is deselected by the client, or
2) enter is pressed when not editing a cell value, or
3) the client attempts to change the table being browsed

Upon any of these user-initiated actions, if validation fails, show a dialog explaining the error and re-select the offending row.  To continue, the user must either click "Delete Record" or fix the offending data.  This enhancement is hinted at from #294, #463, and #514.
 I double this and #463 , very irritating bug.
This would be so much easier if QSqlTableModel was used :cry: QEditStrategy::onRowChange could be a cure but...
  I just started using DB Browser for SQLite and each time I attempt to Create a new Database the program crashes with the error "sqlitebrowser.exe has stopped working..."

I'm using Windows 7 Profressional 64 bit, and I tried using both the 3.8 and 3.7 builds with no luck. I also tried opening as administrator, still no luck.

Is there something I'm doing wrong? Is there a setup step I'm missing?

Thanks!
 Looks similar to [Issue #543](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/543)

And like the others, using the Nightly Build works with no issues.
 Sure @justinclift, it will probably be tomorrow before I have a chance, but I'll give you a shout once I do.
  The app's version number should be displayed in app's About Box and in Finder's GetInfo dialog.
 OK I uploaded two screen shots to my initial report above. In doing so I discovered that I had been using the your version from Jan 2015 which doesn't show the version info in either the AboutBox nor Finder GetInfo, as reported.
However I then downloaded the latest version which does now show the version in the About Box, however the version info is still NOT displayed in the Version field of Finder GetInfo. Cheers, Joe 
 I uploaded the screen shots again here.... The About Box shot is from the Jan '15 version, and doesn't show the version but the latest build now does. The Finder GetInfo only shows the app name but no version info.

  I am using SQLite browser to store data I have saved text data successfully but can't set or save the image in that. What do I need to do to save the image in SQLite browser? Please help me out. 
 I am using import button but it's not working. I need to store lots of images. Is there any way available ?
 I am using the latest version. Just drag and drop is working but it is taking too much time to load the application when I run. Is there any other solution available ?
 I want to just fetch the stored data (Images and text) from the SQLite database into my ios application.

I am having a large number of data to be stored in the database. I have saved some images with drag and drop option but it is taking too much time to load the app in simulator. I need a soultion for saving the images and fetching it from SQLite database.
  The export SQL dialog has no option to select or de-select all. I ran into this issue when I wanted to export a subset of a very large database of about 70 tables, so I've added the two self-explanatory buttons.

I think another good improvement would be support for shift-clicking to select a range of tables, which I can also implement.
  When in the 'Execute SQL' tab and entering SQL into the window, when I press the 'Execute current line', the SQL from the cursor downwards is executed, which isn't 'the current line'.  (am using Windows 3.7.0 ... also same behaviour in 3.8.0)
Unsure if this is 'by design' (kind of makes sense if you split SQL over several lines and want all those lines executed, eg half-way in the window...) but isn't quite 'what the button says will happen'. 
 Thanks.  I noticed that highlighting SQL and pressing F5 only executes the highlighted commands.  This seems an 'undocumented feature' ... unless its standard in other sql systems.  It gets around the above issue though... albeit a bit long-winded sometimes...
  Hi 
I just installed the latest version of sqllite browser on my 64 bit windows 10 PC.
The sqllite browser opens and when i click on new databases, the application crashes.
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2013 is also installed on my PC.
Can any of you please provide me with a solution for this problem?
 Try execute in compatibility mode.
 Hi,
I have selected the compatibility mode and tried in both win 8 and win 7 mode .... but still its not working.
 Installing the nightly build version worked for me.
Thanks lawrence 
 Just as a 'fix' (which isn't a fix...) but as 'new database' always opens in a 'random' directory\* (or at least not where I want the database) I open an Explorer window and create a new file where I want it, call it 'xyz.sdb' and then double click this file.  This opens DB Browser with this file, and I can create tables as required.  DB Browser happily opens zero byte (empty) files.

*OK, not random, but not always the directory the last database was opened either.
  Wondering if there Is there a limit on the number of records imported? 
Querying the new imported table to count the row also returns a row count of 40001.
 How certain are you that there are 42224 records? Is it possible there are extra line breaks, blank lines, etc? Can you share your .csv file?
 ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17833200/14290322/7ce830a4-fb56-11e5-96e8-6639da68e753.png)

I've managed to isolate the problem, and I believe it is a bug...
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17833200/14290602/87bc8998-fb57-11e5-9ce3-be5975079fa5.png)

In one of the fields being imported called Summary, is from a system that users have typed in a summary of an issue or problem raised in system testing, , and when the numpty users type some thing like

Exception raised in 'Ease of Use" API when blah blah etc has been done.....

In this instance, the user has opened Ease of Use with a single quote ' , but has close off with a double quote " . It appears the file import isn't escaping these properly. And then eats up all the characters across multiple rows, until there is another occurrence of this unmatched quoting! - which also occurred in the data dump I was using.
I proved the issue by 1) Exporting the newly imported  table back out as sql, into a text file, and could see multiple rows rolled up in one insert. and 2), Removing all the single & double quote characters from the data that was being imported, after which the row count corrected displayed 42224 rows as shown on the browse data tab in the GUI.

Regards, AL.
Great app BTW, it has helped me implement some data analysis code in excel, using the DB Browser as a tool to get data into a db. Hope this helps.
  When copying a single cell (CTRL-C) that contains multi-line text, and then pasting it (CTRL-V) on another single cell, each line from the multi-line text fills another row of the table in the database.

This is totally wrong behavior.
 But it already works correctly when multiple (multi-line) source cells are copy-pasted,  So, why have a different behavior for the single source cell in the first place?  To me this seems counter-productive.

There could be (like it is done in spreadsheets) a 'Special Copy' menu bar (e.g., Edit/SpecialCopy) option where the copy is performed in an alternate or user-defined way.

But don't you think the default behavior should be identical for either single or multi-cell source?
 IMO behavior we can see now is quite convenient. Definitely it should be kept as default one to avoid confusion of users that are used to it.
I think the best way to handle pending change would be "Multiline text copy" switch with "line per entry" and "all to one entry" values possible.
I would put it under View -> Preferences -> Data browser menu
 Agree, it will be better. 
Are you meaning some kind of radio setting in menu bar which will change behavior until switched to other option  or actually option for one time paste?

In first case if user will set option to all-to-one, pasting of multiline text will always lead to adding of one field per paste, while in second case it will only paste one entry for multiline text if user will click, let's say, Edit -> Paste -> Buffer to one entry. 

Also, I'm confident setting name should be about pasting data, not copying. And it might be good to use Ctrl+v for entry-per-line paste and Ctrl+Shift+v for all-text-to-one (as in other programs, where Ctrl+V used for formatted input, while Ctrl+Shift+V for plain text entry)
 But what about Mac OS users? Do they have menu bar? Have asked two people and they gave me different answers 
  Lets have table like this:
CREATE TABLE "Foo" (
    `Id`    INTEGER,
    `Name`  TEXT NOT NULL,
    `Bar`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `Baz`   TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY(Id),
    UNIQUE (`Bar`, `Baz`)
);

If you edit it within the app, unique constraint is not read from the DB and after edit it is gone completely.
 Ah sry :)
Its with 3.8.0 on Fedora 23 x86_64
 Hi, I've tested it with the current master and it seems to work. Thanks!
  I'm running Version 2.0b1 on Linux Mint 17.3 XFCE.
If I try to set an alternative location it shows it in the text box and I click OK. The config file (SQLite Database Browser 2.conf) is saved in ~/.config/sqlitebrowser.sf.net. But when I try to open a database it goes straight to my home folder. 

When I go back to Preferences it now has my home folder shown

[db]
defaultencoding=UTF8
defaultnewdata=NULL
defaultlocation=/home/xxxx/Data/xxx/Desktop/gps/
defaulttext=Plain

Is the preference file saved somewhere else ? 
 Hi
Thanks for quick response.
With a little trepidation I decided to compile as suggested.
Loaded dependencies, then ran as per website.
All worked OK.
Now have working version 3.8.0
Thanks a lot

  When writing SQL in the "Execute SQL" pane, the browser tries to suggest table names in a similar manner to IntelliSense in some IDEs. It interferes with my typing. I really hate this feature. How can I disable it?
  When in the browser tab, CTRL-UpArrow or CTRL-DnArrow currently behave (AFAIK) like simple Up/DnArrow except for moving the marker.

I propose these keyboard shortcuts be used instead for selecting previous next table/view (in the order these appear in the drop-down list above but order is not really of much importance).

This makes it very fast (for those of us who prefer the keyboard over the mouse) to change table/view.

Thank you.
 Seems OK.  Would it be possible to open a sqlite3 database hosted on a remote server (Azure to be specific), provided the connected using has the proper authorization?
 These are options I thought of:

a) connect to the remote location and run the sqlite3 command on the server.

b) I believe azure is windows hosting (although can be linux, I think) so that means you can install sqlitebrowser on that thing and open the db locally, right?

c) download the database and use sqlitebrowser to browse it locally.

But I agree with Justin, make a copy of the db and look at it, especially if it's still being written to and used.
 I use option a today, but I just found the sqlitebrowser yesterday and
thought it would be nice if I could connect directly from the client to the
remote DB file.  I did find an ODBC for sqlite that has promise.

_Thomas F. McGeehan V_  Hi, 
Really great product! The only issue I've come across so far is that when I import a csv that I exported from Excel, my data rows get reversed: 
![table_reversed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16559983/13459914/0b01b2b6-e045-11e5-8ec7-bf616931372c.jpg)

As you can see, I've added a column called "ID" and designated it as Primary Key. It matches the order of the data in the csv. Does the built-in rowid order matter? Am I in good shape as long as the PK order is correct?

Thanks again,
Matt
  My code is this

```
static void Main()
        {
            NewMethod();
            NewMethod1();
        }

        private static void NewMethod()
        {
            System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteConnection.CreateFile("test");
            SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder sb = new SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder();
            sb.DataSource = "test";
            sb.Version = 3;
            System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteConnection c = new System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteConnection(sb.ConnectionString);
            c.SetPassword( "123");
            c.Open();
            c.Close();
        }

        private static void NewMethod1()
        {
            SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder sb = new SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder();
            sb.DataSource = "test";
            sb.Password = "hjk";
            sb.Version = 3;
            System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteConnection c = new System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteConnection(sb.ConnectionString);
            c.Open();
        }
```

And i have no exception at end!
  I'm having difficulty adding a record when a check constraint is defined. I can provide a db example offline if anyone can help me?
 I just came across a concrete example for this:

```
CREATE TABLE "AAA" (
    "FIELD" TEXT,
    CONSTRAINT "AAA-FIELD-EVEN_LENGTH_CHECK"
        CHECK(LENGTH("FIELD") % 2 = 0)
)
```

The fix for issue #505 seemed to fix some of these (check constraints with logical connectives such as AND/OR before that fix also exhibited this behavior), but the constraint parser clearly has some unresolved issues.  The above table prevents inserting new records (or browsing the data within it) in the April 3, 2016 nightly build.
  For previous versions, I can drag a sqlite file onto the app to open it. I find it inconvenience to use the open database button, and navigate to the file, since folders for  iOS simulator are difficult to locate. Hope this can be fixed in next version.
 @justinclift Thanks for the quick reply and looking into the issue.

I meant to drag and drop a .sqlite file on a running instance. In my case, drag-n-drop opens a Finder for me, but not automatically opens the sqlite file.
 By the way, my Mac OS version is 10.11.3. I have also tried to `brew install sqlitebrowser`, and it still doesn't work.
 Hi, jumping in here because of the "help wanted tag".

@inksword - please be more specific. "Opens a Finder" makes no sense, because Finder is an app that always runs. Do you mean "opens a Finder window"? And where do you drag the sqlite file, exactly? Onto the Dock icon, or onto the application icon inside a Finder window (in the first msg you mentioned the app, but I like to double check with you).

(Similarly, @justinclift, you cannot really drop a file onto an instance because an instance is not a GUI element. Did you mean to have dropped the file onto the app's open window or did you mean its Dock icon?)

Also, which version are you using? ... Oh crap, the OSX app does not even show a version in the Get Info window. That should be fixed (I guess the Qt system is responsible for missing out on that?) Anyway, my About window shows 3.8.99 for me, and there D&D works on 10.11.3 for me.

Please try one thing: Create a copy of a db file, and rename it so that it ends in .db instead of .sqlite. Can you drag that file onto the app icon then?
 Oh, BTW, the way the file extensions are declared in the Info.plist do not seem to be correct because the "Open With" operation on a .sqlite file does not offer the app as it should. I may be able to help fixing this but that would that you'd be able to make custom edits / additions to the Info.plist and not depend on Qt(?) auto-generating everything (what it's currently putting in there is rather outdated and not fully correct, IMO). Can you do that? I am not a fan of Qt and thus have no installation to try myself.
 OK, let's see what @inksword finds out. Happy to help.
 @tempelmann 
Great! It works if I drop the file onto the app icon in either the dock or the Applications directory. However, it doesn't work if I D&D the file on the GUI window. Here are the answers for your previous questions, FYI:
- I am actually D&D on the app's GUI window
- My sqlitebrowser version is 3.8.0, Qt version is 4.8.7, SQLite version 3.9.2
- I created a test.db with sqlitebrowser, and D&D on the GUI window, and a finder window opened

D&D

The finder window actually points to the user's home folder.

 I guess @inksword is happy that he's found a work-around, so it's not an issue for him any more, and politely closed it. :smile: 
 Still don't understand, how it could happen that dragging a file over the app's window can lead to opening a window from the Finder.

The Finder can indeed open new windows during D&D, but only if you target a folder shown by the Finder, e.g. a folder icon on the desktop or in another Finder window, and when you then hover your dragged file for 2s over it (can be turned on/off in the Finder prefs, or at least used to be so).

However, if there's another app's window in front of the Finder target, this should not be happening.

Curious. But not really a big issue any more, I'd say.
  I could not input Chinese characters into the fields of the data browser. But copying and pasting works find.
I am wondering this is a bug or it is simply not supported yet? Thanks!
I am using version 3.8 on Ubuntu 14.04.
 May I take a look at it and submit a PR if I come up with a fix?
  I'm still using WinXP 64bit SP2.
There were no problems with SQLiteBrowser 3.7 Portable.
For ver.3.8 Portable, the
SQLiteDatabaseBrowserPortable\App\SQLiteDatabaseBrowser32\sqlitebrowser.exe
runs ok
while
SQLiteDatabaseBrowserPortable\App\SQLiteDatabaseBrowser64\sqlitebrowser.exe
windows doesn't recognize as a compatible application and doesn't start it.
Why are builders not using a compatible compiler???
  Bij modify a cell, the title of the screen is "Edit database cell".
This screen fly van center to the left top corner.

**Example:**
"5684 GM" --> "5684GM" --> no space inside string (screen center), next
"5684 WX" -->"5684WX" --> no space inside (screen left top), screen center, screen left to
en so on.
 -Open a Database.
-Browse Data (filled database).
-Double click on a cell (filled).
    A screen with the name "Edit database cell" is shown, position left top corner.
-Press now the button cancel.
Double press again on the same cell.
   The screen what is shown has now a different postion (centre)
Repeat this several times.
 Closing was a mistake

 I don't have Windows 7.
 @justinclift Nope.
 @glawrence It's cool; I ended up just downloading the binaries.
 But it's not fixed?
 So it's not planned to support Qt 5.6?
  I have upgraded from 3.4.0 (win32) to 3.8.0(win64v2) and now DB Browser for SQLite is saying the database I have is invalid.
I have dropped down to 3.7.0(win64) and that opens the database fine.
 Hi, sorry for the delay.
I have been able to open the DB on Fedora 21 using a different version of SQLite 3.8.11.1
sqlite> .version
SQLite 3.8.11.1 2015-07-29 20:00:57 cf538e2783e468bbc25e7cb2a9ee64d3e0e80b2f
sqlite> 
  Ported over from this issue: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/428#issuecomment-147124785

Not sure if this is a bug or not, but the output panel font remains unchanged despite changing the **SQL Log Font Size**:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/121520/13150645/74d88c0c-d61b-11e5-814d-d98956c1b73f.png)

Is the output pane _the_ considered the "log"? if not, then obviously it's not a bug. But would love to have the option to configure it.

The other perhaps orthogonal suggestion is that the output pane have some kind of visual cue to show that something has happened when a query executes. Even as a moderate "power" user of SQL and of DB Browser, I sometimes forget I have to look down there to see if my query had an error or if I just wrote a query that returned a nonsensical empty set (it varies depending on which monitor I'm using and how large the editor is currently stretched out to...). 

A cue that an **error** happened would be especially useful. Not for people like me, but perhaps for the Excel-to-SQLite users who are used to have Alert Boxes thrown in their faces when an error happens. But don't make it an alert box...a little red highlight around the output pane (or error text) is good enough :)
  v. 3.8.0 for Windows (64 bit)
1. Create new sqlite database.
2. When prompted to create table, hit cancel.
3. Go to File > Import > Table from CSV file...
4. Select a CSV file where the column names are in the first row.
5. Check option for "Column names in first line".
6. Click "OK".

Table will be created but the column names will still be in the first row. Columns will be named "field[n]...". 

Perhaps this is intentional but most other db GUIs I've worked with would take that first row and name the columns based on the text in that column's cell. That's the expectation I have when I select that option. If I don't select that option, I still get the column names in one of the rows but I now get a blank line above that row at row #1.
 I've followed those same exact steps and could not re-create this bug. The columns are named as expected. Is there anything else you did not mention in your test case? (Using windows 7 x64)
 I forgot to post back a follow-up. The problem wasn't with the sqlitebrowser, it is with the CSV. If the tool that generates the file has white space before your first row, probably a line break, then you get the effect mentioned. 
  I'm using 3.8 on Windows 10. When I am entering text in a cell I press the Enter key to save the cell/row. In 3.7 that simply did what I expected. It saved the changes. But in 3.8 it saves the changes then pops up the cell editor window, but the contents of the editor are the old value of the cell BEFORE my last entry change. I have to remember hit Esc or Cancel the dialog each time. This is unexpected and confusing behavior, and causes extra steps and potential data loss. I don't mind that the Enter key pops up the cell editor window, but only when I was NOT editing a field. Popping up the editor dialog should be the behavior only when I am navigating cells. And if/when it does pop up it must contain the latest version of the cell, not some previous version.
 I'm getting this too, on Windows 7. I notice it when attempting in-place editing.
 @MKleusberg: that seems to be fine! Thanks for the suggestion (which I should have thought of myself).

Might I suggest that rolling this change into a production release be given some priority, because the status quo gives the appearance of data loss, and could conceivably result in same if the user doesn't work around the problem correctly.

I'm glad I created a github account for this issue. :)
 I have verified that this is fixed in the nightly builds. I look forward to the 3.9 release.
  I don't like how the name is just 'sqlitebrowser.app', so i always rename it to be SQLite Browser, is there a way to modify the build scripts so it has a prettier name by default? =) 
 maybe it needs to be escaped? "SQLite\ Browser.app" ? 
  Version 3.8.0
Qt Version 4.8.7
SQLite Version 3.9.2

2.8 MB database file (3 tables, 5 views, 3 indexes) is taking several minutes to open.  Once finally open, any operations are taking a very long time, often leading to a freeze which requires the application to be force quit.
 Wow, huge difference with the version I just built from the prebuilt one. Not only are the issues noted above gone, but overall the application is significantly more performant.
  Has there been any thought to using an update installer? This way users can just press "Install & Restart" instead of having to go to the GitHub & re-download.

One that comes to mind for Mac OS X is this: https://sparkle-project.org/
 My apologies - my issue search somehow didn't turn that issue up!

I'm afraid I don't have enough time or experience with OS X (only Swift for iOS) to get it working at the moment.

But in the plot I can only select 'timestamp' and 'M1'.  'M2' is not available presumably because there are NULL values present in that column.

Is it possible to add a feature to have this column available also in the plot, and draw previous value or Nothing (plot with holes) when NULL values are present in the query result?

Best regards
Carl.

 Hi Justin, how can I make use of and test the nightly builds for Windows64 if I sit on a sqlitebrowser **portable app** version and have no administer priviledges?

Regards
 Ralf
 Great! I checked this before but was'nt successful. But you encouraged me to hang on. And in addition to your hints, for me I needed to replace (update) the platforms directory in addition to the files mentioned by you.
...
Hm, as I see by now, you already mentioned the platforms directory by yourself.

Wiki is a good idea, cause next time I like to use a nightly, I will not remember what I've just learned here ;-)

Well, thanx 
 Ralf  Hello,

in attached database, i perform the attached query. 

[test_db.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/121597/test_db.zip)
  The fix is working with this build http://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/win64/sqlitebrowser-win64-issue639v2-201607131125.exe but not with this one http://sqlitebrowser.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser.exe.zip
 I tried the latest nightly build just now, and still the same problem.
 Windows 7 SP1 (64-bit).
 I don't think it is DB4S fault though. It could be a library problem. Cause after I reverted back to official version (3.8.0), show rowid is now working correctly.

To make it more clear, I was using the official version (3.8.0) and I had both problems (crashing, and not refreshing rowid). Then I uninstalled it, and installed the one @justinclift made in the the "win64-onceoffs" folder, and it fixed both. He told me to test the nightly build, and this build fixed the crash bug only. Then I uninstalled this "onceoff" version, and went back to the official one (3.8.0) and it is showing rowid correctly now.

 True. But to be honest, it could be also something on my PC. Anyway, I'm using the version you made and it is working fine. I will just wait for the next release (3.9.0) and see how it goes. Thanks @justinclift and @revolter for your help. :+1: 
 I can confirm Karim:

  I'd like to be able to go direct into the 'Browse Data' tab from the command line.  I.e. something like "sqlitebrowser --browse boat.db", if this isn't possible now then this is an enhancement request.

Also, is there anywhere to ask this sort of question, I'd prefer a mailing list but I guess a forum would do.  Twitter really doesn't seem a sane way to handle technical[ish] discussions.
 I have already suggested that the default tab on entry be the browser as it is the most likely place one wants to be in the majority of cases.  I don't even think an option should be needed.  Maybe the option should be there to go directly to one of the other tabs.
 That still doesn't help getting to a specific table, though I agree it does seem to be a sensible default.
 Right, and your suggestion only specified the db file, not the table.

Maybe you meant something like
sqlitebrowser some.db --browse sometable

Then, I would suggest, the browser again to be the default, and on the command line to simply say:
sqlitebrowser some.db -t sometable

(-t for table)
 Oops, yes, you're right.  I didn't make it clear that I want to go direct to a specific table.
 I agree an option is possibly the best approach.  (Preferably a command-line one, and a short one like -t to avoid typing too much all the time that specifies directly the table to browse.)

As for the 'intelligent' behavior I don't think it will actually work in practice because (for me, at least) most databases have more than one table/view, so I would end up back in the original (current) behavior, which I don't enjoy very much.  Unless, of course, it is in addition to having an option as described above.

So, if there is a single table, yes, go to browse that one table, but if there are more tables, check if the option says which one, else (no option) go to datastucture tab.

(BTW, why does opening a big table cause a delay?  Is the whole table read in all at once instead of pages as they are displayed -- you know with the LIMIT ... OFFSET clause?)

Thanks.

It would be useful to have the ability to specify somehow where to go
in the table, especially if it's a big one.  Default to 'last n
records' that fit on the page with 'last' meaning most recent.
 Excellent!  I have just built from the latest source and there it is, a -t option to specify the table to browse.  Thank you.  I was actually going to try and do it myself (that's why I got the source) but it's done already.
  In latest (last night's) build, whatever changes I make in the edit box are not accepted, either by CTRL-ENTER or pressing the OK button.  (The problem could have been introduced earlier because I haven't been updating on a daily basis for some time now.)
 The fix worked but it still has one minor issue.
When typing directly on the cell and pressing ENTER, the edit box does not update with the new value.
   I get an error when I try to modify the following table:

```
Sqlite parse error:  "line 5:72: unexpected token: NULL" ( "CREATE TABLE \"anime\" (\n\t`id`\tINTEGER,\n\t`name`\ttext NOT NULL,\n\t`type`\tTEXT NOT NULL,\n\t`ep_watched`\tinteger NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK(`ep_total` is NULL or `ep_watched` <= `ep_total`),\n\t`ep_total`\tinteger DEFAULT NULL,\n\t`status`\tTEXT NOT NULL,\n\t`date_started`\ttext DEFAULT NULL,\n\t`date_finished`\ttext DEFAULT NULL,\n\t`animedb_id`\tinteger NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n\t`anidb_id`\tINTEGER UNIQUE,\n\tPRIMARY KEY(id),\n\tFOREIGN KEY(`type`) REFERENCES anime_types ( type ) on delete restrict on update cascade,\n\tFOREIGN KEY(`status`) REFERENCES anime_statuses ( status ) on delete restrict on update cascade\n)" )
```

Here's a cleaned up version:

```
Sqlite parse error:  "line 5:72: unexpected token: NULL"

( "CREATE TABLE \"anime\" (
    `id`    INTEGER,
    `name`  text NOT NULL,
    `type`  TEXT NOT NULL,
    `ep_watched`    integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK(`ep_total` is NULL or `ep_watched` <= `ep_total`),
    `ep_total`  integer DEFAULT NULL,
    `status`    TEXT NOT NULL,
    `date_started`  text DEFAULT NULL,
    `date_finished` text DEFAULT NULL,
    `animedb_id`    integer NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    `anidb_id`  INTEGER UNIQUE,
    PRIMARY KEY(id),
    FOREIGN KEY(`type`) REFERENCES anime_types ( type ) on delete restrict on update cascade,
    FOREIGN KEY(`status`) REFERENCES anime_statuses ( status ) on delete restrict on update cascade
)" )
```
 Yep, looks like it's fixed.
  Version: 3.8.0
SQLite version: 3.9.2

In the "Execute SQL" tab, I can run:

```
select load_extension("path to extension");
select new_function(...)
```

but if the startup file has

```
select load_extension("path to extension");
```

then when attempting to run `new_function` I receive:

```
no such function: new_function: new_function(...);
```
 Furthermore, this startup file fails to modify the pragmas:

```
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```
 if the database is supplied to the command line, the startup file is executed, as expected. The startup file is only ignored when the database is opened via the GUI.
   Mac version 3.8.0. If I have a SQL Output with say 1,000 rows, clicking the top left corner of the window should select all records in the output window. In reality, it only selects the visible records (10 or so). 

A related bug is the scroll bar in the output window. I can't grab it and scroll to the bottom and thus shift-click the last row to easily work around this bug. I have to resort to shift + page down. This used to work in previous versions though.

Thanks for a great tool though.
 I would usually do one of two things which both worked. 

I would click the top left hand corner to select everything then command c to copy. 

If I didn't need everything I would click whichever columns I needed to select everything in that column(s). Then again command c to copy. Both approaches worked prior to the current version. 

All the best,
Chip.
 Hmmm….

I thought I would try the ole quit and restart. That fixed the issue. I usually keep sqlitebrowser open for a long time, sometimes even for days. But I checked and after a restart of the app, it’s fixed. Sorry for all the trouble.

Regards,

Chip.
  Hello Sqlitebrowser team!

I've been using Sqlite + SqliteBrowser to replace a very expensive only MongoDB service. It's been working great for me, but most of my work consists of 'dumping' data and retrieving it, without a lot of complex queries. Thus, I've been using @piskvorksky's SqliteDict (for python), which 'pickles' the values and stores them in the table. 

While I am not particularly connected to 'pickling', it would be really great if there were a 'decoding' of most common encodings in the fields. For example, one might dump entire ProtoBuf (google's)  objects into the database, and be able to see 'real-time' changes, as it is decoded by the viewer.

In a verry related note, would there be a possibility of creating an extension environment from other languages? I could write the extension I'm suggesting in Python, but would have a hard time in c++.

Thank you!
 Now that you mention, I might try to get my hands on trying to implement my request. The things that I learn, I'll document, it'll be useful as a foundation for other extension-makers.

I just need onee hint to get started. I'm trying to figure out the point between the query returning results, and the results being displayed, but have been unable to do so. Any idea what file/lines I should be looking at?

Somewhat related, perhaps it might be a good idea for someone more knowledgeable to add a little bit of documentation, if only in the header files, and at a file level? _That_ would definitely be a great first step towards starting a healthy extension environment.
  Hi Guys,

Tried a basic "sqlitebrowser-3.8.0-win64v2.exe /S", and "sqlitebrowser-3.8.0-win64v2.exe /?" to see if there where any options, but the installer just launched.

Cheers
 Hey @justinclift . I meant to post back before @rp did with the same info, and indeed I though I had tried this very option (see first post), as when I first checked I though I still saw all the install wizard dialogues relating to folders etc. However, running this again worked slightly differently second time round. 

Because I already had sqlitebrowser installed, I still saw prompts, firstly to ask if I want to uninstall the "old" (but same) version, then the uninstall wizard. However, the actual install did progress fine.

Not sure if it is possible to override the uninstall/upgrade dialogues as well? 
  Hi no Problem, I feel happy that finally there is progress. Well the fetch all button seems to work. 2 Points here: 1) maybe the fetch all button could be "highlighted" - or make visible - only in case, that it is of use, as to say, when the actually plotted data are actually limited? 2) when the fetch all data button is activated surely it tooks a while til all data are loaded and plotted - but I miss the "hour glass" here, to get informed that something really miraculouse is happening under the hood.

Ah, and unfortunately the original issue "Plot misses columns with NULL as first value" is still not affected by this patch.

But thanx for this first step
 Ralf

 Hello, I seem to have a fix for this issue.

It's my first time submitting code to a community project, so if this is the wrong channel, I am sorry.

I use sqlitebrowser in a course at my university, and noticed the problem.  The cause of this issue was the Scintilla Editor output being drawn to a buffer which as it seems was not being scaled correctly. (Source: http://scintilla-interest.narkive.com/Yb4Qbh9h/scintilla-gtk-on-retina-displays)

I managed to fix the issue by setting `bufferedDraw = false` in `EditView.cpp`, in the Scintilla library.  I'm unsure if modifying the bundled library is this is within this project's constraints though.  (The modification to the app.plist file does not affect rendering or buffering within Scintilla).

In my fork, I also made some other changes to the default font size, bumped from 8 to 13 in the editor, and up to 12 in the data view.  Perhaps we could add a menu item for "High DPI mode" or some such so it's not the default for people on machines that lack high dpi support?

The before/after images are at the top of this, including the unit tests, which all passed.  I do hope this can be added, as I've seen a couple of other people reporting this issue.

 That's awesome!  :smile:

I am working on the pull request, just going to try and squash my git commit history first, per the developer wiki.  For this commit, I'll just disable the `bufferedDraw`, so the rest of the settings stay the original defaults (they are more of a personal preference, and I wouldn't want to impose).

I'd be delighted to test out the nightlies for the next builds as well. :smile:

Cheers!
   sorry, wrong repository... -.-
  Upon selecting the open database button the program crashes after 3-4 seconds. It dosn't seem to matter weather or not I select a file/folder or not. The same thing happens when using file -> open or control + o. Im using windows 10 for home (64 bit). I have tried using the portable and 64 bit version but both experience this crash.
 Thank you, that has fixed it.
 Ok, if you need me to send any logs or anything then please let me know.
 Yes that is what I mean - no other information appears. Only the standard sqlitebrowser.exe has stopped working.
 Thanks, I'm afraid I'm currently away but will definitely try asap when I get back on the 26th August. Nice work guys!
 One above has fixed the issue for me and works perfectly - nice one :smile:

  I just discovered Sqlitebrowser. Many thanks for this project, very useful to rename fields !

Two years ago, I had to convert a mysql database to sqlite and it was difficult to find a free tool, so I wrote my own.
I think it is fairly good now and includes tables and data (of course !) indexes and Foreign Key constraints. I think you write in C, my script is written in Python, but it could give you the structure and the sql requests.

I thought it would be interesting to integrate in your program importing a mysql database.
You find the code here : https://github.com/Averell7/mysql2sqlite

Note I have also a sqlite to mysql, but it is much more limited, only tables and data, just because I am lazy and didn't need more...
  I'm use version 3.8.0 and if I want put a filter (for example C) it doesnt work.
I read https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Using-the-Filters but not work.
 Yes
![filterz](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5431180/12264103/1b1067dc-b913-11e5-9b56-9891bf44d742.png)
 I exit and then I enter to the application and now work.
I remember that I create the table, insert some records, write changes an then test filter and its not work. Maybe this was the problem.
  Is it possible to set to 0 this delay time (it's a bit annoying waiting the app refresh the list)?
Or create a preference item where insert the delay time...
 Sorry for the delay (busy time).
I just tryed and it works well.
But I noticed that app is very very slow if showing very large table (with or without the delay time)
  I am editing my sqlite database for Android application on OSX 10.11.2. I have both AndroidStudio and SQLiteBrowser (3.8.0) opened. My database is broken after hours of editing and saving on each change. There must be something in the backround chaning the database file, maybe AndroidStudio, or the AndroidVirtualMachine. Changes are partial - lots of fields are blanked. Please introduce backround file change detection. I have lost my hours of work two times already. SQLiteBrowser does not verify the written file, so I am writing into pure space and the results are lost. Please add database file verification.

 There is no concurrency problem. No other application have access to a database file. SQLiteBrowser 3.8.0 corrupts sqlite database files - it does not save what it show, it does corrupt database file!!!!! :-1: 
 I have local file. Simple case. At first I though that would be concurrent access problems. But then I rebooted with nothing else accessing the sqlite file. I was only editing it with SQLiteBrowser. For some reason it does not save data into database, and even worse it randomly blanks some fields..

What I did was to put some data into table cells, then save, then refresh view of that table by re-selecting it from the list, and some data was gone... sometimes data was on refresh but it was gone when I closed and reopened the file. I had to repeat until success, but finally I have switched to dbeaver.. :-(
 I have reviewed the source files and found no issues in concurrence with your problem too which I also  have been using this application for creating pre generated databases for mobile development and I have not had these same issues. From the sounds of your problem you may have a coding logic error. As justinclift has stated Android does have some issues that are related to using a pre generated database and thus it is at times best to programmatically generate it.
 Nope, I access only sqlite, modify database, store database, close database, open database that is already corrupted. Maybe that is dependency/libraries problem for a binary download. I am also using MacPorts tree for the rest of the OpenSource.. no clue :-)
 hello @justinclift, that database crop is not the case in my case, i am working on a file that is source for apk that is then copied to app data directory, so its one way operation.. but your notice is valuable thanks!! :-) yea hope so! =)

maybe concurrent access from AndroidStudio and SQLiteBrowser? is sqlite file modified anyhow on open? although its only read once a while to copy, maybe some race condition occurs.. it would be nice to make a md5 sum of the opened file and verify against external file change..?  Application crashed after I have entered id field that was already taken, then warning popped up, I pressen Esc, and application crashed.

 That did not happen every time, randomly.. but also I got database corruption very very often.

Does OSX package depends on any external libraries or everything is included? Maybe there is a conflict with MacPorts packages/libraries?
 Getting this on Windows 7 as well. A reliable way to reproduce this would be to create a database with the following without using the wizard. Just go straight to SQL input.

``` SQL
CREATE TABLE `SOME_names` (
    `id`    INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    `username`  TEXT UNIQUE
);
```

Then add a few records:

``` SQL
INSERT INTO SOME_names (username) VALUES
('Billybob'),
('SuzyQ'),
('Janey');
```

Now using the Add Record button for that table, try to input 'SuzyQ' again. It will throw an error detecting that SuzyQ already exists, but once you click 'OK' then try to head back to the main app. Here it crashes and burns.

The only common thing I see here is that @cederom and I are both using underscores. While I suspect that shouldn't affect things, I still wonder if it has any play.
 No problem @justinclift, the only thing with crashing it on Win7 is that it doesn't generate a crash report for you guys. If it does, I don't know where to look for it.
 Able to verify on both Win 10 and OS X 10.10, but only for the most recent release version (3.8.0), and not for the nightly build from Apr-23-2016. It seems to have been fixed in the meantime.

I used the examples by Lech above to verify. The only way I could get it to reproduce was to press enter after adding an already existing row. Warning dialog appeared and could be closed normally, if simply clicking elsewhere (outside of cell being edited) to remove focus and end editing. 

The 3.8.0 version seems to be popping up a new window "Edit database cell" for detailed editing a lot more often than the nightly (Can't tell if maybe every time I end edit with enter?) If that may have been/might be relevant? Adding a duplicate row from the detailed edit window doesn't seem to cause the crash either.

Nice app, btw :)
 TANK U 👍 
 Sorry for the late response, I just tested my example against a 3.8.99 nightly under Windows 10 Pro and it appears to be behaving itself fresh out of the box.  :+1:  Thanks!

Also thanks to @MKleusberg with a work-around for 3.8.0 until the next stable version is available. :smiley: 
   Sorry,  this was in error.
  @justinclift It looks like I ended up implementing this 😄 Could you take a look at it? It was so hard for me to implement this fairly simple feature. But I'm understanding Qt and the project structure more and more ❤️.
  When searching, the list of found items appears in the grid below.

Pressing down arrow (while still in the search box) highlights row number but not the whole cell (as if when clicked).  Pressing right arrow (or TAB) does not go to the cell, either.

Pressing ESC, when in the result grid, could go back up to the search box to let one type another search.  Now it does nothing.

Thanks.
 No, I just noticed this.  It's not a bug, rather a 'polishing' of the UI for easier use by keyboard.
  Greetings everyone,
My goal is to re-compile sqlitebrowser for Windows with the support to open encrypted database. I downloaded the source code and already "scan" the support you insert in source (#ifdef ENABLE_SQLCIPHER)
I have Qt 5.4 & sqlcipher (binary & almagation files - license trial from Zetetic, and source code avaible ofc), but I dont know which steps to follow to attach sqlcipher with sqlitebrowser.
For now I did:
qmake CONFIG+=sqlcipher
make

But it gives me this error (which I though do not related much on sqlcipher...):

Do you have any ideas what is gone wrong? Is there anything I miss in the configuration steps?

Thanks a lot for any helps,
Best regards,

Huy Cong Vu
 Hi guys, 
Sorry for duplicate posts in here and your private mail @justinclift, I guess we should discuss here from now on, It'll be easier for both of us :)
 Yes indeed, I usually compile my other Qt projects with mingw32 and this configuration and it works fine. 
This error showned up when I tried to compile antlr lib. I'm not sure that it depends on string_s.h (which is standard) from other packages or not.
 I'll try with cmake then. 
Following this link, I must have MXE to compile? I had msys2 already https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md#cross-compiling-for-windows

And then in the cmake file, I find some absolute path for the libs, which means that I have to set it to the right path on my system?
"
if(WIN32 AND MSVC)
    if(CMAKE_CL_64)
        set(QT5_PATH "E:/Qt64/Qt5.5.1/5.5/msvc2013_64")
        set(SQLITE3_PATH "E:/libs/sqlite3_x64")
        set(OPENSSL_PATH "E:/libs/openssl-1.0.2a-x64_86-win64")

 Oh wrong call, it is a cross-compiling for Windows from Linux, won't work with me then :(
So if I stay in Windows and use cmake (with mingw) is it still possible?
 I'm trying to build with MingW 32 bits without success for now. 
When I ran cmake -Dsqlcipher, it gives me this error:

-- Could NOT find Antlr2 (missing:  ANTLR2_LIBRARIES ANTLR2_INCLUDE_DIRS)
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
LIBSQLITE

Eventhough I already add the path to my sqlcipher lib files:

find_library(LIBSQLITE ${LIBSQLITE_NAME} HINTS /local32/dst/sqlcipher/lib)
set(ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_PATHS ${ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_PATHS} /local32/dst/sqlcipher/include)

I had libsqlcipher.a & libsqlcipher.la in lib directory (build from sqlcipher source with same MingW 32 tools). I wonder is these 2 files the CMake are looking for?

2nd questions: I must set these variables to the path of sources or binary?
SQLITE3_PATH 
OPENSSL_PATH 
 I bypass the error when run "cmake -Dsqlcipher=1" when force link library to a pre-compiled sqlite3.dll. However, when I run "make", the same error that I had in the 1st post with qmake is reproduced, and I still have no idea why...
 Finally, I manage to compile with MSVC compiler & Visual studio + sqlcipher lib precompiled, it seems that it won't work without MSVC compiler. I now have sqlcipher browser works perfectly.
Thanks a lot for all your helps! :)
 Hi @glawrence 

I would love to contribute for your community. But I don't know what to write much about, it's pretty straightforward in fact. I just hesitated to choose the build tools (qmake or cmake, gcc or MSVC...)

So my build set is : MSVC + cmake, in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013

 In general you guys all setup already all .vcproj file, config & build step. All that I have to modify is the paths to dependancies (sqlcipher, Qt for MSVC 32 bits) in CMakeLists.txt file (which for now is not generic, but point to local path of your build, I think for the future you can setup some find[Package] with CMake for those dependancies). 

The roughest part must be figuring out which sqlcipher .dll I have to link with, because I have differents builds from differents sources, but I choosed a C/C++ DLL for Windows pre-compiled that I order a trial from SQLCipher main site web.

Rather than make the package generic, I just modify it to make it work on my local build. I don't know if it's useful to improve your work?
 > Does anyone know where to set that?

You set this in cmake-gui by selecting a 64 bit generator. All 64 bit generators for Visual Studio will have Win64 at the end.

> So, I'm unsure where it's getting x86 from. ???

The default generator is 32 bit
 BTW, You can also set the generator on the command line via cmake -G "generator" 

cmake --help 

will list the options.
 just tried no luck
  To reproduce:

Type some SELECT into the SQL and execute it (BTW, CTRL-ENTER does not work for that, only F5 -- this is another issue).

The result will show up in a grid box, but going to the cells will not update the Edit Box (even though in read-only mode just like a View)
 Still does not work with the keyboard -- moving from cell to cell does not update the edit box.  It only with mouse clicks.

The CTRL-ENTER issue is OK.

(BTW, what happened to the statically built daily releases?) Well, I didn't say it should be editable.  However, the reason IMO you need the read-only edit box is because long cell contents are easier to read that way, rather than directly from the grid cell. Indeed, now ENTER is needed all the time for **both** keyboard and mouse.  (This feels awkward to me.  It's certainly worse for mouse users as they now have to use both mouse and keyboard.)

I'm not sure of the previous mouse behavior but didn't it update the edit box with each mouse click?  If so, then perhaps the mouse click event could be 'manually' called whenever the grid cell is changed by keyboard, no?  (I suppose there is some way to detect that, I don't know QT.)

Regarding multi-selection, the edit box should always show the most recently accessed grid cell contents.  Using 3.8.0, and the nightly build from 6 Jan.
When you add data via the 'browse data' table, when you press Enter to confirm data in a cell (or add new data) the 'edit database cell' window appears.  This didn't occur in 3.7.0.
If you add new data into a cell (eg, 'test') and press Enter to confirm this data, the 'edit database cell' window appears, but it is also blank.  Pressing Cancel closes the window, and the original data entered is correctly stored in the cell.
Additionally, updating the contents of a cell and pressing Enter displays the 'edit database cell' window, but this window has the original data in it.  Clicking OK on this erronous data is actually ignored - the edited data is saved.
 No, 'View' -> 'Edit Cell' has the same error, but the dialog doesn't appear.  Focus is changed though...
Now if a cell contains 'test' and I overwrite it with 'test2', and press Enter, 'test2' is saved to the cell, but 'test' appears in the window underneath.  The dialog doesn't appear though.
 Additionally, the 'Edit Cell' pane at the bottom is labelled 'Edit &cell'...
Excellent - thanks for assigning it - much appreciated.
 Hi.  Yes, annoying bug.  Ship please! :)
 thanks @justinclift, I prefer to wait for the next official release.  I think it was the only\last open thing for the 3.9 milestone. :)
 @justinclift  Finally, i'll accept your offer to provide the version with this commit. :)
 lol... caved in at last.... ;)
  So, here I am again :)

Previous version of the program issued standard confirmation message, query executed successfully..

now i get "not an error: "

guess that means a-ok?

basically the query was:
drop view blahblah;
create view blahblah as ....
  I have a database I was just working with an older version and now the new version crashes when opening the same database.

I can open the file in 3.5.1 but not this new version

Here is the db file for review
http://www.thetazzbot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kodioke100.db_.zip
 Mac OSX El Capitan
 Yes that opened it just fine.

Thanks.. The point of this excercise was to hopefully have a feature where
I could copy the VIEW creation statements... alas that is not the case.

Now off to google to figure out how to do that...
 Sure!
 Verified it works without crashing
 Still happening for me under El Capitan. Sample database which causes freeze on open every time: http://pawky.net/df.db

DB created with http://peewee.readthedocs.org/. Peewee can work with the DB without issue, but even schema-only (no data) fails to open in Sqlite Browser.
 Good news for you - Sqlite Browser isn't to blame.
Bad news - Finder's QuickLook feature is. If I toggle the file open dialogue window to a non-column mode (which means no file contents preview), I can open the file without issue.
  Some times, for a db pulled out of an Android app, it shows this error, while the file can be opened using other sqlite editors on the device (eg. SQLite Editor (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.SQLEditor&hl=en) ) 

[com.shygunsys.mu.cyberMobile.zip](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/files/76168/com.shygunsys.mu.cyberMobile.zip)
 thanks, so it't not this apps bug then 
again thanks for quick response 
  My students use this application for android application. 
I love this project. =D
 Thank you, please merge~  :+1: 
  Windows DATE is a date formatted as double, with origin at 1/1/1900. This modification allows to display doubles interpreted as a Windows DATE, similar to the unix epoch display option.
 @MKleusberg 
The fractional part of DATE is the hour/min/sec representation.
eg.: 42372.4709375 represents 2016-01-03 11:18:09.
I propose to add both a date and a datetime format.
date ('1899-12-30', `Date` || " days" ) 
would indeed be shown as 
2016-01-03.
  Adding to readme since that's where most people will look for this information.
  If you have the edit boxed docked, and close the DB, whatever was last displayed in the Edit Box remains visible.
 Seems OK. Thanks.  I'm not sure if you are supporting this version yet, but when I try to import or save a new database, the program crashes immediately.
 @justinclift compiling the package manually worked! Thanks!
  Sqlitebrowser is actually being compiled and provided in Fedora 22/23 so it's much easier to get it running.
  I'm running installer in Traditional Chinese (zh_TW) environment, but the installer message is in zh_CN (both encoding and the message itself), which shown as mojibake. (See attached image.)
The problem both appears in 3.7 and 3.8. It only affects installer; the main program correctly detected zh_TW.

OS: Win 7 Enterprise with SP1, 64-bit, Traditional Chinese Version

![mojibake](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4156121/12028493/eada9ae8-ae12-11e5-92f7-d6ed303584e8.png)
 I've never working on installers, so I don't know how or what to setup; since this mojibake message is the ordinary zh_CN default message, I think using default message for zh_TW should suffice.
  When creating a new database or opening an existing one the application crashes with the error 
Exception Type:        EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (SIGILL)

 What version of OS X you're on, lphooge?
 Yosemite, 10.10.5
 @justinclift yes i do have homebrew installed.
I do not know what you are referring to with "compiling DB4S", but when I build the app bundle like the instructions say, the resulting app does not NOT crash when creating a database. The official build still crashes.

One thing I noticed: I got the warning "Warning: sqlite-3.8.11.1 already installed" when trying to install sqlite via brew.
Also, a sqlite3-binary already existed in /usr/bin (3.8.5 2014-08-15 22:37:57 c8ade949d4a2eb3bba4702a4a0e17b405e9b6ace).
 I think I'm seeing the same issue. Here is a crash log if it will help:

 Sorry for the delay. Yes, that nightly build seems to work for me.
 Are you sure that version was built with Qt5? I downloaded and ran it successsfully and in the 'about' menu it said it was built with 4.8.7 just like the newer nightly (and the 3.7 release).
 I don't have much time to test, but it seems fine, no crash when creating a new database.
 Looks good for me as well. One bit of feedback though. The default font for the data browser is really cramped and hard to read, especially when you are looking at some 20 character uid. I eventually found the setting to change it but it is something that may be worth looking at.
 I'm not sure. When I went into the settings there was no font selected so I assume it was using whatever the default system font is for OSX.
 Not that I know of. Defaulting to a font like arial that is easier to read at small sizes or simply defaulting to a larger font size would probably solve the issue. Not sure what font the previous versions used but that one seemed pretty good.
 Not a problem. This little app makes my job easier on a daily basis, so a few questions are a small price to pay ;)
  "sqlitebrowser.exe" from the 3.8.0-win32v2 install is triggering a "invalid win32 app" error message on this side of the curtain.

OS: Win ... XP
 Yes, the nightly (28-Dec-2015 02:20) starts up ok on this side. :) ... :thumbsup:
 Thanks for continued XP support. :smiley: 
  I have a table 'A' with Primary Key on 'ID' column. I have some data inside, however there is no record with ID = 1.

I have a table 'B' with AID marked as Foreign Key from table 'A'.

If I try to add new record in B i get:
DB Browser for SQLite
Error adding record:
CHECK constraint failed: B (INSERT INTO `B` (AID) VALUES (1, ...);)
 I found out that the problem is not caused by foreign keys but constraints added to columns.

It seems that when adding new row, it is added with 'default' values and then edited with values given by user.

This is for version I downloaded today, so 3.8.0. The same applies for 3.7.0. I'm running windows, downloaded x64 version.
 I had this problem today. I try to add a new record but it says:

**"Error adding record: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed (INSERT INTO `FriendShip('id', 'user1', 'user2') VALUES(4,0,0);)"** @justinclift I tried today and it seems to work. Windows 10, Version 3.9.1  I updated from v3.7.0 to v3.8.0 (Windows) this morning and now whenever I click the "Browse Data" tab the application crashes.

I have attached the db that I am trying to view.

 Hey guys. I just wanted to confirm I'm having the same problem with the latest version on my Windows 64 Bit Desktop computer.

Landon
 That build works fine for me.

Also, I noticed that the Qt version in the above build is 4.8.5, while the version when it crashed before is 5.5.1.0 in the windows error detail.
 That nightly appears to be working fine. Adding to what @chinhodado reported regarding versions;

3.8.0 - Qt version 5.5.1, SQLite Version 3.9.2
3.8.99 - Qt version 4.8.5, SQLite Version 3.8.4.3
 @eikcam Shouldn't 3.8.99 be Qt version 4.8.5, and 3.8.0 be Qt 5.5.1?

 @chinhodado You are 100% correct. My bad. I have corrected my previous post :+1: 
 Thanks for the quick action @justinclift. I'll roll with the nightly you provided for now and wait until the experts do their thing.

Cheers.
  Corrected overlooked problem suggested by @tonypdmtr on issue [#453](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/453). I make new issue because [#453](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/453) is already merged.
 @MilosSubotic 
This is a very nice feature, but I believe it can be made a bit more powerful.
1. When pasting a BLOB field, instead of getting the actual content of the blob, I simply get the string 'BLOB'.  (I don't know if this should be considered a bug or an enhancement request.)
2. An enhancement I see to this copy/paste to make it even more flexible is a one-to-many ability.
   That is, if I have a single cell copied to the clipboard, but I have multiple cells selected when pasting, I would like the single value copied to each selected cell.  (It's quite common that one wants to copy a single value to a range of cells -- like in a spreadsheet.)
3. It can be made even more powerful (many-to-many) by pasting each copied cell in sequence to all selected cells.  That way, if I have copied two cells with contents 'A' and 'B', and paste to a range of five cells, I should get 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'.  (So, the source can be more than one cell, and the destination more than one cell, but the two numbers do not need to be equal.)  This will also take care of [2] above automatically as it is a sub-case of this one.

Thanks for your great work, and Merry Christmas to all.
 1. I don't thing this cannot be much better, because clipboard is in text format.
2. and 3. I'm not sure that have enough time to make that (I lack time a lot), but you could do it. Guys here are really nice and quite open for contribution.
   Also consider to use SQL for such advance things. Because that I choose sqlitebrowser over spreadsheets.
   Merry Christmas to you too.
  When editing the table, and adding any column does not check that the name is already in use, resulting in the loss column added when saving table and fall program attempting to move a column with duplicate names

to repeat
1. Create a table with columns (Field2, Field3, Field4)
2. open it for editing
3. add a new column, it name will duplicate (Field4)
4.1 when saving last column will be lost without warning
4.2 when trying to move the last column will happen fall program

add:
if you use non-standard column names, the name of the column will be repeating the standard
 That will not be enough
you need to add a check of repeatability column names in edit mode when you change the order of columns and save.
Not only standard column  names
 to repeat
1. Create a table with columns (a1, a2, a3)
2. open it for editing
3. add a new column, it name will duplicate (a3)
4.1 when saving last collum will be saved as 'Field4'
 to repeat
1. Create a table with columns (Field1, Field2, Field3)
2. open it for editing
3. add a new column, it name will duplicate (Field3)
4 when saving last collum will be lost (second 'Field3')
 to repeat
1. Create a table with columns (Field1, Field2, Field3)
2. open it for editing
3. add a new column, it name will duplicate (Field3)
4 trying to move last collum (second Field3) upper  -> program will crash
 These examples are not just for the standard column names.
No checks the correctness of the table in the editing mode structure
 as I understand:
commit only affects moment to add a new column but there is no verification of column names before executing a user-entered changes
 look good, ok!
i close issues after test
 all right
  May I suggest (hopefully for the upcoming release, as it is a tiny change) the 'Browse Data' tab moves first in the order of tabs so it is immediately available when opening the app.

I'm quite confident the majority of users, most of the time they enter the app, they want to go straight to viewing/editing data, instead of the database structure.

Hopefully you agree, and Merry Christmas to all.
  When you try to open a Sqlite database which uses indexes on expressions then DB4S only shows a message box "invalid file format".

Quote from [https://www.sqlite.org/expridx.html]

> The ability to index expressions was added to SQLite with version 3.9.0 in October of 2015. A database that uses an index on expressions will not be usable by earlier versions of SQLite.
 I don't think it's a bug since the SQLite team clearly states that using that new 3.9.x feature makes the database incompatible with previous versions. That's why I'm asking for an updated version.

I'm using the newest available setup for Windows (8.1), 3.7.0 which includes SQLite 3.8.10.2.

The "problem" (=incompatibility) starts after creating an index (by using another tool) which includes an expression: `create index PixelCount on Images (Width * Height)` and the database again becomes compatible after dropping such index.
  [Some "complex" queries do work in latest command line version, but not in the sqlitebrowser](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34391632/how-can-i-add-row-position-to-a-query-with-a-sum-column-from-subquery?noredirect=1#comment56524568_34391632)

…and this is apparently the latest DB4S version released to the public.
 Thanks for the information, that's good to know!

> In the meantime, if you need things to work right away

Fortunately, not really (I usually only use DB4S just for quick "prototyping"/testing harder queries), so I'll just wait. :laughing: 

And, by the way, I want to say, DB4S is an awesome thing
  My version of sqlitebrowser (Windows64) seems less flexible than required for a course I am following (Python using databases with Charles Severin).

How does one change the field names ("field1", "field2" entries to ) to, say,  "name", "email" and my options are "text",  not VARCHAR as seen in the course material. 

Thanks for any help.
 Thanks! Of course. ;) My "clicks" weren't determined enough.

Best seasons wishes and thanks again,
Sandra Britz

  I create a database in memory and shared it.
But I don't know how to connect it with this tool.
 Oh, I see. Thank u.
  This would require to change it in the code as well as in the i18n files.
 I mean the key combinations to for example run a query.

That sort of thing :wink: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/9582786237792f9db010fb6b18f6e43dd558e589/src/EditDialog.cpp#L17
  Hi.
I added paste (Ctrl+V) and erase (Delete) functionality for cells in Browse Data table (ExtendedTableWidget).
I add it for my convenience, please consider to merge it if you think that is usefull.
 @MKleusberg
- tr("asdf") corrected.
  1) Commits-merged.
  2) Even better with Del and Alt+Del
 I synced my fork to the newest commit [4727b0b](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/4727b0bb9226377ca2eb1c46a0ec6f4697b53746).
My erase() is erased.
Commits squashed as you like it.
 When pasting, the data is quoted.  Maybe the quotes should be removed, or else there is always need for manual editing after pasting.
 I will correct that today.
    I have some Pragmas that I set in ~/.sqliterc . However, the SQLiteBrowser does not seem to use this file. How can I force SQLiteBrowser to always use Pragmas with a preset value? In other words, how can I make "secure delete" always false (unchecked) without having to change it in "Edit Pragmas"? I would also like to make "Temp Store" and "Journal Mode" always set to "Memory".
 Ubuntu
 The GUI-editor would be fine if I only ever had to set the PRAGMAs once and then always use the same settings.
  In table view I added a filter for a column. The column contains a text representation of a date as yyyy-mm-dd (e. g. 2013-04-27).

**Example 1** 
Filter `>2010`
SQL-Log: `SELECT rowid,* FROM msgs_view WHERE 1=1 AND date > 2010 ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 0, 50000;`
Problem: It's a text field but filtering is done numeric. 

**Example 2**
Filter `>2010-10-01`
SQL-Log: `SELECT rowid,* FROM msgs_view WHERE 1=1 AND date LIKE '>2010-10-01' ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 0, 50000;`
Problem: It's executed as LIKE filter and not as GREATER THAN

**Remark**
There is always an additional sql execution to detect the number of rows
`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT rowid,* FROM msgs_view WHERE 1=1 AND date LIKE '>2010-10-01' ORDER BY date DESC);`
Shouldnt ORDERY BY be omitted for performance reasons?
  This isn't an issue with sqlitebrowser -- I didn't know the appropriate way to reach you.

When I look at the OSX .app Frameworks folder of sqlitebrowser, I noticed that your project is much smaller than my Qt app -- you utilize less Qt framework bundles. How did you get your application to support that? For instance, I'm not using QtQuick or QML in my Qt/C++ application. However, when I run my project through macdeployqt, it includes these frameworks in my app bundle. When I try to remove them, my application won't load.
 I found what's going on in my Qt/C++ app. Once I included QtWebKit, it
increased the size by several MB and forced the adding of QtQML and
QtQuick, even though I'm not using those. If I don't add that, the other
frameworks don't get deployed by macdeployqt.

 Nope, close it. Just didn't now to reach someone really experienced in this
field. Sorry to place a ticket like this.  Thanks so much for your

 Hi Justin,

I'm on Windows 7. With the last stable this button was fine. 

I used this button most while attaching databases - and this only could be done by SQlitebrowser one by one - with saving the first attached database before being able to attach the next.

Regards
 Ralf
 sorry Justin - betatester, no progger :(
 Hello Justin,

sorry for letting you waiting. Seems fine to me :-)

The only thing I wonder about is: the nightly build exe file is roughly tenfold bigger than the one from the original release (32MB to 2,2MB).

Regards
 Ralf
 Yes, but it has no dependencies on other files (DLL, etc.)
I wish the actual release did the same.  I like the stand-alone binary version better (like with SQLite3 or FOSSIL)
 +1 for releasing both ways.
 Thanx for shedding some light on this Topic, Justin. 

Personally I use the portable version, that's my main concern. I put the nightly build into the 64-folder, as with the original release I use the 64-version. With the Information now, that the nightlys are 32bitters, that is the wrong Folder. But it does not matter anyway, because the static nature of the build. Right?

Regards
 Ralf
  Neither of the Windows 64-bit releases work on my computer. I am on a 64-bit Windows 7 OS. I open the application and click "New Database." Then an error message shows saying "sqlitebrowser.exe" has stopped working. My machine then automatically closes the program. This program does not work.
 This is the log I found for the error. Do you know how to fix it? 
Faulting application name: sqlitebrowser.exe, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x5548f5ba
Faulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 6.1.7601.19045, time stamp: 0x56259295

Faulting module path: C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll
 I suggest you try searching the internet for "Exception code: 0xc0000005" which returns all sorts of possible causes from bad memory to corrupt video drivers, if you add in "ntdll.dll" then you might find something more specific or helpful. However I am sorry to say this suggests the problem is with your computer and not DB Browser for SQLite. If you have access to another computer with Windows 7 you could try running DB Browser for SQLite on there.
 But how come its never been an issue before? I think that file is a link library that is used by a lot of programs. How come it only fails with your application?
 It works well on my Windows 7 64-bit computer ^_^
 I'm having the same problem on a windows 10 machine
 Yup, that worked ! thanks !
   Weird.. OK I was using Ubuntu when I ran the build, must be a Mac vs Ubuntu
difference. It's no big deal, I would say to keep (cmake ..) Because the
Ubuntu guys will just figure out that it needs one to make it work.

Strange differences...
  See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1282792 :

"In the browse data tab, add new row, then double click a field. The popup window appeared to edit the field, and it froze."

Problem is that during synchronization of the plaintextedit and hexedit, the updated editor emits the changed signal which then triggers another syncronization, and so on, resulting in a stack overflow due to infinite recursion:

  This keyboard shortcut to set a field to NULL still does not work correctly, I suppose.  It behaves the same a plain DELETE, the field is emptied but not NULLed.
(BTW, Ctrl-Delete feels like a more intuitive choice to Alt-Delete.)
  SQLite Browser Version : 3.7.0
OS : Windows 10 64 bit
Steps : 
1. File->Export->Database to SQL file
2. Select New INSERT INTO syntax..
File selection window opens, and the the program crashes 

![issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12444895/11015554/326a49e2-8589-11e5-81ef-4e01a6faa5be.jpg)
  Also, dragging a picture to a blob field could insert that picture.  Now, it crashes.
 @justinclift I just did with the current nightly build.  It works much better now.  However, (again) being a keyboard person myself, I would like the focus to stay in the cell I was, rather than move to the editor.  That way, I can move over the grid using arrow keys (rather than mouse clicks), without losing focus all the time.  Try using it with the keyboard arrow keys, and you'll see what I mean.  With the mouse, it works great.

Suggestion: How about you keep the focus the way it is now when someone uses the mouse to click on cells, but keep the original cell focus instead if the keyboard is used.  That should make both use cases work the best.

(BTW, the drag-n-drop still does not work.  I think it tries to open the dragged file as SQLite3 instead of a blob to be inserted in the dropped at cell.  Not a big deal, though.)
 Works great! Thanks!

I only noticed one more issue (a bit unrelated to this) with the edit box.  I can make a different ticket for it, if you like.  But, while we're on the subject, I'll mention it here:

When ESC is pressed from within the edit box, it minimizes to the left lower corner. If you try to double-click on it (or the min/max icon) to make it big again, it completely vanishes (it becomes floating -- instead of docked -- but nowhere to be found).  Even trying to re-enable it from the 'View/Edit Cell' does not bring it back.  Only way I found to bring it back is to close the app and re-open it.  So, something is not quite right there.

So, maybe when restoring the edit box, center it on the screen and bring to front for easy locating.
(Couldn't ESC be used for going back to the grid cell instead of closing the edit box?)

Thanks to all for your great work!
 Perfect work!  Many thanks.
 If I'm browsing a view (instead of a table) the cell data isn't shown in the editor.  Of course I cannot possibly edit a view, but how about having the data display there in read-only mode so it takes care of the original issue of seeing the whole field?
Is read-only edit box possible?
 Great!

My final (I hope) observation is a really minor remaining issue:
You enter the edit box and type something, and instead of accepting it (with OK or CTRL-ENTER), you press ESC and go back out to the grid cell.  The value in the edit box does not revert back to the original (unless you move away from the cell and back on it).  It stays modified so the cell and the edit box no longer match either other.

Thank you all again for all your work (and immediate responsiveness).

P.S.
1. CTRL-Z could act as "File/Revert Changes" when you're not editing a field (i.e., in global scope)
2. Unless there is a separate selection for edit box font, maybe the same font should be used for the edit box as the one selected for the grid.
 One more similar to the previous one:
If you edit directly on the grid cell, and press enter you go to the Edit Box but with the previous contents of the cell -- even though the cell has been edited already.
 Sure.
  When moving in the browser grid from cell to cell, it'd be nice to have the full contents of that cell display in some full-width textbox (e.g., at the bottom of the screen -- like with a status line).

This is much faster than entering/exiting the editor for each cell when quickly browsing the data.

(If this is also a multi-line textbox, it could also take care of issue #416 I created earlier.)
 @MKleusberg Thanks for this.  I tried it and it looks very good.  However, double clicking (IMHO) still slows it down more than it's necessary.  How about the edit box being refreshed as soon as move the cursor from cell to cell, without any extra action, e.g., when navigating with the arrow keys.  (I personally tend to use the keyboard more than the mouse.)  Thanks again.
  Chrome (latest, Mac OSX 10.10) has a History file that is in SQLite format. But opening it with sqlitebrowser 3.7.0 gives the "Invalid file format" error. 
 So I was told it was in SQLite format. And I can open it in sqlite3:

```
$ sqlite3 
SQLite version 3.8.4.1 2014-03-11 15:27:36
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
sqlite> .open History
sqlite> .tables
downloads             meta                  urls                
downloads_url_chains  segment_usage         visit_source        
keyword_search_terms  segments              visits           
```
 At the `qmake` step, I'm getting `QMAKESPEC has not been set, so configuration cannot be deduced.
Error processing project file: /Users/igallevy/source/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.pro`.

Looking at Note 2 in the build section (referenced by your link), I see that I should run one of the `qmake -spec` commands, but there is no context given for which. So I ran `qmake -spec macx-llvm`, which seemed to work. However, after I copied the .app to Applications and attempted to start, I got the following dialog:

**sqlitebrowser cannot be opened because of a problem.**

So perhaps it should have been compiled with the other `qmake -spec`, but I'm far from knowing. I did retrace steps and tried it (same result), but some cleaning up may have been needed before trying that.

If I get the time I'll try starting from scratch if all that entails is blowing away the sqlitebrowser source I checked out. Or maybe you'll have a new build done sooner :pray:
 I had this problem, but I think it was because Chrome had the file open while sqlitebrowser was trying to read it. I made a copy of the file, and sqlitebrowser was able to open it.  Picking up on #184 
- SQLite 3 seems to use affinity types - ( https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#affinity ) - and has baked in support for column types such as 'DATETIME' etc.

In SQLite Browser, if I execute the SQL that creates a columntype of DATETIME, SQLite supports it, and DATETIME is shown for the column type.

However, when trying to add / edit a column type, these types are not supported, even if I type them in manually.

Perhaps the default column types could be listed, but the add / edit dropdown will accept custom types as well.

I feel this qualifies as a bug - as I can't use your tool to access a built-in function of SQLite.

Thanks kindly
  Tried a project save and then re-open it but doesn't show on the file list because the file extension identified as a SQLite Browser Project is not on the file.  No clue as to what is expected.
  I've just installed 3.7 for the first time, I clicked New Database and this caused the application to crash. I also tried 3.6 and the same happens.

Clicking Open Database has the same effect.

I presume there's some conflict with my machine but I have no idea what that might be, everything else is running fine and it's only a 2 week old installation of W7.
 Same for me on Windows 8.1 x64 on x64 version.
What a day, first Django migrations f*d up and now I can use that tool to review the database.
 Now it looks good. 64-bit version runs fine and the open dialog doesn't
cause crash. I'm able to browse my test database from Django application.

Thank you very much.

  I just worked through getting it to build on Qt 4.6.2, on a locked down Linux machine.

It struggled with a few errors when building v3.5.1.

Here are the errors:

```

```

I'll see about doing a pull request sometime with the fixes.

Fixes basically were:

Add `#include <QFile>` to main.cpp

Wrap includes for `QElaspedTimer` with:

```
#if (QT_VERSION < QT_VERSION_CHECK(4, 7, 0))
# include <QTime>
typedef QTime QElapsedTimer;
#else
# include <QElapsedTimer>
#endif
```

Wrap calls to `QDateTime::currentMSecsToEpoch()` with

```
#if QT_VERSION < QT_VERSION_CHECK(4, 7, 0)
    QDateTime::currentDateTime().toTime_t() * 1000
#else
    QDateTime::currentMSecsSinceEpoch()
#endif
```

Wrap call to `QLineEdit::setPlaceHolderText()` with

```
#if (QT_VERSION < QT_VERSION_CHECK(4, 7, 0))
    // setPlaceHolderText(tr("Filter"));
#else
    setPlaceHolderText(tr("Filter"));
#endif
```

Hope that helps someone.  These fixes should make it backwards compatible with Qt 4.6.
 I'll try rebuilding it with 4.6 on a home computer this weekend. I found
those errors on a locked down computer without internet access.  Sorry
about the late response.  Does it still build easily with 4.8 since
supporting qt 5?
 This is an old thread, but I'll just add that yesterday it saved my hide.  Qt-4.6 may be ancient, but it's what's in use in RedHat 6.8, which is still widely used in industry.  This patch is not irrelevant to me.  Just for jollies, and to be informative, my company-standard installation has qt-1:4.6.2-28 and qt3-3.3.8b-30 installed.  (If you thought Qt-4.6 was old...)  I have qt5-5.6.1-3 available but not installed - apparently nothing "standard" has called for it.  The preparations are beginning to upgrade to RedHat 6.9, but I'm not sure what Qt code levels that will entail or when it will happen. Awesome!  Glad it was useful.  The biggest thing to watch for with older versions of RedHat is support for OpenGL or the MesaGL libraries and xcb support.  If those are fully installed and supported, then Qt 5 will play nice.  Otherwise some gotchas come up.  Qt 4.8.x doesn't need OpenGL, and Qt Lite (in Qt 5.8+) also doesn't need OpenGL.    I have a question regarding the built-in plotting function. I observed that for larger databases (~ 2M entries) the plots look quite different compared to plots made with e.g. python. I also observed that the plots very much depend on the ordering of the entries in the database. 
Since the plots are extremely fast, I assume that you perform some kind of "thinning" before doing the plot? I am right about this? Could you elaborate about the details of how the plots are done?

Thanks,
Christoph Niehoff
 I don't understand what you mean with look different?
The plots depend on what x and y axis(columns) you select,
and of course how your current select statement looks like.

And no there shouldn't be any data left out for plotting, all data that is returned from the select should be used to plot
 Dear Rene,

thank you for you reply!

Let me give you an example.
When I perform the two following select's:
1) select dataA, dataB from DataBase order by dataA
2) select dataA, dataB from DataBase order by dataB
I assume that in both cases I have the same datapoints (or am I wrong here? I am quite new to SQL... ).
But when I make plots with dataA on the x-axis and dataB on the y-axis, I get totally different outcomes  for both cases (different distributions of datapoints and different plot ranges).

Also, I can make a plot with all points. Then I can perform a select that only returns entries, which are in a region, where the plot with all points didn't have any points. This select then shows that there are entries in the database, that the plot did not show...

I assume that this very much depends on the structure of my data. My database contains ~2M entries generated by ~500 different Markov Chains, so the data is pretty much "clustered"...

Thanks very much,
Christoph
 I had a look at the code(some time has past since I wrote it) and I think I have not really accounted such order by statements and the plotting is still more or less some kind of prototype. So this is more or less a bug or missing functionality.

But I can say that we pass all the data returned from the statement to the plotting widget (qcustomplot), but as you noticed it may happen that some data is not shown, thats because it's not possible to draw every datapoint if the x-axis is too large and the plotting widget has to skip data.
 Dear Rene,

thank you very much for taking the time to look into the code.  I think, this pretty much explains it. Thanks, that helped a lot.

All the best,
Christoph
  It would be convenient to open recent files with combination: CTRL + 1 (2,3,4)
 Strange behavior.

actions:
open base
amend data
press the key combination (cntr + 1)
press (ESC) (2 times why?)
when you try to make a change in the base will be informed that it is locked
 all right
  On "Execute SQL" tab I write:
SELECT default_image, russian FROM cards WHERE russian_lower LIKE "%тихо%"
I get:
SELECT default_image, russian FROM cards WHERE russian_lower LIKE "%????%"
 Windows 7, build 7601, 64 bit, I never do updates, because can't remember even once that they helped me with anything.
SQLite version is 3.8.9
 It's 3.6.0, I'll try the newer one and report.
 It's OK in 3.7.0, sorry for inconvenience.
  Hi GitHub,

I try your DB Brower for SQLite Version 3.8.10.2. The Browse Data text filter does not work at all. I will try it your next release again and see if your software is desirable. 

Best regards,

En Ych
 Hi Justin,

Please look below. When click the bug report of the program, it will go to your website.

Best regards,

En Yach
 I think @ITS225EN you will need to attach the image directory in GitHub, e-mailed images don't work, as far as I know, we certainly can't see your picture, sorry.
 Hi Geoff,

Later I download sqlitebrowser-3.7.0-win64.exe to try. This one works.

Thanks,

En Yach
 That's great news. Do you know what you had before exactly? Just in case there is an issue.
  With monospace fonts query editor rendering seems to be ignoring the proper space width. Screenshots below are both of the exact same text using 10pt Courier New with the red line 1px after the select keyword.

How it should look: Notepad++ 6.7.9
![notepad _6 7 9](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12277525/10455659/f57223a2-7192-11e5-80ed-f36572dcbca8.png)

How it looks: DBBrowser 3.7.0
![dbbrowser_3 7 0](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12277525/10455658/f5519a1a-7192-11e5-9b12-7a376d017c46.png)

Please note that spaces might not be the only characters involved and **_formatting_** might also affect the result.

Here is the text:

```
select sum(ValorNeto) as Neto, sum(ValorIVA + ValorNeto) as Total
  from NV
 inner join Entidad
    on NV.IdEntidad = Entidad.IdEntidad
 inner join NVEstado
    on NV.IdNVEstado = NVEstado.IdNVEstado
 where NV.IdNVEstado = {0}
       {1};
```
 Perfect! :+1: :+1: :+1: (I'm no longer suprised :grin:)
  I apologize if this has been addressed elsewhere, I did a quick search for font-related issues and didn't see anything.

I'm on DB Browser **3.7.0** and on OS.X **10.10.5**

The font-size for un-quoted alpha-symbols seems to ignore the specified font-size in the SQL Preferences:

Here are my **Preferences > SQL** settings:

 I followed the instructions (uninstalling and re-installing sqlite and qt via homebrew) but unfortunately, I get this error when trying to run the compiled app:

```
LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Applications/sqlitebrowser.app.
```

Here's the output of the `make`...There's a few errors and warnings but I don't know if they're the root cause of the error (and note that programs my `/anaconda/` path take precedence...don't know if that affects things either):

 Sorry for the late reply...I was taking my usual annual SQL cleanse...thanks for the ping, looks like it's fixed!

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/121520/13132196/b5e32b56-d5a5-11e5-8da4-57812a243700.png)

Thanks! I'm closing the ticket now as the issue has been resolved. Don't know if it's worth mentioning that the **output** font remains uniformly small...but maybe that's intended? Or in an option that I've missed (is it not the SQL Log Font Size, which I've set to be 32 in the screenshot above, the same as in the SQL Editor Font Size setting)? 

If I have one more interface suggestion to make, based on my experience in using SQLite Browser for live demos and teaching SQL in-class, it's that that bottom output panel can be very easy to miss, even for me, but especially for new users/SQL novices who don't realize that it's related to the execution of the query...which gets confusing for novices who struggle with knowing the difference between an empty query set and an actual error. Configuring the font-size would be helpful, but even a little color flash upon update, or a red-highlight border around the output box in the event of an error, would be really helpful.

Thanks again!
  I'm happy to see the usage of qhexedit in the wild. I would be more happy, if you add a reference to
 https://github.com/Simsys/qhexedit2
 yes we use qhexedit, it was introduced while @MKleusberg reworked the value editor dialog a long time ago.

  My base has 134 records in table 'Projets', as displayed by my application, but sqlitebrowser displays only 106 records.

I thought this was due to accented characters in the records, but that is not the cause.

Unfortunately, this panel does not allow to attach a base or an .xls file...

The base (Lightcomm.db, 150k) and the excel file (Projets.XLS, 8k) are available with
www.pixname.com/DBBrowser/Lightcomm.db
www.pixname.com/DBBrowser/Projets.XLS
 I did not specify that this happens on Windows 8.1, with 

sqlitebrowser 
Version 3.7.0
Qt Version 5.4.1
SQLite Version 3.8.10.2
 Interesting: I uninstalled and reinstalled 3.7.0 64bits on Windows 8.1. 
and - surprise - all 134 records are there.

Thanks for your interest, and sorry for disturbing you.

Raanan Barzel
  I have downloaded the 64 bit version of sqlite browser. It appears to start normally and properly. As i do any activity on the browser for e.g. click on any button,an exception shows and the browser crashes. It goes off automatically. Please look into it and suggest some solution.
 Hi Justin... I have a similar issue....
I just installed the latest version of sqllite browser on my 64 bit windows 10 PC.
The sqllite browser opens and when i click on new databases, the application crashes.
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2013 is also installed on my PC.
Can you please provide me a solution for this problem?
  Hello,

is there any way to Interrupt a (far too) long running query. Actually I kill the process, but that's not the nice way to do.

Regards
 Ralf
 Hello Martin,
I understand your concerns. Perhaps just as information: SQLite Studio shows up an interrupt button when a query is engaged, works fine, so far no problems, but not heavily used anyway.

I came to this, because by un(for)seen changes at my collected measurement data I run into troubles with my (old) queries: SQLite Studio could interrupt them, SQLite Browser I had to kill each time ...

Personally I much more like SQLite Browser; I use SQLite Studio for some work because here I can attach a bunch of databases by a set of query statements, which SQLite Browser cannot.

Regards
 Ralf
  I have many records with underscore char in the text.
But this char is also a wildcard so I'm not able to exclude unwanted items.
How can I escape wildcard in the filter textboxes?
 Already tried with no luck. Doubling the char doesn't work.
Thanks
  Under Wndows, on a HD screen, the scrolled list of tables in the 'Browse data' tab is streched horizontally across the screen and becomes uncomfortably wide. It would be nice if its size could be adjusted to the size of the largest table name.
Vertically, the list shows only 10 entries whereas there is plenty of place to display a much longer list. My 23 tables could easily fit in one list (they do in the Database structure tab).
 Sure, no problem :

Thanks
 In my previous mail I sent a screenshot of about half the screen. The 
full screen is below, and you can see the problem of navigating the 
scrolled list...
 Please see the enclosed screenshot.

 Done.
 Hi Justin,

DB Browser does not display records containing accented charaters. Is 
this the normal behavior? What needs to be done to display such records?

I switched the browser language to French, but this does not modify the 
operation of DB Browser.

Regards,
Raanan
 tried with

Version 3.7.99

Qt Version 4.8.5

SQLite Version 3.8.4.3

Same problem.
 Hi Justin,

The accented words problem went away with 3.8.0.

The width of the 'Browse data' menu is still too large.

A request: include an option to 'Open the last opened base automatically'.

Regards,

Raanan
 Hi Justin,

Thanks for accepting my suggestion, and a happy new year!

  It would be nice if the user could change the row height for the data browser. I presume this would be placed on the Preferences -> Data Browser tab. 
 I'm on Win7. I'm leaving today for the week but will be back on Sunday. I would be happy to test at that time.
 Hi Clift,

  I have version 3.7.0 installed on a Win-32, Win7 PC. I don't see
  where I can change the row height size.

  Bob
  That version number sounds like a release one, @justinclift was suggesting you look at the latest nightly build. If you go to https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser and scroll down you will find some explanation and a link to the nightly build. Try that and see.
 Now using 3.7.99 and I see many NEW   options for changing the font and font size - but none for the row   height.  Even when I use a very small font size the row height   remains unchanged, and too big. I tried a smaller font size, just to  see if that would reduce the row height. Nope.
  I want to have shorter row heights - primarily to see more rows on   a single screen.
 A friendly +1 for this.
I just updated from 2.0b1 to 3.9.1, I was very excited by all the progress… but then I became very sad when I saw how bigger the rows have become… Yes, there is an improvement. Here are some screenshots:
* [3.9.1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/544424/24899798/e49ba6a8-1ea1-11e7-9791-507eb501d9bd.png)
* [nightly 2017-04-11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/544424/24899801/e7bc9bb2-1ea1-11e7-9112-7081f7c3e6a3.png)

Personally I'd prefer even narrower rows, like in the "Database Structure" tab. But it's highly subjective, I use quite denser layouts than most people do.

So, it should be fine as it is now. Thanks! Hi Justin,

While I recently got a Win64 PC, I also have my old Win32 PC.  I tried both 2017-04-11 versions (what is the difference? what is sqlcipher? ) on the Win32 PC and both worked really well. There are certainly many more features now which are not apparent how to use. I'm sure the online Help will follow.

I thought there was going to be something under Preferences that specifically addressed row height. Changing the browser font size will change the row height indirectly but I saw nothing that would change the row height directly. For example, a smaller row height with no change in font size would reduce the white space between each line.

One minor change I noticed. File names in the new version use forward slashes / instead of back slashes \ . It just looks unusual to see some of the files with back slashes and some with forward slashes when I view the most recent files in the Files menu. I think the Windows default is back slashes, although I believe either will work. As a PC user, this is something I've never paid much attention to.

 I tried but got an error here:

bash-3.2$ git clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.git
fatal: could not create work tree dir 'sqlitebrowser'.: Permission denied
 Ah, I see. I should have moved to the admin's home when switching users with su.
Qt compiled fine here:

   /usr/local/Cellar/qt/4.8.6: 2791 files, 119M, built in 693.9 minutes

11 hours vs. 2. Your machine seems to be "slightly" faster than mine. ;-)
Testing the binary now, and it works!
Thank you!
Now I "only" have to figure out how to interpret my database's contents. ;-)
 Update: Opening the db works, but then browsing a table and clicking the refresh button lets the app crash:

An the resulting binary starts up without problems but crashes with a SIGSEV when I try to browse a table in my DB, even before hitting refresh.
 Sorry I can't be more helpful. 
The last time I coded something successfully was when I used 68000 assembler. ;-)
 Same problem here on Mac OS X 10.6.8 32 bit on MacBook Pro 3.1
 I noticed that the v3.7.0 .dmg provided here unpacks as version 3.4.99; it does not run on Mac OS X 10.6.8. The v3.6.0 .dmg unpacks as version 3.6.0 and runs properly. ...
 Will try shortly.
 Sorry, I'm short on time.
Must test later.
 Pong.
I'm there, what should I do?
 My internet connections seems to go down …

Do I need to do this part again?

$ brew install sqlite --with-functions --without-readline
$ brew install qt
$ brew link sqlite3 --force
 IT WORKS!!!

Thank you very much!
 I have with the newest build a similar problem

 Nope, Justin. So far I never compiled anything, always download just binaries.
The version     http://mirror.salasaga.org/sqlitebrowser/onceoffs/sqlitebrowser_201509260125.dmg
works as well as the one with (or without) cipher of 20150608. All later crash on Snow Leopard :(
  I tried to delete the content of a table "myTable" in an attached database "myDB":

DELETE FROM myDB.myTable;

And got the following error:
no such table: myDB.Tablename: DELETE FROM myDB.myTable
(Where "Tablename" is the name of a table in the main database)

The table itself exists, so a query on that table works:
SELECT \* FROM myDB.myTable;

Deletion on the main database works fine also:
DELETE FROM main.myTable;

Kindly regards,
Andreas Martin
  When a field contains line feeds, in the Browse Data tab, the contents are displayed on the same line but without any space between the lines.  I propose you replace line feeds with a space so as to look better as single line.  For example:

If fields contains:
Hello<CRLF>
World

It now displays as:
HelloWorld

(no space between Hello and World)

After my suggestion:
Hello World
 That would work also (even better, actually).  However, still a space should surround the special character or else again it will look as one word when printed as a single line.
  I would like an option for Filter to automatically enclose whatever typed text in %% so as to not to have to type the % all the time.  This is because I have found that practically always I need a “%text%” type search instead of just “text”.
 That's why I thought of it as a settable option (View/Preferences)

Better yet, a checkbox right next to the filters row where one can immediately change the default, and also verify its current state.
 Hi,

another problematic point here is the immediate activation of the filter while still typing. With big data it took relevant time to complete the intendet filter phrase, and the program does filtering again and again with every of the next typed in characters.

Alternative solutions might be:
1) drop this auto activation behaviour (not that conveniant)
2) make it optional by Setting (a bit better)
3) define a certain amount of time to wait that no further Input is done in the filter field and only then start filter Action (my best bet, i.e. 400ms might be a good starting point)

Regards
 Ralf
 This seems unrelated to this proposal as the only difference is that the LIKE argument will be automatically embraced by % characters.  None of the remaining functionality is affected.

As for appropriate solutions to the other issue, I'd go with 3.
 I appreciate all the work put into this, and the result is very good.

However, there is one issue with this always-on use of % that may be a problem.  It fails to handle the case where a string is also found as a sub-string of another string.  For example, the names: John and Johnson

If I'm looking for John, typing John will give me both and there may be cases where I only need to see just John without Johnson.  And, there is no way to make it not find Johnson.

I think some kind of on/off switch for this option is needed.

(BTW, one minor note about the implementation.  I looked at the code and when the string is empty it is replaced by '%%' when just one '%' is sufficient.  Not important in that it does not change the behavior.)
 I didn't know about the = option.  That will work just as well. Thanks.
 It's OK as far as I'm concerned!
  Hi,
Thanks for a great product.

My Name is Svein Berger (mr.) I'm a Norwegian software developer.
First I want to apologize for my limited knowledge of English. So please try to understand my note.

We are using an technical application that saves data to a SQLite database.
The first version of the program was written in Delphi. Later I rewrote the program in C#.
The character set back then was Windows western europe (same as CP1252)
When I rewrote the program to C# i kept the old character set. That was because it was to complicated to convert the data to UTF-8.

As a Norwegian (it applies to most countries in Europe), we use letters that are outside A..Z like øæå ö ü etc. 
At the time we startet to use our database UTF-8 was not the common character sets. The transition to UTF-8 is no problem for those who only use the letters A..Z. But for us who live in countries that have an extended alphabet, the transition to UTF-8 is a challenge for some older systems. The letters A..Z kept the same places in the new character set, but the letters that we use was "shuffled around". 
So the result it that when we use a program, liker yours great app, the letters øæå is displayed wrong.
An example: Pressure test is in Norwegian Trykkprøving. But it is like this Trykkpr�ving in DB Browser for SQLite. For all charaters ØÆÅ øæå is displayed like �. Not very nice.

Pleas see attatched screen shot.

If I had written the program to day, I would of course used UFT-8, and everyone would be happy.

I fully understand that you do not add an additional interpretations of the character set in the program. But if you have the opportunity and see this as a challenge, I would be more than happy to test the solution for you.

If I make my self unclear, please ask me and I will try my best to answer you.

Kind regards

 Hi Martin

Wow! Thank you very much, all participants. This was quick and amazing!
I do most of my development i Windows, and I tried it there. It works great!

All my tables (aprox. 120 tables) , in two databases uses the old cp1251 format.
How do I set it to open all tables in cp1252?

And again thank you for your great support!

Regards
Svein
 Hi Martin,
Thank you again, this works fine, all tables are set correctly. And yes, there is no problem to set the encoding every time I use the program.  

I Run a query in "Execute SQL". The result there is still UTF-8. Is it possible to include the selected encoding in the query tab?

You guys are awesome. Great support and fast solution. 
Thank you.
 Hi Justin, 
I do have Homebrew and followed your guide. It's working great. The encoding option is there and working.

Thank you.
  There was a previous problem (https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/394) in the Window's version that was fixed on August 19th 2015. Later it got broken, which I mentioned in that thread, but here's a new report with up-to-date information. :smiley: 
Now, the Edit-window is alternating between two places depending on the position of the main form. First it appears in one place, then the other next time it's opened. If the main window is moved, it's two different places. Sometimes half way outside the screen border.

The position of the main form is stored when the application is closed, so wouldn't it be a good idea if you added a setting in Preferences to also store the position of the Edit-window? Those who don't have any problems can leave that setting unchecked and will have the applications default behaviour. :smile:
 Just curious if I'm the only one seeing this strange behaviour? Perhaps most users on Windows stick to the release builds and therefore haven't experienced this yet? :)
I tried the nightly build from November 10th and, for me, it behaves the same erratic way as described in the post above.
 I'm seeing this on the 3.8.0 build of Windows x64 as well.
 I just tried it, and the Windows build still has the problem.
 Yes @justinclift I was going to suggest that myself, both this and #394, plus also #342.
  In an existing table with data, if you change the datatype it rollsback on saving. For example you import an csv file, and it uses id fields as text. Now you want to make it integer, you can not.
 Dear Justin,

I am using it on windows8.1.

Regards
Ashutosh
  I do create COLUMN with the COLLATE NOCASE. Sqlite browser does not parse COLLATE NOCASE
statement correctly.
e.g:
CREATE TABLE `MyTable` (`ID` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,`Filter` TEXT COLLATE NOCASE)
 DB4S: Version: 3.7.0
OS: Windows 7 64 bit
 @slidertom did you get a chance to test this please?
 Was just going to raise a ticket when I saw this was already here.  

Using the latest nightly build (13 Jun) and this works 40% successfully (using Windows 10 64bit)

Maybe I broke it, but I 'cheated' by editing a table and changing the field from 'text' to 'text collate nocase'.  DB4S kindof accepted it...
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/16045736/b02c725a-3241-11e6-965b-65ee0ab5cb0b.png)

But its not in the dropdown
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/16045764/cfd73aae-3241-11e6-8916-48e250c3cb75.png)

...and the 'Modify Tab;e' GUI doesn't see it.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/16045783/e5b2b11e-3241-11e6-96eb-a071e3111ed6.png)

It does physically work though - the field is now nocasing, so 'fred' is found with a field containing 'FRED'.  Adding a field doesn't break this, but MOVING a field does.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7872218/16045824/1bab18ba-3242-11e6-8960-06f189491e84.png)

So it works, but only just...

I added a table via SQL, and the same results occurred.  Physically worked, appeared in the schema line but not the dropdown, and not in the 'Modify Table' GUI. Adding a field didn't break it, but moving a field did.
 I am still getting this error on the latest nightly build.
Do I need to be concerned about this?
Can you fix it?  I have to make sure that the blob column is not displayed to make the scrolling speed acceptable.
There needs to be an option to not attempt to render the contents and just display "BLOB" as was previously the case.
 Is there a change for a, relative soon, nightly version with a workable BLOB display fix.
With (displayed?) blobs the current 3.7.0 SqliteBrowser becomes so unresponsive its just unworkable.

Tried it with nightly 3.7.99. (added the nightly exe (renamed) to the current installed 3.7.0 version, just in case that's not the way to do it.)

OS: Windows, 32bit, XP
(funny, every time I specify XP I now feel I'm saying something political unacceptable.)
  Sqlitebrowser performs very slow when running Recursive CTE. I have a table with >500K rows and it takes Sqlitebrowser about 6 minutes to finish the query. Other sqlite browsers/managers such as sqlitespy, database.net, etc take around 1 min and 45 sec to complete. The fastest is sqlitespeed. It takes only about 1 min and 15 sec to complete the query. Can somebody take a look at this?

Thanks
 Justin -
Any update? Did he get a chance to investigate?
Thanks,
AJ
 @MKleusberg - I recently got a new PC so I have different results when I tested the sample that I sent you. The latest DB browser (v3.9.1) now can complete the query in 149 second (2.5 minute) vs 68 second if I use sqlitespy. With my old PC, DB browser took 6 minutes to finish the query vs 1 min and 45 with sqlitespy. It seems DB browser processes the query faster but still lags behind other sqlite browsers. 

I'm more than happy to help you run the query using the special build to figure out the issue. Just let me know.  Is it possible to show the ROWID of a record as a column? Currently each table has an unnamed column (the leftmost one) that looks like ROWID but it is not.
 @justinclift I think you have Mac nightly builds working now, so thought a polite nudge might be in order
 @MKleusberg I just tested on OS X 10.11.2 and it worked the first time I tried it but now it's not displaying the column. 
- I enabled it for one table and it displayed the rowid
- Switched to a second table and enabled it, but no rowid was shown
- Switched back to table one and toggled it off/on, and rowid did not return
- restarted sqlitebrowser and now unable to display rowid at all

Not sure what is going on. Would it be possible to just move 'show rowid' to the preferences pane and apply it across all tables? That would make the most sense to me..
 The feature is working great for me, thanks!
  I have a table that contains a json field.  If I do a query of the table with no where clause the json field shows text.  However if I put in a where clause to pick a  particular set of records (1 or more), the json field only shows the word BLOB (in italic and light font) where the same same records without the where clause shows the text in the json field.  

Why does this happen?
 Sorry.  This looks like it was already fixed in version 3.7.   I was running version 3.6.
  Thank you for any assistance that you can provide! Glenn

No errors when do it from sqlite command line.
In the attachment is the module I want to load.

  There is no possibility to save graph on data, and it is not clear on how the data is plotted (selected table in another part of the window, and on the other tab)
 yes
  On the Open Database dialog program asks me for the file and it reads the supported file types are ".db .db3 .sqlite .sqlite3".
But for some reason when I try to open "key.db" file from profile settings of Mozilla Firefox it prompts the plain message saying : "Invalid File Format". I was unable to find any working solution on the forums (i didnt try any solution talking about downgrading btw)
I'd be glad if you take a look
 The same error I get with the android calendar db file /data/data/com.android.providers.calendar/databases/calendar.db

The file starts with "SQLite format 3"

Do I need write access? It works when I copy it to local folder ...
 Maybe the error message should say this then
 That's the best behaviour imaginable :+1: 
 No I'm just using the FreeBSD port
 I'm getting this error message on a ssqlite db file...
  When function is called save(...) and instead of saving it releases savepoint - it seems a lit bit strange for me, so I have renamed some functions and fixed couple of logical errors (well, at least from my POV :D ).
Let's discuss
 It is worth to check from flow perspective, I am not an SQLite expert and have been digging sqlitebrowser sources only for couple of hours.
Especially we should pay attention to places where former save() and saveAll() were used. 
Due to misleading name - I am not sure what was meant in particular points: either "I want to save" or "I want to release savepoint" :)

![default](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6053197/9262130/3dff4e4e-421b-11e5-88c2-2d985f555a5e.png)
 I would say the bug is that UI is unable to display names with escaped special symbols. There is nothing bad in having special symbols escaped in the names of fields/tables, isn't it?

However, there are some more issues with at least this particular special symbol.
In the same circumstances if we will rename column 'example' to 'exa`mple' it will be renamed (from the first look). However, attempt to move column up/down will lead to "renameColumn: cannot find column " error.
Also, on exit through "ok" button changed name will be not saved if alphanumeric sequence is used. In case of numbers only we will see situation which was initially reported here
 ok, all work
 yes, bug fixed
  Is it possible to assemble the project in windows ???
 You may suggest where to start and what libraries are needed?
 i try compile in qtcreator ... 
but why that was an error: "'::strcpy_s' has not been declared"

Try to go exactly according to instructions...
  I installed SqliteBrowser recently, and to my surprise found that the program tries to make a https connection to an IP automatically at launch. With the amount of open-source involvement in this, I realize this probably something innocuous like Checking for updates or something, but even then, connecting to some IP without any form of notification to the user raises immediate red flags to me.

If it is indeed about automatic updates, please allow the user to choose it consciously, rather than doing it behind the curtains. With a simple dialogue at first launch, saying "Automatic updates are enabled and will ensure DB4S is at the latest version" - with a prominent OK button and a "Change setting" text link that takes you to the Preferences page - you can also ensure that only those who really wish to disable auto-updates do that. Currently, even if the user wishes not to allow external connections (for whatever reason), a connection is going to happen at the very first launch, before (s)he has a chance to change the Preferences.

And whenever update check is going on, you could also give a simple notification, putting to use the several unused pixels at the bottom of the window. I consider this necessary because, given that DB4S is a desktop program that one doesn't expect to connect to the Internet, making external connections is an unusual state for the program and something that deserves a user notification. Putting it at the bottom left also keeps it similar to browser status messages, which would make it easier for users to grok. 
  I found it support 2d chart on GUI. Does it support 3d plt based on X, Y, Z data?
 Thanks. I'll have have a try.
 Thanks for the reminder. 
  in order to meet the requirements: `sudo yum install qt-devel ant-antlr antlr-C++`
(not exactly sure about the C++ bindings). while it builds with `cmake . && make && sudo make install`.
please check and add to the build instructions - tested on CentOS 7.1.
 looks good. one probably would just need to validate the dependencies on a fresh install once,
because I'm not exactly sure if not others were already installed (they'll gonna complain, if not).
 Just FYI: you also need gcc-c++ or the build fails with a CXX error on Fedora 22/23.
 Sure, I can do that. I actually didn't end up installing from source since I ran into other issues with the build (it didn't find MAC or WIN but did find X11 and it wouldn't build).
So I did what I should have done from the start & looked in repo. Fedora actually packages it out so it's as easy as dnf install sqlitebrowser. I'll do a PR & update for Fedora 22/23.

  Hi!

I'm using the Window's version of your great browser. One thing I've noticed is that each time I doubleclick on a cell and the window "Edit database cell" opens it moves further down the screen. After opening it a couple of times I need to move it back up before it disappears off screen. As you probably understand, it can be a bit irritating when doing lots of editing.
I would prefer if the edit-window always opened at the same position. Or even better if it opens in the position where it was last closed, to give the user control.
Hope this can be accomplished. :-) 

Have a nice day wherever you are!
 Thank you very much MKleusberg, your fix makes it work a lot better. :smile: 
The first time after application start the Edit-window opens screen centered, but after that each subsequent opening is centered over the main window.
 This is broken in the nightly build (at least since August 29th). Now the Edit-window appears screen centered every second time, and halfway outside the top left corner of the screen every second time. I know nightly builds may contain oddities but I just thought I'd mention it so it doesn't remain like this when you make a final build. :-)
I'm back to using the build from August 19th.
 I can add that where the Edit-window appears depends on the position of the main form, but it seems to alternate between two places. Maybe some kind of offset?
The position of the main form is stored when the application is closed, so wouldn't it be nice if you could add a setting in Preferences to also store the position of the Edit-window? I think that would be the most general solution.

I just had another thought. Since this thread is labeled "Fix applied" perhaps I should start a separate thread with this "new bug-report"?

May the force of SQL be with you. =D
  would love if we were able to edit(UPDATE) the returned SQL records from a SELECT query without having to manually issue an UPDATE statement or switching back to the data editor tab.
 When i run a SELECT query, the results are not editable. Double-clicking in the cells does nothing. Would be awesome if i could edit the results in-place.
 I understand the difficulties. Thank you for at least considering it.
  ... and how to use them?
 Of course ^^ Thanks for your help @justinclift @MKleusberg :+1: 
  UTF16 = Case sensitive compare
UTF16CI = Case insensitive compare

comparison is performed by QString functions.

AFAIK the Byte order of QStrings are CPU dependent. This means, that the collation does not work if the byte order of QString does not match the byte order of the database. 
 The reason to choose this collating sequence was the need for a Unicode collation that really matched the in-memory comparison. Especially regarding  non-UCS2 chars and Unicode normalization. The performance should be OK as we're not copying any data here.
  to repeat:
1) create table,with some column
2) click "correct table"
3) add some column
4) move any column

  I'm used to pressing "Command-R" (on a mac) to refresh the current table. It would be great if this was added. Thanks!
 Awesome, thanks! :)
 argh! sorry for the lack of response, i'm not usually on the actual github site, so i've just seen this notification.

just downloaded and tested the latest version, this works great!! thanks very much for it justin! the little things like this make all the difference

cheers  If I create a table with the following SQL:

``` sql
create table "table`1" (column1);
```

Then it cannot be editted with the graphical interface.
  The new version of sqlitebrowser produces an error on attempting to open:

Having read some other posts this appears to be a 32 / 64 bit issue.  Am I out of luck or are there plans for a backward compatible version?

Anyway - thanks for a great application - even if it is stuck at 3.6.  (why is the new one 3.4.99?)

Thanks for your effort …. unfortunately no cigar.

Here's the console log - I'm sure it means a lot more to you than it does to me !

 I do - but haven't used it for a long time - 'brew doctor' threw up a bunch of problems that I'll have to resolve later.  I'll let you know if I can clean it up enough to use it - or do a re-install.

 ok - Homebrew seems to be working now.  What's the plan?

 That worked.  Making qt only took an hour….. 

Although it turns our I already had it installed in /opt/local/Library/Frameworks (21 Qt frameworks) and a remarkably large number of instances of sqlite3 in various places.  So my sqlitebrowser app is only 4.9 Mb - yours was ~ 19 including the three frameworks and libsqlite3.dylib.  So I'm assuming that my binary is very much dependent on being  on this machine.  Which is OK.

Anyway - somewhat surprisingly it seems to work just fine.

I appreciate your help.  If you ever need to test stuff I have machines running 10.3.9, 10.5.8, 10.7.5, and 10.10.4 and would be pleased to help out.

 Homebrew reacted negatively to the antique OS, so no luck there…… ('operating system too old').

  Building under Mac OS X 10.10 was broken using QT SDK 5.4. Add
missing macextras.

To be able to build against sqlcipher fix INCLUDEPATH for mac by removing the -I from PATH.
  When I launch version 3.7.0 on a Mac (10.10.2), the About DB Browser for SQLite page shows version 3.7.0.  But in the Finder, is shows version 3.4.99.

 My mistake (my Mac was always launching the old version) -- close it.
  Together with amount of rows returned, the amount of time the query took is the most important info if the query is successful. This info is at the bottom of the success/error pane. Could that info be on the first line together with the amount of rows? E.g. "5 Rows returned  in 115ms from:\n"
 @justinclift Yes, this issue may be closed as well
  Since most screens are more wide then high and query texts rarely occupy the screen's entire width,  the space in the "Execute SQL" tab could be used more efficiently if the query field could take up the entire left part of screen and the result/feedback fields were stacked on the right side.

Of course, the possibility to resize the left/right panes would be a bonus.
 Wow, this is truly swift!

I'll have a look tomorrow...
 The views are not expanding vertically...

Having considered the aesthetics, I still prefer the success/error pane to be stacked underneath the results pane. The editing of the query is the main task in this window hence its view should be most comfortable/efficient.
 @justinclift Sure I will with this amount of speed and effort put in by MKleusberg... :-)
 @MKleusberg @justinclift  Just tested the nightly build of July 10th. It works like a charm! 
- I've got a 50% increase in vertical  space, which gives me much more oversight when editing and testing my queries.
- I also like I don't need to scroll down the entire success/error pane any more to see the performance figure of the query.

Thank you! I compliment you on your responsiveness....

Just out of curiosity, why is the query repeated in the success/error pane? I don't see an added value over the same text in the query pane. Wouldn't messages like "no such column: l.locationId" or "5 rows returned in 52ms" be enough on their own? 
 @justinclift Yes from my point of view this issue can be closed. Thanks for your support.
  or Remove files that don't exist anymore, or both.

It would be good to have this extra menu item in the File menu, a bit like Notepad++
 hey, i will try later today, thanks
 sorry about the delay, confirmed working, thanks. 
  22 days in, still no portable 3.7.0 as far as i can see

possible to get a portable version released? 
 great, thanks :)
  It would be a great addition if the `Table name` field would be auto completed by default with the file's name without the extension.

So if I'm trying to import a table from the file named `my_first_table.sql`, the `Table name` field would contain `my_first_table`, obviously, with the possibility to change it.
 @justinclift, sure, but I don't know how
 It's working great! Thanks.
  Even with two tables, the dropdown is unnecessary small, it should **not** have arrows for such small dropdown.

 `OS X Yosemite 10.10.3` and `DB4S Version 3.7.0`
 Somehow it's solved, the list is now much bigger, and, for a small number of tables, there's no need for scroll. I'll close this issue and reopen it if the bug reappears.
  Im having a similar to issue #89 but with the cells  content color
I tried changing all the colors in preferences and none seemed to work

  Problem:
Current software can display numbers only in decimal format.For my current use sqlite as a database,  many items are created in hex format. Not comfortable read them in decimal format.
Suggestion:
Every display of data has two options, decimal or hex. Let user to choose.
 For me, I prefer to display it in Browse Data tab.  For example, in the attached picture, I prefer the item "diag_msg_def_id" to be displayed in hex format because the item are defined in hex format in my software application.  

Thank you for your efforts!  
 Yes, your proposal is exactly what I want.😊
 Wonderful, I have tried and like it. Thanks!
 A little suggestion for hexadecimal display. Instead of  "printf('%x', `an item id`) ", "printf('0x%x', `an item id`)" may be better. 
 After I select an display type for an item, then exit the database. Next time, I enter this database, I still have to re-select the display type for this item. I know the reason is that the database does not remember my selection. Could this problem be solved? 
 I have a lot of BLOBs that I need to display in a hex format, so I made a small patch.

 @justinclift I have updated my profile with my name. I would prefer not to give out my email address.
 You're welcome :)
 Happy to see this new feature. I updated to master and tested it out--thanks for the work to do this.

I'm not seeing a way to display values in a decimal format. Am I missing something? 

If I change from default to hex, I get the proper conversion in the text box: `printf('0x%x',`Value`)`, I press ok and see the values. I then right click on the cell and choose `edit display format` and see the drop down now shows custom. I'm not able to actually type in the box, though. Is this expected?
  Add backtick formatting to highlight required packages and file names.

contacts2.db from Android 4.4.4 (HTC One M8 DS)
 DB loads fine after clicking Yes once or 30 times No :) I can't open some tables (same errors), but can export them to CSV.
Win 8.1 64-bit 3.7.0
  I've created a table called 'android_metadata' with a field called 'locale'.

Then I go to browse data and press "New Record" and get the following error:

"Error adding record:
 near ")": syntax error (INSERT INTO 'android_metadata' VALUES ();)"

I guess its because I didn't enter any value to inserto to the DB, but there's no field to do it.

If i run the command from the "Execute SQL tab" it works fine.

I'm using Win8.1 x64

Thank you
 I'm sorry for the long delay to reply.
I've just downloaded version 3.7.0 yesterday.

Those where my first steps into DBBrowser. Afterwards I added a few more tables and they worked fine, but this one still didn't.

I created a new db following "i think" the same steps and the table worked fine, but when I open my first file the error still happens.

  Hi,
When opening a table that includes fields that are defined with COLLATE NOCASE a scary message box is displayed (see "Collation warning.jpg").
Trying to sort the table according to such a field gives wrong results both when trying to run a query (see "Wrong sorting using query.jpg") and when clicking the field header (see "Wrong sorting.jpg").
For comparison, the commercial SQLite Maestro application gives no warning and has no problem with the sorting (but of course it's not free).
Is there a solution for that?
Thanks,
Yaron Bank

 Hi,
Thanks for your answer.
I really chose 'Yes'.
When I choose 'No' the sorting is really OK.
But the message is still scary...
If I always chose 'No' will I be safe from harming my database?
Is there a way to set the application to always work with 'No', so I don't have to click 'No' the 1st time I open a table with COLLATE NOCASE fields?
Thanks,
Yaron Bank
 Hi,
I thank you all for your answers.
Still, I want to be sure if I got it right that if I always chose 'No' for the message box I'd be on the safe side. If so, that would be good enough for me.
Thanks for your help,
Yaron Bank
 Thanks a lot for all the commenters.
This has been very helpful.

  Sometimes I use YYYYMMDD format as the user_version in a database to know when it was last modified. It is stored and displayed correctly when using the SQLite3 command line:

```
sqlite> PRAGMA user_version = 20150623;
sqlite> PRAGMA user_version;
20150623
```

However, when viewing the database from DB4S, the User_Version will not be displayed correctly (it will be 10000) if the value is higher than 10000.

According to SQLite3 (https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_schema_version) the user_version is a 32-bit signed integer (maximum value is 2,147,483,647).

```
sqlite> PRAGMA user_version = 2147483647;
sqlite> PRAGMA user_version;
2147483647
```
 Thanks for the quick reply and fix. I will test it tomorrow and get back to you.
 Yes, it is working. The User_Version is displayed correctly now. Thanks a lot.
  Function `setFont()`, without params, sets font for all lexems types. .
To set default font color to black I used `sqlLexer->setColor(Qt::black, QsciLexerSQL::Default)`.
That's also keeps numbers color with aquablue color

And it doesn't  looks very clever now, it thinks that every not special english SQL word is table or column name.

I compared it with old (before Scintilla) appearance:

![workspace 1_065](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5500999/8290579/2dca5b18-194e-11e5-93aa-478376843c6e.png)
  There is some old bug which presented from version 3.6. Look at this picture (first line) that's how it looks now, cyrillic characters (out of comments and quotes) are drawn with different font:
![image 10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5500999/8280145/0e3f9ea2-190d-11e5-84ce-87f600c57cda.png)

That's how it was in version 3.5.1 and probably the way it should be:
![image 6](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5500999/8280115/c6f13772-190c-11e5-8a12-39bb50c75e8c.png)

There is the test string:

``` SQL
абвгдеийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя
-- абвгдеийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя
SELECT *
FROM Student
WHERE name like 'Александр%'
```
 This problem is presented also on windows and linux. Also changing font size doesn't affect size of this characters. Looks like It's also affect arithmetic characters and digits:
![db browser for sqlite - -home-m-mmk-_akarin-lessons-lessons- -students dbs_058](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5500999/8283570/383d5aa4-1922-11e5-9d4d-816f290e2124.png)

Maybe this is some special UTF8 digits, here the another test string:

``` SQL
абвгдеийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюяqwerty
-- абвгдеийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя
SELECT 1234567890-=/+,.\|
FROM Student 
WHERE name like 'Александр%'
```
 I have tried to compile binded example, changed font. 

``` cpp
...
textEdit->setUtf8(true);
QsciLexerSQL *lex = new QsciLexerSQL(this);
lex->setFont(QFont("Andale Mono", 20));
textEdit->setLexer(lex);
...
```

This is what I got. All as it should be:

Some characters a bit bolder but all the rest is ok.
 I found out that if make this small fix in SqlTextEdit::reloadSettings() function, everything starts to work, but I'm not sure will it broke something or not...

``` cpp
...
defaultfont.setPointSize(PreferencesDialog::getSettingsValue("editor", "fontsize").toInt());

// sqlLexer->setDefaultFont(defaultfont); // comment this line
sqlLexer->setFont(defaultfont); // and replace with this line
setupSyntaxHighlightingFormat("comment", QsciLexerSQL::Comment);
...
```

 Ok, let me try =)
  I tried to delete a column via the "Modify Table" popup. Selecting the column and clicking on "Remove" brought up a popup that said "No error", but the column remained. The SQL log for the app shows:

SAVEPOINT sqlitebrowser_rename_column
CREATE TABLE `sqlitebrowser_rena... <string can not be logged, contains binary data> ...
INSERT INTO sqlitebrowser_rename_column_new_table SELECT`_ID`,`name`,`local_path_template`,`is_localized`,`is_automatic`,`file_set_id`FROM`FileInfo`;
DROP TABLE`FileInfo`;
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT sqlitebrowser_rename_column;

which I interpret to mean that a) the rollback means that the operation failed, despite the "No error" popup, and b) perhaps binary data in the CREATE TABLE statement is not helping, either? (Could this be a side-effect of the new UTF-8 support?)
 Yes, I do have tables that reference FileInfo with foreign keys. It would have been nice to get clearer error messages or logs, but... you get what you pay for :-}
 Thanks for asking. I'm making an assumption here (yes, I could try it out, but... :-) that the sqlite API reports an error message if you try to delete a table, or rows in a table, that can't be deleted due to a FK constraint. So if sqlite's error message(s) could be displayed in the popup, instead of it displaying "No error", that would be a big help. If that's not feasible, then even "Unknown Error" would be better. As it was, the "No error" lulled me into thinking that indeed no error had occurred. (Maybe "No error" was displayed not to mean that no error had occurred, but rather that an error _had_ occurred but the browser couldn't determine what the error was.)

I realize this is asking quite a bit more, but: It would be great if, when I try to delete a table or column that's referenced by a foreign key, the browser could tell me in advance of execution "You can't do that; it's got foreign keys pointing to it."
 Thank you! Hi, all,

I'm very sorry for not getting back to you on this. The short story is that
I _think_ that it worked, but I no longer have access to the database where

Dan  Hi,
I have a problem running sqlitebrowser on a Windows 7 (Home Premium SP1 32-bit) machine. Installation runs fine, but DB Browser (Version 3.7.0) does not start. C++ redist (x86, version 10 and version 12) and .NET 4.5.2 are installed. The error message specifies Qt5Core.dll, Version 5.4.1.0 as the problem.
Would appreciate Help.

Thanks, Walter
 yes, I use the 32-bit download. Will paste screenshots.

  I have a file with a ".db" extension in android and I need to edit some data in that file and then export it back to ".db" extension but the only extension options are HTML, PDF, JSON, SQL or XML

How do I export the file back to its original extension and format in ".db"?
 Hi Justin thanks a lot for the insight!

I see the export options when I click "Export the database" - here's a screenshot

http://i.imgur.com/6t6brlp.png

How do I save the changes directly to the file?? (without exporting to a new file) That would be best!

I apologize for the dumb question but, what is DB4S?? Is it a ".db" file editor? I've googled it and pulled nothing (I'm new to databases btw!)
 Ooopsie!! Sorry xD
Well I just downloaded the zip and trying to make this DB4S work but there's no exe to launch the program!! How do get this thing to work? I can't wait to try it!
 Thanks so much guys it worked!
  I've used the SQLCipher instructions to allow my iOS app to create an encrypted database.  When I try to open it in sqlitebrowser I just continuously get prompted to enter the password.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.  Any ideas?
 It does use SQLCipher to do the encryption, what i don't know is what the page size is.  I wrote the app using the instructions on the SQLCipher website, but it doesn't say anything about what page size it's using.  What can I do to start investigating?
 Thanks for your help, I found the problem.  You mentioned building sqlitebrowser with a newer version of SQLCipher, well that's what I needed to do.  My iOS app was using an old version of SQLCipher.  Once I updated SQLCipher to the latest from github, I could read my databases in sqlitebrowser.  I even tested with sqlitebrowser 3.7.0 and it worked great.  Thanks for your help!
  Prior to version 3.6.0 windows allowed me to assign the ".gpkg" (GeoSpatial format built on a SQLite file) extension to be opened with sqlitebrowser.  With versions 3.6.0 and 3.7.0, Windows won't allow me to associate the file extension with sqlitebrowser.exe
 That was it exactly. I don't know how that didn't come up in my search for a fix. I greatly appreciate your prompt and precise reply :)

There is no provision for naming or changing fields.  The database is limited to default field names e.g. field1, field2, etc.
 Yes, it Is peculiar.  I am able to make entries on a contemporary build under OsX, but not under Centos Linux.  

Yes, I ran the build scripts locally; no error flags during the process.  My local build seemingly supports everything except revision of field names v.v. Importing a database created on a Mac, entering new data, changing old data, outputting to CSV, exporting, all work uneventfully.

  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30643061/sqlite-db-browser-invalid-operand-for-regexp 

I use DB Browser for SQLite version 3.6.0; SQLite Version 3.8.9. If I use regexp on a nullable column `revision` then `invalid operand` error is happened.

``` sql
    SELECT brand,revision FROM TDevice WHERE TDevice.revision regexp '^ASUS$';
```

Below is the schema:

``` sql
    CREATE TABLE `TDevice` (
    `id`    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `brand` varchar(128) NOT NULL,
    `model` varchar(128) NOT NULL,
    `revision`  TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
    );
```

After I replaced the NULL `revision` with empty string, then this issue fixed.

``` sql
    UPDATE TDevice SET revision='' WHERE revision IS NULL
```

I assume `regexp` should behave as `LIKE` operator, because `LIKE` operator can accept NULL text.
  When a table is empty an you export, (suing the first 2 checkbox)
it will export an additional ); just after the create table.
Consequently, It makes an error  when you import,
 It works with the latest nightly build.
Thanks !!!!
  Using File > Export > Database to SQL File:
Tables containing some data, are written correctly. But for empty tables, an extra ); is added on a new line, after the table.

Example:
correct:
CREATE TABLE "Table_with_data" (
  "object_id" INTEGER NOT NULL,
  "value" REAL NULL);
INSERT INTO `Table_with_data` VALUES (1,40.0);
INSERT INTO `Table_with_data` VALUES (2,90.0);

incorrect:
CREATE TABLE "Empty_table" (
  "object_id" INTEGER NOT NULL,
  "value" REAL NULL);
); <<<<<<<<<< redundant closing bracket

AFAICS, this occurs since v3.6.0 (export was correct in 3.5.1)
 OK, I will. I'll let you know if it works. Thanks for fixing!
 Hi Justin,

Just tested with the nightly build and confirm fixed. Export is correct. 
Thanks,

  Since sqlitebrowser is oriented towards end-users, it would be optimal if it could be executed from the command line to open a specific database, switch to a specific tab (e.g. Browse Data), open a specific table, and (if feasible) do so either "read-only" or "editing enabled".  

Example: 

"C:\Program Files (x86)\SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser.exe  --path=x:\mydb.db   --tab=browse   --table=mytable   --action=edit  "

This capability would enable sqlitebrowser to be executed from other applications within a specific context for a specific purpose while ensuring that the end-user gets exactly where they need to be.

Thank you for a great tool.
 Don't know about Windows, but with OSX you can do it yet.
  I have an existing database with utf-8 strings inside (tested with Eastern-European characters like čšťžýúä any others). Everything works OK, but when I try to import an .sql file (in "Execute SQL" tab, both "Open SQL file" or copy-paste the whole SQL file contents), the characters are replaced with ?.

This works fine with 32-bit version 3.5.1 (clean portable install) on the same database. I'm reverting to the old version for now.

  On Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 (6.1.7601), the dialog message box, "sqlitebrowser.exe - System Error" is displayed with the following message: "The program can't start because MSVCR120.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."

I uninstalled and resinstalled sqlitebrowser.exe, but that did not work.

I then installed the Visual C++Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 from: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=40784 and installed for 64bit OS. The application then launched successfully.

I'm not a developer, but I suspect that this DLL from MSFT should either be included with your installation or a prerequisite. Hope this helps.
  Hi,

I just downloaded and opened version 3.6.0, and there seems to be an issue with the Browse Data feature. When I open my database and browse data, sqlitebrowser shows all of my BLOB columns as being occupied with BLOB, when in fact only a subset of them are (as revealed by browsing with version 3.5.1, and my work with this database). I'm running Mac OSX Yosemite (10.10.3). Please let me know if you need any more information.

  Each time I click on a cell, its editing window will be opened on different positions and it makes me move the window to other positions because the save changes button will be placed under the taskbar.
 @justinclift You should set certain positions for such windows. Currently If you edit some cells without moving the window, after four or more times you have to move the window to other positions because you cannot click the save changes button! And that's the problem.
  Probably it's me being a non-native speaker of English, but what you mean?

```

With v3.7.0 this query creates 2 lines in User log:

```
WITH RECURSIVE
  cnt(x) AS (VAL... <string can not be logged, contains binary data> ...
```

and 3 lines in Application log:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (WITH RECUR... <string can not be logged, contains binary data> ...
WITH RECURSIVE
  cnt(x) AS (VAL... <string can not be logged, contains binary data> ...
```

With nightly build, the 4 lines of the query are copy/paste in User log:

```
WITH RECURSIVE
  cnt(x) AS (VALUES(1) UNION ALL SELECT x+1 FROM cnt WHERE x<1000000)
SELECT x FROM cnt;

```

And 6 lines in Application log:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (WITH RECURSIVE
  cnt(x) AS (VALUES(1) UNION ALL SELECT x+1 FROM cnt WHERE x<1000000)
SELECT x FROM cnt);
WITH RECURSIVE
  cnt(x) AS (VALUES(1) UNION ALL SELECT x+1 FROM cnt WHERE x<1000000)
SELECT x FROM cnt LIMIT 0, 50000;
```

I would really like to help improve DB4S but I'm unable to build the source code actually.
 I checked the latest nightly,
the commit from @MKleusberg is working perfectly.
Well done :+1: 
  When you close a database, "Execute SQL" tab get cleared.
There is no warning about that.
Logs got cleared too (user & application).
 I tested 3.6.99 nightly build.
It happens too.
 Added to the list :wink: 
  Beside me, anyone else could find useful to be able to open an in-memory sqlite database ?
https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html
 I know you can't open an existing in-memory database.
I was thinking this could be useful for testing purpose only.
Instead of creating a database file which need to be dropped / deleted when you want to test something else or test a database generation script.
Not a priority enhancement, I admit :wink: 
 Maybe, need to take time and look into the code.
Btw, is there a howto build/compile DB4S somewhere ?
or at least a "required" list of things I need to be able to build it ?
I work with visual studio 2013 community
 Thanks for the link
I will check and report
  There is problem in execute SQL tab when query includes Unicode characters for example Japanese or Chinese kanji. All characters turns to question marks.
  Unrecognized token: "@" when query a column that use @ symbol
 CREATE TABLE `Testing` (
    `id_@`  text,
    `name`  text,
    `adress`    text)

select id_@ from testing
  The new 64-bit version is obviously not an update but a completely separate program to any existing 32-bit installation. Certainly not a bug by any means, but perhaps a note could be included somewhere for unaware users.

I was unaware of sqlitebrowser's 32-bit-only history and just assumed it had always come in 64-bit offerings when I saw the 64-bit download. As a result, my head got scratched a few times when it kept asking me to install 3.60 even after updating. It only dawned on me when I uninstalled 3.60 and still saw 3.40 sitting in my x86 folder :)
 Well, I can think of at least two ideas.

The most useful spot would be in the 'There is a new version, please download' pop-up alert that appears, since it's what triggers most users to download the new version in the first place. Having such a note would clutter up the alert window though, and wouldn't be relevant to someone updating to a 32-bit version or (eventually) from a 64-bit version.

The neater solution is to have the installer detect existing 32-bit installations as well and uninstall them before continuing. This turns into a much bigger implementation though, with the need to migrate user configs/etc to the new directory in addition to the 32-bit detection.

Not a critical issue now but maybe something to think of down the line? I'm sure this happens in countless other projects too- maybe others have addressed the issue elegantly before.
 Can do! Need to work on some projects at the moment but will be sure to
find some time this weekend for you. Great to hear about your progress :)
  Hi, I would like to suggest a "Close database" button beside the "new" and "open" buttons.

A better enhancement would be a tab in settings to select active buttons in a list of possibilities allowing users a bit of customization.
 I don't know about Qt
I'm a bit skilled with C++ but I'm not up to date since I didn't used it for 5 years
I could contribute with code, I have to free up time
  When writing unicode characters in executeSqlTab, it instantly becomes a question mark "?"...

текст -> ?????
  Howdy

When I add a new field, it adds the field. However I cannot change the name after I save it. It keeps the name it was created with (e.g. field24). I have tried restarting, and I cannot delete the row. Only add. When I try to delete the row I get a popup that says "no error".

Thoughts or advice?

I tried with 3.5 as well, still won't work. I can provide the database.
 Oh hey sorry!

I havent used this for over a year. You can close this issue!
  Translated a lot of things.

Functions (for instance) were not translated.

Used LibreOffice's built-in Brazilian Portuguese dictionary to find some typos at the end.

Open for discussion about my choices.
 muito obrigado :D 
 De nada. (We greeted each other in our language).
  Hello, 

   Congratulations for your software. I'm the lead developper of the project : EduPython (http://edupython.tuxfamily.org/) which is a portable python distribution for French Teachers (this may excuse my bad english ;) ). Edupython is under free licence CeCILL-B.
    1 - Can I include your sqlitebrower in my next EduPython distribution ? 
    2 - Can I help you by translating sqlitebrowser in french ? 

Thanks for your answer,

 Hi,

```
Thanks a lot for this very good new ! Yes I can include it in my 
```

python distrib, because it contains, Python engine, IDE (pyscripter), 
and tools (see the screen shot). I already do this with a very old 
version of SQlite Databas Browser.

Best regards,
Vincent
 @magicvinni if you need help with doing a pull request you can just ask, however the GitHub help, StackExchange and Google should also be useful. My suggestion to you is that you do it all in one commit, so just take your time and do the one commit. If you don't it's fine, we have commit merging instructions on the wiki
 Hi,

Thanks. I saw, with the usage, I need to improve it a little...
  If no database is loaded it would be really helpfull if you could drag one on the main app window.
 Strange, now it works, sorry 
But for completeness: 
Win 7 Pro
DB Browser Version 3.6.0
Qt Version 5.4.1
SQLite Version 3.8.9
fresh install from today
  Self-explanatory: I'm using sqlitebrowser to examine data but only the affiliated software must be permitted to modify the DB in any way! Lest a slip of the mouse occur, I respectfully request that you folks implement an Open Read-Only capability down the road or ASAP. Hey, THANKS!

Y'know, it's actually not a crucial thing. You'd have to be a dumbo to click on "Write changes". So let the reader be the judge of the value of this request.
 I have just tried opening a database, issuing some queries and then doing a binary diff, nothing changes, which is good. I then marked the database file read-only and when I tried to add a row I got an error message. So, DB Browser for SQLite does seem to do the write thing. As a workaround I would mark the file read-only to avoid problems. However it would still be good for us to add an enhancement displaying "read only mode" and also handling the UI better.

I tested on Windows by the way.
 'Glad to see you're pursuing this. You said as a workaround you could "mark the file read-only". I'll just go ahead and assume you mean by that to enter the appropriate direct command under the program's "Execute SQL" tab. I confess to and apologize for my utter ignorance of SQL command lingo but no matter. You say you may integrate the read-only ability into the UI and I am thankful!
 @JoeErsatz sorry, I meant use your operating system to mark the file read-only. So, before you load the database file in DB Browser for SQLite, find the file with your operating system utilities and mark the file read-only
 Windows. Hey no, I get you now -- I actually had considered momentarily that was your meaning but concluded otherwise. No I cannot mark the file read-only because it's over a LAN but more importantly the software controlling the DB is constantly running (at that other LAN node). 
 @justinclift for the scenario @JoeErsatz has outlined the only option is "Open Read Only" within DB4S. Given this is labelled as an enhancement and we have clearly outlined why then we just need to wait for a pull request or similar
 Yes, it is still of interest to me. Many earnest thanks for your efforts in regard to my request! But I won't be testing it via the nightly build. Instead, I harbor every confidence that you guys know precisely what you're doing, and if the feature appears in the next release then it will be employed. I presume the implementation of read-only open in sqlitebrowser is a proverbial "walk in the park". Thanks!  OS Windows Prof 7 x 64. Both versions x86 & x64 not prints russian symbols in SQL Window
  Found this one while translating. Not sure where else I should change it. (The pt_BR translation already accounts for it).
 Will do.
 Got other 2!
 Wait! @MKleusberg What do you think about csvparser.h line 13? "provde"?
 @justinclift Mind issuing a `cat src/csvparser.h | grep provde`? Not sure exactly what is that.
 @MKleusberg Agreed. It makes sense now. I am not squashing these commits as it would break their atomicity.

Unless there is stuff that still needs checking or rereading, I am done.
 I don't believe there are any other typos left. At least not in comments or strings.

Glad to know that.

 @justinclift  I'm waiting new version ;), because I need quick view of blobs. I already reported about it and looks it will be reverted back in it.
  Add the ability to build a plot of the points only.
 Yes exactly
 Checked version of mac and win. In the version for the win chart with points at the vertices displayed incorrectly.

 @schdub, yes, data is equivalent. [DB](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2957764/Gortrans.db)
If choose point shape Disk on windows build, plot displays similar mac build.
   I believe I tested this well enough to be sure. Started browser, opened a DB, closed browser. On next start, browser went back to looking for DBs in generic user folder. Since I mostly use the browser to do quick checks on previously-opened DBs, this is a usability drop.  I uninstalled the latest version and re-installed the previous, so I do not have version 3.6.0 to test further.
 This has come up a few times with 3.6.0 and also earlier than that. The nightly builds have some updates in. So I would suggest either using them or go to 3.6.0 and use the "Most Recently Used" database on the file menu. Which sounds like it might work better for you.
  Hi,

Every time i start SQLite Browser it pops up with "New version available". I can click "OK" and "Don't show again". Clicking OK obviously warrants the popup to show again when i start the application again (till i update), but the "Don't show again" button should just stop me from seeing the "New version available" popup. Also after restarts. Right now it seems to behave the same as clicking OK since restarting the application will still show me the popup...

And yes, if i update the popup is obviously gone, but that isn't the point of this bug report :)

Regards,
Mark
 Now that is interesting!
The values are:

disable : true
major : 3
minor : 6
patch : 6 <-- weird one! It's in the future (3.6.0 is the latest version at this moment).

I've had these same symptoms on two computers. I can only access one, but i suspect the other one also has a patch version in the future. Setting the patch value to 0 seems to fix it for me (for now).
 I was using 3.5.1. I just updated to 3.6.0 (i see you folks updated Qt to 5.4.1, nice!).
I think this bug can be closed now. I will open a new one if i encounter this issue again on 3.6.0 or higher.
  I run the installer for the 64 bit build, and every time I try and run it, it fails to run and shows the following dialog:

![http://i.imgur.com/ZTo3FeK.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZTo3FeK.png)

I am running windows 8.1 64 bit, and the 32 bit installer version works fine
 Was about to raise this issue myself, the 64bit does the same thing on Windows 7. Likewise, the 32bit version works fine.
 That was my problem, I had the 2012 64-bit version installed, but not the 2013 version. Works fine after that's been installed on Windows 7.
 @justinclift then the installer should definitely be updated to download / include the installer for vcrdst2013, because i'm on the latest 'production' windows operating system and I didn't have those run time components. Let alone anyone on windows 7 or anything earlier. 

You should be able to include the installer that is on that microsoft website you linked in the windows installer builds, as the license is meant for exactly that. 
  Hello,
trying to type Non-English characters and more specifically Greek at the 'Execute SQL' panel or trying to load an SQL file containing Greek characters they appear as English language question marks( ? ). Why is this happening ? I would like to note that data containing Greek characters stored in the database's tables are presented correctly in the Grid when a select statement is executed at the 'Execute SQL' panel. See attached picture for an example of what is going on.

Thank you very much.

Sqlite Browser version used : 3.6.0
OS: Windows 8.1 Pro English 32bit

![pict1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12430967/7614224/1f5199ea-f99e-11e4-8f04-a9666a57a12b.jpg)
 Hi again,

thanks for the quick response and sorry for the delayed comeback.
Well, the problem is partially fixed using the nightly build suggested. Now typing Greek characters directly at the 'Execute SQL' panel works as expected but the problem remains when trying to load an SQL file containing Greek characters that is saved using the default Windows ANSI encoding - if it's saved as UTF-8 then it loads properly(Greek characters are shown correctly). This is a minor issue but it would be nice to work either way. I say this because working also with other databases like MS Sql Server for example loading the same SQL file in Sql Server Management Studio using either encoding(ANSI or UTF-8) files are loaded without issues.

Thank you very much.
 hi there, I can't write persian words in sql panel and I don't know what should I do? help me please.
  Please change dialog title and message to reflect the actual choices.

@justinclift suggested "NOCASE collation does not handle multi-byte characters"
 The text didn't change from 3.9.1 to 3.9.99.  :confused:
 I'm not sure about that. What will happen if you choose "No"? From a purely UI pov a warning with just one button has the same effect: you execute the query anyway. So what the user (me) needs to know is what effect will the choices have. 

Something like:

Title: "NOCASE collation does not handle multi-byte characters. Proceed? "
Message: 
"A table in this database requires a special collation function '%1' "
"that this application can't provide without further knowledge.\n"
"If you don't proceed, NNN.\n"
"If you do proceed, YYY.\n"
"Be aware bad things can happen to your database. Create a backup!"

Replace the YYY and NNN with the effects.
I'd also like to know what those "bad things" are. 😄 

3.10 version name 👍 😆
 >  I'm not sure what those effects are either. 

My point exactly. 😉   In 3.6.0, In Exequte SQL Editor

chinese and Korean letters crash.

but 3.5.1 is normal.

for example

insert into TextureInfo values ('1','1','1','1','ADDITION','덧셈','加法','jiāfǎ','加','jiā','法','fǎ','','','','','','','1','心算加法','xīnsuànjiāfǎ','덧셈을 암산하다.','20150501','120000','','');
 thanks, your rapid reply. I use 3.5.1 well. Later I will download upVersion.

One more question, I hope you see attch file ==> ex01.mp4.

'jiāfǎ' word display well at Editor but not well at Grid Cell.

ǎ letter is crashed.

I want to know Only my pc's font problem or bug.

There is no problem on Coding. Only showing problem.
 Thanks to your good reply. It's good to know this problem.

I hope  you and your team go well.
 In 3.6.0 editor crash but grid is good.
In 3.5.1 editor is good but grid crash.

[image: 본문 이미지 1]
 Okay, Now I downed 3.7.0 and tested.

Everything is OK. There are no problems in both editor and grid.

Thanks to your continuous cares.

Also, thanks to MKleusberg.
  move field up sometimes make a crush, and most of the time I have sth like this:

FreeBSD 10.1
SQLBrowser 3.5.1
 @MKleusberg sure, I'll check it out soon.
 Version 3.6.0
Qt Version 4.8.7
SQLite Version 3.8.11.1

Still the same
 Actually I think that I make some mistake.
https://freshports.org/databases/sqlitebrowser/ According this, it should be 3.7.0 version, rather than my 3.6.0. Seems interesting, why `pkg upgrade` didn't catch this scenario.
Doesn't use FreeBSD for a while, so...
Will check and repeat in further. 
Sorry for worrying.
If problem still take place, I'll write to port maintainer.
 Yes, it continuous even with 3.7.0 compiled from ports.
I invited the maintainer coder@tuxfamily.org, so It's nothing I can do more.
 2 years past since.
I'm no more FBSD everyday user ;D  No .qm files are installed anywhere with make install command.
Also, seems like the program searches for "translations" directory only in directory with the executable, e.g. in /usr/bin.
Sorry for my english.
 Ubuntu linux.
 @justinclift  I am preoccupied with other projects and helping my Juniors with their thesis, no promises but i can "try" to look into this by creating a window in my very tight schedule (my apologies).

:smiley:  
 Yep, now language is selectable and works fine. Many thanks.
 Thanks  @schdub  @justinclift , I will package the changes on testing ppa asap. :smile:  :smiley:
  Hello.

I've found one instance sqlitebroser returns one wrong row on 3.5.1 and 3.6.0. SqliteAdmin-0.8.3.2 works fine and so does every other software I tested. Unfortunately I'm working under NDA so I can't publish the query or the database but I can send them privately on request.
 I suppose I shouldn't be surpised by your response speed any more. :grin: 
Thanks @justinclift
 It works. Never crossed mi mind to choose 'No' when asked 'Proceed?'. :grin: That dialog is kind of misleading. Maybe handle it as a separate issue?

Anyways, thanks @schdub.
 Issue #308 

I think that's about it for this issue. Multibyte nocase collation will come in due time so creating another issue for it won't help. Right?
  Hello, I had just fresh install sqlite 3.6 64 bit edition and I got 0xc00007b problem. indicates that a 32-bit application is trying to load a 64-bit dll. maybe it's my windows? i'm not thinking so...

oh, sqlite browser is built by Qt!
 windows 7 home premium 64 bit (updated)
 Good to know that it is known to work.
thank you for replying, @justinclift . I had just known that SQLite 3.6 requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013. I actually have the 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013 for both x86 and x64 architecture.

Oh, okay, my bad that I did not notice the note.

it solves the problem.
would be handy if the installer comes with an installer for VC2013 Redist for VS2013 tho. I had the VC2013 redist only..

thank you for reminding me, @justinclift 
 No, Installing Visual C++ 2013 Redist (x86 / x64) does not fix the problem.
but,
installing Visual C++ 2013 Redist (in my case is x64 (I take 64-bit version)) **FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2013** fixes the problem.

marking as solved.
thank you!
 @justinclift Hello again..

weird, why do I need to reinstall (repair) my Visual C++ 2013 Redist for Visual Studio 2013 every time I reinstalled (in my case, I updated) SQLite Browser.. does the installer replace any file?
  Scrolling in one direction at a time is not possible. Very difficult to stay in same column when scrolling down because it scrolls left or right at the same time. Locking first scroll direction would be a big improvement. 
 Sorry, my laptop fan just died so can't retrieve version. But just update to latest release a few weeks ago on OS X Yosemite. 
 Trackpad for scrolling. I'll have to wait about a week for my new fan, then I can try latest release. 
 Yes, wide and tall databases
 OK, just received my new fan and MBPro is working again. Found that my installed sqlitebrowser version was 3.6.0. So already had the newest (other than nightlies which I haven't tried yet)
 Just wanted to comment that i'm still seeing this scrolling behavior in v3.7.0
But it may actually be more of an OS X issue.

edit: I've made some adjustments to (almost all) of my trackpad settings and the scrolling has become much better. As I suspected, something in the OS was causing the issue. After a reboot, and reopening the database, scrolling is much more responsive and not as "wild" as before. Please consider this issue closed for me.
  Since 3.6.0 sql editor font is not monospace. Please support font customization.
 Wow! You just broke about every response time record I've ever heard of.

 Thanks. I'll let you know you nailed it as soon as I can. :smile: 
 Nailed it. Not that there was any doubt about it. :grin: 
:+1: @justinclift, @MKleusberg 
  Previous versions were all build statically. So I could have exe file in one directory.. The 3.6.0 is build dynamically with a bunch of files which is not very nice. You should also link to the msvcrt statically.
  As the title says I'm having trouble registering the `*.db` file extension. When I double click such a file I'm asked to select the program to open it with. When I navigate to `C:\Program Files\sqlitebrowser3\bin` and choose `sqlitebrowser.exe` it is not added to the "Open with" window and thus I can't select it as the default option.
 It seems like the same issue, but I didn't find it using the search. I'll attempt the solution later this week and let you know.
 Yes that solution has worked for me. I changed the value of `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\sqlitebrowser.exe\shell\open\command` from `"C:\Program Files (x86)\SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser.exe" "%1"` to `"C:\Program Files\SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser.exe" "%1"` and the extension can once again be registered. Thanks for the help.
  Hi.

I am not sure why, but I have tried exporting my database to SQL using dbviewer. Then, I go to my website and use phpmyadmin to import the SQL file, and I keep having errors. It does not seem to understand the begin transaction statement. I have tried removing it, but it keeps saying that "integer" is not a valid SQL statement either.

What can I do to import my database on my website?

Thank you very much!
  Hi guys,
I've got tables with fields marked as NotNull. Tried to add a new record which returns "Error adding record: NOT NULL constraint failed".
I'm guessing the logic defaults everything to NULL for the user to change.

Current workaround: uncheck not null fields, add new record, populate with requisite data, recheck not null fields

It's only create a simple database,not create a sqlcipher database (encryption).
 ok. i will download the sqlcipher version. and try it latter.
Thanks.
 ok. i have download SQLCipher Version 3.8.6 .
But when i create a database it also tips a simple database and then create a table .
how to create a SQLCipher database with my custom key ????
Thanks
 like this https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher
 I have now started a Wiki page on this, happy for others to improve it
 yeah.great job~ thanks.
  Look for an installed antlr v2, and if available use it instead of its embedded copy.
  Just installed for the first time. When attempting to run it, I get "sqlitebrowser.exe is not a valid Win32 application". No warnings about DLLs or other dependencies missing. I downloaded the correct binary for my CPU/OS architecture (both 32-bit) and I have MSVC redistributable 2013 installed. Is Windows XP not supported anymore?
 Well, as I am sure you know, Microsoft don't support Windows XP any more. I don't believe there was a conscious decision to drop it though. Can you confirm you have SP2 applied? Oh and could you try the nightly download for Windows from the repository home page?
 Even though I am on XP I stay as up to date as I can on things, so I have the latest service pack and all other updates available of course. I will try the nightly build and report back.

EDIT: Yep, the nightly build runs.
 I also run XP SP3 with VC++2013.
just wanted to confirm that the nightly build 3.6.99 works fine, but sqlitebrowser-3.6.0v2-win32.exe fails with same error that Nisto previously reported.
Will there be a nightly build of 3.7.7 for us to try?
 Yes indeed, am perfectly happy to keep using the nightly version for now, thank you.
 I can confirm that sqlitebrowser-3.6.0v3-win32.exe works on my win XP sp3. Thanks :+1: 
 Testing a bit around with the portable version, I just noticed, that version 3.9.0 (to be precise: the portable launcher) on Windows XP shows an error message, that it requires at least Vista.
Is this a bug or has support of Win XP officially been dropped? I couldn't find an info about that in the release notes.
  Improve the build and run of tests:
- allow the build of tests within the main build, so there's no need for a separate build for them, and ctest works with them
- split the `sqlb-unittests` in two separate (and different) tests
 > This is failing in Travis CI btw.

I guess that's because the build instructions still do the old build way. Is it something I can fix, or you need to adjust something in travis?
 > Can you maybe rabase them

Yep, done.
  The small patch series improves the handling/testing of unicode (non-ASCII) data in the `TestImport` test.
 That's ok for me.
  In 'Execute SQL' tab:
Non-latin1 characters become question marks (`?`) if I try to type them.

If I copy or type the following SQL and execute it:

``` sql
select unicode('α');
```

it becomes:

``` sql
select unicode('?');
```

and the result is `63` (Unicode value for question mark(`?`)).

I'm using 3.6.0 on Windows 8.1.
 All right, the nightly build fixed the problem.
  In the 'structure' as well as the 'DB Schema' (aren't those two not the same ref to the table called 'sqlite_master' and therefore can better carry only one of aforementioned names [my suggestion 'Schema', bc it's called like that in most books and RFC's] ?) window is a column 'type' (may be one of the four on the left - 'table', 'view', 'index', 'trigger' [ eventually 'meta', but in practice I've never seen such a type... ] so to save space and avoid confusion to others and me you may safely remove it. My €0.02  
 Sorry I forgot the column-name 'Schema'. One may call it by name in sqlite_master  'SQL' (or lower case 'sql')

Another thing: it seems that the version with sqlcipher when created with 512 byte page_size is automatically changed to the default 1024. Is therefore a reason? 
  Data type isn't decided by column type, but user's decision on 'Edit database cell' dialog.
Note : This topic is discussed on issue #239.
 I see. I missed such a case.
At any case, `using QAbstractTableModel::setData` is a bad solution.

`setData` mehod I modified should be implemented as another method (not as overload), I guess.
The another method is like following.

``` cpp
bool setTypedData(const QModelIndex& index, bool isBlob, const QVariant& value, int role);
// or
bool setTypedData(const QModelIndex& index, int dataType, const QVariant& value, int role);
```
 @justinclift Sorry to be late. Now, I don't find another issue about this.
I'll modify code based on current trunk soon.

Now, I'm checking current branch for merging this feature.
Maybe, I'll finish all by next Sunday.
 I fixed 2 bugs that pointed by @MKleusberg.
1. prevention of in-place editing
2. the lack of tr()
 @justinclift Sorry about dirty commit history.
I packed these commits to one.
  Sorry for the lateness guys, I'm moving from one country to another so those last days are being pretty busy. I'll get back to this next week but no problem if you guys want to merge it :)

SEP has flagged at as fraud software and was reported on 5 users machines
 I have used SEP to scan the installers and extracted versions as well as Norton Internet Security (NIS) and no issues are found. However on a SEP box when I run the installer I get this:

![sep_scan](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1067355/7428265/7d5be9b8-efe5-11e4-91ae-2ba285957e0a.jpg)

Once you go past that everything is fine. All the above shows is that SEP has not seen this very much and is being cautious.

Where do you see this "flagged as fraud software"? A screenshot might help us.
 Click More info

Be interesting to see if someone has compromised the code or the exe file

I also know that SQL light was featured on Hak5. Popular online tech show
 I clicked "More Details" and can see this:

![sep_scan2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1067355/7429868/7690045e-f001-11e4-96ae-f65e377b1c12.jpg)

This tells me it is a "reputation" issue, it is unproven but some evidence it is trust worthy, less than 5 SEP users have seen it and it is new. All of which I would expect for a new release of software like this. I am not seeing the link to fraud software to be honest.
 Fraud software could be a exploited or compromised code even.

Eg someone makes there own executable and then find a way to uploads it to
the official website
 To me SEP is just saying I have not see this very much before. If you are concerned it is compromised then I suggest you download the code, study it and compile it yourself. Clearly if you find a problem in the code please open an issue
 I thought about the SHASUMS but if a hacked can replace the exe then replacing the SHASUMS is no big deal right?

For me Synamtec is doing the right thing, it is warning you of a low reputation file, but I guess we could ask how to avoid this, which is probably a good question.
 Geoff is getting the same error message as me. So the reputation and sha
hadh should be the same. and someone would need to label it as fraudware

its concerning. You can open a file these days and find your entire data
wiped, stolen or executable remotely phones home :)

adam
 I think generally Adam we all share your concerns, however this problem is not unique to this project, I have seen SEP (and NIS the consumer product) do this with other software, particularly with new releases.

@justinclift I suggest we close this issue and query Symantec about reputation warnings to see what, if anything, we can do? I am happy to pick this up with them if you want me to.
 No problem, happy to pick this up. Do you want me to provide any feedback in this issue, or close this and I'll raise a new one with any actions?
 @justinclift my conclusion is we would need to submit our new binaries to https://submit.symantec.com/whitelist/isv/ which seems worth a try to me. Would you like me to do this for the v3 files?

PS http://sqlitebrowser.org/ is pointing to the v2 Windows exe files, which needs updating
 @justinclift website looks better now, thanks! I know we mentioned e-mail via sqlitebrowser.org before but I can use my work e-mail, which is probably better, if you are okay with that?
 Leave it with me then and I'll see what happens, might be a "fire and forget"....
 Just been reading and...

```
To prevent false positive detections we strongly recommend vendors to
digitally sign their software with a class 3 digital certificate.
```

My guess is we would need to do so with the installer and executable. Any thoughts?
 Not forgotten but going slowly, sorry.

With large CREATE TABLE statements, the interface kinda messes up in those two interfaces (Database Structure tab, and the right side window, DB Schema), as it tries to show the full CREATE TABLE statement with all the newlines, tabs and spaces included. These CREATE TABLE statements are created by SQLAlchemy, so thats why they are formatted that way, but it theoretically could happen with manual written statements too if people like them to look pretty in the code.

Easier to show a screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/8bCmexZ.png

I would suggest making it so that the Database Structure tab, all the 'tables' are not so far apart (as it shows the large Create Table statement by default, and maybe have that as a drop down arrow as a child of the table, so it doesn't mess up the formatting/spacing of the table by default? 

And also for the DB Schema side window on the right, i dont think there is a need to show the full CREATE TABLE statement anyway, as you are already parsing out the individual columns anyway and showing the relevant part (per the column) right next to the column anyway. Maybe add entries for Foreign Keys and you won't need the whole CREATE TABLE statement?
 That option does exist! thanks.

I guess i just don't understand why we even have the 'text' schema there at all, what does 'column_name VARCHAR(200)' tell us that already parsed columns with the 'name' and 'type' information in the respective columns don't? I would support just getting rid of the text schema (except for maybe one place), and just have everything be available in the graphical tree view, including foreign keys, NOT NULL constraints, etc
 Another picture, this of MySQLWorkbench, a program that is basically like sqlitebrowser only for mysql, and it sorta has what i'm envisioning for the schema views, where everything is available in a tree like fashion and we don't really need the giant CREATE TABLE string...

  Click Open Database, then choose database file. Next click on Open Database - you'll see the User sesttings folder again, not previously selected folder. Actual for version 3.6.0
  https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions

It seems you cannot alter columns after they have already been made. Yet I don't see an option to set OnDelete actions for the Foreign Key.

Do you know how I can set this up so if a foreign key is deleted in a parent table then all columns with that key will have those values set to null?
 I'm trying to use ON DELETE CASCADE but it's not working.

eg. I have an order in Orders with order_id=3 and some rows in relationOrderProduct  with that order_id.
When I delete the order with id 3 in Orders shouldn't it delete the corresponding rows of relationOrderProduct? For some reason it doesn't. 
Have I made a mistake somewhere?
Thanks!
 Yes, foreign keys are enabled and the layout is as you say.

I'm doing something wrong but I don't know what. :p
  On the 32-bit version of sqlitebrowser for Windows (W7P x64), I can set sqlite files to automatically open with sqlitebrowser. However, I was unable to do this for the 64-bit version. Just letting you know. Thanks!
 I right click, "open with...", "Browse...", then select the sqlitebrowser executable "C:\Program Files\SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser3.exe". Normally, the application would then appear back in the application selection screen. In this case, however, it doesn't appear, so I can't select it. It would be useful to get confirmation.

p.s. I also just tried using the "Default Programs" route, but same issue.
 Had the same issue for the 64 bit version. I figured that the registry entry is still pointing to the wrong directory. So in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\sqlitebrowser3.exe\shell\open\command the value needs to be changed from "C:\Program Files (x86)..." to  "C:\Program Files..."
 If I remove HKCR\Applications\sqlitebrowser.exe and then associate with "c:\Program Files\sqlitebrowser3\bin\sqlitebroswer.exe" windows keeps the association. But if there is an exisiting shell\open\command (with an incorrect path) for the application it does not.
Maybe the installer made by cmake nsis generator works in a similar way. Without an explicit removal of that key it just leaves the exisiting?
 I had the same issue (Couldn't register the 64-bit as the default program after having the 32-bit).
The [solution](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/279#issuecomment-98643971) by @hko-gh worked for me.
 Well its _very_ basic but here's a start. I didn't know how to do a pull request on a wiki so https://github.com/maxslimmer/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Windows-File-Associations
 Having first edited @maxslimmer copy of the Wiki I have now coped this to the sqlitebrowser wiki and added the link.

@justinclift let me know if we need anything else doing but I think we can close this issue now like #296 
 I have seen other software do one of two things:
- put a check box in the installer, so users can opt in to file association if they want
- options in the preferences for file association

Pretty sure this is possible either way, another option is both. However I think we need to support multiple and possibly custom file extensions given sqlite files don't have a standard extension
 I guess we need a good wiki page and a Tweet? Or something like that anyway. Maybe http://sqlitebrowser.org/ should link direct to the wiki, as well as GitHub, some people might not know there is documentation in the form of the wiki on the GitHub site.
 Thanks, an option in the installer sounds excellent.  This would also help the users who had created associations by hand that subsequently got broken with renaming.

You will need to decide what extensions to use.  As a starting point for that, according to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/808499/what-is-the-best-extension-name-sqlite-database-files 

> Emacs expects one of db, sqlite, sqlite2 or sqlite3 in the default configuration for sql-sqlite mode
 A user preference in the program would be convenient.  However it needs to be done carefully because changing file associated settings needs temporary escalation to Administrator access.

I feel that the developers should choose either install time or a subsequent preference depending on implementation factors.  As a user, I would welcome and can adapt to either.
 Excellent.  One other thought - if possible please can the installer allow a reconfigure option to change the setting of any config options without forcing a reinstall.  Often when I am evaluating software, I don't want to take over existing extensions.  But then when I decide to use it to replace my existing software, I want to go back and enable the extensions.
  See bellow results of query.

  I downloaded the latest 3.6.0 and is reporting this missing .dll
  the Open Database button does not restore the last folder opended. It's allways opening on the same folder: my user folder.

OS: windows 7
 In my opinion, the last version's behaviour is more correct: allways open in the last folder selected but, someone else might not like it that way. It might be a matter of personal taste, I don't know.
 I reckon we might need a preference checkbox to keep everyone happy. Personally I expect "default location" the first time I ever use an app. Then on each subsequent start of the app I expect either default or last used. However once I have open a file I then expect the next open to start from there.

Anyway, how about a preference which is a combo box with some options:

"Open Database" directory
- default location as specified
- same as last file used
- same as last but default for new session

Ok, so not great UI design but just some thoughts.
 Thanks @MKleusberg I shall look forward to testing that in the nightly build.
 Hi justin, I installed version 3.7 and it works great! Everybody's happy!
  Howdy

I have two tables:
characters
weapons

My characters table has a column: weaponId
This I need to reference to the id in Weapons table.

In my weapons table I have made sure there is an id column, and its the primary key.

I have foreign keys allowed in my schema.

When I go to edit table, on the Characters table, and I click the 'weaponID' column, and I type in for the foreign key weapons (id) my SQL log looks as follows:

```
CREATE TABLE `characters` (
    `id`    INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    `weaponId`  INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY(`lweaponId`) REFERENCES weapons (id)
);
```

However when I click OK, the foreign key is not there at all. Its never saved (and I've tried weapons(id) as well to check if it was a formatting issue).

Can you advise what the issue may be? :)

PS I tried doing a manual SQL query too:

```
ALTER TABLE `characters` 
(
    ADD FOREIGN KEY (`weaponId`) REFERENCES `weapons`(id)
);

Error Log: near "(": syntax error: 
```
 @AnthonyUccello - How does the structure of your table `weapons` look like?
 @rp- By edit table I mean modify table. When I want to add a foreign key here:

 (Sorry for the typo weappons in the image, but the issue is the same regardless, I've tried weapons(id) and weapons (id), and manual SQL attempts).
 Updating to 3.6 fixed the issue. Closing this.

You guys work fast ^_^
  Running Windows 7, 64-bit OS.

I had a 32-bit version of 3.5.1. This time around I decided to go 64-bit for 3.6.0v2. I uninstalled the 32-bit version (which wasn't registered in Windows 7's Add/Remove Programs list, so I had to find it and use uninstall.exe), but unfortunately it didn't get everything. 

I installed 64-bit, and double clicked on a .db file. It brought up the 32-bit version that I thought I had just uninstalled. I did this a couple times and then uninstalled 64-bit, searched my hard drive manually deleting every sqlitebrowser.exe I could find.  I re-installed 64-bit, but now I could not double click on my .db files and make them open in sqlite browser. It associated with the next program on the list (just happened to be 7zip, and 7zip choked...). 

In any case, digging into the registry, I found that the key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\sqlitebrowser.exe\shell\open\command\Default was still set to  "C:\Program Files **(x86)**\SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser.exe" "%1". This confused Windows 7 and would not let it associate the new, 64-bit install with .db. Once I whacked that and re-installed 64-bit, it was shiny.

tl;dr: Make sure that the uninstall whacks that reg key so an install with a different target (32/64/ia/etc) will not confuse Windows.

Other than that, great job with 3.6.0v2. I like it. :-)
 Ah. That's why it didn't unset them. :-)
My bad.
  During testing the 3.6.0 v2 release, I noticed that the icons for the Windows 32 bit and 64 bit were different. Should they be the same? Maybe one was left over from a prior release.

Thanks.
 Out of town for a few days. Will check them out when I get back this weekend. Currently running Windows 10 Pro 64 bit and Win 7 64 bit on box and laptop.
  I am running windows 7 64 bit and when i install the 64 bit version i keep getting "This application failed to start because it could not find of load the Qt platform plugin "Windows".

Reinstalling might fix it.

Reinstalled multiple time nothing worked and 
 Thanks for quick fix :3
  minor fix of release version
 Sure.  I think this is what you would like.  I am sure this info was was the least of your concerns.
 Btw. The reason this was an issue for me was I had a few versions of sqlitebrowser installed and the help menu was how I choose to identify which is which. FYI.
  When trying to update to 3.6.0 in Windows 8.1, I get the following message "This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin 'windows'. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem ".)

Tried to install both the 32 bit and 64 bit versions for Windows. Version 3.5.1 installs fine and runs. 
 Maybe it is in the build?
I don't know if this will help, but 3.6.0 produces a bin with multiple .dlls.

Only thing that might need addressing are their icons. They seem to switched around. Perhaps one is left over from the previous version?

Also note that 3.5.1 was a single .exe rather than all of the .dlls.

Both versions start up without any errors. Haven't time to check integrity but I'm sure that you wouldn't have released it if you weren't ready to go. ;-)

Thanks for the extra effort. If the icons are an issue, let me know and I'll start another issue.

Great job!

(Thanks again)
 BTW, I have VS2013 Community installed on this machine. Did not get the MSVCP120.dll error message. No problems were encountered with the "v2" installs.
 Has the portable app been updated with this fix? I'm seeing this error with the portable app at https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/v3.6.0/SQLiteDatabaseBrowserPortable_3.6.0_English.paf.exe
 Was able to open @jgus' portable app on Windows 8.1 machine without any error messages. Did not check it any further. No error message as I first reported in April (see first post).

What version of Windows are you running @jgus? Perhaps you should log it as a new issue with documentation of its problem and your machine's specs, as this issue is closed.

Ping me if you need me to run some quick tests.
 Windows 8.1. Though, the exact same set of files _does_ work on another Win8.1 machine. Not sure what the difference is. And using the installer rather than the portable seems to work around whatever the issue is on the problematic machine. :shrug:
  Perhaps a feature rather than a bug.

I used an open-source conversion program to go from an SQL file to a SQLlite file.  That program left the data types in the table schema in their original SQL form.  One was a "bit" type.  Your browser seems to interpret that reasonably.  It displays as either 0 or 1.  When I run an sql command in your browser to select for 0 or 1, it works as expected.

But when I run the same command in SQLlite3, it never selects regardless of the bit value.

It appears that the browser is interpreting data types in a different way than SQLlite3.  So while the browser's liberal behavior is a nice convenience, it is misleading.  Perhaps the browser should display the type being used?  Or warn?

Otherwise, I'm very happy with it in my rather limited experience to date.
 Hi Justin,

A few hours after sending that message I found that my test of SQLlite behavior was flawed.  I’m not sure the bit data type really behaves differently in the two contexts.  Now I’ve eliminated that data type from my DB so I can no longer test for it.

It seems to me that the most useful feature would be to display somehow the data type that will actually be used in SQLlite.  For example, my database also includes DateTime data types.  I’m wondering whether those are considered strings or blobs (or …?).

Anyway, it’s not an urgent concern.  I can work around as long as the behavior is consistent.

Thanks for responding,

  Can I load the spatialite extension module? I have attempted using "Load extension" but I got "Error loading extension: The specified module could not be found".
 I am on Win7 x64. For the DB4S (x86) version, I attach a screenshot with the about:
![dbbrowser_version](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2849257/7254833/67d23f2c-e813-11e4-94a8-93419a8bc757.PNG)

For the spatialite extension, I am using the last stable (4.2.0): http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/windows-bin-x86/

I am not sure that I am properly using the application .. I was not able to find documentation on the "load extension". However, to reproduce my error, I open DB4S, then I create a dummy table and I try to "load extension" selecting the dll in a folder where I unzipped the 7z archive:

![dbbrowser_error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2849257/7254834/69d50e76-e813-11e4-988c-62fd14a1ca49.PNG)
 I'm having this problem also. I am trying to load the ST_Geomtry extension for ArcGIS:

http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/databases/spatially-enable-sqlilte.htm

I've added all the PATH's and the command works via command line sqlite3, but not in the browser.
 I am having the same problem. I have tried the same directory approach , and no dice..

Win7 x64    db version  3.8.0
 I ran into this same issue and I finally got it to work. It has to do with the library search paths on Windows because `mod_spatialite` in turn loads its own dependent DLLs that reside in the same directory as `mod_spatialite.dll`.

I got it working 2 different ways:

1.) Add the directory containing the spatialite `.dll` files to your `%PATH%`. Windows searches `%PATH%` for dll files so it will be able to locate it.
2.) Copy the `.dll` files to the same directory containing `DB Browser for SQLite.exe`. e.g. `C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\DB Browser for SQLite` whichever version you have installed (32bit or 64bit). You will also want to make sure you use the correct x86 or x64 dll files that correspond to the version of sqlitebrowser you have.

This works because Windows searches for .dll files in `%PATH%` and the current application directory. So putting them in either place works.

If `mod_spatialite` were shipped as fat binary containing _everything_ in a single dll file I don't believe this would be necessary and it would just work pointing it at the dll, but until then we have to make sure all of the .dll's are located somewhere Windows will search when loading shared libs. I added a new page.

https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/SpatiaLite-on-Windows I think this issue can be closed because it's definitely not an issue with DB4S. I don't believe there's anything to be done other than making a more location-independent build of `mod_spatialite`.  The FileOpenDialog show all files in all formats. The SQLite formats are: *.db, *.sqlite, *.sqlite3, *.db3. Is it possible to add the filter? 

Note: I'm Colombian, My English Is Bad.
 I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate Edition.
 I have just downloaded a Windows nightly build (23-Apr-2015 02:15) and I only see one file filter, "All Files (_._)". So on Windows 7 I get the same. From looking at the code it would seem the filters were removed for all platforms but I might be wrong.
 Just to make sure, you are talking about the dialog from "File > Open Database...",  right?
 I was and I assume @jonorozcoc was as well. However don't forget, it needs to be Windows and Linux only @samir-aguiar as per the comments from @justinclift 
 Alright, could you guys test it please? :smile: 
 Oh, tomorrow btw, after the next nightly build. 
 What version of Qt are using?? This issue is solved on MacOSX in the latest version.
 Yeah, but I think it's only fixed on Yosemite. Could you confirm that, @justinclift? I don't run Mavericks anymore. :smile: 
 I have tested the latest nightly build (24-Apr-2015 02:19) on Windows and I get a filter in the open dialog when I do "File -> Open Database...". I guess @justinclift someone needs to test on Linux and Mac.
 @justinclift you're right, that was confusing. :smile: 
So, apparently the bug we had on #230 is gone on Yosemite, but I'm not sure if that's due to some Qt update and if it's also fixed on Mavericks. I'll send you a release of DB4S through e-mail, then can you please test if the bug from #230 is still there?
  To perhaps clarify a bit more outside of the twitter character limit!  We have a SQLite DB in our Unity project, and a requirement was encryption.  sqlcipher wasn't supported by the SQLite Unity plugin we used (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/4334), so we had to use their "PRAGMA key = X" to encrypt the DB on devices.  We would love a way to then use sqlitebrowser to decrypt the contents of this DB after pulling it off a device and entering our key.  I grabbed the latest nightly build of sqlitebrowser as well as the cipher-enabled version, but neither of them will decrypt our DB. (though i'm unsure if changing the "page size" value in sqlcipher version would help, I have no idea what value I'd use there)  

The format of key we're using is:  0x5c516e4e21a65b8fee841db84b462367

(some digits changed to protect the innocent, but length remains the same as what we're using)
 Will you develop Cipher for Windows?
 I wish I can, but my skill is not good. Exactly I don't have experience. :)
 Simple suggestion (perhaps too simple to be a true solution) 
First decrypt with your key; 
Then encrypt with cipher embedded in DB4S
 @justinclift Has been made any progress on this?   This is occurring in the latest nightly Windows build.

When modifying the order of fields, the 'move up/down' buttons are disabled when at the top/bottom of the list. But if you click on another row, then hold down the mouse button and drag to one of the end rows, the movement buttons are not properly disabled. So you can click to move the top row up and the bottom row down, both of which crash the application.

The inverse also works, so if you click the bottom row, then drag up one row, the "move down" button will be disabled even though you should be able to move the field. So basically it seems like the listener for disabling those buttons triggers on the mouse click, not the actual final selection after dragging around.

 Alright, looks good now! Thanks for the quick response :+1: 
  Really nice enhancement @MKleusberg!
  Okay so I'm not sure if this is the appropriate place to do this, but I didn't see any other place. There may be a way to do this already, But if there's not just want to put my two cents in that it might be a good idea. I'm on Mac OSx. I have set up an Automator service that lets me right-click an SQLite database and then open SQLiteBrowser. However, when I do so it doesn't actually open the file in question. Is there a way for me, perhaps using a shell command or some other way, to open SQLiteBrowser and pass in the filename of the database I wish to open?
 I was able to do this using finders normal file handling capability. Although, I kind of want something that won't make opening a database as simple as a double-click. Right Click > Open in ... would be nice.
 Yeah. It should be. I made a similar Automator workflow to do that with sublimetext. It opens the file or folder that I have highlighted. With sqlitebrowser, it seems no argument gets passed in, because it opens only the App not any database file along with it.

 Okay. I figured out how to do this. Create an Automator service that runs a shell script. I even included a notification center to prompt with the filename as it opens. But that's not necessary.

```
for f in "$@"
do
    osascript -e "display notification \"$f\" with title \"Opening file:\""
    open -a "sqlitebrowser" "$1"
done
```

  The PortableApps Format is ugly portable specification, need much settings, A single zip with all contents are more useful. Note: I'm colombian, my english is bad.
 I recomend see the PortableApps Config File for details of settings.
 Yes, i try
 I will use the latest release.
 I made the file with all the requirements (VC2013), as it can send?
  It would be convenient of pressing 'tab' in the SQL editor when multiple lines of text were selected indented all of the lines. The current behavior replaces the selection with a tab.

This could be useful when incrementally building complex queries and subqueries.
  EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT BlahField FROM BladDb WHERE foo=0;

begins a transaction when one is not required.

When using the DB browser to execute certain queries it enables the "write changes" and "revert changes" options when this is not required. This means DB Browser creates a transaction that is awaiting a COMMIT or ROLLBACK but no such thing is required in this case since the explain verb does not write anything. In journal DELETE mode an empty journal is created.

SELECT BlahField FROM BladDb WHERE foo=0;

works as expected and no transaction is creating awaiting a COMMIT or ROLLBACK.
 Thanks for the quick response.
Adding "END TRANSACTION" can have catastrophic consequences if my main app is running at the same time which sadly is how I found this problem in the first place.

But what are your thoughts on one of these fixes:

Option 1: It appears the sqlitebrowser understands that there are times when a transaction is not required.
SELECT BlahField FROM BladDb WHERE foo=0;
executes without enabling the "write changes" and "revert changes" buttons. So since sqlitebrowser knows not to start a transaction in that case why not add statements like "EXPLAIN" to the list of cases where a transaction is not created similar to how "SELECT" is handled? In fact instead of having a hard-coded list, as I am suggesting, why not call
int sqlite3_stmt_readonly(sqlite3_stmt *pStmt);
on the prepared statement to determine if changes will be made by that statement. Then only start a transaction in the cases where changes will be made.

Option 2: Since Transactions cant be nested perhaps DB Browser should consider using (SAVEPOINT, RELEASE, ROLLBACK TO) instead of (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK). This might work better in the cases where I am using sqlitebrowser to look up something in the DB while my main app is running. Note to self: I should perhaps make this same switch in my app too.

Option 3: Let the user control the creation of transactions. Add an option to disable the current transaction approach built into sqlitebrowser thus forcing us users, who choose that option, to manually create transactions via the BEGIN or SAVEPOINT in those cases where we feel it is required. And if we don't then we get the default SQLite automatic transactions on every statement.

Forgive me is any of this is already in place or has already been discounted as crazy. I have not looked through the code.
 @rp- I have always thought that SQLite handled multiple processes accessing the DB perfectly fine. But after fooling around with the explain query in SQLiteBrowser I eventually wound up at a place where my main app stopped running complaining that it could not prepare a SQL statement. Closing the DB in SqliteBrowser resolved the issue and allowed my app to continue. Maybe this is something unrelated to the unrequired transactions topic so I should do some further investigation.

@justinclift Yes of course I would be willing to contribute some code. I am not familiar with the ins and outs of contributing code on GitHub but I am sure I can figure it out. If the desire is for Option 1 I can certainly put something together. BTW: in another thread I saw you were looking for a Visual Studio person to help with 32 to 64-bit code. I am willing to help there too. I currently build SQLite3 from the source into a 64-bit DLL that gets used by my 64-bit app. I am a windows coder.
 @justinclift  Adding such a checkbox would be fantastic. Leaving it on by default would preserve the current behavior and when people needed it to be off they could turn it off. Perfect.
  I think it would be handy if a value could be set to null by highlighting it (single click, not edit mode) in the data browser then pressing "delete" or "backspace" (equivalent of double clicking value to open the editor then pressing "clear").

Currently values can be edited without actually opening the editor window, but they still require the edit window to be opened to set them to null. If this were added it'd nicely round off the editing actions that can be done without having to open the editor.
  How do you set a value to null in the data browser, aside from doing it directly with a sql query?

I couldn't find anything in the wiki or browsing around through the application.

Sorry, but I was unable to find a way to contact you besides filing a bug report. 

Thanks.
 Thanks. The "clear" button was the first thing I tried, which didn't work. But I tried again after reading your reply and realized there's a bug that if the value is non-null but empty, "clear" doesn't change it to null (it only works if the current value is not empty). That's what got me. I'm going to file an issue report, unless that's the bug you were referring to?

Thanks again,
J
 Good news: It works properly in the current nightly build.
  @schdub if you need help merging/squashing your commits then I have just documented this in the wiki at https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Merging-Commits because it took me a while to figure out, @justinclift did explain it but now it seems to make sense to have it in the wiki.

@justinclift please can you check the new wiki page and update it if it is wrong, this seemed like a good use of the wiki to me
 Thanks @justinclift appreciate your improvements, to me this is collaboration and open source at work, so thank you. I will keep looking out for stuff to add to the wiki, as well as trying to get round to the outstanding stuff!
 @schdub you're welcome, but we are all helping each other, you prompted me to write a wiki page, @justinclift improved it and now we can easily refer people to it, rather than people going through pain!

Also nice seeing the Travis build is working now and you have 1 commit, so, looking cool!

Nice link by the way, have to check that out, just to see if it is my kind of thing....
  sqlitebrowser consistently crashes upon opening a database with a large blob in it (close to 1GB blob, but not over due to the SQLite max size)... the database(s) work fine in the program that utilizes them, but the browser can't handle it. I get a visual c++ error stating that "This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way."
I have tried this on several databases with similarly sized data and have encountered the problem on each. If I create the same database layout with a smaller blob then it is loaded fine.

Running Windows 7 Professional SP1 64-bit
2.7GHz i7
12 GB ram
 It is very simple, just a TEXT column with the "filename" and a BLOB column containing the data. This is for an octree structure, one blob stores a tree's structure, and the other stores data accessed by the nodes.
 I'll try it out, thanks!
 Thanks, I am now able to open these databases without this crash... Though it is a bit sluggish on opening.

I'll go ahead and close this, as I feel the problem is adequately fixed. I don't know if anything can really be done about speed. This is dealing with large blobs after all =P
  Desktop shortcuts were being copy to /usr/local/share/ instead of /usr/share/. According to the FreeDesktop.org specification (see http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/ar01s02.html) it should not be a problem since it uses $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, but it does not really work in GNOME. In their help files (see https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en) they guide developers to drop desktop files in /usr/share/ or ~/.local/share/.
 I am running CentOS 7, with GNOME and the current directory works just fine for me. I don't object to the change of directory just saying it might not be needed or might be different for different distributions
 @glawrence Although I tested only tested Linux Mint 17.1 (which uses Cinnamon), it seems to be a Gnome related problem. Did you check if there are cached desktop/icon files in your Gnome? (maybe from previous sqlitebrowser installations, dunno)

Also, it is important to note that, after this change, the sqlitebrowser icon just disappeared in my computer. If that happens to someone, just run "sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor/" to force the icon cache to update.
 @justinclift Yes, the problem is with the current git master, I did not use the package manager from the distro because it is outdated. Also, I tested the installation with this proposed change, and everything worked as expected.

According to FHS (see http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/fhs-2.3.html#USRLOCALLOCALHIERARCHY), the correct place to store sqlitebrowser is /usr/local, and according to the FreeDesktop.org specification (see http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/ar01s02.html) it should be also OK to store desktop files under /usr/local/share if it is listed on $XDG_DATA_DIRS variable (which is usually True).

So sqlitebrowser seems to be following the specification.

But, despite what these specifications says, Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon does not show desktop files stored under /usr/local/share in the menu (fortunately I installed the system yesterday, so I am with a clean installation). We still need to confirm if this issue affects other Debian based distros, or just Linux Mint.

Anyway, I am reporting this issue to Cinnamon developers, so we can track the source of it.
 @DiegoQueiroz when I tested this I renamed sqlitebrowser.desktop to sqlitebrowser.xxxx when I did this the menu entry disappeared, when I changed the name back the menu entry returned. So I think this is probably a Mint issue. I don't have another GNOME install to hand, my openSUSE is running KDE.
 I just confirmed that this issue also affects Ubuntu with Gnome (thanks to Professor J. Kinoshita, USP who kindly gave me access to his computer to test), so I think it's safe to say that this problem is not related only with Cinnamon or Linux Mint.
 Hmm, sounds to me like some GNOME installs are adhering to the standard and others are not. So whilst DB4S is doing the right thing, it might be as well to take the pragmatic view and make the change
 Well. If there is a set of systems that do not use
/usr/local/share/applications folder and a set that use it, so we need to
check the OS first and decide based on this.

Anyway, I am still not sure what systems really use
/usr/local/share/applications folder. Although I described it as possible
according to FreeDesktop standard, all tutorials and documentations I can
find around the web say to store .desktop files under
/usr/share/applications.

 @justinclift Do you mean about the hardcoded path? I don't think there is anything wrong with the Makefile, since it ok to copy application files to /usr/local, no?

I'm not sure, but it seems to be also hardcoded somewhere when Gnome is installed (at least on Debian based systems).
 I think the best workaround is to hardcode the path.

I understand it is a bad solution, but it should treated as a workaround, since some systems appear to be checking /usr/share folder only. We won nothing keeping the "right" relative path, if it does not work in Debian-based systems.

Another possible solution is to check if the /etc/debian_version file exists, if so, use the hardcoded path.
 @justinclift just a thought, if problems are related to different base systems, we can check it via running "dpkg" command or "rpm" command to detect the base system (debian or redhat, but for other can be applied too). If cmand returns non-zero code means we are on wrong system. We can use nested if else with it.

But as I can see the problem is related to desktop entry, 
1.  do we update cache after adding file to applications folder?? 
2. Permissions of. desktop file must be set to (acc to my knowledge 755).
3. ~/.local/share/applications is the diectory where only one user can have access to that entry, on the other hand /usr/share/applications will creare a global entry for all users.

For 1. Refer to below commands 

desktop-file-edit
is used to modify an existing desktop file entry.
desktop-file-install
is used to install a new desktop file entry. It is also used to rebuild or modify the MIME-types application database.
desktop-file-validate
is used to verify the integrity of a desktop file.
update-desktop-database
is used to update the MIME-types application database.

I am commenting Using my mobile, so apologies for mis-formatting. Or any other mistakes. :smile:
 Well... so why close the issue if it was not resolved yet?
 Well On Linux Mint 17.2 it is working properly. So what is the problem ?? :)
  Create a file "header" containing licence header .
Then : 
for file in *.cpp *.h
do
cat header $file > $file.new
mv $file.new $file
done
~     
 Not needed, except (perhaps) in cases where the header is already present in a file you take in whole or in part from some other project. There are arguments for and against per-source-file notices; practice around this issue varies quite widely.
  According to README.md, "DB Browser for SQLite is bi-licensed under the Mozilla Public License Version 2, as well as the GNU General Public License Version 3 or later." - it is not clear if this means that conditions of both licenses must be met at same time or that one or other license must be followed.

Thanks for clarification
 Yes, thanks a lot for quick reply.
 Hope you don't mind @justinclift but I have added this to a wiki page now at https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Licensing as I thought this was worth documenting
  Create Sample Table using "Import/Database from SQL file" function

> CREATE TABLE foo (x DOUBLE);
> INSERT INTO foo VALUES (9e999); -- +Inf
> INSERT INTO foo VALUES (-9e999); -- -Inf
> INSERT INTO foo VALUES (9e999 / 9e999); -- NaN: gets converted to NULL

This foo table has these values

> 'Inf'
> '-Inf'
> 'NULL'

Export foo table to SQL using "Export/Database to SQL file" function. This SQL Statement generates error on "Inf".

> CREATE TABLE foo (x DOUBLE);
> INSERT INTO `foo` VALUES (Inf);
> INSERT INTO `foo` VALUES (-Inf);
> INSERT INTO `foo` VALUES (NULL);

I think that this is right. What do you think about this?

> CREATE TABLE foo (x DOUBLE);
> INSERT INTO `foo` VALUES ('Inf');
> INSERT INTO `foo` VALUES ('-Inf');
> INSERT INTO `foo` VALUES (NULL);
 I have tested using 11-Apr-2015 02:15 nightly build. Everything's OK. Thank you. @justinclift @schdub 
  It would be great if the column order during csv import could be changed. If the order of the columns in the target database doesn't match the source database, swapping the columns around manually is somewhat difficult.
 Well, the problem is that csv import ignores column names in the csv file
and assumes the order is the same. In my situation this was not so. I
resorted to fixing the sql export as fixing the csv file was too much work.
But as a csv importer is already present, a dialog allowing the user to
arrange the csv columns before import would make sense.
 I'm able to change the column order during a csv import in the latest master.
  When exporting the database to SQL with the purpose of importing the data from one of the tables via SQL to another database, it would be extremely helpful if the columns were named in the INSERT statement. This would make the insert work even if the columns were in a different order in the target database (my situation),

I can solve it by replacing the INSERT word like this:

INSERT INTO `SomeData` VALUES (1,34,37,463);
to:
INSERT INTO `SomeData` (col1,col2,col3,col4) VALUES (1,34,37,463);

I would be nice if this tool could do this automatically.
  It would be nice to select multiple cols and get them all resized in 1 go as has been implemented here:
https://forum.qt.io/topic/16047/solved-qtableview-resize-of-several-columns/6
  SqliteBrowser allows using WITHOUT ROWID only for INTEGER column.
SQLite does not have this limitation:
https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html
 ![](http://markac.home.pl/pub/sqlite.png)
 Of course.
 My current table schema:

```
CREATE TABLE `test` (
    `Field1`    TEXT NOT NULL,
    `Field2`    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    PRIMARY KEY(Field1)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

When I try modify the table schema and check Unique checkbox, application not respond and crashes.

![Screen1](http://markac.home.pl/pub/sqlitebrowser/bug1.png)

Inserting data from Browse Data tab don't work, I don't know why...
When I click New record I received:

![Screen2](http://markac.home.pl/pub/sqlitebrowser/bug2.png)

Manually insert works:

```
Query executed successfully: insert into test values('bla',1); (took 0ms)
Query executed successfully: insert into test values('bla2',1); (took 0ms)
```

Look on SQL Log on right panel...
SELECT MAX() from TEXT field??

I am usung now SQLiteStudio since two weeks (sorry guys :)) and works like a charm :)
 Editing and deleting also doesn't work :)
Even if I change Primary key to NUMERIC.

Log:

```
UPDATE `test` SET `Field1`=? WHERE `Field1`=0;
DELETE FROM `test` WHERE `Field1`=0;
```

Field `Field1` always equal 0.

When I create new table with NUMERIC key, then it works.
 This is more complex than the programmer thought.
Many functions operates on numeric keys, and now... all must be changed? :)
Maybe I'm wrong and the key can not be text...?
  BLOB data imported from file is not typed BLOB but TEXT.
We can replicate by following way.
1. create table

``` sql
    CREATE TABLE 'Sample' ('ID' INTEGER, 'Image' BLOB, PRIMARY KEY(ID))
```
1. add new record on "Browse Data" tab
2. update 'Image' data by importing image file(e.g. jpg file) on 'Edit database cell'
3. query type of 'Image' data, and get TEXT type

``` sql
    SELECT typeof(Image) FROM Sample
```

Maybe, the reason of this issue is DBBrowserDB::updateRecord(sqlitedb.cpp) method.
Imported data for update bind by sqlite3_bind_text without reference to actual (or estimated) data type.
 Thanks for response.
Yes, I guess #229 is caused by same problem, too.
 Thanks. That solves my problem, completely.

But, I worry about column that has multiple data type.
Now, we cannot insert TEXT data to BLOB column.
yes, this is the issue @schdub points on PS.

I think that use of such column is not good practice.
But, SQLite accepts such column by right.

For example, if we execute following SQL to last DB,

``` sql
INSERT INTO 'Sample' (ID, Image) Values(2, 'some text');
```

We get text value on Image column.

I think best solution is data type is switched according to 'Edit database cells' dialog.
Maybe, data type should not be decided by column type, but user's decision.

PS : I'm trying such a solution on my local code.
 @justinclift Sorry, I missed your request.

Now, I confirm that this has been fixed.
Thanks for your nice release.
  It will be better if we get a version for Linux, However windows version can be executed using wine.
 My apologies for not knowing that and my laziness :sweat_smile: . I am using Linux Mint 17.1. Can you please maintain a ppa for that.?

If you say i can maintain the ppa. :smiley: 
 Good :+1: 

I will be free in next few weeks, i will be right to it.
 Yeah sure , i will be free by then. :smiley: 
 @rp-  Thanks for the refrence that helped a lot. I will be using same code for packaging from previous ppa :smile:  And here is link to testing ppa

https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser-testing

Feel free to tag me with packaging issues. I will be happy to help and contribute to project as much as possible :smiley:  And as i don't use Sqlitebrowser in depth, it will be great if somebody can test ppa builds (or alternatively tell me how can i test (stress testing or other)  my build :P ).  Thanks .
  Running the query:

`SELECT * FROM address WHERE house_number LIKE '%3';`
runs a query like
`SELECT * FROM address WHERE house_number LIKE '20';`

The number that %3 gets turned into seems somewhat random, but usually less than 20.

Note that %1 and %2 are also broken, but %4 and up work.
 Nightly build works! Sorry for the trouble. I swear I searched first. :frowning: 
  As per issue #178 I have created an AppData file and got it to install
to /usr/local/share/appdata/. I believe the license and updatecontact
tags need checking.
 E-Mail address now removed, I assume you are happy with the licenses I referenced? I stated "Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal" for the appdata.xml file itself which is usually different to the project and one of the four permitted ones and then said the project is licensed under "Mozilla Public License 2.0" and "GNU General Public License v3.0 or later".
 Mostly okay, but a few issues:

```
appstream-util validate sqlitebrowser.desktop.appdata.xml 
sqlitebrowser.desktop.appdata.xml: FAILED:
• tag-invalid           : <url> type invalid [unknown]
• style-invalid         : <image> has vertical padding [https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/raw/master/images/sqlitebrowser.png]
• style-invalid         : <image> has horizontal padding [https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/raw/master/images/sqlitebrowser.png]
• style-invalid         : <li> is too short [Search records]
Validation of files failed
```

A url without a type is invalid (perhaps you meant type="bugtracker") and the other issues are just style warnings that would go away using validate-relax. Thanks!
 @justinclift We rely on there being no alpha padding around the screenshot so we can scale it to fit the application area. This means the screenshots have to be taken without any kind of "fuzzy border" -- or you can remedy this in GIMP/Photoshop. Also, the screenshot is supposed to be what it looks like on Linux :) See http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/#screenshots for more details; thanks.
 @justinclift Any screenshot is better than no screenshot, but I'd really like the application installer to look sexy and coherent. If you need space I can host a static image somewhere, although I'd much prefer this was in your control for obvious reasons. If it helps, about half of the apps with AppData have the screenshot in the VCS :)
 @hughsie I understand what `<li> too short` means but inclined to ignore that, the text is a direct copy of the website. Is there a list of valid url types, I could not see anything at http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/ ? I did try using the validator on the web page but it did not work.

@justinclift thanks for the new repo, do you know someone who could trim the existing image or make a new one?
 @glawrence You can ignore the two short style warning in this case, it's a little redundant. The URL types are defined here: http://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-url
 @hughsie thanks. I was thinking of adding GitHub repo as a second homepage but it is easy to get to from the main website, so will add a link to issues as a bugtracker. I guess once I fix the url we could run with this right? Or should we really fix the image first?

By the way, the xml file lands in /usr/local/share/appdata/ so is that okay?
 @glawrence Fixing the screenshot can be done whenever, but I'd obviously prefer it not be forgotten about :) /usr/local/share/appdata/ isn't ideal, but if if you install the .desktop file to /usr/local/share/applications I'm sure the packager is just doing a simple mv to get things in the right place already.
 @hughsie thanks, understood, I have updated the xml now

@justinclift happy for you to merge this or wait for an updated screenshot
 @justinclift thanks, would be nice to roll this in and then we go see how well it all works. If you let me know when the screenshots are in I will add them to the xml. Ideally we need a default one showing a good overview, like the current one and then we can add more. Just for information:

"Ideally, all screenshots should have a 16:9 aspect ratio, and should have a width that is no smaller than 620px. They should also be in be in PNG or JPEG format. PNG is the preferred format; JPEG should only be used when screenshots include large photographs or other images where a lossy format like JPEG may compress better."
 Will take a look as soon as I can and update the XML, will be all good after my next commit!
 @justinclift everything is ready now, in that I have added the new screenshots. I am happy to merge the commits into a single one but I can't fathom how, I have searched and tried a few things but failed. So, if you want me to merge them then I will need some steps please, sorry!
 Yes, it was fine, once I figure out `git push --force` was what I needed. Hopefully this is good to go now!
 Thanks guys!
 You're welcome. So @justinclift I now need to find the next thing I can help with!

Thanks to you and @hughsie appreciate your support
 I will take a look and see what I can do, thanks
  Why sqlitebrowser write "cannot VACUUM from within a transaction: VACUUM;"? When I select "VACUUM" query.
  Starting application with no database open, a click on the "save file" icon on the "Execute SQL" button then leads into crash. 
Anyway, great piece of code. Thank you!
 This should be fixed now, thanks! :)
 Hi Justin,
 
I took the version from 21.03.2015 (http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/), the problem still occures...
 
Regards,
Andreas
 Hi Justin,

yes, now it's ok, thank you!

Cheers,
Andreas
  There are some issues with the paging arrows in the bottom left.  One thing is just a little confusing at first.  You are doing something that is not typical UI.  I've never seen software that lets you scroll, and also tells you which lines are being displayed in just the viewable window, and also lets you page through the scrollable view.  Once I figured out what was going on, it is actually pretty cool.  But then I found that if I change the window size, then use those paging arrows, they don't give me correct results.  They seem to skip large amounts of records.  I would suggest first, of course, to fix that errant behaviour.  And then maybe add the word 'Viewing' before the range of rows displayed, or something to make it clear the user can either scroll to see more records, or use the arrows to jump scroll.
 V3.5.1
OSX Yosemite 10.10.2
 I think it might be a OS X thing, because I couldn't reproduce on Fedora. Will try on OS X when I get home as well. :)
 Yeah, the buttons are supposed to scroll 100 records up/downwards, no matter the size of the window. So if the window is very small, it will appear to skip a lot of records, but it's just moving the selection by 100 records.
  The arrows in the column headings to indicate sort direction are incorrect.  They are the opposite of what they should be.  An upward facing arrow means the sort is from smaller to bigger (or alphabetic).  A downward facing arrow means the sort is from bigger to smaller (or reverse alphabetic).  
Take a look at the arrows in the column headers of folders on a PC or a Mac, or in Outlook, or any other common software that allows sorting by columns, and you will see they are using them the way I am describing, which is the opposite of how you are.

 INT = short for INTEGER it's written full in 'list_id' to make it (synonym) of ROWID

ref. https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#rowid
 It is sorting incorrectly for list_id too

![screen shot 2015-03-20 at 6 59 39 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5605944/6752832/b94f72f6-cece-11e4-842a-3b5dad50dabb.png)
 The arrow shows the order you can change the current one to so the opposite of what is the "status quo"
 Ok, I think I got this fixed.
Apparently the problem happened when opening a table for the first time (either by opening a database file or switching tables) and clicking on a header. Then the data were sorted correctly (based on the order from the SQL query), but the arrow was upside-down.
Would be great if you could do some tests :smile: 
 Sorry, I don’t see how to install the nightly build.  Instructions please?
 Eureka!  You did it.  Sort arrows are working perfectly now.  Nice work
gentlemen.
  I think it's a Qt bug on OS X, because it works on Fedora:

![save_as](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3753623/6735536/1e5d94a4-ce5f-11e4-9fdf-c447a9f9bc13.png)

Will do some research when I get home :)
 So this is really a [bug in Qt](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-38427) on OS X. It also affects older versions like 4.8.5, although it's not mentioned in the bug report.
 The files become clickable if you leave and enter the directory again after changing the filter.
Another workaround is not use the native file dialog. That works, but it will look a little bit weird.
Or perhaps subclass QFileDialog and force a refresh when changing filter, but might be too much for something not so critical.
What do you think? :smile: 
 Done :smiley: 
  When I create a BLOB in the field while maintaining it through the client software size of file twice as much than the original. Fix please. 
 Here are two files https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1rJ9TOTvh-VcHBKSWdFSFJaTFE/view?usp=sharing
One original and one saved by the client (connected to the base of this SQLITE3)
 I downloaded your files and 'file *'-result:

clientopen.jpg: data
original.jpg:   JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01

Editing filetype seems a bad idea
 Sorry, Justin, I misunderstood, my bad.
Apparently it does matter if the type is real or anything else of numeric nature.
Try one with type BLOB (eventually TEXT)

Perhaps this is helpful: https://www.sqlite.org/intern-v-extern-blob.html

As Italians express it: IBAL (i.e. "in bocca al lupo")
  Hello,

Start with a new DB and go to SQL tab and execute:

CREATE TABLE customer(
         id INTEGER,
         firstName TEXT,
         middleName TEXT,
         lastName   TEXT,
         address TEXT,
         contactNum TEXT
);

 CREATE TABLE item(
        id INTEGER,
        name TEXT,
        description TEXT
 );

 CREATE TABLE orders(
        id INTEGER,
        customerID INTEGER,
        date TEXT,
        FOREIGN KEY(customerId) REFERENCES customer(id)
 );

 CREATE TABLE item_order(
        id INTEGER,
        orderID INTEGER,
        itemId  INTEGER,
        quantity INTEGER,
        FOREIGN KEY(orderId) REFERENCES orders(Id),
        FOREIGN KEY(itemId) REFERENCES item(Id)
 );

After you execute this, save the db.

Now switch to the "Database structure" tab, and SQLite Browser will simply close!

Now anytime you try to open that DB, the browser crashes!
 I forgot to mention, I am running on Windows.
 Thanks for the efforts. I will try that Monday when I am back in the office.
 thanks. it works. much appreciated.
  Added one more item :grinning: 
 Just corrected a page :)
 @justinclift I have written a wiki page on Regular Expressions at https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Regular-Expressions and update the wiki home page. Please feel free to improve as you see necessary.
 @justinclift you're welcome. I am glad you tweaked the wording, my writing usually needs a tweak or two, so thank you. I will try and remember to add screenshots next time, they do help.
 Seems we both had the same thought! Let me know if what I have done does not cover it enough, very happy to have it updated/corrected/improved.
 @justinclift my default OS is Windows, so no. I have a Linux VM but have not built with SQLCipher yet, currently working on something else. I also don't have your image editing skills with those soft borders you add!
  I'm trying to open sqlite database. It is working with some databases, with others there is error:"Invalid file format"
Not sure if it is because of database or sqlitebrowser
 DB4S 3.5.1.

 I will email it to you now :)
 It's fine, thank you :)
  After Opening a DB, then Opening an additional DB the Browser should start from the directory where the last Successful Open occurred
 Your default directory will be opened by default. Works for me. Another way is to open one of the last five opened databases.

 I agree with https://github.com/rp- 

Perhaps the uploader used some pre-UTF8 codePage 

To check go to http://mysharepoint.org/Accounting/Lists/Client%20List/AllItems.aspx 
 This is really a problem with the data. In the header of the file it says UTF-8, but the characters are encoded in Windows-1252 or ISO 8859-1. Navicat probably uses one of them as fallback or something. But the specification states that only 3 encodings are valid, namely UTF-8, UTF-16le and UTF-16be.
 Hmm I don't know much about encoding, but it's possible to detect invalid UTF-8 characters, yes. It could then default to some other encoding instead of invalidating them (which is what I think is currently happening). So I think it's doable, however it will probably require a lot of changes.
 It's indeed rather tricky to make an educated guess. There are so many ways to encode/encrypt data. Navicat was lucky since 8859-1 (Latin-1?) is (almost was) one of the most common. If the developers are able to detect let's say four of five of those, they deserve a prize. I don't think it's worth all the effort though besides an increase in size...
  Allow copying of info in About DB Browser, so it can be copied and pasted when sending bug and enhancement requests 351, 486, SQLCipher386 version and 351, 486, SQLite 3.8.8.2.

Also should in SQLCipher Version mention OPENSSL version?
  Hi
I am trying to add a column constraint in order to restrict a column to a certain set of values
Field1 IN ("one","two")
However, when I enter this in the 'Check' column in the table editor I see it in the SQL but pressing OK makes it disappear

If I open an existing database with such a constraint I am unable to add a row

What is happening?
  I've changed this and added options (not commited yet) for a custom text and custom foreground and background color, as suggested by @glawrence in #163.
However, I can't find a nice layout for the fields. I've added them to a new "Data Browser" tab, because I thought that putting them somewhere else would be misleading.
Thoughts? :smile: 

![null_fields](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3753623/6561287/4ed57470-c690-11e4-8ec8-fbf6786fcdd6.png)
 P.S. those colours won't be the default, of course :smile: 
 Thanks for remembering! I quite like #ffd0cd by the way and the new tab looks good to me.
 Indeed it was too small, @justinclift. Here's how it looks in the end:

![browser_settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3753623/6605025/0bdc8462-c82d-11e4-80eb-d6c4cd336e76.png)

The default colors and text are the same as in the first implementation by @MKleusberg. I think this way is better because it's more neutral and won't change much for those accustomed to the old appearance, but no problems to set it otherwise :smile:  
 Done :smile: 
 Ahh I thought you meant the field in the settings pane. :grin: 
Yeah, that's doable, but won't that look out of place when the others are left-aligned horizontally?
Have a look:

![screen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3753623/6607961/66f674e6-c843-11e4-8f20-a281b2cceea8.png)
 So @justinclift I've commited some changes for this bug of not being able to set the value to NULL. Now the clear button should set it permanently :smiley: Also, when it's NULL the type in the edit dialog will be shown as "Null", so it's possible to tell empty from NULL.
If you could test it would be great :smile: 
  Dear contributors, I'm reporting an issue with sqlitebrowser related to exporting table from database. When I view the table from sqlitebrowser, all the alignments are in place, but when I try to export the table to as a csv, the rows and columns are get misaligned. I'm using sqlitebrowser for mac. I updated the install to the latest "night" install from March 8. Input file: the database is "example.db" within http://web.mit.edu/aizhan/www/twitter_api_workshop/docs/ the table name within the database is called "result"
 In the same directory there is a file 'example.sqlite'.
 @justinclift  it is just my Uni uses a bit slow servers, hence is a lag :(

I put 2 screenshots: "csv_screenshot.png" and "sqlitebrowser_screenshot.png" to http://web.mit.edu/aizhan/www/twitter_api_workshop/docs/ . You can see misalignment there. I used excel to view the csv file. Sorry for the delay, had lots of classes.
 @atoregozh can you try the nightly build tomorrow to see if the issue is fixed? The problem was that some of the values end with the CR character ('\r'), which was not escaped when exporting. Because we now accept it as a line ending character, I've changed the code to also escape them.
 @samir-aguiar sure will do. Thanks for your help in many ways
 Hi @samir-aguiar! I tested the last build and it works perfectly! Thank you so much for a quick fix :+1: 
  Some background info here, skip over to get to the problem.

-------Before yelling at me, please understand the new 3.x versions of sql arent compatible with my mac version 10.6.8 for some reason. I have no programming experience, but i have used this program before to edit some integers for an iphone app a few years ago, however it isnt working now, even with the same app, the same software, and the same .db file.

Here is why i am confused as to why i cant use the updated 3.0
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser
"OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) - 10.10 (Yosemite) are tested and known to work"
yet it doesnt.--------

end BG info

So, i have a file "Cashe.db" that has integers in it that i want to modify, that should be in a table. So i >file>openDatabase>Cashe.db and nothing shows up. it's blank. on the top bar it says as follows "SQLite Database Browser  - /Users/me/Desktop/Cashe/db". I assume this means that the file is open, but not loaded, perhaps due to an encryption? I tried using other .db editors but they dont get me to the table due to one reason or another, again, because of the possible encryption. 
 You're sure it's a made with a version after 3.6.12 (the standard of 10.6.8) I can imagine 2.\* databases can't be handled by sqlitebrowser, not even with sqlite3. I suggest to dump the old db and load it with a version after 3.7.\* 

Normally DB4S can handle practically all sqlite3 databases.

I have 10.6.8 and normally use (or convert to) the newest version (now 3.8.8.3) 
If you need help you may send your db to me, though I can't handle version 2.\* 
 Version 3.6.18, as it says from the about dropdown, not sure if that is what you meant by 2.*. I do remember though, i was able to load the database document with no problems and edit in the past.
 This issue has 2.0 in the title.

More about release 2 here: http://slackbuilds.org/repository/13.37/system/sqlite2/

It's about 2.8.17_6

Probably I misunderstood the title. When you open your database in Terminal\* do you get an error message?

*
Finder > Applications > Utility > Terminal.app

cd  /Users/me/Desktop/Cashe/db 
sqlite3 Cashe.db
 You mean SQLitebrowser 2.01b 
with http://www.sqlite.org/changes.html#version_3_6_18 ?
 yes, i did mean 2.01b, sorry for the confusion.

I went into terminal and here is what i have

My-iMac:~ Games$ cd /Users/me/Desktop/Cashe/db 
-bash: cd: /Users/me/Desktop/Cashe/db: No such file or directory

 I sent the file justin. i have no idea if it is encrypted or not, but i have heard SQlite shows an error instead of showing up blank.
 @justinclift re-emailed to you. 
 Good to hear that it isnt encrypted :) 

i believe i downloaded every version and tried to use them, however they "arent supported on this mac"

 Did you ever changed the database with a version after 3.6.18? In this case you absolutely need to upgrade. Let's hope it's not corrupted.

 @Oldimac10yrsold try the following: right-click on sqlitebrowser.app, click "Show package contents". Now go to Contents > MacOS and double click on the sqlitebrowser file (I'm not sure if the path is correct, can't check now). See if the app opens or if not, what message appears.
 @samir: On Apple we don't right-click, but ctrl-click

the rest of the info is correct:

--[[z4us|binz--]]
cd sqlitebrowser.app/Contents/MacOS
--[[z4us|MacOS--]]
ls
sqlitebrowser translations
--[[z4us|MacOS--]]
 You're right @Z4us, thanks. I have mine customized for so long that I forgot the original behaviour.
The first thing I did after buying a magic mouse was enable right clicking. The same with maximizing windows, couldn't stand they only expanding and not taking all the space. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 
 @samir-aguiar I went to the MacOS folder and clicked and it opened with this dialogue
MY-iMac:~ me$ /Users/me/Desktop/Storage/SQLite\ Database\ Browser\ 2.0\ b1.app/Contents/MacOS/sqlitebrowser ; exit;

and SQL opened normally.
@justinclift 
im gonna hit 2 birds with 1 stone, and show what folder i was in and my mac info

http://imgur.com/Pc4fZVb
 @Oldimac10yrsold Sorry, I forgot to mention that this should be done with the lastest version, the one that you say it's not working on your Mac.
 @samir-aguiar Here is what it says in terminal

my-iMac:~ me$ /Volumes/src:sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.app/Contents/MacOS/sqlitebrowser ; exit;

 @rp- i believe so
 @justinclift I can wait, i dont modify these files often, maybe once a year if i use them to begin with.
 @justinclift to my knowledge, yes.
 @justinclift I'm not sure, I don't have any 32-bit system either...
I'll do some tests tonight :wink: 
 Navicat doesnt work either.
 Yes sir

 doesnt even open :(

 If you're sure using the 32-bit version there might be a bug in it.

When I do the same I see a similar message (without 'Bus error')  B4S is launched

FWIW it's this 64-bit version I believe the buikd of yesterday

Version master_git

Qt Version 4.8.6

SQLCipher Version 3.8.6

BTW: is there a way within the GUI to see which build you're in? 
 That error is related to memory issues, as to accessing invalid addresses. That's probably some library incompatibility, but I don't know what. I've compiled Qt with libstdc++, the target as OS 10.6 and the arch as i386. I've also linked a universal build of libsqlite, that contains both 32 and 64-bit instructions.
@Oldimac10yrsold can you try the following?
With the .dmg file mounted, open Terminal and run:
`ulimit -c unlimited`
then:
`/Volumes/src:sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.app/Contents/MacOS/sqlitebrowser`

Then check the folder `/cores/` to see if a core dump file was generated for the process. If there is a file there with the creation date just after you ran DB4S with the command above, can you send it to me?

@justinclift That would be great!
 "Bus error (core dumped)"

cant find the core folder. Also, what is DB4S? i just want to check my knowledge. 
 Hmm I think that folder it's hidden by default.
Run this on Terminal:
`mkdir ~/Downloads/cores`
then
`cp -R /cores/* ~/Downloads/cores`
Then check your Downloads folder, a new `cores` folder should be there with the interesting files. If you could upload them somewhere and send the link it would be great :smiley: 

DB4S is our acronym for DB Browser for SQLite :)
 Okay, i have one file in it, how shall i send it to you?
 Like Samir said: Upload it somewhere e.g >> https://gist.github.com/
 and post the link here. 
 OK I got through most of this stuff but I'm now met with this, when trying to `brew install qt`, on the `make` step:

```
make[2]: *** [.obj/release-shared/qtestcase.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
make[1]: *** [release] Error 2
make: *** [sub-testlib-make_default-ordered] Error 2

READ THIS: https://git.io/brew-troubleshooting
```

It's worth noting that I don't have all of XCode installed, just the GCC tools...
 @Z4us gist caused me a lo of frustration trying to upload the file. any other method?
 the original file is 600 megabytes, the .zip is 101 megabytes.
 Perhaps upload it to Dropbox, Drive or something of the kind and send us the link? I think it also works :smile: 
 i can do google drive. just give me an address to send to and ill get it done asap.
 Nice, you can send it to saguiar@gmx.de
Thanks :)
 sent the share samir :)
 Thanks, I was checking and it seems to be a problem with the Qt libraries. I'll build Qt again overnight with some other flags set and we send you another binary tomorrow... Let's see if it works this time :grimacing:  
 Thanks guys :)
 Hey all, sorry about the delay. Built fine once I got XCode installed. I have a .app but not the .dmg ... what would you like me to do?
 That's great, @cbredesen!

I was going to send another version but I dug further and I didn't think that would work either. I'm running some tests with Valgrind and Xcode Inspector to see if they can find leaks, but they are not helping much.
It would be great if you could upload it somewhere or send it to @justinclift so he could upload to his server. To build the .dmg, Qt comes with a deploy tool. You can run:

`macdeployqt sqlitebrowser.app -dmg -verbose=2`

It will generate the .dmg with the libraries added to the bundle.

Thanks a lot for helping :smile: 
 Here you go:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12092928/sqlitebrowser.dmg
 Thanks @cbredesen!

@Oldimac10yrsold can you try this version?
 the good news, it works! the file loads and everything is cool.

the bad news is that i cant seem to find the data fields i need to edit :)
  I have a DB with Table Id as text and kwd as Text

Id has values 
3.1.1.a
3.1.1.b
...

If I make a query: 
select \* from Sutra where Id like '%3.%'

I see the result as:
6 Rows returned from: select \* from Sutra where Id like '2.%' (took 2ms)

No records displayed.

Problem (a): When I ask for '%3.% why it is taking as '2.%' ?
Problem (b): 6 rows returned, but the records not displayed
  Hi,
it would be very relieving if there was the possiblity to store/load table definitions which then can be applied to tables which are imported from csv files. 
It suits to my use case where a bunch of people are managing data in a csv file on google drive (since concurrent access is possible) which then needs to be imported in a certain sqlite databse. The data belongs to a certain table of that databse but everytime I import the csv file I also need to modify the table definition fitting to the original definition (and of course rename that table and remove the older table, to perform the replacement). This is a tedious progress :(
One alternative solution would be to somehow enable importing of csv data directly in a already existing table (column name matches needs to be checked and eventually duplicates omitted of course).
 You can use the first line of a CSV-file as table definition with column names. No need to worry about types since SQLite does it "autodramaticcaly"

https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#csv
 thanks for the advice!
 "questionPool.csv:1: INSERT failed: datatype mismatch"

[edit] the import yet worked. I guess the failure is just related to the first line where the column names are listed.
I created scripts which make the process a lot more easier and faster. Thanks for the advice again!
  Wow, quick turn around on that inquery. I will look into tesing it out soon (probably tomorrow).

As for why SQLite does not implement the function I suspect is just to keep the lib as small as possible for embedded purposes where REGEXP is rarely needed. Hooking to qt implementation is what I would expect for sqlitebrowser.

Thanks again,  I will let you know how it works for me.
 Took a few minutes to download the nightly and give it a whirl. Its working as expected. Thanks again for the feature support!
 Nice! :+1: 
  That's weird, I've done some tests but couldn't reproduce. Here it immediately changes.
More info please? :smile: 
 That's really strange, I followed the steps and it just works. 
Can you try closing the app, removing or renaming the settings file and trying again?
It's this one:
`~/Library/Preferences/com.sqlitebrowser.sqlitebrowser.plist`
Maybe that's it, somehow it doesn't get the new values. Perhaps the stored settings are corrupted.

If that doesn't work, send me the database, I'll do some more tests. :grinning: 
 Thanks Justin!
The fields are actually empty as they can't be NULL (because of the constraint), but right after adding a new record the table was getting it wrong.
It should be fixed now. :smile: 
 Yeah, that's because of the PK constraint, it doesn't insert NULL values as PK.
 That's true, @justinclift, I'll commit some changes related to that later. :smiley: 
 BTW, apparently it should be possible to add NULL fields as PK, so that's also a bug. Not related to the color stuff though.
  Hi

I'm importing 3 CSV's. The first 2 worked ok but the 3rd shows:

![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8420596/6459769/8f9d4dcc-c189-11e4-9880-47a04e20a29a.PNG)

How can I find the error, to fix it?
 @MKleusberg I've added two tests, one for CR endings and another for empty strings between separators. Any ideas for other tests?
  I had a small table in csv format that had 3 columns and I wanted to import that into sqlitebrowser (create new database then file -> import -> import from CSV file). The import doesn't look right as instead of having multiple rows, it just imports everything into 1 single row. I was teaching a workshop using sqlitebrowser today and everyone who had a Mac had the same issue. We downloaded the most recent version of sqlitebrowser that is available on your website. Windows users didn't have this issue.
 @rp standard line ending of Mac is LF since the beginning of 21st century :-)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#Representations

Perhaps for next milestone you may create an option in the menu where users may choose the EOL symbol of their system?
 I forgot to add that this bug wasn't just for csv files but also for text files as well. When I tried importing a text file, I had the same 1 row with many fields instead of several rows and several columns.
 @atoregozh could you provide a sample file?
The code works with LF and CRLF line endings, even if the file uses both. However, as @rp- mentioned it doesn't work with the old CR line endings, so perhaps your editor has that as default. TextWrangler, for instance, offers the ability to save with the three.
 @samir-aguiar I'm not sure how to upload the file in this discussion but you can download "handle.csv" from here: http://web.mit.edu/aizhan/www/twitter_api_workshop/docs/

Also, could anyone enlighten me and explain how to know what line endings were used in a csv file? In order to create the file, I just manually typed the rows in excel and saved it As .csv file.
 Yes, that's using only CR.
The easiest way to check is to use a editor that shows that information (Sublime Text does and IIRC so does TextWrangler) or open Terminal and run:
`$ file <filename>`

The output for your file is:
`handle.csv: ASCII text, with CR line terminators`

However, apparently this is a bug (or a feature?) of Office for Mac when exporting to CSV. I don't know if there is a setting to change that, but you can convert the line endings to a more common format by using a text editor that supports it (like the ones I've mentioned) or checking [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#Conversion_utilities) for some command line tricks.
 Hmm I did some searches and apparently there's no setting in Excel to change that. Don't know why would they choose this behavior though...

Anyway, from what I've seen it would be easy to also accept only CR as the line-ending character. What do you guys think?
 @samir-aguiar thanks! that did fix it, but why would the sqlitebrowser code not work with CR endings? because they are "old" and no one uses them? I guess there would be some people who would view their csv files using excel, and if they save it, the file will be saved with CR endings.
 @samir-aguiar this might be off-topic re sqlitebrowser issue: I used both options of checking the line endings you suggested and terminal does say that I have CR endings, but when I opened the file in Sublime Text2, and viewed the file's line endings, the tick was on Mac OS9 and not on Windows. Would that imply that sublime text is not recognizing the correct line endings?
 @atoregozh It doesn't work probably because they are not common and are not accepted by the RFC, but I don't know for sure, I've only recently joined the project :smile: 

As for Sublime, it's showing correctly: Windows uses CRLF. CR was used by Mac OS until version 9 and starting with OS X it switched to Unix line endings (LF).
 I think it should be working now.
By mistake I referenced and commented in the other CSV issue... it's right next to this one :smile: 

@justinclift we already cover cases where there's a non-empty string between the separators :wink: 
 @samir-aguiar great you already added support for CR? Does that mean that I should reinstall sqlitebrowser? Again off-topic: I actually have Mac OS X, why would sublime show that I have Mac OS 9 and thus I have CR endings? 
 @atoregozh Yeah, you can test tomorrow with the nightly build. It won't be in the stable version though -- if everything works out it should be in the next release.
The line endings are actually part of the file contents, so Sublime is telling you that this file uses the character '\r' to indicate a line break. OS 9 text editors added that character to the files when saving them to represent a newline. OS X editors now add '\n' instead, which is the same character used by Unix systems. So Sublime just shows what character(s) the file contains that represent a newline, along with the most common OS family to first set that character as the default for files read/written by that OS family tools.
 @justinclift sure I'll install it later tonight. Per link you gave, what's the difference between sqlitebrowser vs sqlitebrowser-cipher? And which one should I install (sorry maybe that's not a relevant question)
 @justinclift Thank you! I downloaded the last built (from March 8) and it works! I appreciate your fast assistance with this. And I learned a lot myself )
 @samir-aguiar Thank you so much for helping!
 No worries :smile: 
  I don't quite understand why this statement is an error, should you review the documentation or is it my mistake?

The only statement not supported is the 'IF NOT EXISTS', at least so I deduce.
 The syntax should be 

create table if not exists customer (customer_id...

Indeed if you suspect a bug RTFM

https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html
  I need to know the ranges of data that can be used for numeric data, if it is possible to update the article at https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html,
 Floating see http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html

Integer from -(2 ^ 64) to (2ˆ64) -1
 Well, @Z4us already said the ranges and we can't edit their documentation, so I'm closing this. :) 
  As a non-native English speaker I don't understand "a real to have" as if 'rea;' is a noun as well?

On a more serious and on-topic note: increasing user-friendliness is always a good plan for any software OS, commercial or something in between.
  The registry key HKCU/Software/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/checkversion/disable doesn't seem to have any effect for every release I've been using in the last year -- the program always checks and always throws an annoying popup if something new is available. Clicking "Don't show again" does seem to change the registry value, so I guess that works. Just kind of annoying.

Also, it'd be nice if you used a flat file (.sqlitebrowser perhaps?) or INI file in the AppData folder for user selected preferences to make installations more portable. I don't mind the last window size and version number being in the registry, but I'd prefer to be able to backup chosen preferences without exporting registry keys.
 Great response; thanks for the update.

The INI thing was just me nitpicking after realizing that the checkversion flag was in the registry. It's always helpful if user preferences are easy to migrate to another system; registry keys/hierarchy are usually not published by developers. Sqlitebrowser is very light on user preferences, but it's a burden with some Windows programs. I didn't realize that Qt libs are handling configuration persistence, so I understand now that it's not worth the hassle. Thanks for looking into it. 

Keep up the good work!
  Thank you for developing sqlitebrowser. I use it several years. I get databases from mobile device and often I need to reopen them to see changes. Can you make menu item which:
1. close current database,
2. open it again
 Oh, thank you. I did not see database history. Much time I used old version without history. 
  It would be great to have the possibility to paste SQL code in the "Execute SQL" tab. Either having a history browser or a simple snippet manager where you can add the current code to would be very supportive. At the moment I have a text file where I paste often-used statements, which is not very comfortable.
What do you think?
 Another useful thing might be to not close "Execute SQL" tabs when closing connection to the database. I often have a need to execute same ad-hoc query against couple databases and lose the query when closing one database and opening another. Maybe disabling the "Execute" button is enough?
 Desire to learn. Never worked with Qt and github repos. Last C++ was first
year of college, 15 years ago.  First: great piece of software!
Second: The auto-completion is not updated when SQL statements are executed "Execute SQL" tab. So when I add or remove tables there, auto-completion is not up to date.
 Win7 64bit using the sqlitebrowser 32bit win installer. Noticed that behaviour in the last 3 versions (3.4.0, 3.5.0 and 3.5.1)
 Sorry, still not working for me. When I rename a table in the 'Database structure' tab, everything works as intended. But when I rename a table manually using the 'Execute SQL' tab, I do not have the correct auto-completion afterwards. (Version 3.9.1. 64-bit Win7)  So they should be there... Was trying to find the languages in the dropdown menu and thought that it was a bug in my installation. Hope someone figures this one out.
 3.6.0 (release)
 Oh, thank you for pointing this out. Should this issue be closed then?
  Table:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE `table1` (
    `Field1`    TEXT
);
INSERT INTO `table1` VALUES ('testing');
INSERT INTO `table1` VALUES ('123');
INSERT INTO `table1` VALUES ('87654');
COMMIT;

Query:
select \* from table1 where CAST(Field1 AS Text) LIKE '%2%'

1 Rows returned from: select \* from table1 where CAST(Field1 AS Text) LIKE '2%' (took %3ms)

The % in front of '2%' is dropped and no results are returned.

Ver 3.5.1
SQlLite version: 3.8.8.2
 Did another test and ran from the sqlite3 cli - working fine.

sqlite> select \* from table1 where CAST(Field1 AS Text) LIKE '%2%';
123

Running Win 10 Preview build if it helps. (10.0.9926) - 64 bit.
 Some more info which hopefully points to where the problem could be:

like '%6% - working.
like '%3% - is changed to like '6%';
like '%2%'; - is changed to like '2%';
like '%1%'; - is changed to like '7%';

Very odd. :) Also tried on Win7 - same issue so it doesnt seem to be OS related.
 I think I've got it. :smile: 
The "%2" was being seen as a placeholder by QString::arg() when doing replacements.
 Great stuff. That was quick - thanks. Will check in the nightly tomorrow.
 Tested on the latest nightly. Now working. Thanks a lot guys!
  Depends on the file system. If they still use FAT32 nothing helps

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_file_support
 Just to help dodgy memory @justinclift as I suffer the same, I believe you mean Visual Studio Community Edition, which is better than the old Express Editions and more information is at http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx
  With last update I can't manually edit sql query in Edit Table wizard.
I think this option is required! 
What do you think about it?
 sorry. editable sql text is in Execute SQL tab.
wrong issue :) 
  Nice one, working here as well. Those Qt roles are tricky :smile: 
  Primavera 

(i.e. Italian for spring - eventually you may write it not exactly correct, but as a pun like 'Prima Vera')
 I would suggest coming up with a pattern rather than a name. For example, I worked for a company once where projects were named after letters of the alphabet, starting with A of course and their theme was alcohol, so the first project might have been Ale for example, however I worked on Guinness.

It might be better to use something that won't have copyright or trademark issues! Just in case. There is no need to get too clever, so we could use towns and start with Aberdeen, then Birmingham, Cleveland......

Anyway, that's just food for thought
 Following glawrence's suggestion we would start with F being the sixth letter of the alphabet.  Combination with mine 'Frühling' (German for spring) or his own 'Frankfurt' 
 Referring to China to avoid political correctness ;-?
 What about famous people provided:
1 they are dead
2 equally use artists, champions in sports, politicians, (fe)males etc.
3 perhaps they have something to do with the date e.g. day of birth, death, victory, dissertation, speech etc.

example: if a release is planned April 4 one may think of Martin Luther King
 I also find interesting the name of stars/galaxies, famous historical
battles or Greek/Roman mythology characters.

  <b>OS : OS X 10.10.2
SQLitebrowser Version : Feb 06, 2015 nightlies</b>

It is as the title suggests, null value is become empty string when I tried to import from CSV file which has a null value (etc,10,,10,). I tried to import using other SQLite app the null value (etc,10,,10,) become <i>NULL</i> instead of empty string. Oh, and the preview when importing a CSV file (after choosing the CSV file) btw, also display an empty string rather than <i>NULL</i> value. I have already checked when I import using SQLitebrowser and open with another app it becomes empty string for the <i>NULL</i> value.

I don't know if this is a feature or not, but maybe you can add an option when trying to import you give a checkbox and textfield for the <i>NULL</i> value, so when the user check the box but leaves the textfield empty the <i>NULL</i> value becomes empty string or the value of the textfield if any. And when the user does not check the box, the textfield is disabled and the null value becomes <i>NULL</i> when imported.

 On second try, I think when importing from a CSV data to current table that exist in the sqlite database ignores whatever default value the table has. Maybe this is why, when importing from a CSV the value of the table become empty cell rather than the table default value NULL.

I already tried using other default value other than NULL, and the result is also an empty cell rather than default value.
 Yes, actually I also prefer to have an option for what to do with the empy value (',,') than to set the field to default value by default.

Anyway, Thanks for the responses and keep up the good work!
  Hi,

My usecase is probably not supposed to happen, but it happened: I unfortunatly added a table with no name. Having this leads to a software crash at startup.

But anyway, thanks for this amazing sowtare!
da3
 Hi @justinclift , I just tested it, it works. Thanks @MKleusberg for the fast fix !!! (And I corrected my own software as well, so this should no longer happen :+1: )
  OS : OS X Yosemite 10.10.2
SQLiteBrowser Ver : 3.5.0

There's a bug when importing CSV files to database that the last record is not imported. Say that I have 10 records, then only 9 of them is imported, 20 records and only 19 imported. I use another SQLite browser app and the import works fine. Maybe you can work this bug out, I really love using your app for simplicity and easy to use.

This case is not always btw. I also have another CSV file that has 5 records in it, but all of them is imported. Maybe the bug occurs when the total records number exceeds certain number.

Also one more, when let's say I have 60 records in CSV file, when I click import there's a preview (when I was asked to name the table that is imported) of the records that's inside the CSV. But the preview only shows 19 of them, not all, even though the preview is in a scroll view. Maybe you can work this too so that it shows all of the records in the preview. Obviously when I import, only 59 of the records imported.

Thanks for your work on this app! Keep up the good work, and have a nice day!
 Ok. Here is the CSV file with 10 records, and only the first 9 is imported.

CSV file is generated using Apple's Numbers app on OS X.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/e8pad14efeki5e7/ZWATCHACTIVITY.csv?dl=0
 Thanks for the fix!
 Oh yeah, I already tested using the Feb 06, 2015 nightlies, and the problem is fixed but forgot to post here. Silly me!

Anyway, Thanks again for the fix!
  Is there any update on this issue? The ability to add foreign keys would be really helpful.
 ....... I am an idiot. Thank you. .____.;
 It would be great if the UI itself also had a dropdown of some of the rows when entering foreign key data. phpMyAdmin and MS Access are two examples (with the latter being awful) of GUI tools that do this, but I don't think there's a single SQLite example!

Example
![foreign-example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5298712/8393439/e964b0ce-1d06-11e5-8c51-b80c9660969c.png)
   I tried to attach a database with another database, but nothing happened after attachment. I want to attach a database with another to copy the data from one's database to another database table.
 https://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html
 and https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/open.html#urifilenamesinsqlite3open
 I'm also not understanding this.

I've tried to google about merging two databases together, and pretty much all of them talk about using the attach function of SQLite.

However, I am too stupid to know what the code is to do this.

I attempted to use this program to just attach the database for me, but when I select the one I want to merge it asks me what to call the database.

This is where I hit a wall and don't understand.

I don't want a new name for the database, so I attempted to name it the same as the old.  Nothing happened.  It showed a log saying it was attached, but nothing changed within the database.

I tried to name it something different.. same thing, no changes.

I left it blank, nothing happened. (no log this time)

Needless to say, I don't understand what's going on.
  The translations were not being added to the bundle when
deploying the Mac app and thus no language other than
English could be loaded.
 No worries :)
 Yeah, I've noticed that too. This happens with other languages as well (IIRC Russian is one of them). Perhaps the translations retain the menu layout of the system used generated them? I think that having the "Preferences" menu under "Vue" is the behavior on Linux and Windows.
  How can I increase the Maximum Number Of Columns?
As far I understand the limit is 2000 but I need 8000.
Thanks
 Thanks for your prompt answer. I just tried to compile and it works very well if I use Homebrew.

However, in my case I can not use Homebrew because I have to change the value SQLITE_MAX_COLUMN in the source code of sqlite before to compile and after, to compile sqlitebrowser. The first compiling (sqlite) was fine but the last one (sqlitebrowser) was unsuccessful.
Then, I think the problem is because I missed some parameter when I compiled the source code of sqlite. Which parameters I have to pass to compile sqlite? I am using 

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/src/sqlite3 --enable-dynamic-extensions

On the other hand, the last lines of error message when I compiled sqlitebrowser is

ld: warning: bad symbol action: $ld$install_name$os10.7$/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/CoreServices in dylib /System/Library/Frameworks//CFNetwork.framework/CFNetwork

Thanks in advance
  In addition, the new tab that I created also holds the "default location" option as suggested by @MKleusberg.

I've also renamed the Chinese translation file because the program was not finding it (see [QTranslator::load()](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtranslator.html#load) for the patterns used when looking for translation files).
 Hmm the initial code had a "System Language" entry, but I removed it for some reason I cannot recall now. But I'll put it back, I think it makes sense to have it.
 (closed by accident) :grin: 
 Oh, I remember the doubts I had when I removed this option.
Tell me what you think:
I thought about two cases, one where the user's locale has a corresponding translation and the other where it doesn't.

For the first case, supposing that the language is German, I thought that it would be more informative to just show "German" selected instead of "System Language", because there's a German translation and the application would be in German. For the second case, I thought that showing "English" right away instead of "System Language" would also be more informative because it indicates clearly that there's no translation in the user's language and that it has defaulted to English.

And the language names will always be in English. This was meant to prevent cases where the users couldn't find their languages because the program somehow started in a strange language (perhaps it would be better to show the name of the languages in the native version?).

(BTW, I have to add some comments to the code about this).
 @rp- I reverted the changes but unfortunately using the native version turned out to be a no can do. That would break compatibility as the methods were introduced in Qt 4.8. 

That's right, @justinclift, the user is the ultimate tester I guess :smile: 
 Thanks @MKleusberg!
Yeah, I plan to open some other pull requests soon :smile: I was looking at the issues to see what needed to be done, but if you've got some suggestion just let me know :grinning: 

And appending those strings is a great idea -- I'll do some tests later.
  I use SQLiteBrowser in Windows Vista
1. I clicked in saveSQL file in execute SQL tab
2. In select file name window I press Save button and browses all folders (browse/hide folders option) instead of saving.
3. When it browses, I press again Save and nothing happens
 You have a SQL-statement correctly executed in the screen?
If so then click save-SQL-icon, type a filename
then save
 No i didn't I am still getting this bug
 Hello,

I don't think I solved it. Actually I quit being à programmer And I don't
think I am dealing with this anymore. But thank you for your interset
anyway
  The argument count (first parameter) is a reference, and thus must be kept alive for the whole lifetime of the QCoreApplication instance, as also the Qt apidocs say.

Also properly create a "string array" for the actual args, instead of badly casting a string to that.

This fixes sporadic crashes in this test, for example as seen for some architectures in the Debian build of 3.4.0: https://buildd.debian.org/status/logs.php?pkg=sqlitebrowser&ver=3.4.0-1 & http://buildd.debian-ports.org/status/logs.php?pkg=sqlitebrowser&ver=3.4.0-1 (click on texts in the "Result" column to see the logs).
  I've noticed that the types available when creating a new field in a table are limited.  Is there any goal to support datetime?
 SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times.
  "Error adding new record: near ")":syntax error". I don't know where to search the problem.
Please make a repair function, fix this or show the position of the illegal record. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13673400/test.sqlite

After "compact database" the button "write changes" is disabled.
 The problem is probably in your schema SQLite does not recognize the types 'BOOL' nor 'DATETIME

 @rp:
thank you for fixing!

@MKleusberg:
Writing the changes is ok, but if you open a db-file and compress it you need to change anything in db to be able to save the compressed one.
 @justinclift The "compact" function seems to have effect if a record between records was deleted. Description of behaviour of 2 Versions before, step by step what I did:
- remove record(s) between other records (in "Browse Data")
- write changes
- press compact
- write-button is greyed out, but at this time nothing was saved and filesize is still large

In Version 3.5.1 DB is written to file immediately after clicking on "compact database". I would prefer to save manually, but issue is fixed. :)
  I believe it would be quite useful to be able to change the application language in the preferences dialog.
For example, my system language is German because I'm trying to learn it, but I like to use some applications in English because otherwise I have no clue of what they are saying.

I could work on this if you like.
From what I saw, DB Browser would probably need to be restarted to apply the change (as does Qt Creator when changing the language).

One problem would be where to put this option in the preference dialog. I thought about creating another tab (e.g. "Interface"), but I'm not sure if a tab with only a single drop down menu would look nice.
 Perhaps all text to be translated in a seperate dynamic file
 @Z4us sorry, but I didn't understand. What do you mean by separate file? I meant an option in the Preferences pane to select between the .qm translation files.

@justinclift Can you please test if you can change the language on the Mac (by changing the environment variables) with the lastest version? While working on this I found out that I cannot change it and I think it might be a bug.
 @https://github.com/samir-aguiar I mean it may be possible that developers make a kind of template for translators to easily translate the relevant data in the source to be translated to their language.
 @MKleusberg great, I'm working on this :grinning: 
 I've just opened a pull request, but let's leave there while we decide on this then. :)

But I don't know, although this can happen most users will probably use that option once (if ever) and leave it alone for good. In such cases I think it would be strange to have it on the main screen.
 I think if any app opens in a language you can't understand there is something very wrong, so I would kill it and then check my OS settings and search for known issues. If that is still not fixable I would try it on another machine or read someone's advice, probably from a ticket here, to navigate in the language I don't know to select one I do. So, my personal view is not on the main screen but in the preferences, somewhere.

Note: just giving a point of view, in a friendly way, to help
 Much better to think out loud @justinclift and have the discussion in public, especially for an open source project. @samir-aguiar I think the key is getting it working, then we can all see it, test it and you or someone can always comment, suggest or tweek it later. I always prefer to get functionality in and then tidy up afterwards.
 Keep thinking out loud @justinclift, ideas are always welcome. :smile: 
I couldn't agree more, @glawrence. The current pull request is for a working version if you want to give it a go.
 Please if possible wait until I make the changes suggested by @MKleusberg because I might ask for suggestions. :smile: 
 So I've implemented the changes proposed by @MKleusberg and the behavior is the following: it adds the suffix "[System language]" when the language has a corresponding translation and, if that's not English, it adds "[Default language]" to English. It also moves the selected language to the top.

However, for English the resulting text is "English (United States) [System language]", which seems kinda ugly to me. It's also a little long, so the combo box width would need to be increased. Any suggestions here?
 Okay then!
What about some flags? :smile: 

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3753623/6118080/2783eb5e-b0ba-11e4-8d2a-e3a19fd8c18d.png)
 It's actually quite easy to add them; QComboBox supports passing a QIcon() along with the data, so it would be a matter of including the images in the resource file. Of course, a image file would need to be added for every new translation.
I've found [this pack](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/world-flags-icons-by-osiris.html) that contains a lot of flags and is free to use according to the license. There's also [some repos](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=country+flags&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults) here.
 Yeah, that's good. I'll be doing some tests and commit later this week.
 Well, I guess it's done.
The system and default language (when the former is not American English) now have a suffix appended to them and the chosen language stays on top.

I've done a lot of testing with those flags and couldn't get them to look nice when building with small resolutions, so I've just built 320x240 images and manually rescaled them with Gimp.

If someone could test the width of the combo box under Windows that would be great. I've tested under OSX and Linux, but I couldn't find a setting that would make it look aligned with the QLineEdit above it, so I increased the minimum size of the QLineEdit. Not sure if that won't look weird on Windows as they don't look the same under different OS.
  Hi,

I am pleased to announce that it's done! I created the ports and it was commited.
https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=196365

You can install it via FreeBSD ports system:
# make -C /usr/ports/databases/sqlitebrowser install
 Yes,

You have two choice for install it:
Using port:
#make -C /usr/ports/databases/sqlitebrowser install

Using package:
#pkg install quiterss

Regards
 Sorry...

I works on quiterrss package too..
Remove pkg install quiterss.
It's:
#pkg install sqlitebrowser 
 Yes, I will update the port.
 Done with a patch for translations: using Datadir (/usr/local/share/sqlitebrowser/) when installing instead of binary dir (/usr/local/bin).

Waiting for approval https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=197253
 Hello, I do not think that this patch is to be applied in the code base, it was necessary for me to make a clean install on FreeBSD. Nevertheless, it may be possible to perform a modification of the code to be compatible with all systems. Indeed, SqliteBrowser search the directory "translations" where it is installed (local dir or install dir /usr/[local]/bin). 
Now it is in my view a mistake when it is installed, it must be in the directory of application-related documents (/usr/[local]/share). If the patch is to be applied, it should probably create a variable in CMake replacing %%DATADIR%% the right path (/usr/share/sqlitebrowser, /usr/local/share/ sqlitebrowser/, ./ etc.)
What did you think?
 sqlitebrowser 3.5.1 commited on FreeBSD :)
https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=197474
  Hi! 

I'm running DB Browser for Sqlite 3.4.0 on Windows 7.
- run test1:
  
  <pre>
  CREATE TABLE "a" (
  `b` TEXT CHECK(`b`='A')
  );
  </pre>
  
  and visit the Database Structure view: 1 table "a" with 1 column "b", that's OK.
- delete table "a" and run test2:
  
  <pre>
  CREATE TABLE "a" (
  `b` TEXT CHECK(`b`='A' or `b`='B')
  );
  </pre>
  
  and visit again the Database Structure view: 1 table "a" but column "b" is not shown.

Can you please confirm if bug is reproducible for you as well.

I guess the problem is in the Database Structure parser, even if sqlite3.g seemed correct to me at first sight (i.e. "CHECK LPAREN expr RPAREN"). Thanks for your work, your time and your product, kindest regards.

Andrea
 Hello Justin,

  I downloaded latest build (http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz) a few minutes ago and repeated test2. It still shows the same defect as in ver.3.4.0. 

May I please ask to you (and/or to who reads here and has some time and patience) to execute test2? Just to exclude that my setup is wrong. Thanks and kindest regards,

Andrea
 I downloaded the latest build and re-ran test2, now it works correctly. Thank you guys!
  Please consider writing and installing an AppData file with the application description and some screenshots, else sqlitebrowser looks really bad in the GNOME and KDE Software Centers. We'd love to showcase more applications, but without the extra data file we can't.

See http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/ for details; thanks!

Richard
 I believe you can do this yourself via a pull request, so why not do it yourself, you seem to know what is required?

Rather than use developer time on this, I reckon someone else could help with this, if you. I would be happy to give it a go if there are no other volunteers and it is agreed this is a good thing.
 Right, I could indeed do a pull request. There are three main reason I've asked upstream maintainers to do this rather than just submit something myself:
- You probably know the application inside out, e.g. how to take screenshots to fully show off all the features that would take many weeks of me using to find out.
- You can update the description and screenshots yourself when you add new features or port the UI to a new toolkit.
- Time; so far 473 upstream projects[1] have written AppData files, and I simple can't scale myself to do all that.

Also, according to https://alt.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/screenshots/f22/matrix.html sqlitebrowser doesn't have any keywords in the .desktop file, which means that searching for it in the software center is going to be harder.

[1] https://alt.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/screenshots/f22/status.html -- warning, BIG HTML page
 Yes, ok, I will give this a go. Do you have a target date for the next release?
 I have created a pull request, please see my comments in the request as I believe it needs to be checked.

@hughsie could you take a quick look too please?
  When I try to export as CSV the output from a query with delimiter set to ',' (comma), it does not quote fields that contain commas.
 Yes, the latest nightly build fixed this issue.
  Hello,

I want to re-create an index for a database file and it has to be similar to the previous formatting. To have that, I want an option "None" for sorting of an index. Now there are "ASC" and "DESC" only. I don't want any sorting. Please add this. It's very important. Thanks! :)

Before:
(
    key_remote_jid,
    key_from_me,
    key_id
)

After:
(
    key_remote_jid, ASC,
    key_from_me, ASC,
    key_id, ASC
)
 Thanks a lot. :)
 Hello, I checked it out right now. Works great. Thanks. :)
  I know that the preferred method for compiling is cmake, but I tried to compile through Qt Creator with qmake and had problems with the libraries because I was using shadow build.
Besides, of course, disabling shadow build, another solution I found was to use the OUT_PWD variable instead of the PWD variable when declaring the libs path. The code looks like this:

``` qmake
LIBPATH_QHEXEDIT=$$OUT_PWD/../libs/qhexedit
LIBPATH_ANTLR=$$OUT_PWD/../libs/antlr-2.7.7
LIBPATH_QCUSTOMPLOT=$$OUT_PWD/../libs/qcustomplot-source
```

This variable is equal to PWD when shadow build is disabled and equals to the build directory when it’s enabled, so it should keep the current behavior but add support for shadow build.

Of course, although it worked on OS 10.9.5 with Qt 5.4, I’m not sure whether this variable is always valid in every version. This would require some checking (if empty, if valid, etc.).

Anyway, what are your thoughts about this change?
 If this works only for higher versions of OSX (I for one have 10.6.8) DB browser for SQLite can't claim anymore to be compatible for 10.6 thru 10.10; in and of itself not a bad idea. Happy holidays y'all!
 The age old problem of moving forward and remaining backward compatible, which has no simple answer! Personally I would vote for sticking with one release branch, ie not maintaining multiple major versions, moving forward to Qt5.4 etc and maybe leaving an old release available for those that need it. Allowing easy building in QtCreator might actually help with development and new comers getting started.
 @MKleusberg if everything is good, here it goes :)
  If main is encrypted the version with SQLcipher seems to think all databases to attach are encrypted even when they are not.
 I took like 10 minutes tit test the build of MMXV-II-V and it works of course. I expected no less of MKleusberg. You guys rule! Keep up the great work on DB Browser4SQLite. Can we expect a 3.5.1 soon? 
  Program (3.4.0 as downloaded 2014-12-11 from sourceforge) immediately phones home to an IP hosting suspicious sites such as 5monkeys.se (see http://reverseip.domaintools.com/search/?q=23.235.43.133). It shows no opt-out or autoaupdate options.
  This is what happens when I try to delete this entry, 

SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `Instances`  ORDER BY `name` DESC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `Instances`  ORDER BY `name` DESC LIMIT 0, 50000;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `Instances`  ORDER BY `name` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `Instances`  ORDER BY `name` ASC LIMIT 0, 50000;
DELETE FROM `Instances` WHERE `_rowid_`=0;
SELECT COUNT(_) FROM (SELECT `_rowid_`,_ FROM `Instances`  ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC);
SELECT `_rowid_`,\* FROM `Instances`  ORDER BY `_rowid_` ASC LIMIT 0, 50000;

nothing is deleted...even in edit mode clearing the cell does nada. The row in question is empty yes, but still has an id (type of data currently in cell: text /numeric 10 char(s)) so I want it gone, seem impossible =/ actually nothing can be saved to these entries it seems???

Sorting is also reset after "delete record" is pressed, very annoying =)
 @justinclift Win8.1 and latest version DB Browser for SQLite at that time. @rp- thats not my fault, this is what the app generated! The db (s3db) comes with this program https://simcitypak.codeplex.com/ I've moved on and using another app SQLite Studio. No problem deleted anything there. So its not a problem with the db itself.  
 Should be any blank row. I don't have that database anymore. And don't have the time right now to setup it up...
 11 days ago, not sure if it were 3.4.0 or any other version at that time. But the issue is real no matter what you say =) keep looking. There are empty rows.
 @MKleusberg  Haha good work! I'll have to give it another try just because you spent all that time locating the issue WTG!
 sure why not
 @justinclift could you link me perhaps, I see nothing called Nightly Builds only the master updated 2h ago =)
 SQLite by default uses 64-bit: https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html

<quote>
ROWIDs and the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY

Except for WITHOUT ROWID tables, all rows within SQLite tables have a 64-bit signed integer key that uniquely identifies the row within its table. This integer is usually called the "rowid". 
</quote>
 @MKleusberg ok, spanx, I'll test this out later today then =) Or a little later then that =/
 Seem to work fine, GJ.
  The problem is that the CMakeLists.txt for the unit tests doesn't include the PreferencesDialog class files. I think that including them there would probably cause issues because they include the `ui_PreferencesDialog.h`, which is automatically generated.

I don't know if there are better options, but what could be done is either pass the NULL color to the model once it's set or surround the code that calls `PreferencesDialog::getSettingsValue()` with preprocessor checks, where the checked macro would be defined in the unit tests CMakeLists.txt (e.g. check if this is not a unit test build).

But the code to change the color worked nice here. :+1: 

(A fix that I propose: according to the [Qt documentation](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qt.html#ItemDataRole-enum), BackgroundColorRole is obsolete and BackgroundRole should be used instead.)
 Ops :smile: 
I'm just fixing up some stuff and was about to write here.
 No, that's what I was fixing!

I've merged it and rebased to add a commit _before_ the change introduced by @Chuongv that broke the unit tests. Don't know if that was the best option, but I thought that it would be better to do it this way because we can keep the history without having a commit changing multiple stuff (which would happen if I had amended one of his commits to fix the unit tests build).

I've also amended the last commit to use Qt::BackgroundRole instead of Qt::BackgroundColorRole, as the last is deprecated.
 What do you think? :smile: 
 No worries guys! :smile: 
BTW, I've decided to add the PreferencesDialog files to the unit tests (didn't realize it could be done at the time of my comment about this) because from what I've seen it leaves space for further customizations of the data shown on "Browse Data" tab (e.g. change the font size, font type, etc.).
  Attempting to export a SQLite table to a CSV file. Table contains text fields with carriage returns. Instead of properly wrapping the carriage returns, they're included in the output file. This causes issues when opening the CSV file. This happens in the export to SQL file as well:

INSERT INTO `SqliteArticleV3` VALUES ('04a2cca8-ab3c-47bd-bd6b-66be299c88b7','2012-12-28 00:00:00','Lazy day','0','Lazy day today. ',NULL,NULL,'0');
INSERT INTO `SqliteArticleV3` VALUES ('23e40c94-a559-4e71-9940-7499f6b39e49','2013-01-07 00:00:00','xxxxxxxxx','0','10:25 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
10:28 xxxxxxxxxx
10:29 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

gap

10:51 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
',NULL,NULL,'0');
INSERT INTO `SqliteArticleV3` VALUES ('22153e94-3b09-4c58-9ff9-6dd3b3f99157','2013-01-08 00:00:00',NULL,'0','xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.',NULL,NULL,'0');

(Output edited to replace original text) This occurs in the current version, but not v2b. 
 Doh! I should've included such information! Sorry :(

I've done some further testing, and I must apologise profusely! It is a wetware error on my behalf. In my defence I do have a neurological condition. But there is nothing wrong with your output. Very sorry. I should have triple checked before I leaped.

Do keep up the good work. This is a wonderful tool. :)
  If the dataset is too big, I want to navigate to the head and the end. So I add two buttons to do so.
  Hola,
¿hay alguna forma de introducir funciones como valor DEFAULT para un campo?
Lo que necesito es el valor de hora UTC como entero con este esquema:

```
 `timestamp` INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (strftime('%s','now'))
```

veo el código y parece que no es posible.

Sería útil una ampliación que aceptara esta funcionalidad.
Por ejemplo, Visual FoxPro usa el "=()" para reconocer funciones:

```
=(expresion)
```

en mi caso en particular podría entrar

```
=(strftime('%s','now'))
```

Un cambio en EditTableDialog.cpp (lineas 347 y 348) podría ser este:

```
QChar ch = new_value.trimmed().at(0);
if(!( (ch == '\'' || ch == '"') && new_value.trimmed().endsWith(ch)  ))
{
    if ( ch == '=' && new_value.trimmed().endsWith(')') && new_value.trimmed().at(1) == '(' )
          new_value = new_value.trimmed().substring_function_I_dont_know(1);  // get rid of '='
    else
    //...
```

No conozco QT ni C++, pero es algo así.

He modificado el formato para darle claridad al código, también emparejo comillas simples con simples y dobles con dobles (la implementación actual acepta entradas como 'mydefault").

Bueno, la idea está allí.
Gracias.
 Hello
(sorry, my "english" is very poor, i edited my post without backtick quotes, for google compat)

DB Browser (DBB) supports default values, i.e. values as defaults, but NOT functions (expressions).

In the example I post, the column name is "timestamp", type INT, and must defaults to the current datetime in UTC, _as integer_. Because type affinity, SQLite converts this expression to integer with this SQL form:

```
CREATE TABLE foo (
timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (strftime('%s','now'))
....
```

But, when I enter the expression `strftime('%s', 'now')` in the "default" column of the DBB **Table Editor** (not in the "Execute SQL" tab), DBB converts this to the text `'(strftime(''%s'', ''now''))'` and then generate this SQL:

```
CREATE TABLE foo (
timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT '(strftime(''%s'',''now''))'
```

of course, SQLite replaces the timestamp field with the literal string (strftime('%s','now')), and not the _numeric_ value returned by this function.

I hope I have been clear,
thanks.

Sorry, perdón por la demora.
Acabo de probar la versión en desarrollo de 13-Dec-2014 02:14
Tiene un pequeño detalle: al abrir la tabla para _modificar_ la estructura, el signo '=' no se lee. Si el esquema se guarda sin editar un campo calculado, el campo se mantiene; pero si se modifica, hay que agregarle el caracter '=' nuevamente para que el editor lo reconozca como una función.
Aparte de eso, que supongo será sencillo de corregir, al parecer funciona perfecto :thumbsup:
Anexo 3 imágenes con la prueba que hice.

Muchas, muchas gracias !!

Una simple prueba:

 Hi.
If you mean that it is necessary "=()" to indicate that the default value is a function, I think so.
The point is: When the schema (of the table) is re-open for edit, the SB analyzer does not recover the equal sign, and if the developer changes the default field, he/she must reenter the sign for the analyzer recognizes the changed default value as a function. It is not serious, but it is uncomfortable.
The first time it happened to me I did a quick change to the default for the strtest field, and the query did not returns the results I expected. When I checked the schema, I realized that SB had kept the default value as text, and I to re-edit the schema to add the '=' and remove the duplicate quotes.
 ok, I test it tomorrow
 @justinclift / @MKleusberg, it is working like a charm :+1:
  I am trying to convert an existing MySQL DB to sqlite.  Being an optimist, I first tried an "ansi-compatible" export from the MySQL DB for one table, created (and saved) a new DB in sqlitebrowser and then tried running some of the Export file.  The result is that sqlitebrowser just hangs.

I was hoping to see it report a syntax error or something like that so I could go about massaging the sql exported from MySQL so I could do my conversion.

The SQL I tried to run in sqlitebrowser was the following:

``` sql
SET time_zone = "+00:00";

/*!40101 SET @OLD_CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT=@@CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT */;
/*!40101 SET @OLD_CHARACTER_SET_RESULTS=@@CHARACTER_SET_RESULTS */;
/*!40101 SET @OLD_COLLATION_CONNECTION=@@COLLATION_CONNECTION */;
/*!40101 SET NAMES utf8 */;

Ideally sqlitebrowser should report what the error(s) is/are rather than just hanging.
 I'm using version 2.0b1, the version that installs when you use "apt-get" in Ubuntu 14.04LTS.  I guess it's out of date.  As I'd not seen this issue in any of the bugs reported here, I assumed it had not been fixed but if it works for you, then obviously it has been fixed in a more recent version.
 I manage all my apps via apt-get.  For things that are way out of date, I go looking for a ppa.  I can't find any for sqlitebrowser and my version of Ubuntu (14.04).
While I'm OK with building from source, I find most apps usually just drift out of date that way, even though the opposite is true for some apps, like this one.
Any thoughts on how to get a more recent version into this distro of Ubuntu?
 Hi Guys,
Sorry for the delayed response, but many thanks for the ppa and I can report that it worked for me without a hitch (Ubuntu 14.04LTS 64-bit).
Thanks again!
 I've re-labelled this issue to something more appropriate to the underlying problem.  I'm happy to close it now, but it doesn't seem like I can do that myself?
 added ppa,
then on apt-get update i get :

 @justinclift yup on 12.04

thx and kudos!
 Hi,

I just have the same very old version 2.0b1 with my new elementary os 0.3 install (ubuntu 14.04 based) with the app manager. I have build my own 3.5.1 version and its works fine but I think that an updated version to the ubuntu app manager could be a good contribution for the community !
 So, I just have tried the ppa from @deepsidhu1313 and the install works but I have an UI issue, maybe because im in Elementary OS. My own build hasn't this issue. The weird problem is now i cant build anymore my own build, the sudo make install say : 

```
Linking CXX static library libantlr.a
[ 24%] Built target antlr
[ 25%] Generating src/moc_qhexedit_p.cxx
moc: Cannot open options file specified with @"
```

So I cant show you the good UI in Elementary OS, but this is the weird UI with the PPA :

 I have almost same UI with both windows version (via wine or on windows) and linux version (debianized), so i can't tell the difference.
If it is some bug in packaging let me know. :smile: , I can use other ways to package files.

I'd normally be happy to help but we're away cruising at present and

 @justinclift Glad to see the changes in the new nightly build :+1:,  but I think a different background color for NULLs will be better :-)
 @justinclift I pefer the second version, otherwise I have to judge whether it is a cell with the string value of "NULL" or not at the first sight.
 As you might expect other folks have been listening to this, so I thought I would throw my view into the mix, hope you don't mind....

It would help if some of the example screens had empty strings as well as NULL so we can compare.

Personally I would like to see something in the NULL column, maybe this: {NULL}
Or some other brackets, and shading also helps but I am not sure I want this leaping out at me in red, it is not the most important thing on the screen and is certainly not a crisis!

I guess in an ideal world we would have the following, roughly, in Preferences:
- show NULL in results
- text to indicate NULL
- foreground colour
- background colour

That way we can all be happy, some with their bold red, others more subtle and others keeping the status quo.
  If software can automatically check for updates, we should have a button [Update] that downloads new exe and then starts installer.
 Something that I thought:
The program could check for updates when initializing, and...
- On Windows it would download and run the installer, that should remove the previous version and install the new files.
- On Mac perhaps it's better to integrate Sparkle into the project and let it do the job. It's widely used and probably has less bugs than the alternatives.
- On Linux I think the package manager should take care of this.
 Yeah, I was thinking about giving it a try. :smile: 
But I didn't know that there was a Homebrew formula for DB Browser 4 SQLite (I'm waiting for that acronym). Homebrew doesn't officially support autoupdate, does it? If not, Mac users who wanted that would need to set up a cron job or schedule the execution of a AppleScript/Automator Task.

Anyway, I'll do some testings with Sparkle and tell what I find.

edit: I don't know why I confused "acronym" with "anagram".
 Yeah, it would be great. Please send it to me :grinning:
 Nice @justinclift, I was already thinking about asking you if you used qmake and macdeployqt to generate the bundles and .dmg files because I have another pull request to open related to the translations thing and bundle generation. Thanks!

DB4S sounds good to me :smile: 
 Just a status update: I've managed to integrate Sparkle into the app, but not without adding code. I needed to add a small Object-C++ source file to call the Sparkle methods. Sparkle also requires packages to be signed and does a bunch of checks to avoid tampered updates so the .plist files required some changes as well.
Anyway, it was just the basic integration; I still need to look at Sparkle's code to see what options they provide and run more tests.
  This Feature request comes along issues #114 and #107.

It would be nice if there would be a progress indicator when opening big databases or exporting big tables. `Cancel` button also will be welcome. Currently application freezes and becomes unresponsive until the operation ends. And you keep wondering if it's frozen for good or it's still alive and doing something.
 Looks good to me.
 A pop up, Justin? There are people who hate them, even block them. Better is IMNSHO a menu item called Staus or Progress with lines for all (sub)processes that take longer than let's say two or three minutes.
 Right, some kewl animation if technically not too hard to develop :)
  Hi there,

When I import data from a CVS file (exported from excel), one of the columns in the database is a numeric hexColor. some of those hexColors are "000000"(or black), and they are imported as "0" into SQL.Another issue is the hexColor "314659" is imported as "5.57e+92".

ATTACHED IMAGE EXPLANATION:

 I will give that a try! thanks
 Hey Justin,

This issue was discovered when I tried to remove the hexColors alpha values from, so “FF01273C” to “01273C”. I ended up going back to the hexColor with the alpha “FF” values.

Cheers,

  Opening a db file with a table like this crashes SqliteBrowser:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE table1 (
    id1,
    id2,
    PRIMARY KEY(id1, id2)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

The crash happens at `sqlitetypes.cpp:391`. That line fails because `tab.findPk()` returns `-1` as it can't find a single primary key column.

``` cpp
Table CreateTableWalker::table()
{
    Table tab("");

    if( m_root ) //CREATE TABLE
    {
        …
        while(s != antlr::nullAST)
        {
            // Is this a 'without rowid' definiton?
            if(s->getType() != sqlite3TokenTypes::WITHOUT)
            {
                …
            } else {
                tab.setRowidColumn(tab.fields().at(tab.findPk())->name()); // <-- Line 391, Probably faulty
            }
        }
    }

    return tab;
}
```

 Looks like it crashes with a table like this as well:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE table1 (
    id1,
    PRIMARY KEY(id1)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

This however works:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE table1 (
    id1 PRIMARY KEY
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```
 A lot of the code seems to depend on the existence of a single column primary key. When there's no rowid, the software kind of emulates one using the primary key (it only supports integer primary keys because of that behaviour). This obviously fails with composite primary keys.

I reckon quite some code would have to be redesigned in order to fix this issue.
 So @justinclift unfortunately I don't have enough understanding of SqliteBrowser's inner workings to efficiently tackle this. This may be better done by someone who's familiar with the codebase, as it doesn't look like a simple fix.

I hope I could help you by pointing out the source of the malfunction.
 I tried 3.4.0 on Windows (two different machines) and Linux, and the current master branch @1ce33792c534f7228fd888d0b27f5abdc51c8c28 on Linux.

Hm… Are you sure you used a table having without rowid _and_ a multi-column primary key? As far as I can see, the code doesn't handle this case at all.
 Weird… Now I can't reproduce it with the examples I posted any more. I still have a db file that crashes though, I'll see if I can strip it.
 So I can't reproduce the crash with my examples any more. The following table however still crashes:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE test (
    key TEXT NOT NULL,
    value TEXT NOT NULL, 
    PRIMARY KEY(key)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

That's most likely due to the keyword `key` being used without quotes. The following variations work:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE test (
    key TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    value TEXT NOT NULL
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

``` sql
CREATE TABLE test (
    key TEXT NOT NULL,
    value TEXT NOT NULL, 
    PRIMARY KEY(key)
);
```
 Yes that fixed it. I'm still sure I had crashes with the first examples I posted, but the last one is fixed, and I can't reproduce the others. Thanks!
  Possibly add the feature to compare 2 separate database files to find differences in the tables... Possibility? Or just a dream?
 Differences in schema or data? 
 Lol I smell a challenge... First one to make it happen gets extra credit
rofl.

I tried using beyond compare (http://www.scootersoftware.com/index.php) to
compare the csv files... but it takes forever xD... I was thinking because
your program is fast and easily navigates through all the data that it
would be a great feature. Differences of the data in the tables

 Hello,
I would of course use 4.8+ if we had that on OS/2, but for now we stuck @ 4.7.3
Is there no way to make it working for 4.7.3 ?
 Hi
Ok Thankz for answers
 Hi

I have no time yet. But i will try to find some time next week
 Hihi

Had some time, and a friend helped me out :)

 Hello

I add the diff file.
I also change the win.rc and made a os2 ico
 Hihi

Yes looks ok to me :P

Only i need to send you the Os2 ico and the os2 rc file.

Mayby better change in pro file:
os2:RC_FILE = os2app.rc

To not mixed up stuff, as i had to change the winapp.rc file to make it 
working with Os2

I can send you both files
 Hihi

As promised :)
 Hi

Did i miss something ?
Cause i thought is where fixed now.
 I send them last week.
 I will resend then when im home
 Hihi

Sure i have sometime to test. I will test tomorow. I can just pull a build
from site..
 Hi Justin,

Just did a fresh pull and it's compiling without any error :)

So all seems to be ok, wanne thankz you for the great help :)

 Hello

They know where to look :)
  When dump .db to .sql

In version 3.3.1:
INSERT INTO `T_EXAMPLE` VALUES('STRING',0,'STRING2',0,NULL);

In version 3.4.0:
INSERT INTO `T_EXAMPLE` VALUES ('STRING','0','STRING2','0',NULL);
1. Additional space is attached to "VALUES"
2. Integer value is wrapped with ' '

Especially number 2 problem. Is it correct? I suppose it is not.
 @justinclift Microsoft Windows 7 Korean. Sorry for late reply. ;)
 I just tested using 22-Nov-2014 02:16 nightly build. There's another problem.

In version 3.3.1:
INSERT INTO T_EXAMPLE VALUES('STRING',0,'STRING2','',0,NULL);

In 22-Nov-2014 02:16 nightly build:
INSERT INTO T_EXAMPLE VALUES ('STRING','0','STRING2',NULL,'0',NULL);

'' is mapped to NULL. These two are completely different. Check again please. @justinclift 
 I just tested using 25-Nov-2014 02:15 nightly build. Everything's OK. Thank you. @justinclift @rp- 
  I create a sqlite database with the password 'abcd'.When I try to open the database ,this software just told me "Invalid file format"
I wonder why there is no choice to inuput the password to access the database
 I download the windows.exe file from http://sqlitebrowser.org/   .
I create the database  by the SQLiteConnection.CreateFile("c:\test.db3").
SQLiteConnection.Changepassword("newpassword")  to set the password.
Using the dll System.Data.SQLite.dll for .net.

The version of DB Browser for SQLite can not find ,because I have uninstall the software.
I think the version is the latest.
 See issue https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/12 
  I have a big database in mind that will be in sqlite.
And the most common data fill scenario would be the following:
There are 2-3 dictionary-tables that store dictionary entires, lots of them.
And there will be 1 table that will tie these entries together.
Obviously, this combination-table will have only id's from dictionary-tables, but it's so difficult to first input dictionaries, and they jump between tabs trying to memorize id's while pasting them to combination table.

I understand this probably isn't any close to a possible priority, but if there was only a way to say 'this cell of tableA can have only id's of tableB rows', but when I try to type something into tableA cell - show a dropdown of not-yet-added rows from tableB so I would be able to pick a row by the name, and UI would just add a correct id. This will simplify managing data a lot.
 Yes, I tried LibreOffice + ODBC for Sqlite, and couldn't find out how to do that. Can you give me the steps if you know? I have no problem using some other software, but I've tried a couple, including LibreOffice, and couldn't do what I wanted
 Can be done easily with SQLite and perhaps it is done yet. To re-invent the wheel is a waste of time, isn't it. Post it to SQLiteUserList and you'll get quite a few answers, I suspect. 

OffTopic: What is actually the difference between 'LibreOffice' and 'Open Office' ?
  I'm trying to input some rare UTF symbols, like acute accent (U0301), for example. But looks like edits fields in the UI do not support them.
Would be great if I could see them in UI.
Also, any way to input such symbols? Like, if I write \U0301 in the Edit field, will it read as one symbol in db or as 5?
 I'm on Win7 X64 English version.
Version... let me see, probably not the latest, but the one before that.
Basically seems like lots of software has problems inputting acute accent. Like Windows Notepad, for example. It's a tough symbol because it should combine with the previous symbol by the font itself.
 I have 3.3.1 atm
 @AAverin 

Latest version is 3.4 and for Windows are nightly builds abailable. I remember from Windows (was pre 7 to be honestl perhaps it's deprecated in 7+?) one can enter characters not on your keyboard via Alt+<numeric keypad values>, but it would be a great enhancement to make this possible for other types of OS like OSX, Linux etc.
  It would be really neat if the 'open SQL file' dialog (on Execute SQL tab) would remember the last directory I opened a file from. Now I have to navigate to the correct directory every time.

Also, when I press save it does not remember that I opened a sql file in the first place so I have to find the file. This could be a UX choice though.

One last thing. Some database tools have the option to execute sql that is currently selected. The execute current line option is nice, but often you will want to execute multiple lines.
 Hi! Thanks for your response. 

About the 'execute currently selected text', wow! I did not know you could do that! Great!!

> With the "Save Project" dialog, it also does that for me. I'm not sure you need to actually do that though when you want to just save your changes. You might be able to use the "Write Changes" button in the top bar for that. Lets ask Martin and Rene, just to confirm. :wink: @MKleusberg @rp- Thoughts on that?

Okay I guess I wasn't clear, sorry. Follow along if you will:
1. open an existing SQL (script) file, eg _test.sql_
2. make some changes to it
3. click 'save sql file' to save

Now, DB browser for SQLite will now ask me to give a name to that sql file, but it should follow that it should just use the file that I opened in the first place, namely _test.sql_. Am I making more sense?
 Wow I'm truly amazed by this speedy response. When I wrote it it was more of a 'would be nice if this was implemented at some point or another' but to actually have it coded the next day is something else. Great!

My C++ is quite rusty and I've got a lot of things going on at the mo, but I hope I can at least donate through paypal or something? And of course I'll test the nightly. I'm using Db browser on Windows at the moment.
 I checked today's nightly and it works great! It would be a great asset to the program to have this in the code base! Marking it complete.
   Oh, I'm sorry, my OP was really ambiguous.
Actually, I mean exactly this behavior that you've shown me. 
I created this issue because I didn't see this with "PRAGMA table_info". 
For example, there is an output for existing table:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4062234/4992920/d7a5b4fc-69b8-11e4-80e3-864cbdd688d9.png)
But if table does not exist, we have something like this:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4062234/4992925/e528f346-69b8-11e4-8509-b365c2e95d96.png)
I think it will be clearer if the middle pane will be empty after the second query
 @justinclift, with pleasure, thank you!
 Now I see desirable result: middle pane was cleared after PRAGMA. I think the bug can be closed now. 
Thanks for your support! :) 
  This select is working:
select \* from
Table1 join Table2
on Table1.ConsumerID = Table2.id
where Table1.visibility = 0 and Table2.visibility = 1

This Update is not working:
update Table1
set Table1.Visibility=1
from Table1
Table1 join Table2
on Table1.ConsumerID = Table2.id
where Table1.visibility = 0 and Table2.visibility = 1

The error message is:
near ".": syntax error:

First of all the syntax has no error and then the message is not understandable.
Where is the problem?
 You are right, sorry for the mistake and thanks for the useful link.
This is a great support!
  It would be great if the "Export to CSV" dialog (for queries) would remember the options. I like to export TAB-separated without quoting, so right now I have to click four times every export.

Also it would be great if the file save dialog that comes after would not be restricted. I like to save those as .tsv or even without file extension. 

I am on Linux, using version 3.4.0
 Remembering settings works like a charm, thanks!
 Actually, it would be nice if it would remember the directory too, at least on subsequent exports. But I wouldn't consider this worth re-opening. :)
  For example:
![sqlitebrowser_browsedata](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3741754/4948757/c52c1f1a-6656-11e4-866b-bf4b369723fa.png)
If table name in quotes, in query then data is shown:
![sqlitebrowser_query](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3741754/4948765/fd7ece62-6656-11e4-9443-cefc0ca34629.png)
 @justinclift I'm using Linux mint latest LTE
 @justinclift sorry, I forgot remove old version =)
  Would be cool if we can search all the tables. This SQlite file has 25 different item tables... I am trying to find the one that uses 0479 for the id_icon xD

![screenshot_12](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2800945/4947305/52c7e0e2-6621-11e4-964b-d4083bdc1282.png)
 Well i could use XYPlorer to search all of the CSV table contents. Either way works lol. Just a built in search would be  faster :)
  When browsing the data of the SQlite file can you make it so that its possible to export all the tables into CSV files? Doing one at a time is taking forever xD
 Id be honored :+1:   Lol
 It Works!!! And so far I don't see any problems. But If I do I will report.
  If I try to right-click on a custom file type, and open with, sqlite browser doesn't appear. Even after going browse -> and manually selecting the sqlitebrowser executable from program files doesn't fix the issue.

Also sqlitebrowser doesn't appear in the list of programs to uninstall
 FYI there were some keys in the registry which were pointing to
SqliteBrowser3\sqlitebrowser.exe instead of
SqliteBrowser3\bin\sqlitebrowser.exe.
I got it working eventually by changing these keys, and possibly deleting
some other keys; I don't remember exactly what I did

 Yeah it was fixed ages ago, thanks
  ME AGAIN XD

That tool worked and All the information I need is in here!

Just one problem!
![screenshot_22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2800945/4873405/ee02075a-6210-11e4-9b15-1f16883a94a9.png)

Its in KOREAN! :'(

That isn't what I need help with though. When i try to export the table it seems to mess up the korean characters... I don't know if this is a problem with your program or with Excel... do you have any idea on how to fix this?
![screenshot_94](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2800945/4873407/247bacc8-6211-11e4-97f7-61106c060eda.png)
 Wordpad didn't work... they looked the same in excel... but it worked when I opened it in Notepad++... and if I copy the korean characters and paste them into excel then it works xD
So no I need to figure out how to bring back the table xD
 ![screenshot_11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2800945/4946334/f3cdeaf4-6612-11e4-9c9c-3fb1e2a1ad8a.png)

I tried that and it messes up the columns.... no clue why :(
 Well is it possible to make it so that the columns and its associated data is seperated by | pipes when its exported?

commas are kind of iffy because in the description field it could have commas in it thus throw off the layout... i dont think that is the case here but meh lol.
 Wow lol... Can't believe I missed that xD
 Well that still didnt work. https://www.dropbox.com/s/zbaj7u3vlkw3h6n/compact_decrypt.sqlite3?dl=0

There is the decrypted SQlite file... If you can figure it out I will worship you for months!
lol
 Well Justin I am true to my word. Every morning I will praise your name xD and ill mention MKleusberg every now and then since he fixed it :)

That Calc program looks like it formats better than excel.... however whenever i try to open the item table CSV file  the program freezes up. What is and how did you get/view that ODS file??? because that looks easier to view than using excel table.
 I downloaded LibreOffice but I just don't know where you got that ODS file from lol.
 Yep.... and look what i found XD
![screenshot_10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2800945/4961043/29e0bb8c-66ca-11e4-99db-246ba35fb048.png)

Now i dont need to worry about translating rofl
 Any chance you can give me the localized text table with the fix implemented please.
 Its not a bug lol.... trust me. When excel was trying to do anything with the file it took 5-10 minutes to load.... sort... save... ROFL
 Whoops... missing the column headers... Ill get that though lol... that took forever as well xD

Thanks again :)
 Any chance on getting this fixed problem in a quick release??? Lol... maybe version 3.4.1 xD

Id rather not keep bothering you to convert it for me lol.
 Thanks!!!
  I am trying to open this sqlite3 file but your program says invalid file format.
 Im going to upload it to dropbox and send you the link. I don't know how to use this client your talking about and Id actually prefer to use your program lol... command line programs are usually to difficult for me lol. I prefer GUI xD

 Yes the file is from the game archeage. I'm trying to file all the game data so that I can help contribute to the archeage Gamepedia wiki. I prefer using the game files because when they update the game I can use beyond compare to see exactly what changed.  This is the hardest game yet lol...  I managed to find the data files for Farmville... Runes of Magic...  And Atlantic's online...  But this one is killing me xD

I wish I could speak Russian lol... Kudos for finding that.  I will have to give it a shot. There are thousands of files and that DB file is my only hope...  I can't find anything anywhere else...  Why can't they put it in a nice... Organized....  XML file xD
 IT WORKED :D
 Only thing is that it doesnt have the data im looking for :'(
 NVM YES IT DOES... I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING YET XD

I might need a translator @_@
 Well at first I thought it would work... until i started seeing garbled names and descriptions xD
Misery of sword Adventure.... was a messed up item name..
You can install your own home was completed. 
Installation position: inside floor and yard 
If you want to demolish the building while installing the items that the item is destroyed.You can eoneul over large furniture.
Messed up description lol... its just going to be hard to figure out. I hate that games can change it to be the correct translation in English but google translate cant.
 Its probably all in the en_us locale file
  Every time I start the app, I get a new version available even though I've clicked "Don't show again"
I'm on version 3.3.1
  This is a feature request to allow Insert/Update/Delete user interface capability for Views on Browse Data tab.

Views are normally read-only in SQLite, however, SQLite supports using triggers on Views, which handle the write operations attempted against the View. When this is the case, the absence of a user interface for editing the view means you have to write SQL code to do so.

To avoid confusion, you might consider interrogating existing triggers for an "...INSTEAD OF [INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE] on <Viewname>..." trigger to determine what user interface options to expose. But if this is too complex, it might just be better to expose the options and return the result from the database engine, whether that's an error (because the view is read-only and doesn't have a trigger for the action) or otherwise. Of course this may conflict with your easy-to-use design philosophy (some users might dislike having the user interface indicate that edits are possible when they are not), in which case I guess the enhancement should be rejected.
 It is been two Years, can we reopen this issue? 

Consider this database: 

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE Foo (a, b, c);
INSERT INTO `Foo` (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3);
CREATE TRIGGER update_bar
INSTEAD OF UPDATE OF a ON Bar
BEGIN
  UPDATE Foo SET a = NEW.a
  WHERE b=NEW.b;
END;
CREATE VIEW Bar AS SELECT a, b FROM Foo ORDER BY b;
COMMIT;
```

With `sqlite3` It is legit to write: 

```
UPDATE Bar SET a = 23 WHERE b = 2;
```

However, it is not possible to do it so on a View on `DB Browser for SQLite`. 

It would be a huge plus for me.  What amount of work this feature would represent? What are the concerned files? If I wanna build DB Browser for SQLite on Windows is there a VS project? It's tough, but well documented ^^ Great!   Wooh that's nice. I should give a try  Hi,

I've been using your SQLite Browser software for about some months and just updated to your new program version. Generally I enjoy your software a lot, but recently I've been a bit disappointed about editing options for views:

Your new program version shows the CREATE VIEW SQL on "Database Structure" tab, but doesn't allow to copy or edit it like in your previous versions. I just wanted to copy the SQL I've recently used for creating a view to my clipboard or something like that.

I would suggest you to implement a context menu option "CREATE TO" (similar to SQL Server) that creates a SQL file with CREATE VIEW SQL. Alternatively you could add options "Copy CREATE VIEW to Clipboard" or "Copy CREATE VIEW to new Query Tab".

Kind regards

Marco Tröster
 I feel a bit like an idiot for not trying Ctrl+C before seeing your post. I think it will do what I need but I'd still like to second the request for a clear way to edit the create statement.

Thanks,

Greg
 Hello everybody,

I really appreciate your efforts.

I would really like to test your product, but unfortunately I cannot compile the sources myself. I've just installed Qt Creator, but when starting the IDE, it crashes.

Could you please compile your sources for me? (I am using Windows 7 OS)

Thanks in advance.

Marco Tröster
 Thumbs up for the one who committed the code. Thank you very much :D 
  some items are very long, such as "Schema" in "Database Structure" tab, items in "Browse Data" tab.
 :smiley: yes, it's better now with 3.4.0. Thanks. But maybe "tooltip" can make it much more better?
 Here is what I mean for "Database Structure" tab. Just change `role == Qt::DisplayRole` to `role == Qt::DisplayRole || role == Qt::ToolTipRole`. That's the tooltip I mean. Sorry for my bad English. :smiley: 

``` cpp
QVariant DbStructureModel::data(const QModelIndex& index, int role) const
{
    if(!index.isValid())
    return QVariant();
    // Get the item the index points at
    QTreeWidgetItem* item = static_cast<QTreeWidgetItem*>(index.internalPointer());
    // Depending on the role either return the text or the icon
    if(role == Qt::DisplayRole)
        return PreferencesDialog::getSettingsValue("db", "hideschemalinebreaks").toBool() ? item->text(index.column()).replace("\n", " ") : item->text(index.column());
    else if(role == Qt::DecorationRole)
        return item->icon(index.column());
    else
        return QVariant();
}
```
 That's what I need. Thanks a lot!! :+1: 
     Hm, i am built once and make out with "no target" error. Now, at second attempt, make working without problems. Sorry, my fall.

About build-essentials and g++ - my fall too. Simply package is calling build-essential (without s) (http://packages.ubuntu.com/en/trusty/build-essential) and depends on g++.
 I think this dumb 'request' is unnecessary anymore. My fall, sorry for disturb.
  Trivial patch: Application icons should be installed inside the `hicolor/<size>/apps` folder, see [1].

  I want to export a reference table from a development environment and import it into the production database.

When I export a TEXT field that contains a string that can be interpreted as a number it is exported without quotation marks. Unfortunately that means that leading '0' characters are lost when I execute the resulting SQL to import it again. The string is changed. 

Example of an exported table below. Note: the sensor_id column is TEXT and the value in the first row is '0000000000000001', but during the export the quotation marks are lost and during a subsequent import (executing the SQL) the value changes to '1', which is a very different string. The second row works fine, since it has the string '28C078480500001B' properly within quotation marks.
CREATE TABLE "sensor_descr" (
        `sensor_id`     TEXT,
        `sensor_descr`  TEXT,
        `sensor_nick`   TEXT

This problem occurs both in version 3.0.2 that is available in the OpenSuse repository and in the latest source downloaded and compiled from scratch just now (23rd Oct 2014). 
 Thanks a lot for looking into this so quickly. That's a good motivation to keep putting effort into meaningful bug reports. Thanks for a great little tool! 
    While editing a table definition, I set a default value and later I wanted to stop using that default value and deleted the content of it, but there's no way to "clear" the default flag, it continues using the DEFAULT clause with empty string as default value. I understand that under determined conditions you could need a empty string value as default, but what if you want to remove that default value?

I see two solutions:
- a new flag column should be added to determine if the user wants to use the default value (and activate it automatically if a default value is added, and stop using the default flag when it's unchecked
- add a context menu so you can revert the default value to undefined via right click over the field

Any other solution is welcome, of course :) I am just brainstorming a little

Workaround: remove the field and add it again (it's not much info to remember, but it's a little bothering if you have data on the table :)
 I think this issue can be flagged as enhancement
 Sure, will try along the weekend
Cheers

 Works fine for me, I am closing the issue!
  Hi there,

I am importing a CSV with text fields, and the space between the text isn't importing. It appears to be removing all the spaces?

Is there a solution for this?

Thanks!!!
scott
 Hi there, thanks for getting back to me so quickly, and I would happy to try the nightly build. I downloaded the "sqlitebrowser.exe.xz" and was confused when I saw the "...exe.xz" file extension?
 I ran my database through the nightly build, and spacing is now working correctly! Hooray!!!
  It's simply too small to read - but I can copy the text and view it in the Mac clipboard.

 No, it doesn't. Increasing the editor font size works, though.

 Tried the nightly build - no effect. Noticed that the Log Font Size setting applies to a different part of the window - see snapshot.

 Now that was a speedy fix. Thank you!
  While filling a table with records I pasted a large number of INSERT statements (about 1,000) into the "Execute SQL" tab. On executing these sqlitebrowser crashed repeatedly. 
Doing the same with a smaller number of INSERTs (about 200) was successful.
sqlitebrowser 3.3.1, Mac OS 10.9.5.
 It took about one to two seconds.
 Tried the nightly build with 1783 INSERTs - worked like a charm.
  While modifying a table it is possible to add fields. These get names like Field7, Field8 and so on. Within the browser these fields can be given meaningful names, but these names never make it into the database - after "Write Changes" the generic names reappear.
sqlitebrowser 3.3.1, Mac OS 10.9.5.
 Tried the nightly build - same problem, but I get an error message (see snapshot).

 This issue is resolved in the sqlitebrowser_201410151310 build - thank you!
  It would be great to a get a form view in the way of Bento or Glom. It would be more attractive and more convenient to enter datas.

i'd like 😞

> Thinking it would be easier to begin progressing this with some concept diagrams / screenshot-type-things. Helps work out features, clarify / prioritise things, and so on. :wink:

But i can try to make screenshots with explanations. That will be easier for me.
 Hi

I come back to you with a long time later after the request. I am very sorry, I have been busy and forgot to look after this.

So, to remind the request was to create a simple form view for SQLite browser.

I spoke a bout Glom (Gnome) and Bento (Mac OS X).

They are working almost the same way, but with a simpler way for Bento with a little more graphic features, so I made screenshots of it with Skitch that let me comment them.
Bento has been discontinued, and Mac users are angry about this FileMaker decision, it was also an SQLite based database set, so a Bento database could maybe even imported in SQLite browser.
It could so fill the need, and also give a mire powerful free product available as a multi-plateforme On Linux, Mac and Windows. Glom for Windows is outdated, the Mac version needs to compiled with Mac Ports, it is unstable and not easy at all …
SQLite browser comes there has a better simple product and powerful anyway. It has a nice GUI, and it is very stable and easy to use or to install. So it could be the way to make everybody happy.

The idea is to have a simple view form to manage the datas and having a GUI which is simple and pleasant to enter the datas for the end user.
It should be possible to organize easily the way the fields are displayed and which ones could be visible.
It should be able to manage multiple forms.
It shouldn't let you manage complex features.

you can contact me for questions.

There are available as a download in here, the link will remain available for 15 days from now.

 yes it took me some time, but because I think this little piece of software is good enough to fill the gap.

but I am also aware that'll be a lot of work for the dev(s) behind… and unfortunately, I am unable to help at this level 😞 
but I only based my view with a discontinued software. Glom for Gnome is interesting too, but it's less handy, but it has for it that it can manage SQLite databases, but PostgreSQL or MySQL databases as well.
I tried LibreOffice/OOo but the form designer is buggy and not convenient at all to be used.

I think the most important functions in this is a form designer/view before the design.

 This database can be a good example as well for a data form GUI.

PS. Apologies for originally posting this in a deprecated branch, first time using github, didn't realise I was posting in the wrong place.
 Hi Justin, thanks for replying. I'm using the following

SQLite 3.8.4.3
Windows Server 2012 R2
SQLiteBrowser 3.3.1-win32 - although I downloaded the executable to fix the CSV issue that you posted on this thread..
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/94
(http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.exe.xz)

I wouldn't mind having a look myself but I know nothing about Linux. Are there virtual machines available with the appropriate dev environment?

Thanks for the info on daily builds Justin, finding my way around at the moment :)

Steve
 Hi, no sorry it doesn't fix the issue. Ignore what I said originally though. After looking at it again I think  it's actually just the second issue I mentioned, all other faults updating the table seem to stem from that.

When opening a table sqlitebrowser adds single quotes to default values: adding a second pair of single quotes if they exist already. I don't know how things work under the hood yet but if sql is being executed it's failing because of the extra single quotes ( eg. DEFAULT ''any data''), giving a binary data error.

Removing the default value or it's original quotes _fixes_ the sql generated so the table can be updated.

Should I delete the misleading info from the OP? 
 Hi, yep, I can do that :)
 Hi, the latest build fixes this issue. However a new problem has been introduced. If you delete a default value then the SQL generated still includes the _DEFAULT_ keyword and an empty value, for columns that have had default values removed. 

CREATE TABLE `TestTable` (
    `No`    TEXT,
    `Nationality`   TEXT DEFAULT '',
    `Position`  TEXT,
    `Firstname` TEXT DEFAULT '',
    `Surname`   TEXT,
    `Loan`  TEXT,
    `asde`  INTEGER DEFAULT ''
);.

In the textbox that had the default value removed, empty single quotes are inserted by the app.

---

On writing the changes and opening the table for modification again, not all the default values have been persisted...

CREATE TABLE `TestTable` (
    `No`    TEXT,
    `Nationality`   TEXT DEFAULT '',
    `Position`  TEXT,
    _`Firstname`    TEXT, missing default_
    `Surname`   TEXT,
    `Loan`  TEXT,
    `asde`  INTEGER DEFAULT ''
);

As you can see, _Firstname_ is missing the app generated default.
 Sure, I'm more than happy to check out new builds :)
 Apologies, I will have a look tomorrow :)
  The issue I faced is that the cursor, '|' is shifted backwards to the position it actually is. Sometimes it is not between characters, but on top of a character. In the end of a string it lags a character behind.

E.g. I see
JO|IN
then I press 'Backspace' and get
J|ON

I run SQLite Database Browser on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
 Hi,

This is how it looks
![one](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4622272/380d4cb0-5339-11e4-991d-c97a16cc31e9.png)

Now I press backspace and get:
![two](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4622279/483704aa-5339-11e4-98c2-4d993defecac.png)

Once more backspace:
![three](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/406299/4622283/55916244-5339-11e4-924b-01f03d6c937f.png)
 I think  I used apt-get. OK. I'll try.
 After manually installing it, I see no problems now. 
Seemingly that 'ancient' version is hanging with the apt-get.
  I have an sqlite database that I created from c# (using the System.Data.SQLite library) and I have created a table using a custom collation function.

When I try to open the database in this program, the table with the custom collation does not work. I can't view the data, and I can't even run any queries on it, not even those queries that don't involve any comparisons, such as "select \* from testtable". I realize that the custom collation function cannot possibly be known by your software, but is it possible to have some kind of fallback?

I have a sample database, should you need me to send it to you.
 3.3.1, the current version present for download on your website for windows.
 Sorry for the delay. Was on vacation, didn't have internet access.

The build you sent me did open the database and allowed me to browse the table after a warning. Thanks
  The discussion on this reminded me of Python, so I have read https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html and they refer to the same RFC4180 from IETF, so that's a good start. However they have an Excel dialect, so clearly acknowledge that you have to do stuff differently with Excel. This might be a useful reference when investigating this issue.
 Yes, so my guess is you would have an initial choice of "Standard CSV", "MS Excel Compatible", "Custom", where the custom option allows you to change delimiter, row terminator, etc for those that need it and the first two are easy for most people.

Oh and last I looked when numbers get over 15 digits Excel truncates, so you might need to handle that twist!

Sorry if it seems like I am being a pain but I have had pain in the past so just sharing my experience to hopefully benefit all. For me Python is a good place to look as it is cross platform and well established.
 Guys, it’s your call but I think keeping things simple and not overdoing it would be a wise strategy.
- ```
       First and foremost the goal should be producing the same default result as sqlite3 does – that is the reference most people would expect
  ```
- ```
       I did not experience Excel breaking the standard CSV, the only problem I ever encountered is that Excel does not auto-detect 64 bit Integers correctly, it treats them as Double. For these cases you can do a custom import in Excel.
  ```
- ```
       The 15 digits truncation may only happen with manually created content – if you export a double and read it back in that problem does not exist.
  ```
- ```
       The double quote character is defined as “, so you don’t really need to have a selection box for it if you elect to make them optional (means only use them when necessary for the field content)
  ```
- ```
       Same goes for line ending. Just stick to CRLF.
  ```

Thanks

Jens

nightly build OSX of 4 October
 Precisely, more logical would be "1 - 1 of 1" in my not so humble opinion and the '<' & '>' don't make much sense either in this specific case, do they?
 Good job, MKleusberg. Solved in nightly build of 7 October.
  The svg icon didn't work for me in KDE so I chose to use the png icon. Tested and works.
  What's up with the version #999 ? An alpha or beta special for the *ubuntu platforms?
   Yes, Justin, 

We can even build a DataDictionary like e.g. Oracle has: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/server.920/a96524/c05dicti.htm
 Great idea, enough to type s for 'select', 'u' for update, 'd' for delete, 'i' for insert etc.
  Quisiera saber si su software posee compatibilidad con SQLite 2.x, puesto que es el mas usado por mi grupo de trabajo para realizar web development.
 Yes, I tried, but the program crash.
 No se puede exportar el archivo que genera el SQLite Browser?
 I think the best option is to convert databases of release 2 to SQLite3 format. I don't know if therefore are applications. I never had such an old file.
 You're right, Justin. They might have reasons not to change. 
 Hola, perdón por la intromisión.
quien no use funciones de bajo nivel no debería tener grandes problemas al portar de 2.x a 3.x, creo que alrededor de un 80% de las consultas SQL son compatibles.
De los datos es una simple labor de importación y exportación.

...y gracias a los desarrolladores por este excelente soft.
  Hola, el problema es el siguiente, es que cuando muestras el esquema de una tabla dentro del TreeView  su tamaño cambia considerablemente dañandole el aspecto a tu programa.
 Aca te dejo la captura de pantalla.
![sin titulo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8442497/4465018/266e6504-48d8-11e4-9ec0-c88e6dbd6152.png)

Lo que yo te recomiendo es que el esquema de la tabla te lo muestre en un messagebox o un form para no estropear la interfaz del programa. 
 No, pero en el DB Schema me sirve para saber los elementos de la tabla. Lo que yo digo es en el data structure
 Me refiero a este area
![sin titulo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8442497/4465624/19134208-48dd-11e4-8e13-e037654d87a9.png)
 Thanks and looking forward to your update.
  In previous builds the application always started in the directory named in preferences. Since today (perhaps before, did not install between 19 and 27, sep 18 was ok) starts in the directory I was some time ago - iTunes...
 Now all versions from 7 September and later do the same. Even after closing iTunes. Bug? I expect B4S would go to the directory in prefs regardless of where you were. It always did. Solution is to choose again the default directory. 
 Work-around yes, definite solution no. Perhaps a 10.6 thingy :-? Anyways no big deal if one has time.
 I never had this problem again and update regularly. If Kleusberg is right this may be not a 10.6 thing only, but more a general occasionally occurring bug in the application?
  Software works very fine with <1GB files, but I have one sqlite, which is 8.6GB and can't open. The question is: is there any limit of sqlite file size? Do you have experience with large files?
 http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html
 I have a bunch of data-sets each larger than 1G plus a big one (50G). I tried SQLite Expert and it opens them and scans the data very quickly. So there should be no limit on this I think.
 I run SQLite Version 3.8.10.2 (Qt Version 5.4.1) on windows

I confirm that the software is very slow for files above 200 Mo and crashes when the file exceeds 1 GB.

It would be great if files that do more than 1GB where supported, but at least sqlite should warn the user at start that opening files of more than 1 GB can crash the software.
 I use the 32 bit version actually but it is the latest one 3.7.0.
 And by the way in the SQL shell it would be great to have the number of affeted row when you do an update request, Some thing like:

Query executed successfully: UPDATE table SET field = 's' WHERE field2 = 1 
(took 81ms, 5 rows affected)
 So i'll deal with it but thank you for the answers.
  I just tried a recently nightly and I get a horizontal scroll bar and a hint, so looks good to me and correctly closed.
  Non-English (i.e. French) items may contain single quotes and thus require these quotes doubled for sqlite. 
It will be useful if sqlitebrowser allowed to search for double quotes, or for that matter any sequence of characters, in a filter. Wild cards may be a solution.
  Hi all,

In looking through the README, I noticed there's no mention of Linux. Can sqlitebrowser run on Linux? Are there instructions for compiling it? Do any distributions ship it?

Could this information be added to the README (and perhaps other docs too)? Thanks!
  My table: 
CREATE TABLE `test` (
    `ID`    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `Name`  TEXT NOT NULL,
    `ID2`   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(ID,ID2)
);

It is not possible to insert a record in Browse Date because there is a primary key with two fields and twice are NOT NULL 
  In my opinion it is not possible to create a table with foreign keys in the edit create table dialog. If I create the table with SQL and then I make a modification with the edit create dialog the foreign keys will be delete.
 Sorry, same like #81
  I would like to have a Date field, but it's not possible, as the types are limited to these on the combobox

Need custom types, please!!
 SQLite does not need a field with date affinity. It's either edited and text like e.g.  '2014-09-20' or numeric (int if you prefer) 20140920. or even epoch. 

All about it is in http://sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html

Perhaps the developers of this awesome browser are willing if they have time to introduce some helping hand for you, but there are more issues with a certain form of priority. 
 I know how data types work in SQLite, the thing is that my database engine uses the field type to know how to treat/convert types to native data

Allowing you to write the field type instead of provide a non editable combobox with fixed values is not a big change at all

Priorities are relative to the importance of the problem to each one, and for me this has a certain form of priority. I also know that I have different workarounds to address this, but aren't straightforward at all
 It's curious because on version 2, the product had a [...] button to add custom types! so seems that this feature was dropped somewhere :)

About adding it myself, I feel a little lost with the used tools, I already downloaded the code and QTCreator, but couldn't make it compile, need to investigate a little. I have two long holiday weeks ahead, so I will consider it if I can fight against this laziness :D
 That's really well appreciated by me, thanks a lot!
 I am not at home, coming back con Tuesday. I will validate it on the latest
night build as soon as I am back and let you know

Thank you for the effort!

 Hi! I just tried this feature today with latest night build and seems to work fine, but I just noticed that field is being updated any time I modify the field type name. Wouldn't be better to update the field type on exiting the combobox, just to avoid unnecessary updates? I don't know how heavy is to perform that operation, but when I wanted to change a field to "date", the "updating" window appeared like five or six times

Anyway, it's working so it's a good improvement, thanks!
 I will try it along the weekend :)

Thanks!
 I tried it and seems to work only if you press "enter". Would be nice if it's fired when the control loses its focus, like default value. It's more comfortable and keeps the workflow consistent

Anyway, thanks for the effort :D
  It appears that the table export to CSV builds the export file content first in RAM before writing it to the specified file. If the table is very large the process is hitting the 2GB RAM limit of Windows 32bit applications. Then it crashes. No file gets written at all.
 Where do I find the nightly builds?
 Ok, I did run the test and the crash is resolved. Monitored the memory usage in task manager all looks good.

However, I see now a different problem: All fields regardless of actual column type are exported as text, means in “quotes”. That could cause trouble when reimporting the generated file in other tools, e.g. Excel but also increases file size substantially. In my case the same export run with sqlite3.exe produces a 341MB csv file while using sqlitebrowser produces 420MB. Other than that the content appears identical.

Example:

Sqlite3:
1,0,10.1349167,48.0175202,2.758584499,-0.0005592033267,10.1414681,48.01049,2.500045538,0.0,924.6688232,0.0005592033267,1,9,0
1,1,10.1414681,48.01049,2.5000453,0.0,10.1471049,48.0047975,2.675153971,0.0004602147965,760.9866943,0.0004602147965,1,9,0

Sqlitebrowser:
"1","0","10.1349167","48.0175202","2.758584499","-0.0005592033267","10.1414681","48.01049","2.500045538","0.0","924.6688232","0.0005592033267","1","9","0"

Thanks

Jens
 Yes, that works for my specific case because all fields are numbers. If I remember the CSV spec correctly, the quote character should only be used for fields which contain the separator character, so that the column structure is kept intact. I also just noticed that the line ending of the produced files are Unix style – only \n. Should be platform default.

Thanks

Jens
 I think the document should be right, but I am not 100% sure.
1. Double quotes issue:

The spec says double quotes are optional as long as no special chars are in the field. So the current version is strictly correct, yet it creates trouble with Excel (it prevents automatic field type detection). Since Excel is a widely used tool AND avoiding unnecessary double quotes creates smaller files I would recommend removing them.
1.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
      some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
      at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
      double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:
   
      "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
      zzz,yyy,xxx
2.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
      should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:
   
      "aaa","b CRLF
      bb","ccc" CRLF
      zzz,yyy,xxx
3.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
      appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
      another double quote.  For example:

1. CRLF issue:
   The spec says all files should be CRLF – means Windows style. There is no ambiguity here. That should be an easy fix.

Thanks

   On the Browse Data tab: It would really enhance keyboard navigation to have either (or) both the 'enter' and 'tab' keys move input focus to the next filter field. Currently 'tab' moves to the next data cell and 'enter' does nothing.
 Absolutely. I looked for a build last night but I was still a little early
(still @ 017715510f8e559c0c9f0dc25da33a8cabdf50b8). I'll try it now.
 @justinclift Just downloaded the sqlitebrowser.exe.xz from the oldsch00l link you provided, renamed it sqlitebrowser.exe (assumed that's the thing to do) and tried to run it. Produced following 
![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4123228/4604315/6640d33e-5192-11e4-950d-d4c84d636a86.png)
I'm running Windows 7, 64bit.
 And I'm still early. Build log indicates its still 0177155. I'll wait till tomorrow.
 The file sqlitebrowser.exe.xz is actually an archive file, so you need to extract the exe from the archive before running. I suggest something like 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/) for doing the extract. I just tried this and it worked fine for me.
 I didn't recognize the suffix and somehow my brain went to it being an
obfuscation to fool virus scanners.
Bottom line, tabbing between filter field works as I'd expect. Enter still
does nothing, not sure if that's important.
Thank you for making these kinds of improvements, it makes the tool awesome.
 I could go either way. The filter gets applied on each character keypress so it's not like <enter> is required to start the filter. Plus back tabbing is supported with shift + Tab whereas using Enter to move between fields would imply Shift + Enter for moving backward and that does not seem idomatic.
I guess I lean toward leaving Enter unmapped.
  Is it possible to make a toggle so that I can use the refresh button and still keep the filters I've entered?
 That appears to have fixed it, thank you!
  Export Database or Table to SQL or CSV - allow a user to export the schema only
Suggest adding a check box to the existing Export dialog.
Check box label:  "Export schema only"
Default check box condition: Unchecked
  Warnings are called liked that, because they are mostly harmless. In this case those parameters are probably placeholders for future features. The developer(s) will know if I'm right.
  If github allows it you may change the name of the entire project to e.g. Browser4SQLite or extremely short B4S (1337 [leet] lingo: 845 ;-D)
  Will it be possible to access more than one file in a session?

I tried an 'attach', but B4S (Browser for SQLite) seems not to support it. Perhaps in a future version?
Standard one can attach nine more databases and even 124 with runtime-options.

Ref: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html#max_attached

I get
 cannot ATTACH database within transaction: attach 'file:../db/main.sqlite:mode-ro' as dd;
I wrote 
attach 'file:../db/main.sqlite?mode=ro' as dd;
 Cool! Thanks, I'll try it out as soon as I have time enough. Would br milestone enhancement, right?
  Where can I find the so-called 'nightly build' for OSX?
 Please do, perhaps more users/developers of OSX 10.6+ (5 even?) are interested. I believe you have my e-mail address so a zip, tar.gz or whatever of your newest product is appreciated. What about a s 'Browser4SQLite maillist' with attach capabilities?
 It seems to work. Would be cool if we soon have the same advantages as Windows people :) The more testers the merrier. BTW I would not mind a compressed and complete (eventually including sources) version
 a tarball or zip with source (eventually), object (or dmg), docs. Don't hurry, only dmg is well enough for now
 Excellent, Justin! Thank you very much indeed. A happy Snow Leopard (10.6.8) user.
  ``` sql
create table foo(id integer primary key, value text);
insert into foo(value) values('foo');

I run this sql, but sqlbrowser crashed.

 Thanks! Solved this issue.
  Import table from a CSV file does not handle linebreaks in a field: If a field in the csv file contains a linebreak, the import function handles it as the start of a new record. A solution might be to take the number of fields per record into account as well.

I noticed this while importing a csv file from a third party.

ps. I find the "Import table from a CSV file" function brilliant anyways!
 Hi Justin,

Thanks for mentioning this #84, I saw the same thing (spaces being removed) and I thought it had something to do with me Find-And-Replacing linebreaks.

Thinking of #84: it is removing all empty spaces where LEADING and TRAILING spaces is probably meant (and the latter is very usefull!).

Anyways, thanks a lot for this wonderful tool, I find myself using it a lot lately while making my (free!) apps.

Cheers,

I agree, however according to the standard _no_ (i.e.0, the digit) spaces at all should be removed. To be absolutely sure all text fields should be quoted either by ' or "

One time I noticed a CSV-file I copied and changed all commas by |, but there was a field with an unexoected | inside [luckily just exactly one record :-)] in order to create a SQLite-database.  
 Event better! trimming fields might not be the standard but I noticed many fields in my 3rd party csv file with lots of white spaces in them, so it’s very useful.
 Hi Justin,

I  tried the build below and I had some problems with it: I received a message: “Error importing data. Message from database engine: table table1 has 39 columns but 40 values were supplied”. I would like to see the record number in this message so I am able to correct the csv file. I received this message with the original CSV file formatted like this: “field1”,”field2”,”field3”, “etc…”.

I also have a version of this csv file which I have changed to a pipe separated file (field1|field2|field3|etc…) and I didn’t receive the error on this file, but I noticed the import is now very slow. I have a very large (third party) csv file, 104000 records. I started import, went away and came back after half an hour and the import was only at 52%. The previous version took only 2 or 3 minutes. Performance might not be an issue for smaller files (which would normally be the case).

I know CSV files are often unreliable, I have bumped into these same issues when writing my own import tools. For me the previous version (without the remove all spaces bug) was more workable than this version. In the previous version the import went pretty fast and succeeded. Afterwards I was able to see where the import jumped columns and I could manually remove the linebreaks in Excel.

Cheers,

Niels.
 Hi Rene, the “Decoding CSV file..” is very slow. I have just tested (the decoding part) again, with my csv file 104000 records:
- Version 3.3.1 = fast meaning approx. 20 seconds for 104000 records
- Version master_git = slow meaning at 20% after 5 minutes

I have created a test.csv file, with only 10 records and a header (I cant attach the full file, it is 100mb…), just copy the records until you have 50.000 or 100.000 records .

I can’t send you the original file either because it is not my data, but the result is the same with this test file.

Kind regards,

Niels.
 Hi, the hail0-2002.csv works fine with me too. I guess it’s the csv file I am trying to import causing the problems: Below I copied 10 (identical) records including the header. As you can see there is a lot more data per record than in the hail-2002.csv. You can copy these records to a csv file and duplicate the records using Excel, (or any other tool). This is the modified version of the csv file (pipe separated), which imports without errors in the 3.3.1 version.

Kind regards,

Niels.
 Weird, memory is around 60% (sqlitebrowser using  400MB), CPU is around 25% and I see the Not Responding status every now and then in the task manager. I will be able to test it on another PC next week.
 Hi Justin,

I just imported my CSV file and it looks good. I see the whitepaces are fixed and I don't see any linebreak issues. It is still a bit slow on my tablet (Ativ 700T smartpc pro). I will give it another go tomorrow on my other laptop and maybe on my mac as well with the full CSV file, I will let you know the result.

Kind regards,

Niels.
  Just like on APPLE
 I hope that makes it easy to set up a port on fbsd (no other patch necessary).
For this it would be nice to have a release including this patch ;-)
 Cool. So far the application runs ok on 10.6.8 as well. When will 3.4 be released?
  A query with an expression on the limit clause is not shown, for example

select \* from subjects order by subject limit 2*2

does not appears in the results panel. However the status message correctly reads 
"4 Rows returned from: select \* from subjects order by subject limit 2*2 (took 1ms)"
 Thanks a lot
  Hi all,

I did a french translation. Where I can share the file ?
Thanks.
 I'll try it...
 Hi Rene,

I don't know how to do this... Sorry, I'm a github newbie.

You'll find the file attached here.

I hope the beta version will help some french users

 I Justin,

No problem. Please, send me the file.
 Hi Justin,

You will find the translated file with this mail.
I made a review of the file : sqlb_fr.ts (XML file)

Please, take care... The file is coded with UTF-8. All entities are coded with
this option.
I mean, for example :
l&apos;ouverture
will be, in the file
l'ouverture
The html source data (line 28) has his entites encoded*
style=&quot; font-size:small; text-decoration: underline;
color:#0000ff;&quot;&gt;
will be :
style=" font-size:small; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">

I got the file from github (sqlitebrowser-master/src/translation

have a good day overseas ;)

  The input field in a Execute SQL tab with white on dark KDE theme becomes unusable because of it shows white text on white background.
Can you make this field follow system theme?

opening new issue since i can't reopen this oen
  I had version 3.3.0 installed and working well (except the 'without rowid' issue) with 3.8.6, but changed to 3.3.1 update and reports it's working with 3.7.12. FWIW: I have OSX 10.8.6 
 Isn't it possible to check if SQLite is in the user's $PATH to autodramatically disable your embedded version so we don't see your mistakes anymore in the future updates? I thought that was happening in 3.3.0, but now it seems that for some reason you downgraded creating the new version. Anyways good job and bugs happen. 
 Murphy's law of developing: to repair a bug takes always much longer than their appearance  
 Thank you very much indeed, Justin. I saved the local .app after renaming
it so I can test future queries against >=3.8.2-db's. Hope the team solves
the 'wo-rowid'-issue soon as well. BTW: you could avoid above bug by
recognizing the 'C' in the Deming-circle

  1. CREATE TABLE t(x INTEGER, y, z, PRIMARY KEY(x ASC));
2. insert some records
3. try to browse => no data shows up
 I am also seeing this problem on version 3.4.0 in Windows 8.1 x64. We have a few tables with INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT and only some of the tables show up in the Browse Data table dropdown. Here's an example of a table that does not show up:

```
CREATE TABLE "SortOptions" (
    "Id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "Name" TEXT,
    "SortField" TEXT,
    "SortDirection" TEXT
);
```

If you'd like a full sample database I can email you one.
 My apologies, false alarm. It was actually user error. 
  I get the following error No such function: REGEXP
When I'm attempting the a regexp is this a configuration on my side or just a feature of sqlite3 not currently supported in this app?
 Looking into it a little further the sqlite support for REGEXP looks to be a little different then what I expected.
http://www.ashleyit.com/blogs/brentashley/2013/11/27/using-regular-expressions-with-sqlite/
I've found GLOB which is fully supported able to get the same job done.

Thanks for the quick responses
Evan
 Yep please close

  Would love to be able to open the app from the command line and pass a path to an existing sqlite database. Does this feature exist?
 Guess I just needed to give it a try! I was thinking there might be a special way to pass a db. The following worked for me

```
open /Applications/sqlitebrowser.app my.db
```
  Hi! When I import a csv-file into a table every single space was deleted (v 3.3.0). Special characters are not displayed correctly even though in v 2.0 it worked fine. What happened? Is it my fault? Can I make any settings to avoid at least the space-deleting? Thanks a lot for your help!
 In fact there is: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180

As is written there spaces should not be ignored and use of double quotes
depends on system/application; M$ExCel goes it's own way...

  First commit fixes the test file failing to compile (cannot assign `QPair<Table,bool>` to `Table`).

Second commit updates the test for commit 55678bb9450a0546835b2d86f5124e7efb0a1109

There is still one failing test:

```
FAIL!  : TestTable::createTableWithNotLikeConstraint() 'tab.fields().at(0)->check() == "value NOT LIKE 'prefix%'"' returned FALSE. ()
Loc: [/builddir/build/BUILD/sqlitebrowser-3.3.0/src/tests/testsqlobjects.cpp(244)]

@justinclift
Do you have any idea how to approach this?
 Original code that created that is
```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE Search USING FTS3 (
	_id,
	name,
	location
);
```
you can probably find the same in the .sqlite file if you open it with a text editor/grep it.

@MKleusberg I would agree that it's acceptable to close this issue if those unrecognized/warned tables are read-only and will be written in the same way even if other recognized tables or data are modified.  Create a table with

```
CREATE TABLE "test"(rowid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
```

Attempting to open the corresponding sqlite file will result in 

```
line 1:47: unexpected token: rowid
```

and the program segfaulting:

```

  Hello folks,

After the excellent service on my last request, I have a couple more:
1. On the 'Database Structure' tab, could the schema be made to collapse along with the field list? As it is, the benefit of collapsing is rather lost when the schema is long and you can only see a few (or only one) tables on your window anyway.
2. On the results from running an SQL query, long fields (varchar and friends) should only be displayed up to some maximum length. Otherwise you have to do massive horizontal scrolling to see all your fields.
3. On SQL query results and table browsing, how about a right-click option to copy the value of the field into the copy buffer. At the moment you can accomplish this with browse data by double-clicking and copying from the 'Edit database cell' window, but you can't do it at all with query results.

Many thanks for your help. And let me know if it makes sense that I work on the code myself - I could do it, but would ultimately prefer to avoid one more learning curve!

Cheers, Jonathan
 > makes sense to remove newlines while collapsed.

Yes, that would be ideal.

It seems to work well with the browse table, and consistency is good.

Nothing. I didn't realise you could. :)

But a context menu would be nice to have. Besides copying, you could 
also filter on the content of the field, paste over the content, edit 
the field, and I'm sure others could think of more.
  rp: "makes sense to remove newlines while collapsed."
jschultz: 'Yes, that would be ideal.''

I would say the contrary. Thanks to <Cr><LF> we can see data that's hidden and replaced by ...

Indeed copy and paste to a local text editor helps. Would be nice if the developers replace some whitespace by 0x0d0a internally [of course not in the database file ;-)] to get the same effect.
  Hello,

Since version 3.2, sqlitebrowser reports an error on tables with the 'ASC' keyword in its primary key definition. For example, the a database consisting of the following table (created with sqlite3):

CREATE TABLE [Test]([Field] [int] NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT [Test_Constraint] PRIMARY KEY %28 [Field] ASC %29);

cannot be browsed or modified with sqlitebrowser. That is, browsing the table shows the correct number of records but no data in the records. Attempting to modify the table reveals that the entire table definition (apart from the table name) has been lost. Running sqlitebrowser from the command line returns:

line 1:98: expecting RPAREN, found 'ASC'
line 1:103: unexpected token: )
line 1:98: expecting RPAREN, found 'ASC'
line 1:103: unexpected token: )
line 1:98: expecting RPAREN, found 'ASC'
line 1:103: unexpected token: )

I hope that's enough info to help someone diagnose the problem.

Thanks!
 Ooops, that got properly messed up by the markdown processor. I'll try again:

CREATE TABLE Test ([Field] [int] NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT [Test_Constraint] PRIMARY KEY ([Field] ASC));
 Thanks for that. I know I'm weighing in with no idea of the background, but it does seem a bit of a problem if sqlitebrowser falls over on a legal sqlite3 database. Certainly the most common use I make of it is to take a quick look at sqlite databases that are created elsewhere. For the moment I have rolled back to version 2.0 which works fine.
 I second that! The name browser implies that I can open any DB and browse it. The fact the editor functionality restricts opening DBs suggest that maybe the app should be renamed? I mostly just want to see data and not even open the "Data Structure" tab.
As an analogy imagine an image viewer which cannot open JPEGs with EXIF data, because it can't save the EXIF block, however I want to see the pixels only don't go any further.

I'm not sure what an SQLite file looks like but it should be fully accessible through an SQLite driver. I started wondering why you have your own parser did you write a full engine?
 Fantastic! Thanks for the rapid response.
 Nope I use Linux :)

I already built sqlitebrowser with the patches and it seems fine to me so far.

The file causing it: http://temp.twisterrob.net/share/MagicHomeInventory.sqlite
The DB has no data in it, just the schema: tables, triggers, views.

Opening it with _android-sdk-windows\platform-tools\sqlite3.exe_ works, so I tried to narrow it down.

If I drop these:

``` sql
drop table Category_Name_Cache;
drop table Item_Path;
```

I tried dropping only the triggers of these tables, but it was still crashing. So I suspect there must be something in the `CREATE TABLE`s.
 Are you sure about that AUTOINCREMENT being the culprit?
The tables I dropped to make it not crash didn't have a PRIMARY KEY like that!

Note: I use `PRIMARY KEY(...)` format instead of `name type PRIMARY KEY` to be consistent among tables with singular/multiple keys. And because of this I don't know if I can put the AUTOINCREMENT anywhere else.

`ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO` should take care of those contstraints, I don't think it's a good idea to restrict. http://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html however renaming a table and updating `VIEW`s and `TRIGGER` bodies would be a nice feature if not already implemented.
 @justinclift
Sure I'll try tomorrow, when will it be available (with timezone)?

> Maybe n "Novice mode" option set in preferences, would let us keep stuff simple for novices.

That's not a good idea in general, lot of features will be used by a really small userbase (hard to discover), for example Visual Studio has a nicely hidden "Advanced UI" option in a non-intuitive place: http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC429789.jpg

I'd suggest an expander for advanced features if you decide to go ahead: http://qt-apps.org/content/show.php/ExpanderWidget?content=163843 novice users will see an "Advanced" header of the closed expand and think "Advanced features, beware", others will expand confidently and won't be scared.

@rp- I think if you enter #77 in the commit message github will link your commit to the issue. See https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages . It is always possible to reopen if you see fit.
 @justinclift it works as you expected.
I see all the schemas listed, however I can't edit (don't even want to, see my comment on #78) nearly any of them because it would remove all the foreign keys and constraints and cascades. See Category_Descendant in http://temp.twisterrob.net/share/MagicHomeInventory.sqlite
 That's really visible and nice ui, but my immediate question is: "what does it do? what is considered advanced? where is the advanced stuff?" That's why I suggest the expander: it's simple, it's in plain sight and in context.
Also: what happens if the editor window is open and you swap advanced mode. (I don't know if it's modal)... the same happens if you have advanced featurs on the main window/tabs, you'll have to rebuild the ui?
  Use both of them will crash in SQL log. 
The result of LIMIT a,b should be LIMIT b,a.
  It'd be a lot easier to write SQL if you could see the schema while you're in the Execute SQL tab. This could be achieved with another pane (like the Plot pane) that shows the current DB schema as a treeview.

Having to switch between the Database Structure and Execute SQL tabs is difficult because you have to constantly refer to this information while writing a SQL statement if you have more than a couple tables and fields.

Tables as root nodes, fields as leaf nodes including data type/primary key/foreign key information in the node text.
 That would work too. If you could undock the tabs you could have the db structure and SQL query visible at the same time. That would take care of the issue.
 Yes, thank you very much for adding it so quickly.
  I am not sure if this is already possible or I am overlooking something but I would like to add a unique constraint to a column and a foreign key constraint.
Currently I only see a way to add a NOT NULL constraint with the checkbox and a CHECK constraint with the input field.
Is this functionality still missing?
 Cool thank you I will test it tomorrow :)
 Ah I just see that this is a windows build but i only have linux, the changes are not pushed in the repo yet? I could not see a branch for it.
 Ah yes I see it now :D this works nice thank you, perhaps in future would be nice to allow composite keys too.
 Ca close it thx :)
  How to compile the app for linux? I am using ubuntu 14.04
 Ah thank you :+1:  It worked, good to hear the package has been updated there is a really old version shipped now :D
 Also run

``` bash
$ make install
```

After the make to install the icon, desktop entry and bin file ;)
 There is a small typo, the package is called build-essential without an 's' at the end.
  Being in the root directory cmake needed a path for the CMakeLists.txt - otherwise cmake won't run

(Tested on my ubuntu 14.04)
    I have just tried compiling on ubuntu 14.04 but ran into this error:

sqlitedb.cpp:11:21: fatal error: sqlite3.h: No such file or directory

anyone able to assist or successful with ubuntu trusty
 sorry how do you launch it?
 never mind, i got it :)
 Oh YES :)
  From printf manpage:
z - a following integer conversion corresponds to a size_t or ssize_t argument.
 @rp- and thank you for a great project!
I'm glad to help you :-)
  Here is compilation warning:
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/libs/antlr-2.7.7/src/String.cpp#L41

Caused by wrong type specifier. rhs is size_t (unsigned long int), but '%u' is (unsigned int)
May be it should be changed to '%lu' ?
 PS: warning message was on 64bit Ubuntu (gcc version 4.9). On 32bit Debian with gcc 4.7 there is no warnings
 @justinclift  here it is :)
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/66
 @justinclift , close it, please :smile: It is the only warning I had. But I will periodically look at the issues :smiley: 
  I just realized that when I try to modify a table after a default value has been introduced, following changes are just ignored. They appear in the modify table window and the "query" on the bottom is updated, but if you hit OK, nothing else happens. I also realized that you usually get a little window after any change that dissapears very fast (I think that it reads "executing SQL" or something like that) but once you introduce a default value, that window doesn't appear anymore.

If you remove that default value, everything is working fine

I also realized that if you open the modify table again after setting a default value, it now appears as 'value' instead of just value (I mean, quoted)

Here you can see an example
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5297845/3649297/1411fd66-1111-11e4-9248-468a12a2eb51.png)

I am running Win8.1 64bit, SQLite Database Browser 3.2.0 and I have these additional versions on the About... window: Qt Version 4.8.5 and SQLite Version 3.8.4.3
 Hi there

I just tried with the link you provided and it's still happening :(
 Hope it's fixed soon, doesn't look like something complex :)

Thanks!
 I am having an issue when adding a new field to an existing database and I think it is related to this. I have multiple fields with default values and whenever I try to add a new field, the field is always 'Field7' and cannot be renamed. I just tried the Nightly Mac build 09-24-2014. Quickest solution is to revert changes, export the table as SQL, modify the sql and then execute it.
 @nealpaze I think it's the same issue, once there's a default value, seems that any further updating stops (maybe some kind of exception is caught later is breaking the execution flow?). The thing is that if you have more than one default value (maybe because you are using an existing database), you will not even be able to remove them to allow it working again
 Sure... I still have to try the custom type, I will do both things tomorrow!

 Hi

This seems to be working fine, but I discovered something else while
testing it, I am creating a new issue :)

  I don't know how to figure out WHY it crashes can anyone point me to the relevant log files? Using the windows binary.
 Creating a new database (test) with a field (field1) and then opening my sqlite-database breaks. The same happens if I save the test database before opening the new one.

Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]

The actual database wasn't created by me so it might very well be in some weird format but I would like some kind of error message or log telling me that before I give up :)
 It still crashes so i´m guessing the file is weird in some way.
 This particular file won't be possible to share. Customer data.
 I have the same issue. Neither 3.1.0 nor the nightly from @MKleusberg did fix the crash.

Here is my sqlite db (savegame from sots2): https://www.sendspace.com/file/40bxfy
  When i insert new table from .csv file all my characters that are unicode like č,š,đ,ć,ž,ü,ö,ä, convert in ��
How to fix it. Thanks in advance!
 windows 8.1. Thanks for your help but i solved my problem with some other software for sqlite...  but i still use sqlitebrowser for everything. i will wait for new version of sqlitebrowser cause i hope that they will solve all problems. 
All the best.
 Great work man. I just download it and try it. This nightly build version has solve problems with UTF-8 Characters. This is great. Now I can do all my work with this great tool for sqlite. 
Keep on doing great work.
All the best.
  The `Browse Data` tab shows the correct number of rows but no fields. If I Execute the same SQL as the `Browse Data` tab does then the fields are visible and populated with data.

I've attached 3 screenshots, one from the `Database Structure` tab, one from the `Browse Data` tab and one from the `Execute SQL` tab.

The database works perfectly with PHP and NaviCat.

Any info on this will be much appreciated, thank you.

 This table is created with Doctrine2/ORM running on PHP5.6 PDO SQLite. I've just updated the table (using PHP5.4 PDO SQLite3 3.7.7.1) with new data without a problem.

Here's the table schema:

I've tested some other databases and none of them has the weird characters, so you're right that that has something to do with it. I've tried to replicate the weird characters without any luck. I've done some operations with PHP and Navicat but also no weird characters.

My conclusion is that most likely there's something wrong with my table, although PHP and Navicat has no problems with it. I believe that this issue can be closed.

Thank you very much for mentioning the weird characters!
 About the weird characters in my database, that are just CR and LF instead of spaces in other SQLite3 databases I have inspected. It can be seen on this screenshot:

![weirdcharacters](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/670271/3638028/e8ff7c78-1031-11e4-9af1-5bf367a1afaa.png)

I took a quick look at the file format on http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html but couldn't find any specifications there about the allowed characters in the creation text.

Maybe someone knows where to find more exact specifications of the file format?
 I came across some other databases, tested and inspected them. Table creation text with LF and TAB characters works, data can be seen in the `Browser Data` tab.

Please ask if more screenshots would be helpful and also if you like to examine the database file itself. It's only 1MB.
   Thanks for your words! I tried. I hope that I will make still something useful to the project :smiley:

 I've tried both building from the latest off master and downloading from other places. Same result. I just downloaded from sourceforge for example (http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser/?source=dlp), the version says 3.2, yet the crash report (similar to above) says `Version:         3.1 (3.1)`
 Awesome. I'll get that sent out in the next couple days. Thanks for the
help!
 @justinclift email sent
 @MKleusberg glad to be of help and glad to hear it's fixed! Thank _you_ for your effort! :wink: 
 @justinclift Checking it out now!
 Working like a charm. Thanks again!
  homebrew has been updated with a brew of sqlitebrowser 3.2.0

All that is required to install from brew now is:
`brew install sqlitebrowser`

```
$ brew info sqlitebrowser

 Oh, i wasn't aware there was a difference in the produced binary. It can be launched from spotlight and seems functional to me, but i just found out about sqlitebrowser so i have not tested it very much. I have no other thoughts on the issue i'm afraid.
 looks great!
 Just FYI in case you run into this:  After successfully installing sqlitebrowser via brew on OSX 10.9.5 (after performing the usual Brew update/doctor/etc), could not launch via cmd line 

$ sqlitebrowser

Ultimately uninstalling, reinstalling, and relinking Qt fixed the issue.

  I have db file from Android and every operation fail with "No such collation sequence: LOCALIZED" error. It is some Android related feature? 

Here is SQL code for the table

```
CREATE TABLE channel (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT COLLATE LOCALIZED,
    country TEXT,
    image TEXT,
    category TEXT COLLATE LOCALIZED,
    favorite INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    version INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp,
    UNIQUE (name)
)
```
 At least some fallback would be very useful, because of now not exist any SQLite browser that can work with Android DB because of this.
 Sorry for delay, I just sent example DB to the Justin
 I just tested windows build from http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/
And it works great! Thanks you very much. First Sqlite browser with support for Android DB files!
 When It will be also in the OS X builds?
 Great. Thanks you very much again.
  Hi,

Is it ok for you to use non-numeric chars in the tags?

For instance I got this now: sqlitebrowser-sqlb-3.2.0.tar.gz.

The sqlb- is annoying here, is it Ok to remove it?

Thanks.
 Thanks.
   I will try.
  I am non-professional user that is trying to import csv file that include Hebrew characters.
The file is endorsement of XML file to excel 2010 file and then save as csv file.
After upload the SQL database is not encode Hebrew.
What I need to do in order to see Hebrew in the database?

Hopefully you will help me.
Thanks,

  When you try to add a record, it does not use the specified default value for the fields, that are not being entered. To see an example of how this could be accomplished take a look at the firefox plugin SQLite manager (Screenshot added below)
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8113476/3523976/d0586672-0761-11e4-89dc-a66a2a57adfe.png)
 So it should indeed use default values? (Because I have a table, where the structure is like this: 
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8113476/3532585/997c1c54-07be-11e4-8956-66468c713d95.png) The problem is that when I press insert, the data inserted does not use the Default value for the 'date' (datum) column.I reloaded the table to work around the sync issue you wrote about.
 Is it possible that your nightly build is only for 32-bit Systems (because
the .exe file [after removing the .xz extension] does not work on my
Windows 7 64-bit System.
 Ah, I figured it out (didn't know that .xz was a compression format, now I
do:) ).
And using default values does work with this version now.
  Would love to be able to upgrade my sqlitebrowser 3.1 for PortableApps :-)
 Done. I see this morning it's now a work in progress (John building...)
  Up until now, the DBBrowserDB:decodeCSV used to load the csv-file character by character using the getChar() method of the QFile-class.
Unfortunatelly, this approach caused multibyte-chars as used for UTF-8 encoding to be split and displayed incorrectly.

The fix uses the QTextStream-class to load the file line by line.
Every line is then again iterated character by character, before the old algorithm is applied. Using this approach, the characters are loaded and encoded properly. Splitting multibyte-chars is thus prevented.
 Thank you for the feedback. I am happy that I can contribute something usefull to the project. As my schedule permits I will try to add and test your proposed changes and push them up this afternoon.

@rp- I don't think this would be the case. As far as I know the file pointer is not moved line-wise. Even if there is only one line, it should return false as the pointer is at the begining of the line. Do-While seems to be risky, as an empty file might cause the loop-block to execute once before the condition detects it.
 You are right, this might turn into a problem later. I must admit that I haven't worked with QT for a long time, so I might be a bit rusty ;-)
Exchanging it with inStream.readLine() should do the trick, thought.
 I might have found a first bug. A colleague of mine build the program on a mac, and there it seemed to have messed up the separators, as columns are not separated properly anymore. As I've only tested on a windows-machine I didn't know before, but I will investigate the problem asap.
 Ok, I've pushed a few more changes.
The line is now loaded using the readLine() command instead of the stream-operator. Also I've cleaned the code a bit up by removing unnecessary if-clauses and moved some of the variables into the outer-loop (as per request).
Finally, I've introduced an additional condition into the algorithm to detect blanks between separator and quote. 

EDIT: Made a quick test on my Mac and everything seems to work. Even files with only one line are imported properly.
  The SQLite browser program has stopped working every time I try to open a file and shutsdown
  After installing version sqlite browser 3.2.0 for Windows, trying to open an existing SQLite database displays a dialog box containing "Invalid file format".

Additional Info:
Qt Version 4.8.5
SQLite Version: 3.8.4.3
OS Version: Windows 8.1 Pro, 64-bit.
 It did.  I was using 3.1.0 earlier today.
 I confirmed that I was using “Open Database”.  Both the button on the main view as well as the File->Open Database menu item.
 Interesting…  For kicks and giggles, I clicked the “New Database” button, just to verify that I could in fact create a new database, closed the new database, and then tried to open the old database and it worked.
 Hi, I experienced the same issue just a while ago. I accidentally selected the .sqlite3 file as part of New Database dialog box. It even showed me an alert saying the db already exists which I ignored, then realized it tried creating a new DB with the same name so I cancelled the operation. Then I chose to open the file with 'Open Database' option and got this error. So I guess the New Database operation overwrote the file, but didn't save it properly as I quit the operation.

I  re-created the database (externally) and opened the same in the browser and it opened fine.
  I've a sqlite file created with WinCacheBox (geocaching software). However, sqlitebrowser recognizes only a few parts of the file: only for some tables the structure is shown correctly and only for them the contents is displayed. For all others, it knows how many records are there, but cannot display their contents.
I've put a sample file here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9mayzr3stx389hd/CacheBox.db3
 Right, the nightly build works well. Sorry... Should have tried before...
  This is similar to issue #34, except using the construction `NOT LIKE`. Please note that using a regular `LIKE`, i.e. without negation, does work.

Example:

```
CREATE TABLE not_working(
    value TEXT CONSTRAINT "value" CHECK(value NOT LIKE "prefix%")
);

CREATE TABLE working(
    value TEXT CONSTRAINT "value" CHECK(value LIKE "prefix%")
);

INSERT INTO not_working( value ) VALUES( "a" );
INSERT INTO    working( value ) VALUES( "prefixa" );
-- INSERT INTO NotWorking( value ) VALUES( "prefixb" );
-- INSERT INTO    Working( value ) VALUES( "b" );
```

I'm using the test build posted in the comment by @justinclift in issue #34 on Windows 7.
 Confirmed working now, also on my larger database :)

However, it appears to me that the underlying issue is that you are not fully implementing the grammar as specified by SQLite. For example, looking at the possible definitions for table constraints (http://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html -> column-def -> column-constraint -> expr), it seems to me that the same (specific) problem holds for "GLOB", "REGEXP" and "MATCH". Indeed, the following example again fails to display properly:

```
CREATE TABLE not_working(
    value TEXT CONSTRAINT "value" CHECK(value NOT GLOB "foo")
);

CREATE TABLE working(
    value TEXT CONSTRAINT "value" CHECK(value GLOB "foo")
);

INSERT INTO not_working( value ) VALUES( "bar" );
INSERT INTO    working( value ) VALUES( "foo" );
```

The issue is that all of these expressions (and possibly more in the other comparison operators) may be prefixed by an optional "NOT" operator. However your current fix just allows "NOT LIKE" in addition to regular "LIKE" conditions, but it does not add the generic ability to say "NOT <expression>".

The same holds for the fix for issue #34, modifying the example leads to e.g.:

```
CREATE TABLE not_working(
    value TEXT CONSTRAINT "value" CHECK(value NOT IN( "foo" ) )
);

CREATE TABLE working(
    value TEXT CONSTRAINT "value" CHECK(value IN( "foo" ) )
);

INSERT INTO not_working( value ) VALUES( "bar" );
INSERT INTO    working( value ) VALUES( "foo" );
```

Which again does not display properly.

I'm wondering whether this is intentional? (and how many more of these examples I can come up with ;)
  Oh I see. I do notice that when I open the sqlite file again those shm and wal files reappear. Thanks for your answer!
 Stupid question, but is there a way to open WAL files directly? I have a .db-wal file I was looking to browse apart from my .db.

Thanks!
 Thanks so much for the help, Peinthor! Indeed there is, would this main db reflect the data in the Write-Ahead log before the commit to purge it? If not, is there any way at all to see what this data is before it has been added to the main db?
 @sammarcus wrote 'stupid question'. With the sole exception of the unasked there is no such thing as a 'stupid question'. Stupid answers however there are unfortunately too many...

Back on-topic: like someone said: by opening more than one session (e.g. more TerminalTabs) one can easily have more WA-L and/or SHM-files and investigate them with any tool/language (Perl is an easy example) capable of handling binary files. With the help of SQLite's doc you're able to analyze them and search for nugs and other reasons of corrupted databases.

 @rp- thanks so much for that documentation! I had seen it before but gave it another reread, made some new discoveries. appreciate the link!

@Z4us thank you as well!! I'm just starting out so I always like to preface my beginner questions with that disclaimer but the git community has been so friendly. I got it all figured out.. thanks again!

 qmake -d result: https://gist.github.com/0e5a3b7085d16dd634b6

Note: At the beginning 'antlr.xcodeproj' in Users/kutay/foo/sqlitebrowser/libs/antlr-2.7.7 has not current extension.(3 or 4 more file had same stiuation) When i was running qmake, terminal says ¨can't find 'antlr.xcodeproj' ¨ or something like that. Then i change *.pro to *.xcodeproj .. It may be important to know.
 I had the same issue installing. I definitely had both Qt and SQLite3 installed with brew with no problems.  

This worked for me:
    qmake -spec macx-g++
    make
 I found another way to accomplish my duty. When i have free time i'm gonna try your recommendations. Thanks for now :)
 I was also experiencing this problem on my Mac OS X 10.9.4:

``` bash
$ qmake
WARNING: Ignored (not found) '/Users/username/Documents/sqlitebrowser/libs/antlr-2.7.7/antlr.xcodeproj'

but this suggestion helped:

``` bash
qmake -spec macx-llvm
make
```

Thanks @MKleusberg !
  It seems i'm encoutered a new bug :
I open my database and in a table i click many times on "New Record", many blank rows appears.

I complete theses blank rows then i click "Write Changes" but only the first new record is saved to the disk, all others are cleared !

It appears the same thing if a delete a new record which hasn't be saved or if a i complete the filter, only the first new record appears at the end of the list.

Thanks.
  Cool! :thumbsup:
 How about "auto open last project" and "open project from command line" :question:
  When using a CHECK constraint on a column of a table which uses the IN( ... ) syntax to check that the value exists in a known set of values, the resulting table does not appear to have any columns when viewed at the "Database Structure" tab. Inserting values will still work, as will querying the table manually, but the "Browse Data" tab will show rows without any columns or data.

Example:

```
CREATE TABLE not_working(
    _id PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    value NVARCHAR(5) CHECK (value IN ('a', 'b', 'c'))
);

CREATE TABLE working(
    _id PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    value NVARCHAR(5) CHECK (value = 'a' OR value = 'b' OR value = 'c')
);

INSERT INTO not_working( _id, value ) VALUES ( 1, 'a' ), ( 2, 'b' ), ( 3, 'c' );
INSERT INTO working( _id, value ) VALUES ( 4, 'a' ), ( 5, 'b' ), ( 6, 'c' );
```

I'm using version 3.1.0 on Windows 7.
 Thanks for the quick fix! It now seems to work fine on my database :)
  table is create with episodenb ::  
 integer not null
but show as 
TEXT
in
sqlitebrowser (version 3.1.0, Qt 4.8.5, QSLite 3.7.17).

This is what I use :
create table if not exists episode (
episodeid integer primary key references filmitem (filmid),
serieid integer not null references filmitem (filmid),
seasonnb integer not null,
episodenb integer no null,
title varchar[max],
foreign key (serieid) references serie (serieid)
);"

This is what is dumped by sqlite3 command line:
sqlite> .dump episode
PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE episode (episodeid integer primary key references filmitem (filmid),serieid integer not null references filmitem (filmid),seasonnb integer not null,episodenb integer no null,title varchar[max],foreign key (serieid) references serie (serieid));
COMMIT;

But sqlitebrowser tells me that:

CREATE TABLE "episode" (
    `episodeid` integer,
    `serieid`   integer NOT NULL,
    `seasonnb`  integer NOT NULL,
    `episodenb` TEXT,
    `title` varchar[max],
    PRIMARY KEY(episodeid)
)
 Indeed this was my mistake (no vs not), I'm glad that you were actually able to turn this in something helpful for the project.

Thanks for the detailed answer :wink: 

Another little detail, when I click "modify table" on a table in the "Database structure" tab, and resize the "Edit Table definition" window, after the resize it shrinks back but the bottom QTextEdit (I think) is reduced a little too much and shows a scroll area which should not be necessary. 
 This is the scroll bar in the "Edit table definition" windows.
But it seems it's not always happening, it depends on how you resize, so it's maybe more a Qt problem.

  I recently added a partial index (a new SQLite 3.8 feature) to my database and noticed that SQLite Browser was no longer able to read it. I'm assuming that this is because the 3.1 Windows binary version is still using SQLite 3.7.17.

Since 3.8 is 9 months old now, perhaps it's time to update the bundled version?
 @justinclift: Sure. I just tried opening and browsing the same file (with partial indexes) that didn't work under 3.1 and everything seems to be working as expected. That's about the extent of the testing I can do at the moment, as I happen to be out of town, but it looks good to me....
  Is there any reason sqlb does not contain a compiled osx sqlitebrowser.app in its release distribution?

Was thinking maybe a license issue or possibly a security signing which may prevent it running on other machines issue maybe?
 You basically can copy the Qt framework files to your app bundle, and that's it. Examine the package for the older (sourceforge) app and you will see how it is done. I think I had some automated routines at one time to do this, but they were for Qt3, probably very different.
 One note: in the previous version I used to include the sqlite3 source in the tree, and compile it with the program. But I see now that this has changed (reading cmake). So you are correct that you also need to include the lib. 
But, in general, OSX bundles have this ability: you can include the libs inside the bundle directory and they will be searched first, and take precedence over the ones installed in the system. 
For the Qt libs, you can use the included tool to simplify this:
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/macosx-deployment.html
 Awesome, glad I got a ball rolling. I have forked the repo and uploaded a release OSX build for a friend but I didn't hear back from him if it worked. Going to assume it wont streight off the bat but glad to hear that it may at some point :)
 it doesnt even work. I followed all steps and when i run the make it says:

 It works for me on on Mavericks. Awesome! Thank you! Just what i was looking for! =)

 Same issue here with both versions. The problem seems to be in libsqlite3.0.dylib. How did you generate it? Did you do this on a machine running Mavericks? 
Maybe this lib needs to be compiled/linked against an older version of the system frameworks in order to work on older OSX releases.
 I am pretty sure the processor does not matter, XCode targets abstract this. The problem is most likely that you used/bundled a system version of libsqlite3 that is incompatible with what I have here. Did you copy this from your sytem folder, or compile it?
That is one of the reasons I used to add sqlite3.c to the builds, so you would have a static version on all platforms. Of course, it makes it difficult to update Sqlite and benefit from fixes (specially in the case of LInux builds). For OSX and Win this is really not an issue as you would have to replace the lib anyway.
 Justin, try not including libsqlite3 in the archive, and instead linking to the system framework in XCode. Here are some pointers (the first link is for ios but it should also apply to osx):

  make install (invoked in the top level directory, containing BUILDING, ...) doesn't seem to do anything except produce output; no files are installed anywhere.  The program has already been build using make, and seems to work fine.

I suspect there's a typo in BUILDING, which reads, in part:

```
    Provided you have Qt and cmake  installed and configured, simply
    run

    qmake

    followed by

When I find a Makefile in a build directory, I assume that the packager
has already run whatever is needed to generate it, and that they have
probably done a better job than I will (at least for a first cut), so in
this cas I didn't run qmake.  If you want sqlitebrowser to be built
using cmake rather than make, the above should read:

```
    Provided you have Qt and cmake  installed and configured, simply
    run

    qmake

Build the binary as instructed.  If "make install" doesn't put the
binary in a useful place (say in /usr/bin) copy it to such a place by
hand.
  One field in the database I'm investigating is described as:
dateTime INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
It's actually, as the name implies, a Unix time field containing seconds since the epoch.  If there any way to display it properly in the browser?
  Is there any documentation for Sqlite Browser?  If so, where?  In particular, what do the "Filter" buttons do?
 Thanks for the tips, i went back to the old version just because the search was so strict !
  It would be better if the old Sqlite Browser site on Sourceforge had a pointer to this site.  The Sourceforge site comes up in Google searches much earlier.  I wasted a good deal of time trying to get the Sourceforge version to compile.

  I tend to browse/edit the same set of databases and tables much of the time (a fairly typical scenario?). Would you consider an enhancement to save the column widths the user has set for a given database+table? Either automatically or, to avoid an infinitely growing list, via a button or a menu option?
 Saving the current session profile would be great too, Martin.  But what if I frequently work on several tables in database A and a couple of tables in database B - when I switch from one table to another it would be fantastic if the column widths I'd set for that table were restored for me...
 Works as you describe and does precisely what I was looking for!
Thanks very much!
  This is more a comment than a bug report, but I noticed this when testing the fix for issue #16. 
Suppose you have a BLOB containing multiple null-terminated strings. When you edit the blob, everything is fine as type:Binary, but if you change the type to "Text" in the EditDialog the length of the data remains the same but only the data up to the first null is shown (understandable, but not what the user might expect). Switching back to type:Binary shows all the data again.
However, if you change the data in the type:Text view it is immediately truncated at the first null (the new length shown at the bottom of the EditDialog window), and switching back to type:Binary only shows the truncated data.
I do think it's a valuable facility to be able to edit text within a blob - editing UTF-8 encoded text in hex mode is only fun once :-)
 Yes, it seems to be a very difficult area.  Full function UTF8-aware hex/text editors seem very few and far between.
Perhaps it would be reasonable to settle for disabling Text editing for blobs :-(
By the way, I only discovered by accident that the binary edit mode has the text displayed on the right hand side - it's completely hidden when the EditDialog opens at its default size!
Maybe make the default width enough to show the 16 bytes in both hex and text?
 @MKleusberg both commits appear to have achieved what was intended - looks good, thanks!
May I make a couple more (final?) comments? (although I understand you may have better things to do than attend to this level of detail)
1. there is no visible representation of a null byte in the text view, and 
2."Select all" highlights all the text, but "copy" only copies up to the first null

Seeing where there is a null means I'm less likely to remove it by mistake.
Being able to copy the entire blob value at least gives me the opportunity to take the data for processing elsewhere (and a really nice feature of the EditDialog is that I can get my binary data back into sqlitebrowser by pasting it as hex pairs).
 Here's what I see on Windows 8.1:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7688713/3209796/2d42edac-ee8b-11e3-9574-fbe521985263.png)
To my mind, the best solution is, as you suggest, to extend the hex editor widget if possible to allow input on the right side.
By the way, the hex editor doesn't appear to make any attempt to display multi-byte UTF-8 characters ("café" will appear as "caf.."). Another Qt constraint?
  Just started using the much-improved v3.1.0 via PortableApps - Thanks!
However, I now find that columns with a declared type of TEXT with values which are UTF-8 strings longer than 1024 bytes now appear as (BLOB), both in the Browse Data tab and in the Execute SQL tab result pane. SQLite returns typeof() as 'text'.
Not sure what the previous PortableApps version was, but it displayed text values as text all the way up to my longest string of about 13K.
Is this a limit that you could consider raising/removing? (browsing/editing BLOB data is a tad less friendly than TEXT data!)
 Sure, I'll try it tomorrow and let you know.
Quick work!
 As predicted, Rene's fix works perfectly as far as I can see both for isBinary and for EditDialog::checkDataType() so, from my perspective, this issue is resolved.
(I do have a related EditDialog comment, but will raise a new issue for it)
Many thanks for the super quick fix!
  The tool of choice to translate pure Qt applications (like sqlitebrowser) is Qt Linguist. As Rene said, the code is mostly ready for it, as it uses tr() to display strings. If possible I would like to stay away from Launchpad, as it is too specific to Ubuntu/Canonical. We had a lot of problems in the past in KDE, with Launchpad translations taking precedence over upstream ones in some cases. 
 In issue #57 I made translation to Russian.
  I can't seem to figure out how to open an encrypted sqlite database?  If this is not currently possible, I think it would be an appropriate enhancement.

Thanks!
 It is a nice enhancement, but be aware that by itself SQLite does not include an encryption library. One is available from HWCI (http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/see.html), for a fee. 
As sqlitebrowser is distributed with source we can not include SEE with sqlitebrowser. You can, however, license the extension and compile your own binary with SEE included (I have done this in the past for the Arca Database Browser, the product from which sqlitebrowser was derived from).
 Hi,
Yes, please add support for SQLCipher.
Thanks.
 Thanks for all of the comments/suggestions.  I'm pretty sure I don't have the know-how to link in an encryption library and compile my own version of the software for Windows.  If anyone can do this and make it available for download, that would be great.
 "Coolissimo", Justin, will make the upcoming version "awesomer" than it already would be without this free and open encryption {isn't this kind of a "contradictio in terminis" ?-)} Can't wait :-)
 This is specifically useful for databases/tables containing (or going to contain) passwords like one I'm creating and e.g. Fossil. Of the latter passwords are in normal UTF-8....
 Although I don't get a lot of time to play around with this, I have been keeping track of the comments and enhancements.  It's great to see that even with "free" software, there is some support and people that care to enhance it.

I just downloaded what I thought was the latest version for Windows.  I didn't see any of these changes in it.  Is there any possibility of getting a test/beta version that has the new encryption ability rolled up into it?

Thanks!!
 I'm testing the version with sqlcipher with success under osx 10.6. One question: can I add a parameter like e.g. a filename when I start via the command line of Terminal? 
 Of course we don't enter the password visible on the command line, but things like file-path and name, eventually some options like page-size if it's not the default of 1024 bytes. I asked this to get only the question for a password to any user and in case of a wrong answer they have no access (or just read views, their "own" data etc. 
 Cool @MKleusberg I may have found a bug. When I enter the following SQL-statement:

pragma application_id;

it works well in the GUI (returns 0 - changing it fails), but returns the following error-message to Terminal

2014-12-05 08:29:13.251 sqlitebrowser[20563:903] Failed to get CharCodes from EventRef (-9870)

Not with some other pragmata; didn't try them all yet. 
 Only with encrypted databases unless the bug was introduced after 25 november the last nightly build normal I installed. I need to do some more tests, but it seems that for an encrypted database the application always returns 0 for application_id even if this field was filled with another value before encryption; I'd like to see this one in the 'Edit Pragmas' tab...

The problem seems solved in the build of 7 December. I changed application_id successfully. Thanks! Good job!!
 Just tried the latest version again for Windows.
Is there any hopes for a Windows version that will open an encrypted database?

Thanks!
 Unfortunately, no.  I can fumble my way through maintaining some C++ web code, but other than that, I wouldn't be much help. 
 Hi, 
I will try my best to explain in detail my build set: 
- Miscrosoft visual studio c++ 2013, but I think any version is ok, link download: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=517284
- SQLCipher: I just try to link with 2 differents versions, and it works all fine: 
  - 1st one is SQLCipher C/C++ DLL for Windows that I requested for a 30 days trial on their main site (https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/trial/)
  - 2nd one is a self compilation (mingw32 + code source: https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/open-source), here's a guide link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29196087/step-by-step-guide-to-build-qt-sql-driver-plugin-for-sqlite-db-with-sqlcipher-ex (part 5)
- These variables in CMakeLists.txt must be modified to match your preferences: 
  
  ```
   + QT5_PATH
   + SQLITE3_PATH (path to foremost folder of SQL Cipher)
   + OPENSSL_PATH
   + VSREDIST
   + LIBSQLITE_NAME (sqlcipher or sqlite3 depends on the name of your .dll file)
   + SQLITE3_INCLUDE_DIRS (sqlite3.h)
   + SQLITE3_LIBS (name of your .dll file)
  ```
- Then everything left is just open sqlitebrowser MSVC solution then build
  I'm sure that I might miss something, so if there anything wrong, just ask here, I will look back at my build and answer, for now that's all I remember.
  
    Cheers,

 Can someone please help me? I don't know what it means "Please enter the key used to encrypt the database". I downloaded the database from Bluehost. Do I call them to get the key??
 yes, but there do I get the password? Where do I find it?
 I'm a technical writer (not a developer). I'm not sure what I am doing. I backed up my website and I have this file called kamanjao_kaman.sql that I'd like to view to make sure my pages are there. 
 is it found in wp-config.php?
 Thanks to lulian, Chris, and Justin! Thanks for your detailed reply. I
think I will restore the data to a blank Wordpress setup to verify as
Justin suggests. It's simply to hard to read otherwise. Thanks for the
suggestion!
 so any way to decrypt the sqlite file encrypted by sqlite cipher without know the password? if you know please send me the way on roneqwerty@yahoo.com Thank you for your response.

/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/distri/sqlitebrowser.desktop
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/src/sqlitetablemodel.h
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/src/sqlitetablemodel.cpp
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/src/icons/sqlitebrowser.png
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/src/grammar/sqlite3.g
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/src/grammar/sqlite3TokenTypes.hpp
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/src/sqlitedb.h
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/src/sqlitetypes.cpp
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/src/sqlitetypes.h
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/src/sqlitedb.cpp
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.pro
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.pro.user
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/images/sqlitebrowser.svg
/home/durga/sqlitebrowser/images/sqlitebrowser.png

Should I include explicitly add these files(sqlite3.h/.c, shell.c files from sqlite.org) to Qt project?
 I used to work with couple of sqlite3 versions on my machine. (including sqlcipher)

I can see this on Ubuntu 12.04 also.
  Hi,

I'm going to package it into Fedora 20 onwards, I'd like to know which name is better, sqlitebrowser or sqlb?

Thanks.
 Thx.

If you have not changed this from the original version there is probably 
a .icns icon that needs to be changed with the new art.
