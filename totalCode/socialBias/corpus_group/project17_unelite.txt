Conclusion:

Release build shows erratic behavior when LSTM is used, errormessages and/or wrong output.
Debug And MinSizeRel builds work slowly but correctly.
As soon as the optimization /Ot is switched to /Os (or from /O2 to /O1) or LSTM is not used all problems go away.

### Expected Behavior:

Release build behaves like MinSizeRel/Debug built.

### Suggested Fix:

Problem is located in Tesseract::GetRectImage

As soon as speed optimization for this function is switched off with #pragma optimize( "t", off ) the problem goes away.
 As I made some progress I updated the issue to better describe what is happening.
I built tesseract exactly like described here:
 https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling#windows
Develop Tesseract -> Building for x64 platform It is a 64 bit version of leptonica - otherwise it would not work at all.
Why should the compiler used to build leptonica make any difference?
Due to my findings the problem is located in Tesseract::GetRectImage, and goes away as soon as that very function is not optimized for speed anymore.
I would not expect that the way tesseract interfaces with external libraries is changed by the optimization option. Not my post and it does not look like the problem has anything to do with /Ob2.
RelWithDebugInfo shows the same behaviour as Release as both use /O2. Found similar problem in ColPartitionGrid::ComputeTotalOverlap with some input files.
A Release build hits the following assertion:
contains_unichar_id(unichar_id):Error:Assert failed:in file C:\Users\mw\Desktop\OCR\tesseract-master\ccutil\unicharset.h, line 513
As soon as I add #pragma optimize( "t", off ) directly in front of the function ColPartitionGrid::ComputeTotalOverlap  the problem goes away. @MarkusGH, did you also restore optimization after `ColPartitionGrid::ComputeTotalOverlap` and `Tesseract::GetRectImage`, so we can be sure that only those functions used code without optimization in your test? Yes - I put #pragma optimize( "", on )  directly after the functions.
It looks like the following have a strong effect on the problem:
Training files used, size of input file (pixel count), engine.
Strange enough I found at least one file which works with --oem 0 and --oem 1 but not with --oem 3. I think it is too early to blame MSVC for this issue.
Could be a compiler error or could be sloppy programming which leads to unexpected behaviour when that kind of optimization is active. Again - to me it feels a lot like it has to do with signed integer overflow handling. 
Signed integer overflow behaviour is undefined per C++11 standard. 
Without optimizations signed integer overflow will simply wrap around (this is simply what the processor does). With optimizations anything can happen...
You actually do not really know, if the issue is not also present in gcc builds, because the effects are not necessarily obvious - could be there are only slight variations in OCR results.

As you use gcc I would kindly suggest to create a build with the gcc option -ftrapv (and maybe other options necessary to bring the debugger to break on integer overflows) and try the test case I provided to see if it actuall produces integer overflows. If so this makes a case to investigate further in that direction. A Tesseract executable which was compiled with `-ftrapv` does not raise an overflow exception. What about debugging the buggy Windows executable and setting a conditional breakpoint on `pixCreateHeader` (waiting for `height <= 0`)? Oh - so it looks like the integer overflow hypothesis is dead.
About pixCreateHeader: I searched for that already. Unfortunately I did not build leptonica from source and it does not look like this function is called from anywhere outside leptonica. I tested the latest binary from [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/qlkwgwrntp1gnr7l/artifacts/build%2Fbin%2Ftesseract-master.1240.zip). It shows the same problem when running `tesseract --oem 1 Test.tif stdout` with LSTM.

It looks like `pixCreateHeader` is called with height == 0.  Hello everyone and thanks for the library.

I'm on Linux, using Tesseract 3.05.01, Leptonica 1.74.4. Building both from source. I have built them with no problem.

What I want to achieve is, statically link leptonica and tesseract to a shared object, which uses the functions from tesseract's API. Following this linkage, I wanted to link this shared object to an executable. Finally, there should be an executable with a shared object and these should not need any other shared object.

I've successfully linked the libraries to shared object(I thought so) but when I try to link to the executable, I see that Leptonica functions are not linked. What am I doing wrong?

The linking of the shared object:
```
g++ -I. -I/usr/local/include/tesseract -I/usr/local/include/leptonica -std=gnu++11 wrap.cpp  /usr/local/lib/liblept.a /usr/local/lib/libtesseract.a -shared -o wrap.so -fPIC -Wl,-Bsymbolic
```

Linking of the executable:
```
gcc test.c -o test wrap.so
```

The error I receive:
```
wrap.so: undefined reference to `sem_init'
wrap.so: undefined reference to `pixExpandReplicate'
wrap.so: undefined reference to `pixConvertTo8'
wrap.so: undefined reference to `pixGetWpl'

wrap.so: undefined reference to `pixConvertTo32'
wrap.so: undefined reference to `pixaCreate'
wrap.so: undefined reference to `sem_wait'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

What should I do to overcome these linkage problems?

I've attached the wrap.cpp, wrap.h and test.c:

  Hello,

Releases 3.05.00 and 3.05.01 are missing `./configure` in release bundle
Im struggling to build tesseract for 3 days now

Also, release 3.05.01 is missing build fixes from 3.05 branch
Would be great if you could re-upload release bundles with them

Appreciated You're supposed to run ./autogen.sh as a first step, which will generate the configure script. You (the developer) are supposed to do that, and generate a tarball from the result, and upload it to GitHub as a release download. @amitdo yes, i understand, but for some reason i had to resolve a bunch of errors with autogen.sh, and finally ended up with
```
./configure: line 17577: syntax error near unexpected token `LEPTONICA,'
./configure: line 17577: `PKG_CHECK_MODULES(LEPTONICA, lept >= 1.74, have_lept=true, have_lept=false)'
```
even with `pkg-config` installed

i've successfully builded 3.04.01 witch seems to be the last release with bundled `./configure`

Any help appreciated  If you installed pkg-config after you ran autogen.sh, re-run autogen.sh.  @amitdo i re-run autogen.sh a million times already... :( Leptonica is built from source:
https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/releases/download/1.74.4/leptonica-1.74.4.tar.gz
with:
```
./configure --prefix=$pkg_prefix
make
make install
```

Building tesseract from release tar 3.05.00 I'm getting:
```
...

checking for leptonica... configure: error: leptonica not found
```

Building tesseract from git branch 3.05 I'm getting:

./configure: line 17577: syntax error near unexpected token `LEPTONICA,'
./configure: line 17577: `PKG_CHECK_MODULES(LEPTONICA, lept >= 1.74, have_lept=true, have_lept=false)'

Build script is the same:
```
  libtoolize
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --enable-debug \
	  --prefix="${pkg_prefix}" \
	  --host=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu \

	  --with-extra-libraries=$(pkg_path_for tpolekhin/leptonica)/lib
  make
```

Also, `pkg-config --cflags lept` and `pkg-config --libs lept` gives:
```

./configure: line 17577: `PKG_CHECK_MODULES(LEPTONICA, lept >= 1.74, have_lept=true, have_lept=false)'
``` Nothing if this helps also:
`LIBLEPT_HEADERSDIR=$(pkg_path_for tpolekhin/leptonica)/include`
`LIBLEPT_HEADERSDIR=$(pkg_path_for tpolekhin/leptonica)/include/leptonica` So this means nothing?
```
pkg-config --cflags lept

``` I've found why i have v3.04.00 building normally
configure.ac in branch 3.04 is missing this:
`PKG_CHECK_MODULES([LEPTONICA], [lept >= 1.74], [have_lept=true], [have_lept=false])`
that is present in 3.05 I think that the issue here is that autoconf can't find pkg-config m4 macros for PKG_CHECK_MODULES
Here's what i found in `config.log`
```
ACLOCAL='${SHELL} /hab/cache/src/tesseract-3.05.01/config/missing aclocal-1.15'
``` @zdenop tried `ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /hab/pkgs/tpolekhin/leptonica/1.74.4/20171124113357/" ./autogen.sh` with same error :( Did you install `autoconf-archive` (or another package needed for your Linux distribution which provides the macro `PKG_CHECK_MODULES`? okay, so the issue was that `automake/share/aclocal/` was missing `pkg.m4` The `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` macro comes from `pkg-config`

I'd like to stop supporting old giflib versions, before 5.1 when the interface was last changed.
leptonica is currently supporting 4.1.6 and 5.0, as well as 5.1+.

Is this practical? What would be effect be on tesseract if giflib 5.1+ were required? Hi Dan!

I think it's OK to move to 5.1 as the minimum version.

Gif support is not very critical for OCR purpose.

Maybe you should target a new release for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. OK.  Will drop pre-5.1 giflib support.

And I expect to have a new leptonica release in Dec or Jan that Jeff will
debianize for 18.04.

 CC'ing @jbreiden. `libgif4` (4.1.6) was last used in Debian's `oldstable`, so I see no problem in dropping support for that version. Support for 5.1 which is used by Debian `stable` is required of course. libgif support in gifio.c cleaned up.
Old pre-5.1 distributions are no longer supported.
libgif 5.1 or later only (and not 5.1.2) MacPorts uses giflib 4.2.3, because when giflib 5 was released, its API was different from giflib 4 and nothing supported the new API, so updating to giflib 5 would have broken everything that uses giflib. See [this MacPorts ticket](https://trac.macports.org/ticket/35817) for my investigations into that. Granted that was 5 years ago and maybe some projects have now added giflib 5 support. But I count 68 different ports in MacPorts that use giflib, and I don't know if all of those projects have added giflib 5 support, but my strong suspicion is that they have not, because some of them are probably not in development anymore.

All of which is to say that if you drop giflib 4 support, it will be a lot of work for me in MacPorts to probably create separate giflib 4 and 5 ports and then update and test those 68 ports. We don't currently have that, but yes, I will probably need to work on doing that. Homebrew supports giflib 5.1.4.
https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/giflib.rb Ryan, I'm sorry to hear that.  I know what a pain it is when a basic library changes its interface. The gifilib interface changed at 5.0 and at 5.1.  If you look at leptonica gifio.c from 1.74.4, you'll see what I had to do to support 4.6.x and 5.0 and 5.1+.

Have another look, and if you still want me to revert, at least to give you more time to bring macports up to date, let me know and I will do so.

  -- Dan Ah, I see you already committed the removal in https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/commit/64961e9ae9151f9c9e251de9fe7be0363e780fbd.

Maybe that will motivate me to finally deal with giflib 5 in MacPorts. The offer still stands, if you need it.  I expect that version 1.75 will be released some time in January, to set your time frame. Makes sense.  Ryan, I'll revert the gifio.c change for 1.75.   The error messages come from Leptonica.
  Try to isolate the problem and find out which function/method call triggers the error.

Start by calling only Leptonica functions:

>pixWriteAutoFormat("F:/test.jpg", croppedImage);
Pix* test = pixRead("F:/test.jpg");

  ### Environment

* **Tesseract Version**: 4.0.0-alpha
* **Platform**: Windows 10 64-bit 

### Current Behavior
get the tesseract  by compiling the source code .
visual studio 2015 update 3
using api to call tesseract
`char* outText = api->GetUTF8Text();`
when I free the pointer outText like following code:
`delete[]  outText`
while using the **release mode** to compile the code, running ok ! 
but using the **debug mode**, the program definately crash! 
### Expected Behavior:

### Suggested Fix:
 https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/APIExample

>// Destroy used object and release memory
>    api->End();
>    delete[] outText;

Did you call `api->End()` ? surley I did @hoangtocdo90 tks for your reply man, but it doesnt seem like what you gave.  see https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1030  I am trying to build the latest from git on Fedora 26, 4.13.10-200.fc26.x86_64.

While run ./configure, following error was reported:

./configure: line 4243: syntax error near unexpected token `-mavx,'
./configure: line 4243: `AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG(-mavx, avx=true, avx=false)'

 You can also use the search options in GitHub.

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues?q=is%3Aissue+AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG+is%3Aclosed
  I have read that the training process run on 4 threads using openmp but viewing cpu utilization I can see it only uses 1 thread? Is there something special I need to do to make it run using openmp? I am using gcc 4.8
  I am attempting to run this:

```
lapply(myfiles, function(i){

    shell(shQuote(paste0("pdftopng -f 1 -l 10 -r 600 ", i, " ocrbook")))
mypngs <- list.files(path = dest, pattern = "png", full.names = TRUE)
lapply(mypngs, function(z){
    shell(shQuote(paste0("tesseract ", z, " out")))
    #file.remove(paste0(z))
    })
})
```


However, even though I am feeding it a PNG file, I get the error
```
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v3.05.01 with Leptonica
Error in pixCreateNoInit: pix_malloc fail for data
Error in pixCreate: pixd not made

2: In shell(shQuote(paste0("tesseract ", z, " out"))) :
  '"tesseract C:\users\gallowmb\desktop/ocrbook-000001.png out"' execution failed with error code 1
```


phototest works.  There seems to be an issue with the file itself.  What is the issue?


RStudio 1.1.383
Tesseract 3.05.01
Win 7 64 bit zdenop, here is the output of tesseract -v in CMD.
```

tesseract 3.05.01

   lipgif 4.1.6(?)  :  libjpeg 8d (libjpeg-turbo 1.5.0)  :  libpng 1.6.20  :  libtiff 4.0.6  :  
   zlib 1.2.8  :  libwebp 0.4.3  :  libopenjp2 2.1.0
```


I have converted the PDF to a TIFF, and rerun it, and the tesseract error is this:

`Error in PixReadFromTiffStream: calloc fail for tiffdata` Hi, I found what the problem was after using an example scanned PDF from the internet.  The DPI was too high for the PDFtoPNG conversion.  I took it down to 150 and it worked like a charm.  It seems there is a DPI limit for Tesseract.  

So I went from this:
` shell(shQuote(paste0("pdftopng -f 1 -l 10 -r 600 ", i, " ocrbook")))`

To this:
` shell(shQuote(paste0("pdftopng -f 1 -l 10 -r 150 ", i, " ocrbook")))` I also updated my script to have a more dynamic name, so no overwriting because of static naming.

```

dest <- "C:\\users\\yourname\\desktop"

      files <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(list.files(path = dest, pattern = "pdf", full.names = TRUE))
        lapply(files, function(i){
          shell(shQuote(paste0("pdftoppm -f 1 -l 10 -r 150 ", i,".pdf", " ",i)))
          })
      
      
      myppms <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(list.files(path = dest, pattern = "ppm", full.names = TRUE))
        lapply(myppms, function(y){
          shell(shQuote(paste0("magick ", y,".ppm"," ",y,".tif")))
          file.remove(paste0(y,".ppm"))
          })
  
      mytiffs <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(list.files(path = dest, pattern = "tif", full.names = TRUE))
        lapply(mytiffs, function(z){
          shell(shQuote(paste0("tesseract ", z,".tif", " ",z)))
          file.remove(paste0(z,".tif"))
          })

``` In addition to the above, make sure image magick has a specified DPM.  So for the Image Magick part of the script, the options need to include "-density 300" or something of that nature.

Like such (along with a multitude of other options)
```
      myppms <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(list.files(path = dest, pattern = "ppm", full.names = TRUE))
        lapply(myppms, function(y){
          shell(shQuote(paste0("magick -colorspace gray ", y,".ppm","  -density 300 -depth 8 -flatten -auto-orient -auto-level -rotate -90^> +dither -colors 2 -normalize"," ",y,".tif")))
          file.remove(paste0(y,".ppm"))
          })
```  Is it possible to create a trainned data without the tesstrain.sh script in wiindows?  ### Environment

* **Tesseract Version**: Current main repository (4.00.00alpha)
* **Platform**: Windows7 32-bit

### Current Behavior:
Its recognize Arabic Characters and can not recognize Arabic numbers (ارقام عربى 0123456789)
I tried tessdata, tessdata_best, and tessdata_fast

### Expected Behavior:

### Suggested Fix:
 Did you try Arabic.traineddata? @amitdo yes It is recognize the characters (80% included the Latin numbers) and it does not recognize the Arabic numbers inside the red rectangle (the original without red rectangle )

@Shreeshrii @theraysmith The succeed rate for the pics above 100% (numbers only) but it depends on the pic quality in general

Combining with ara
****- current tesseract main repository** :** give an error (mgr->GetComponent(TESSDATA_INTTEMP, &fp):Error:Assert failed:in file classify\adaptmatch.cpp, line 537)
**- tesseract build by UB Mannheim :** give numbers only
**- best and fast (ara and Arabic) :** not applicable because they used for LSTM only so it give numbers only 

@Shreeshrii  @Shreeshrii  sorry for the question, how to combine the new tessdata_Arabic_Numbers with the current one?
I copied ara_number.traineddata into tessdata dir then I use this command:
`tesseract -l ara_number+ara  image.tif out.txt`

but doesn't work
 @Fahad-Alsaidi You can't combine it with ara   Hello,
with the help from @Shreeshrii  I could create box-files for improving the existing eng.traineddata for my purpose.

I could use these box files to create a new eng.traineddata. It works and is much better for reading my text. However, when I want to use this new eng.traineddata to create box files for new images, it fails with

read_params_file: Can't open makebox

If I leave everything else identical, but switch to the original eng.traineddata, everything works, and the boxes are created.

### Expected Behavior:
I hope to run it with code method, such as [this](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/APIExample#basic-example), but not in commandline. If I can get all `.lib`, then I can build a new project and import to use it. But I get few `.lib` and most `.dll`...So how to use it by [this code method](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/APIExample#basic-example)? @zdenop Help pleaase [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tesseract-ocr/WrwwaZsm9CY), it is confused me some days  ### Environment

### Suggested Fix:

n/a Thanks for the update. Where can I get the 'latest traineddata' please? I got my data from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/
 Thanks for your reply. Just to be rigid. I was using tessdata, which supports oem mode 2 according to the wiki. >The latest traineddatas (tessdata_best and Tessdata_fast) do not support legacy tesseract engine, so --oem 0 and --oem 2 are not supported.

Although I wrote something similar to the above remark in the wiki, since commits [1] and [2]. `--oem 0 -l osd` works with 'best' and 'fast'. Not sure about --oem 2.

[1] https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best/commit/f1d12682c0f1afe61db892f4b2bfaa7909ad7a59 
[2] https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_fast/commit/139ff127aaee3cb0270fd29411fec75d610d728c
 Since the discussion is a bit side-tracked, I'm repeating the problem. The original comment is also updated.

Tesseract v4.00.00dev-692-gad5ee184 crashes when using `--oem 2` and `tesseract-ocr/tessdata`. The master branch (commit ad5ee18415bf59b9f5d1fd1806cb3aad3f18f381) runs good with your image @TerryZH 

However, tesseract should not crash
 @PaniniGelato Are you sure? As reported in the "Environment" section, this crash happens on the build from master commit ad5ee18. And I can still reproduce the crash. Did you use the same tessdata as described in my previous comment?  Hi,

i was using the newest versions of Tesseract to:
1- create LSTMFs
2- extract the LSTM from official traineddata
3- fine tune the LSTM according to the created LSTMFs
4- and then use the new traineddata for detection for better results
i was able to do all these steps and get the final traineddata but when i made detection using it i got an error, now the same case happened for Arabic and Japanese languages, and both i was able to get fine tuned traineddata and both failed in detection and gave the same error.
the commands i used as described [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00#lstmtraining-command-line)
and they were: 
**for creating LSTMFs**
training/tesstrain.sh --fonts_dir ~/.local/share/fonts --lang ara --linedata_only --noextract_font_properties --langdata_dir /home/ibr/latest_leptonica_4/langdata --tessdata_dir ./tessdata --output_dir /home/ibr/latest_leptonica_4/lstmf_ara_lep4

**extracted LSTM from [*here*](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best)

**tuned LSTM**
training/lstmtraining --model_output /home/ubuntu/lep_latest/ara_tune/tune_result/ara_tune \
  --continue_from /home/ubuntu/lep_latest/ara_tune/extracted/ara.lstm \
  --traineddata /home/ubuntu/lep_latest/ara_tune/original_traineddata/ara.traineddata \
  --train_listfile /home/ubuntu/lep_latest/ara_tune/ara.training_files.txt \
  --max_iterations 1200

**then unpacked official traineddata"official traineddata", replaced the tuned LSTM and combined everything together again **

**detection command**
tesseract ara2.png tuned -l ara --tessdata-dir ./tessdata --oem 1

and when i used the new tuned traineddata i got the error:
**index >= 0:Error:Assert failed:in file strngs.cpp, line 270
Segmentation fault (core dumped)** 

that happened when i tried fine tuning for Arabic and Japanese, twice, first time using the version:
**tesseract 4.00.00dev-690-g1b0379c   leptonica-1.74.4**
second time: **tesseract 4.00.00dev-691-gfb359fc  leptonica-1.74.4**

_keep im mind the same exact steps worked for previous versions of tesseract with leptonica 1.74.1_

**NOTE: detection worked fine with both versions for the official traineddata, meaning the error only occurred only after fine tuning**

Thanks in advance @Shreeshrii sorry, my mistake, i forgot to mention the command to create the LSTM from the check point which is:
_training/lstmtraining --model_output /home/ibr/latest_leptonica_4/ara_tune/tuned_lstm/ara.lstm --continue_from /home/ibr/latest_leptonica_4/ara_tune/results/ara_checkpoint --traineddata /home/ibr/latest_leptonica_4/ara_tune/original_traineddata/ara.traineddata --stop_training_

now, summarize everything,
**i create LSTMFs
extract LSTM from "best_traineddata"
tune LSTM according LSTMFs , in the command " --traineddata  best_traineddata"
create LSTM from checkpoint,  in the command " --traineddata  best_traineddata"
unpack  "best_traineddata"
replace LSTM with the new tuned one
combine everything**

"If you combine your fine-tune lstm with existing traineddata, the files
will not be in sync"
means in combination step i have to combine the new LSTM with the traineddata (starter traineddata) that is created when creating LSTMFs? 
i used "best_traineddata" in the command
_training/lstmtraining --model_output /home/ubuntu/lep_latest/ara_tune/tune_result/ara_tune 
--continue_from /home/ubuntu/lep_latest/ara_tune/extracted/ara.lstm 
--traineddata /home/ubuntu/lep_latest/ara_tune/original_traineddata/ara.traineddata 
--train_listfile /home/ubuntu/lep_latest/ara_tune/ara.training_files.txt 
--max_iterations 1200_
because if i pointed the --traineddata to the traineddata that is created with LSTMFs (starter traineddata)
i will get this message:
**Warning: LSTMTrainer deserialized an LSTMRecognizer!
Code range changed from 307 to 74!
Must supply the old traineddata for code conversion!
Failed to continue from: /home/ibr/latest_leptonica_4/ara_tune/extracted/ara.lstm
**
so since i got "Must supply the old traineddata" i used the trained data from "best_traineddata" the whole time, so what im missing?
Thanks
 the last two command actually worked and the traineddata i created is fine, i changed the first command to:

but this command was in "Fine Tuning for ± a few characters" section, in my case i want only to train the best_traineddata to a new fonts only without changing it so i assumed that i needed to go though fine tuning but it didn't work, so does this tuning command covers it? 

also another question, when i run the above command sometime i get the message **checkpoint failed to write checkpoint**  when that message shows following command fails:

what causing this message to show?

   Environment
I'm currently using tess-two version 8.0.0

Current Behavior:
I've tested my app at several images. Actually some of them worked very nice. But the issues starts when i take a picture from water metering which contains of numbers. The tesseract doesn't recognize it and instead of returning it as numbers, it gave me random words. Also, when i've done with the recognition, the memory didn't release. So, here's my question:
 
1. How can i release the memory after the recognition, and 
2. How can i improve the reading when the text is coming from the water metering?

Expected Behavior:
1. The memory will be released (so i can save up to 30 MB)
2. The OCR works on Water metering (at least up to 75%)
  Hello,
thanks for creating Tesseract 4.0.
I have problems creating the box files correctly (where should the tab go?) and get error messages from LSTM training.

There is a link for an example Box File in github, but it is not working any more (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Making-Box-Files---4.0 the links on this page are broken). Could you please publish a working *.box and a corresponding *.tif file for LSTM-Training?

Thanks & kind regards
Ernst @Shreeshrii  thank you very much for your files!!!! I used tesstrain.sh, but did not look into /tmp. Shame on me!
I could not get tesseract to create box files. I used

tesseract pol.ocrb.exp$i.tif pol.ocrb.exp$i batch.nochop makebox

as described, but it created a file called batch.nochop.box, but not the box file I expected (an old style box file would be OK)

Thanks,
Ernst @Shreeshrii thank you very much, that works for me also, that is great!!!
I do not know why the original calls (and I tried many) did not work. 
Kind regards
Ernst
  I want to fine tune with tesseract 4.0, and I just have  *.tif and *.box these two files,
I don't know how to generate *.lstmf files.

The wiki just says like this :
"The training data is provided via .lstmf files, which are serialized DocumentData They contain an image and the corresponding UTF8 text transcription, and can be generated from tif/box file pairs using Tesseract in a similar manner to the way .tr files were created for the old engine."

but it doesn't give the command to generate *.lstmf files.
So, I hope someone can help me, thanks very much ! @minly ,@CoCa520 , @Shreeshrii  @Shreeshrii, I have change the format box files according to the requirements of tesseract 4.0 ,  namely  I add a TAB at end of line and spaces to demarcate words for the  box files.

could you tell me how to use new format box/tiff pairs to generate *.lstmf files? Thanks!

 @Shreeshrii I changed the tesstrain.sh file and the command could copy the box/tiff pairs to the tmp training directory.
but there was another error as following:

it couldn't find 'eng.training_text' file, do you know what the 'eng.training_text' file is ?   

Additionally, the command 'text2image' is used to generate tiff images according to text and fonts, but we have already had box/tiff pairs, so  why it excute the command 'text2image' again ? 
Should I change other script files to resolve these problems?

I'm looking forward to your reply! Thanks a lot!









 @Shreeshrii, with your help, I generated the *.lstmf files! Thanks a lot! @Shreeshrii but now there is a new problem like this:

$ tesseract  eng.num.exp1.tif  eng.num.exp1  lstm.train
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v4.00.00alpha with Leptonica
Page 1
Warning. Invalid resolution 0 dpi. Using 70 instead.
Estimating resolution as 395
Empty page!!
Estimating resolution as 395
Empty page!!

there are several images will generate this error, do you know why it appears "Empty page!!"? Have you ever seen this kind of mistake? @Shreeshrii, the tif files are OK, and every tif image has the warning, for example:

$ tesseract eng.num.exp2.tif eng.num.exp2  lstm.train
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v4.00.00alpha with Leptonica
Page 1
Warning. Invalid resolution 0 dpi. Using 70 instead.
Estimating resolution as 369

Although it has the warning "Warning. Invalid resolution 0 dpi. Using 70 instead.", but after the command, the *.lstmf file could be generated correctly. So I guess the warning is not the truly problem.

And if a tif image has the "Empty page!!" error, the *.lstmf file would not be generated! So, I guess the problem is the "Empty page!!" error. But I don't know how to resolve the problem, hope  for your help , thanks!!! @Shreeshrii, I resolved the problem, I just add " -psm 7 nobatch" to the command like this:
$ tesseract eng.num.exp2.tif eng.num.exp2 -psm 7 nobatch lstm.train
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v4.00.00alpha with Leptonica
Page 1
Warning. Invalid resolution 0 dpi. Using 70 instead.

then, the error "Empty page!!" was disappeared. and finally the *.lstmf file was generated correctly! @Shreeshrii, You're welcome! the command is also right without "nobatch", just as the following:

$ tesseract eng.num.exp2.tif eng.num.exp2 -psm 7 lstm.train
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v4.00.00alpha with Leptonica
Page 1
Warning. Invalid resolution 0 dpi. Using 70 instead.

Dou you know the function of "nobatch" ? Have you used it in tesseract command ? 
Looking forward to your reply! Thanks! @Shreeshrii, OK, Thanks~^_^~ @Shreeshrii ,when I use Chinese character box/tiff pairs to fine tune,  there was a new problem as the following:

  Hi,

i have installed Tesseract: 4.00.00dev-690-g1b0379c with Leptonica:  1.74.4 and its working fine with the detection and all, but i have noticed that the performance is slower than before (comparing with 5 months ago tesseract, and leptonica 1.74.1).

in the past the time was around 4 or 5 seconds but lately its almost the double, that command that im using is the normal tesseract detection command which is: **tesseract image results -l lang--tessdata-dir ./tessdata --oem 1 ** , so am i missing something or is there some sort of a parameter that i should add after the updates to the tesseract or leptonica? or any other way to enhance  the performance speed? (for both single thread case or multi thread case)

Thank you > Slower Performance in Latest Tesseract

It's not clear if you're comparing a newer 4.00 to older 4.00 or 4.00 to 3.05. Also, do you use the newest traineddata for 4.0?  >or any other way to enhance the performance speed? (for both single thread case or multi thread case)

If you use multi-threading  try disabling OpenMP.
`OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1 tesseract in.png out --oem 1`

. @amitdo actually im comparing the latest (4.00.00dev-690-g1b0379c with Leptonica: 1.74.4 ) with the older version (4.00.00dev-549-g2b854e3 with leptonica 1.74.1)

@Shreeshrii  "tessdata_fast" is a news to me, i'm already using the official traineddata, but i dont know about this one, can you please give me the link to it?, also i already created a tuned LSTM, can i also combine it with the new tessdata_fast as well?

Thank you both The latest traineddata files are at https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best and https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_fast. But if you want to compare the performance of an older Tesseract 4.00 with the latest version, you will have to use the same traineddata for both, usually from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata. I'd disable multithreading for the test (set environment variable `OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1`). @Shreeshrii so i assume that if i fine tuned an LSTM file (made by older version tools) it won't combine with the new traineddate?  (for example a traineddata from: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best) 
also you mean by "data for your fine tuning" as the following?
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26926171/31716984-deb8cc32-b412-11e7-8fa7-f0c27132275d.png)
and the steps in the link that you have shared are to enhance accuracy, detection speed or both?

@stweil  the difference between "tessdata_best" and "tessdata_fast" is the accuracy vs speed? meaning "tessdata_fast" will be faster in detection but wont be accurate as "tessdata_best" ?

Thanks for the answers >  the difference between "tessdata_best" and "tessdata_fast" is the accuracy vs speed? meaning "tessdata_fast" will be faster in detection but wont be accurate as "tessdata_best" ?

`tessdata_fast` is faster than `tessdata_best`, yes.
`tessdata_best` is generally better, but not always. I also noticed cases where `tessdata_fast` is better. And there are even [cases](https://github.com/cisocrgroup/Resources/tree/master/ocrtestset/german/1841-DieGrenzboten) where the old Tesseract gives the best recognition rates of all current tessdata. if i wanted to fine tune using the tool "lstmtraining" while i'm using the latest Tesseract: (4.00.00dev-690-g1b0379c) can i use .lstmf files (which are generated by tesstrain.sh)file that are created by older Tesseract version, such as (4.00.00dev-549-g2b854e3) ?
meaning are lstmf files compatible between tesseract versions? thanks  Try re-building with `./configure --disable-graphics` ... or simply hide or remove `scrollview`, so it won't be run.  Hi, I'm trying to train a new tesseract chinese dictionary using jTessBoxEditor.

### Suggested Fix:
Add a config tag (`tessedit_rotation_override`?) that overrides the auto-rotation. It could be just 1/0 (never rotate input image if 1) or 0-3 (always rotate by this multiple of 90).

EDIT: I don't know why but turns out the [original image I posted](https://imgur.com/An1Fz1T.png) recognized fine, even though it was still rotated! The majority of my images output junk though, so I replaced the image with one that doesn't work. Oh, and added console output, out.txt and input image Upload the original image.

Write the full command you are using.

What's the output you are getting, including errors messages, if any? Ok, post updated.

I admit I posted this on the Google Groups forum first. But after a week and 2 bumps, no one could give me an answer. So I assumed nobody got around to implementing a way to override this stupid auto-rotation...

EDIT: @tfmorris suggested changing the PSM, but that does nothing:
![A bunch of identical TIFF files](https://imgur.com/Jp30THT.png) >@tfmorris suggested changing the PSM, but that does nothing:

Including the output **text**? You should have osd.traineddata to make some PSMs work properly.
 @amitdo PSM 12 is the only one that works (with the new image), but that's only if I run Tesseract with a config file I made:
```
load_system_dawg        F
load_freq_dawg          F
user_words_suffix       user-words
user_patterns_suffix    user-patterns
tessedit_char_whitelist NP0123456789:#
```
Plus, PSM 12 is described as "Sparse text *with OSD*". @tfmorris said it's the OSD that's doing the rotation.
And, if OSD is disabled for some of the PSMs, then why are ALL of the TIFF files rotated?

EDIT: "Works" as in the only output that isn't junk. @Shreeshrii Well, is there any way to disable that rotation and force tesseract to recognise the unrotated image? Well if I give Tesseract a horizontal image of the bottle, tessinput.tif is not rotated. Upon closer inspection of the images that do not OCR correctly, **it looks like the binarization algorithm is the real culprit here**. Tesseract doesn't seem to care about the rotation of the text. Anyway, I don't think this is a problem with Tesseract itself so I'm closing this Issue. Some weird **** is going on here. It may be Leptonica, the `tessedit_write_images` code, or even Ubuntu that is rotating the image after Tesseract spits it out.

If I find anything I'm going to post in [this Google Groups thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tesseract-ocr/GAbzk9BTGDE). It is Leptonica that is causing this to happen. Submitting an issue on there rn.

Not reopening this since there is nothing the Tesseract devs can do here, this is a Leptonica issue.  I am getting compile errors when compiling my bindings with `clang++ -std=gnu++11` (MacOS 12.13). This fixes it for me. See pull request #1082 and other pull requests and issues which address the same problem.  I must confess to not being a CMake expert, but I found [this mailing list post](https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake-developers/2016-May/028364.html) that seems to confirm my suspicion that the `FindPkgConfig` module doesn't fix up the library search path to allow linking against the libraries it has found.

N.B.: I also needed https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/pull/282 to get this compiling on macOS. In general, unless you compile on Windows with MSVC, you should use autotools to build Leptonica and Tesseract.

 @Shreeshrii  thanks for you reply
1.commit id is :  9c2fa0d
2.I've  tried  --max_iteration 3000 before,  the result is not good, so I use --target_error_rate 0.01 instead
3.I use the default training text: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/blob/master/chi_sim/chi_sim.training_text    and only one font is needed
4.I'm trying to make tesseract recognize a particular type of Chinese font "STXihei" better. It seems that it's a typical scenario for using fine tune(new-font-style). Should I try to replace a layer?  ### Environment

### Suggested Fix:

 What about other PSMs? 

>Ces data were downloaded from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/raw/4.00/ces.traineddata

There are newer traineddata files available.
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Data-Files#updated-data-files-for-version-400-september-15-2017 I cannot test it right now but I think that it worked ok when psm was not specified. I'll try to use the new data too, thanks. I've checked and new traineddata solved this issue.
As for what psm modes, the segfault appeared for modes 7, 8, 11 and 12 (also for 14- but those are probably not valid anyway).
I'm not sure wheter to close this issue right away, but my problem is now solved. Thank You. I've uploaded one that didn't work in the original post. One that works can be seen here:
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1188728/31050762-53a1d99c-a655-11e7-93b3-75de57a4bf07.png) . Otherwise it worked fine across a few thousand images, with only a single exception where it failed with the segfault mentioned above.

Oem was not set (as can be seen it examples above), so the default value.
 I suggest to close this issue since it was solved with an updated traineddata.  @zdenop

### Current Behavior:
Text embedded using `PdfRenderer` are encoded using `UTF_16BE` but do not contain BOM bytes. Only text string that is encoded correctly is in `/Title` metadata.

### Expected Behavior:
According to [PDF reference](http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) all `text string` objects should be encoded in `PdfDocEncoding` or `UTF_16BE` with a leading `byte-order marker` (FEFF).
### Suggested Fix:
 CC: @jbreiden  See chapter 3.8.1 in the PDF reference. Hi @jbreiden I came across this while trying to extract text from PDFs in a generic way. I am not aware of any incompatibilities with PDF renderer but without BOM it is incompatible with multiple PDF parsers (e.g. `pdfminer`, `pdfrw`). From PDF reference chapter 3.8.1:

> For text strings encoded in Unicode, the first two bytes must be 254 followed by 255. These two bytes represent the Unicode byte order marker, U+FEFF, indicating
that the string is encoded in the UTF-16BE (big-endian) encoding scheme
specified in the Unicode standard.  Evince has no problem with the BOM.

pdf.js - same effect as pdfium. If both Adobe Reader and PDFium can't render the "with BOM" version correctly, I see no point in keeping this issue open.  Maybe 'max_pages' should be a parameter to the shell script, so end users can change it easily.    Environment

 I try to re-install tesseract.  but now I got error with the same [ISSUE#1114](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1114) I try change` LINE 220 `in  `normstrngs.cpp`  but it doesn't fix.

```
 So your original issue was solved.

Don't mix two different issues in one report. Please close this issue. Okay, Let me summary this issue for anyone that get error the same with me. 
If you got this error about `Non-existent flag` 
**Re-install tesseract**  and don't forget to
```
sudo ldconfig
make training
sudo make training-install
```
then if you get  error about `Invalid Unicode codepoint: ` try to change code in `normstrng.cpp`
**See this issue.**
 [Issue1114]( https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1114) 
then run this again 
```
make run
make training
sudo make training-install

```
And the last, I got error about `TESSDATA_PREFIX `
**I fix by read this Issue** 
[Issue221](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/221)

Thank you everyone to help me fix this. I am very appreciate it.
  >First It use function NormalizeCleanAndSegmentUTF8() **to convert the string to UTF-8 encoding**

The first thing it does is calling NormalizeUTF8ToUTF32().
 Maybe you have two tesseracts in your system. one of them is older version than the other. Strangely, tesseract parses 'radical-stroke.txt' for every language.
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/a2a72d7ca78a3bb3798a02a2ba5188e255c2a0f7/ccutil/unicharcompress.cpp#L98 >I checked that I have only one version.

How?

Try this:
`sudo find / -type f -name "libtesseract.so*"`

I wonder why you put the git repo on `/root`. https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/ https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/VGSLSpecs

``` Thank you @Shreeshrii  @yoyoshuang  where can i  find training material  for Chinese  I have downloaded that latest 4.0 release, new leptonica and tried to buid it under MSVC 2017, unicode project. After several hours of I almost succeded in building the project but one problem is still remaining unresolved, I don't know how to fix it.

network.cpp (line 209):
`network = new Convolve(stub.name_, stub.ni_, 0, 0);`

MSVC gives the linker error:
 error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol "public: __thiscall tesseract::Convolve::Convolve(class STRING const &,int,int,int)" (??0Convolve@tesseract@@QAE@ABVSTRING@@HHH@Z)

If this line is commented, project is built normally without errors.
convolve,cpp is included and Convolve::Convolve is definetely presented.
Weird thing that there is another file - networkbuilder.cpp where
one can see almost the same code, and it works fine:
```
  Convolve* convolve =
      new Convolve("Convolve", input_shape.depth(), x / 2, y / 2);

```
But after being copied to network.cpp it give the same link error.
I spent an hour trying to fix but failed.
What if I just comment this line? When it is used? Commenting that line is not a good idea.

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f6xx1b1z.aspx

CC: @egorpugin  No, never heard of it. MSVC project, mostly assembled manually. The previos versions 3.02, 3.04, were assembled and compiled normally. 
First I thought that maybe it's leptonica's "convolve.c" that has collisions with lstm's "convolve.cpp" module and renamed the "convolve.c" to "convolve2.c" with no effect. cppan --build pvt.cppan.demo.google.tesseract.tesseract-master.
gives an error
boost::filesystem::path codecvt to wstring: error WIndows 10, MSVC 2017 community Account to where? I have no account in Russian letters, though I am Russian Oh I see, I changed it to another user, now cppan goes further but no enough "There errors during test start". Log files are empty I use the latest MSVC, is this enough for the latest cmake?
I solved the problem just by copied the source code from convolve.cpp (it's very small) to network.cpp and everything went fine. When I was building 3.02 and 3.04 I didn't know about cppan, so i just manually added all required libraries and everything went fine. Today I found that there is 3.05 version, I downloaded it, added libs and evrything was compiled and linked perfectly as always, it took me around 15 minutes. Obviously I like that way and prefer to use it again with 4.0 version. 
As per my PC, I didn' do to it something unusual, OS  was installed a month ago, MSVC 2017, the tesseract code was not changed, As I said, I resolved the problem, so no need to do anything with the code, perhaps you are right and the problem is with my machine Thank you for your efforts!
Ok, Egor, I will try to use cppan on a new virtual machine with Win10, pure MSVC and a proper Administrator. After creating MSVC project again more accurately (adding files one by one) I succeeded in  building MSVC project without changing the source code. Nevertheless one weird thing I made - I had to add convolve.cpp in the main project. Now it contains two files - main.cpp (my own source code) and convolve.cpp (other dependencies are through lib files). 
MSVC also gives a warning  while linking:
x64\Release\convolve.obj : warning LNK4042: object specified more than once; extras ignored
I don't know what it means  You have two options:
1. Put the deu.trainwddata directly under your tessdata dir.
2. Put the tessdata_best dir under your tessdata dir, and use -l tessdata_best/deu >Put the tessdata_best dir under your tessdata dir, and use -l tessdata_best/deu

A variant of that option:
Rename the tessdata_best dir, for example to 'best',  put it under your tessdata dir, and use -l best/deu Tesseract has this parameter:
 
`m_data_sub_dir `- Directory for data files

It's not new.

The default value for that parameter is `tessdata/`

>I simply replaced (exchanged) my existing .../tessdata with the the new .../tessdata_best. Tesseract 

In that case another option is to put this line in a text file:
`m_data_sub_dir tessdata_best/`
and use it as config file for tesseract.
  You did not copy the command which was used to run the compiler from your build protocol. It should look like this:

Check whether yours looks different, especially whether `-DUSE_STD_NAMESPACE` is missing. That would explain the build failure. I also use Debian 9, same libtiff5-dev, and I do not have `/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/4/tessdata/`. I'd examine it with `ls -l` (is it old) and `dpkg -S` (where does it belong to) and move it out of the way. @Wikinaut, did you solve the issue?  Before you submit an issue, please review [the guidelines for this repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please report an issue only for a BUG, not for asking questions.

Note that it will be much easier for us to fix the issue if a test case that
reproduces the problem is provided. Ideally this test case should not have any
external dependencies. Provide a copy of the image or link to files for the test case.

result = string_at(ocr_r)
```

### Expected Behavior:

Instead of text returned only for the last page, the text should be returned for all pages. 

### Suggested Fix:

Interestingly this works when using the command line `tesseract` command. So perhaps there is already a fix for the command line.  Please report this issue in the repo of the python binding.  @zdenop  this happens in 3.05.01 as well. I'm wondering whether calling `TessBaseAPIProcessPages ` is the correct way to get ALL text from multi page pdfs?  OR whether there is another recommended way

@amitdo I did not see python binding repo under tesseract. Can you please link me to the one you are referring to? Please note i'm using `ctypes` to call the acutal tesseract API and not the python wrapper for tesseract.  >I did not see python binding repo under tesseract.

I thought that you are using a 3rd party python binding.

 >Interestingly this works when using the command line tesseract command. So perhaps there is already a fix for the command line

The command line uses the C++ API. @amitdo Sorry for the confusion, but I am not. I am referring to the actual tesseract capi. The capi can be called from python as shown in this example https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/a75ab450a8cc9a2b69cf05f5c4f7a39bc44cbacc/contrib/tesseract-c_api-demo.py#L72 Note that the linked example is a bit out of date. An actual example that works is https://stackoverflow.com/a/36876584/44286

However, the issue still remains of how to call capi to get all the text from multi page TIFF instead of text from only the last page > text = tesseract.TessBaseAPIGetUTF8Text(api)

This method returns text for one page only. The command line tool does not **directly** call this method.

You'll have to look in api/tesseractmain.cpp and mimic it to get things right.

Anyway, it's not an issue (bug) in tesseract command line or API.  Thanks. I've posted this question on the user-forums here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tesseract-ocr/AL9LzrHa97k

I will continue to dig into `tesseractmain.cpp` to see if something points out  There is no direct way to get the text in all pages with ProcessPages.

if you give it a pointer to TessResultRenderer, the text is written to a file or stdout.  Recently the first regression tests were added to the Tesseract sources, and hopefully more will be added in the future. I expect that many of those tests will require images, maybe also related text and other files. Typically the images are large (much larger than source code files),  and most image formats are already compressed, so Git cannot compress them further. This is bad for the git repository size, but also for the size of the working directory or of release tarballs.

Currently 8 of the 10 largest files are test related:

    1444515 ccutil/universalambigs.cpp
     708120 testing/DuTillet1004Pg2LG.jpg
     444141 testing/hebtypo.jpg
     401757 testdata/chi_tra.unicharset
     399613 testing/hebrew-nikud-genesis-1-2.png
     378914 testdata/kan.unicharset
     359497 ccutil/tesscallback.h
     327214 testdata/chi_sim.unicharset
     239201 testdata/jpn.unicharset
     221628 testdata/mar.unicharset

We should avoid adding more such files. I suggest to create a new repository called `tesstest`,  `testdata`, `tesseract_testdata` or any other name for all test related data and move the existing test data to that repository. The `tesseract` repository can then include that new repository as a git submodule which is only needed when running tests (so most people won't need it).

OpenJPEG is an example of another Open Source project with a similar split of [source code](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg) and [test data](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg-data). They do not use a git submodule, but have a configure option to choose the location of the test data. ... or more. Test images use a lot of disk space.  This change does not look like the right solution for an existing problem. I'm afraid it should be reverted.  ------------------------

### Current Behavior:
I've downloaded and compiled latest tesseract source file from git repository but when i run tesseract engine with mode --oem 1, --psm 0 or 1 it can't load osd.traineddata. My osd.traineddata file is downloaded from tessdata_best. I tried with older osd.traineddata file from tessdata directory it works fine. I've cloned tessdata_best from repo and checked any download error but it was okay. 
installed tesseract shown below.
![tesseract](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30248220/30473888-72f05e40-9a34-11e7-9518-de668fd6c024.png)

I can load and work well with osd.traineddata from tessdata which is created about 3 yrs ago and include following files 
![old](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30248220/30474105-1effef34-9a35-11e7-9118-d89403fca397.png)
 
the one tesseract fails at loading includes lstm files which is shown below.
![new](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30248220/30474201-74a6bbfc-9a35-11e7-82b5-09e97706263d.png)

![osdfailed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30248220/30474253-98bbc1cc-9a35-11e7-8b04-29b2477bd070.png)
here i am using lstm mode of engine so it should load osd.traineddata successfully but it shows failure message. It can load other language's lstm traineddata files and i can get result of text recognition despite of giving 'failed loading language osd' message but i can't feel any difference using best osd so it is not loading best osd.traineddata at all. 

So i guess it is bug related to tesseract engine or osd.traineddata file which is in tessdata_best.  facing same issue for urd.tessdata from tessdata_best  Should `tessdata_best` and `tessdata_fast` be Git submodules of `tessdata` to support language options like `-l eng` (old model), `-l best/eng` (best LSTM model) or `-l fast/eng` (fast LSTM model)? Then only a single `tessdata` directory is needed for installations, and it would be easier to document the relationship between all three repositories (think of new versions). Locally trained models could easily be added in additional subdirectories and used like `-l local/eng` or `-l user/eng`. "config file" is a good keyword:

Will Tesseract continue to use the same configuration files for standard, fast and best traineddata? Then having a single `tessdata` directory would be better. Handling of "sublanguages" which are invoked could be fixed in the code or in the config files.

If Tesseract needs different configuration files for standard, fast and best traineddata, separate `tessdata` directories will be required.
 I wonder whether the current approach with "best" and "fast" traineddata is reasonable: both contain basically the same data, only the LSTM model in the traineddata files differs. Some numbers for `best/Latin.traineddata`:

    # Component size / MiB
    12      Latin.lstm
    1       Latin.lstm-number-dawg
    1       Latin.lstm-punc-dawg
    1       Latin.lstm-recoder
    1       Latin.lstm-unicharset
    85      Latin.lstm-word-dawg
    1       Latin.version
    97      total

`fast/Latin.traineddata` is identical with one exception:

    # Component size / MiB
    1       Latin.lstm

So it would also be possible to modify Tesseract to get both kinds of `Latin.lstm` from the same traineddata file (using a new component name like `Latin.lstm-fast`) and select the desired one with a new command line option. That would avoid the duplication of the other data and simplify the handling while increasing the size of the traineddata only by a small amount.

    97      best/Latin.traineddata
    86      fast/Latin.traineddata

A combined traineddata file with best and fast model included could be zipped and would be much smaller then:

    51      best/Latin.zip
 >Just quoting Ray about 'best' and 'fast':

>2 parallel sets of tessdata. "best" and "fast". "Fast" will exceed the speed of legacy Tesseract in real time, provided you have the required parallelism components, and in total CPU only slightly slower for English. Way faster for most non-latin languages, while being <5% worse than "best" Only "best" will be retrainable, as "fast" will be integer.
 I now did a complete comparison of the extracted "best" and "fast" traineddata files. Besides the `lstm` and `version` parts, they are identical, but "best" includes these additional files:

    ara.config
    ben.config
    chi_sim.config
    chi_sim_vert.config
    chi_tra.config
    chi_tra_vert.config
    deu.config
    ell.config
    hin.config
    ita.config
    jpn.config
    jpn_vert.config
    kan.config
    kor.config
    mal.config
    mar.config
    nep.config
    srp.config
    tam.config
    tel.config
    tha.config
    vie.config

It's not clear why these parts exist in "best", and already the first one `ara.config` looks wrong:

    # We do not yet have Tesseract for Arabic, so use OEM_CUBE_ONLY
    # (see OcrEngineMode enum in third_party/tesseract/ccmain/tesseractclass.h).
    tessedit_ocr_engine_mode        1
    [...]

 >\# We do not yet have Tesseract for Arabic, so use OEM_CUBE_ONLY
\# (see OcrEngineMode enum in third_party/tesseract/ccmain/tesseractclass.h).

This comment should be updated

>tessedit_ocr_engine_mode        1

This is still ok for ara. Shouldn't all fast and best traineddatas have this:

>tessedit_ocr_engine_mode 1

in their config? Tesseract chooses the correct mode automatically.

There are 161 tessdata files in `tessdata_best`, but only 28 of them contain a config part.
`deu.traineddata` loads `frk.traineddata`. That looks wrong for me. Maybe other config files should not be there, too.

 >Tesseract chooses the correct mode automatically.

Yeah, I know, but oem 1 is more explicit.  My tesseract application always downloads eng.traineddata.gz file from internet. I want to make it offilne. How it;s possible?

Edit 2:
Alright... it's a dash in tessdata-dir not an underscore .. sorryy :))  I must admit that I never used that Makefile target. Do we need it at all? If we offer a target which
downloads eng.traineddata, I wonder whether it would be better to get one which supports both the old and the new recognizer (only as long as both are supported, of course).

A side notice:

Currently Tesseract requires eng.traineddata even if someone only wants to get the Tesseract version or the list of available languages. I don't think that this is satisfying.

Tesseract functions which are unrelated to eng.traineddata should work without it. Getting the `traineddata` files needs an internet connection. A simple `make` should work without internet. But a `make install` should result in a working installation, so for that case it would be good to include your code. @jbreiden, how do you build the Debian packages with `traineddata` then? Is there a "standard" Makefile target to get files needed for the installation from the internet? Related: would it make sense to add the Debian rules to the Tesseract repository?
Maybe rules for other distributions (e.g. I have files for the Windows installer), too? It's similar for Debian: https://packages.debian.org/stretch/tesseract-ocr.

The [experimental version](https://packages.debian.org/experimental/tesseract-ocr) switches to 4.0 and adds a non-existing package `tesseract-ocr-eng-ltsm`. Deleted comment (wrong place) Are you referring to my [other comment](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1131#issuecomment-329764356) about "best" and "fast"? >Are you referring to my other comment about "best" and "fast"?

Sorry, I chose the wrong tab in the browser to paste the quote :-) >  Upcoming: /usr/share/tesseract-ocr/4.00/tessdata/

@jbreiden, I still hope that we'll get semantic versioning for Tesseract. Therefore I suggest to use a different name `/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/4/tessdata/`, `/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/4.0/tessdata/` or even `/usr/share/tesseract4/tessdata/` (do you need the "-ocr" in the package names, or can it be dropped?).  The test failed for out-of-tree builds with autotools because it could not find the required files.
It also failed when the "en_US.UTF-8" locale was missing.

Now it passes. This completes my previous PR #1123.  for example

More examples with bad OCR with various combinations of these two settings below. Summary: lstm_use_matrix 0 is universally better than 1, textord_old_baselines 0 is better than 1 most of the time but can throw away entire lines.

Setting both "lstm_use_matrix 0" and "textord_old_baselines 0" seems to help in general, but doesn't fix the problem all the time Example:

(the above double fullwidth spaces are substitutes for the newlines) What's the content of the official best traineddata's config file? AFAIK, the stuff under https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/tree/master/best is all there is for the "best" traineddata. Yes, but there's a way to unpack the traineddata and see its individual files.  [jpn.config.txt](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/1291681/jpn.config.txt)

 @KevinZhuYF, please respond to @Shreeshrii's question.
  Did you use the updated shell scripts or your own (older) modified scripts? I didn't try the latest commits yet, but  saw that there where some changes in the shell script, and thus posted my above comment...   I am really confused. It seems that even finetunning commands does not work anymore: 
I used these commands and I put the Arabic.traineddata from the best folder in tessdata directory:

training/tesstrain.sh \ 
  --fonts_dir /usr/share/fonts \
  --training_text ./langdata/ara/ara.training_text \
  --langdata_dir ./langdata \
  --tessdata_dir ./tessdata \
  --lang ara  \
  --linedata_only \
  --noextract_font_properties \
  --exposures "0"    \
  --output_dir ~/tesstutorial/aratrain
then I uesd these:

mkdir -p ~/tesstutorial/aratuned_from_ara

combine_tessdata -e ./tessdata/Arabic.traineddata \
  ~/tesstutorial/aratuned_from_ara/ara.lstm

lstmtraining --model_output ~/tesstutorial/aratuned_from_ara/aratuned \
  --continue_from ~/tesstutorial/aratuned_from_ara/ara.lstm \
  --traineddata ~/tesstutorial/aratrain/ara/ara.traineddata \
  --train_listfile ~/tesstutorial/aratrain/ara.training_files.txt \
  --target_error_rate 0.01

and I got this error:
Loaded file /home/fanasa/tesstutorial/aratuned_from_ara/ara.lstm, unpacking...
Warning: LSTMTrainer deserialized an LSTMRecognizer!
Code range changed from 307 to 95!!

while these commands worked before.  If you need the training part, use 147a1a50b766. It seems one or more of the latest commits from Ray broke the training. actully I need the changes to tessdata. because it solved the problem of
لا. under this condition can I use this 147a1a5
<https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/147a1a50b766b94c3f2ffa9b8bdccfacf2d42ff0>

 @Shreeshrii 
yes . it seems that there was no problem with using training/tesstrain.sh.
 @Shreeshrii 
thanks. I think your solution is working the finetuning process was finished. I tested the result model. the problem of لا which was solved in Arabic.traineddata, again appeared in my finetuned model. 
@Shreeshrii do you have any idea why this is happening?
 @theraysmith the Arabic.traineddata can not be used in finetuning? @theraysmith I think the changes which made the Arabic.traineddata recognize لا correctly, are not applied to the source code. would you please apply these changes
 @Shreeshrii now I am facing this problem|:

IsValidCodepoint(ch):Error:Assert failed:in file ../../training/normstrngs.cpp, line 225
ERROR: /tmp/tmp.UFLtOD70jF/ara/ara.unicharset does not exist or is not readable

could you solve this? It was merged now. But I am confused. Why does this code change fix something? The new code no longer matches the comment ("In the range [0, 0xD800) or [0xE000, 0x10FFFF]"). And `0xffffffd9` does not look like a valid Unicode codepoint. @Shreeshrii but your PR removed my error. do I have to change it back.
yesterday I updated my tesseract. Do I have to use a newer version?

Why a static_cast is needed here, and only for the first comparison to 'ch'? That's a trick: `return (ch >= 0 && ch < 0xD800) || (ch >= 0xE000 && ch <= 0x10FFFF)`would also implement the test for a valid code point. The static cast of the signed `ch` to an unsigned value saves the `ch >= 0` test. 

A static cast to a negative value changes nothing and could be omitted as well. Maybe we should use the explicit code without any casts and leave optimisations to the compiler.
     bool IsWhitespace(const char32 ch) {
    //  ASSERT_HOST_MSG(IsValidCodepoint(ch), "Invalid Unicode codepoint: 0x%x\n",
    //                  ch);
        if (!IsValidCodepoint(ch)) {
            tprintf("Invalid Unicode codepoint: %d = 0x%x\n", ch, ch);
        }
        return u_isUWhiteSpace(static_cast<UChar32>(ch));
    }
 @Shreeshrii, this pull request might fix it: https://github.com/ivanzz1001/tesseract/pull/1. It still has to be requested for the [tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) repository Try this and report (not tested):

`if (normed.empty() || IsUTF8Whitespace(normed[0])) continue;`

-->

`if (normed.empty() || IsUTF8Whitespace(normed.c_str())) continue;` @ivanzz1001 sent a PR which includes his fix and my above fix: #1153
 No error messages or asserts does not necessarily mean that the new code works. See [my comment](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/pull/1153#discussion_r140649990) for the pull request. @Shreeshrii
Now, can I train a new model for Arabic and Farsi using "replacing a few
layers"?
I want to replace the last layer and these are the commands I'm going to
use for farsi (I am using about 250 lines 13 fonts most of them are new)

 I changed line 53 of unicharset_extractor.cpp to:

unfortunately, the error still exists

 It was fixed recently (see commit fb359fc981f048328bee206fbcf69f2218ae1ee0). @Shreeshrii, does the latest version work for you, or are there issues left?  Otherwise we abort with the message `DotProductAVX can't be used on Android`. Tested on macOS Sierra 10.12.6 `Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.42)` and Alpine Linux 3.3 `gcc (Alpine 5.3.0) 5.3.0`.

I want to re-train tesseract for a specific language. It contains `numbers` and `English letters`.
like:

Yes, the new trained data is *available*.

Yep, i will try it.

 I would suggest you use OpenCV to detect the characters and use --PSM (character) only for the OCR. 

I archive great improve by using this additional step. If you feed the whole page in, as someone indicated above, it cannot generate the correct OCR results.  @hoangtocdo90 zmwang is probably talking about the `psm_single_char` option, `--psm 10`.  I tried compiling by following the instruction on https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling.

When I run the command cmake ..
it gave me an error message: cppan command '0' not found, hence the solution (.sln) file was not created.

 hebtypo.jpg seems to be taken from a copyrighted book.  hi,

i try my first steps on tesseract. i have installed in on my macbook and a windows 7 32 bit machine via virtualbox. 

i want to recognize adresses from envelopes. so i made a picture (jpg and tif) and started the progress. on mac everything works fine - recognizing is very great and in the output file the adress is as expected. on windows the output file is in a single line.

e.g.

input:
name name
street number
code city

output mac is as input

output on windows:
name namestreet numbercode city

i tried all -psm modes with no effect i wanted. works. strange - but it works. thanks

### Environment

* **Tesseract Version**: Tesseract 4.00
* **Platform**:  Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-129-generic x86_64) 

When I use the tutorial [https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00#fine-tuning-for-%C2%B1-a-few-characters] to fine tune the model
my command is 
```
training/tesstrain.sh  \
   --fonts_dir /usr/share/fonts \
  --lang chi_sim  \
  --linedata_only \
  --noextract_font_properties \
  --exposures "0"    \
  --langdata_dir ../langdata \
  --tessdata_dir /home/hs/tessdata/tessdata  \
  --output_dir ../tesstutorial/chi_sim
```
I found that it print out as below in "Phase I: Generating training images":

` training/text2image --fontconfig_tmpdir=/tmp/font_tmp.k2AbBhbk8p --fonts_dir=/usr/share/fonts --strip_unrenderable_words --leading=32 --char_spacing=0.0 --exposure=0 --outputbase=/tmp/tmp.4UpMo5R9vj/chi_sim/chi_sim.KaiTi_Normal.exp0 --max_pages=3 --font=KaiTi Normal --text=../langdata/chi_sim/chi_sim.training_text`

Notice that **--max_pages=3**, so I checked the ".tif" files, finding that the pages number is 3.
 
To my own work, I need more pages for the "tif/box" files, so I try to change the parameter “--max_pages” （ie, --max_pages=6）

Instead of run the command above, I try to finish its work step by step. But when I did the "Phase E: Generating lstmf files " there comes out a error which I can't solved:

```
root@super-desk:~/tesseract# api/tesseract /home/hs/tmp/chi_sim.AR_PL_UKai_CN.exp0.tif /home/hs/tmp/chi_sim.AR_PL_UKai_CN.exp0 lstm.train ../langdata/chi_sim/chi_sim.config
read_params_file: Can't open lstm.train
```

I don't know where is the " lstm.train", how can I find it?

Can anyone help me?





 Thank you @Shreeshrii ~  hi i am new on using tesseract
i am using OpenCV text module calling tesseract400.dll

in release mode i am getting "Empty page!!" messages so i did this fix in my local.
it is up to you deciding if it is useful for public.

thank you  Before you submit an issue, please review [the guidelines for this repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please report an issue only for a BUG, not for asking questions.

Note that it will be much easier for us to fix the issue if a test case that
reproduces the problem is provided. Ideally this test case should not have any
external dependencies. Provide a copy of the image or link to files for the test case.

### Expected Behavior:

### Suggested Fix:
  I built tesseact out of 4.00.00dev. It seems like it has trouble directly reading stdin from ghostscript. Check out the following...

    gs -q -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=tiffg4 -sOutputFile=- demo.pdf -c quit | bin/tesseract stdin demo.ocr -oem 4

then it gives this error:

     Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v4.00.00alpha with Leptonica
     TIFFFillStrip: Invalid strip byte count 0, strip 0.
     Error in pixReadFromTiffStream: line read fail

However if I generate the image first using ghostscript, then pipe the image to the stdin of tesseract, then it works. 

    gs -q -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=tiffg4 -sOutputFile=- demo.pdf -c quit > demo.tif
    cat demo.tif | bin/tesseract stdin demo.ocr -oem 4

 I don't understand what could cause this. Does one or both of the following commands work?

    gs -q -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=tiffg4 -sOutputFile=- demo.pdf -c quit | dd | bin/tesseract stdin demo.ocr -oem 4
    gs -q -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=tiffg4 -sOutputFile=- demo.pdf -c quit | dd bs=4096 | bin/tesseract stdin demo.ocr -oem 4

If yes, the problem could be caused by partial reads in Tesseract (less bytes read than requested). @stweil 

both failed

``` The interesting part of the diff is expected earlier. Calls with file handle 0 (STDIN) are especially interesting. Can you upload both strace outputs?  Empty lines in text output are needed to separate paragraphs,
but there should not be an empty line at the end of the text.

 https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues?q=std+string+is:closed @zdenop my mistake : not to read closed issue. thanks you very much   The tests require installation of GoogleTest of course. How should we handle the case of missing GoogleTest when a user calls `make check`? Get GoogleTest automatically? Show some help text? Or accept a failure (current status)? GoogleTest is now a directory in our repo (sub repo). > GoogleTest is now a directory in our repo (sub repo).

Yes, but the submodule `googletest` is not fetched automatically. Therefore I'd prefer that `make check` should at least report the missing submodule and show a help text how to fetch it. The current error message for that case might be confusing for users.  prevents "Empty page!!" messages hi i am new on using tesseract
i am using OpenCV text module calling tesseract305.dll

in release mode i am getting "Empty page!!" messages so i did this fix in my local.
it is up to you deciding if it is useful for public.

2 error on build
1. in validator.cpp,
error c2039: back_inserter is not member of std and etc...
i solve it adding #include <iterator> in validator.cpp but i'm not sure it's enough.( build is working)

2. text2image project
if I build solution with text2image in Training Tools,
there are so many error
one of them:
variable "CPPAN_SYMBOL_IMPORT" is not name...blahblah <- i'm not english user 
in many header file on text2image

so i build solution excluding text2image. and it wokr. but i hope i can build it together

 Thank you for re-comment. I did it at that time but it's not working.
maybe my environment is something wrong.. retry after time.

  The option `--disable-openmp` works for Windows with Mingw-w64, too. You don't need it neither for Linux nor for Windows, because it is possible to tell OpenMP not to create any threads:

    export OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1
    tesseract ...

or

    OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1 tesseract ...

 Try cutting the non-text areas with gimp and retest. Only the red areas are processed by tesseract, they are written to separate png-files. (I've uploaded the separate files as well and the resulting output-files) The interesting thing is, two similar frames were processed without problems:

 So it does recognize them, but still decides to drop them... 'Pöllan' is dropped because it's not in the dictionary and the 'ö' has low certainty.
'/NORDKOREA' is dropped because it's not in the dictionary and has low space certainty.
 'USA' shares the same low space certainty with '/NORDKOREA' but escapes from punishment because it's in the dictionary. After applying my [patch](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/681#issuecomment-322433100):
'/NORDKOREA' ('USA /NORDKOREA')
and
'Pöllan'

are recognized in the final text output.

All other words are recognized the same as before. Thank you to both of you, your help is much appreciated! I'm on holiday till end of next week then I'll try to compile a windows version with the changes you suggested and test it. >I'll try to compile a windows version with the changes you suggested and test it.

 After I get latest sourses v4 lstmtraining started work but I almost always got errors like 
Encoding of string failed!
Can't encode transcription:
Even if I directly set path to unicharset file. yes. i have 44 new character and I wont to extend english traineddata. Attached my unicharset file. How can I aviod this encoding issues?

 
[eng.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/1222246/eng.zip)
 The command should use tprintf() with a meaningful message and exit(), not assert.  ### Environment

* **Tesseract Version**: tesseract 4.00.00alpha<!-- compulsory. you must provide your version -->
* **Commit Number**: 8e55e52be749b3faccca8ae41abdc0e3d3c7f887<!-- optional. if known - specify commit used, if built from source -->
* **Platform**: Ubuntu 16.04.1<!-- either `uname -a` output, or if Windows, version and 32-bit or 64-bit -->

### Current Behavior:
Method WordFontAttributes returns null if using tesseract 4.00.00alpha with 4.00 tessdata, but it returns font name if using tesseract 4.00.00alpha with 3.04.00 tessdata. The test image link is [eurotext.tif](https://github.com/sirfz/tesserocr/blob/master/tests/eurotext.tif)
I first met this problem when I use tesserocr [tesserocr#68] .(https://github.com/sirfz/tesserocr/issues/68)
### Expected Behavior:
With method WordFontAttributes we can get correct font attributes of recognized words.

 The new LSTM engine does not support this feature and probably won't support it any time soon. Is there an alternative way to get font sizing etc? Do you mean that just this method won't be supported, or the feature in general?  >Is there an alternative way to get font sizing etc?

You can still use --oem 0 with traineddata from here: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata.
Note that the traineddata in the 'best' folder won't work with --oem 0.
 >Do you mean that just this method won't be supported, or the feature in general?

I have reasons to believe that the new LSTM engine is unlikely to have a feature that includes font identification (name and properties like is_bold) in the near future.

Important note: I'm a contributer from the community, and the main developer not always shares all his plans for upcoming release(s) with the community. Thanks for the reply! It looks like the old ocr engine is going to be removed, though (issue #707)... And does using `OcrEngineMode 0` mean the behaviour is the same as v3?

What I'm getting to is:
1. I need to be able to extract font size information (font names aren't so useful) - is there any way at all of doing so with LSTM/v4?
2. If I use `OcrEngineMode 0` to be able to get this info, will that be removed from v4 at a later date?
3. Is there any advantage to using v4 with `OcrEngineMode 0` vs v3.05?

Thanks again for the help! >It looks like the old ocr engine is going to be removed, though (issue #707)... 

It's not known when exactly it will be removed. Until then you can still use it.

>And does using OcrEngineMode 0 mean the behaviour is the same as v3?

It's basically the same as 3.05.01.

>I need to be able to extract font size information (font names aren't so useful) - is there any way at all of doing so with LSTM/v4?

There is no method in the API to get font sizes for the lstm engine.

>If I use OcrEngineMode 0 to be able to get this info, will that be removed from v4 at a later date?

Probably yes.

>Is there any advantage to using v4 with OcrEngineMode 0 vs v3.05?

The accuracy should be the same. The relative font size for a textline can be estimated by calculating the xheight of the line and compare it 
to the median xheight of the other textlines in the page.  

 Ok, thanks for the info :+1:  @phildrip, 

I looked at the relevant code again, and I think the font size functionality (but not font name and properties like is_bold) can be restored when using the lstm engine.

I will provide further details (and probably send a PR) in the upcoming days.  That's great news, thanks! ```
// Returns the font attributes of the current word. If iterating at a higher
// level object than words, eg textlines, then this will return the
// attributes of the first word in that textline.
// The actual return value is a string representing a font name. It points
// to an internal table and SHOULD NOT BE DELETED. Lifespan is the same as
// the iterator itself, ie rendered invalid by various members of
// TessBaseAPI, including Init, SetImage, End or deleting the TessBaseAPI.
// Pointsize is returned in printers points (1/72 inch.)

      ? static_cast<int>(row_height * kPointsPerInch / scaled_yres_ + 0.5)
      : 0;

  return font_info.name;
}
```

The problem:
```
if (it_->word()->fontinfo == NULL) {
    *font_id = -1;
    return NULL;  // No font information.
}
```

With the LSTM engine the `it_->word()->fontinfo` will always be `NULL`.
So pointsize has no chance to be calculated.

pointsize is calculated based on row (=line) height. pointsize is the font size in points of the **line**, so it should not be in **Word**FontAttributes().

There is another function where you can get row height.
```
void LTRResultIterator::RowAttributes(float* row_height, float* descenders,
                                      float* ascenders) const {
  *row_height = it_->row()->row->x_height() + it_->row()->row->ascenders() -
                it_->row()->row->descenders();
  *descenders = it_->row()->row->descenders();
  *ascenders = it_->row()->row->ascenders();
}
```

I think pointsize calculation should be moved into this function. @zdenop, @stweil 
Do you have any comment? Although my current main focus is getting the text from images, there are also important use cases where text attributes are important as well. As I understand your comments, currently the new LSTM recognizer does not support the method `WordFontAttributes`, so it is not possible to get text attributes with that recognizer. Adding support for the font size recognition with LSTM seems to be feasible, but other text attributes like for example bold or italic are desirable, too. Thank you for this clarification, Ray. >Thank you for this clarification, Ray.

In the meantime, can I fix the font size issue?
 https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1074#issuecomment-326762911
 >Yes of course. Just re-order the code in WordFontAttributes.

That was my first thought, but it seems to give you font size in the line level, while the name of the method  implies otherwise (**Word**FontAttributese), so I suggested to move pointsize to the **Row**Attributes() method. +1  I tried to train tesseract v4.0 and got 'combine_lang_model not found' error. This code was added 4 days ago so I tried to build latest master and got '.cppan/storage/etc/static/generate.cmake:106 (message):

Thanks for you help @Shreeshrii .  I believe that `[lang].lstm-recoder` is the compressed unicharset. It's a binary file, unlike the unicharset which is a textual file.  Peace be upon you,
@theraysmith here is a feature that I think you'll find interesting

Computer Assisted Transcription:
- The software segments the pages to lines.
- Then segments the lines into words.
- Later-on, allow the user to transcribe words or glyphs, once the user is satisfied, the software then searches for all instances of presence of such words or glyphs, and automatically transcribe them all in all instances.
- Can transcribe both Glyphs & Words, depending on the segmentation level you choose.

1) It won't work with ligatures.
2) With the legacy OCR engine, there is  a character segmentation step, and the OCR is done on individual char blobs.  
With the new LSTM engine, the OCR is done by the neural network on sequence of pixels in text lines, not on pre-segmented blobs. The fix for most problems with the LSTM engine is more / better training.

The [new binaries](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) are now available.

Suggestion: The results are a lot better with 4.0. LSTM than with 3.05.01 but training seams to be difficult.

@theraysmith, `best/deu.traineddata` includes a `deu.config` with `tessedit_load_sublangs frk`. Why was this dependency added? It is confusing for end users who want to use `-l deu` that they need `frk.traineddata`, too.

@TheSeiko, maybe you'd get better results for Antiqua text without that `frk` dependency (which might be good for texts which also include Fraktur). You can use `combine_tessdata` to extract the components of `best/deu.traineddata`, remove deu.config and combine the remaining components again in a new file. Thank you for the tip. Much appreciated! @stweil Am I doing something wrong?

Are you going to fix that?
 
 @theraysmith 

Another try... hope you'll notice. Please read my above message (at !#1052). 

Please also see #1024  Instructions (run in Tesseract source directory):

 Still missing:
- Update documentation.
- Add to Travis CI.
- Support for autotools (is this needed?).

That can be done as soon as there are real tests. Maybe there are also different opinions about the best location for the `googletest` submodule or the name of the test executable (currently `tesseract_test`).

`configure` / `make` is currently not used for CI tests, so maybe it is sufficient to support `cmake` for GoogleTest and don't implement autotools support. Is there a reason to have both cmake and autotools in the first place?

The homebrew build script for Tesseract uses autotools right now, so people are building with autotools. Logically one should be able to test any configuration that gets built.

I'd be tempted to deprecate/eliminate autotools so we don't have to worry about setting up test for it, if possible.  

 I personally also use mostly autotools, for example when building the installer for Windows. As far as I know it is also used by Debian based distributions when building Tesseract packages.

For the tests, having cmake in the first place seems to be sufficient for me because CI is based on that.

I'd decide later how easy or difficult it is to maintain testing with autotools. >Is there a reason to have both cmake and autotools in the first place?

The autotools build works fine on Posix environments.

 https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/2fbcba62e5e
 You are right Debian packaging builds Tesseract with autotools, but it would be pretty easy to switch that over to cmake if needed. You should also build leptonica with CMake. I noticed for the first time that cmake builds a `liblibtesseract.so`. That looks like a bug, because it should be `libtesseract.so`. > You should also build leptonica with CMake.

That's not strictly necessary. As long as I install it to the standard location (`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblept.so.5` for my Debian installation), the Leptonica library works both with CMake and autotools.

Ray, I‌ assume that your latest Leptonica was installed in `/usr/local`. Then CMake probably won't find it by default. I think the above is a case in point for my earlier comment that we should get rid of either Autotools or CMake. When there's two equivalent tools and people prefer one or the other, maintenance of one of them falls behind. Basically, CMake is for Windows&MSVC and autotools is for all other environments.
I'm talking only about this project, not about other projects' build tool usage.

Related: https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/issues/253 I suggest to let @egorpugin (maintainer of CMake build for both Leptonica and Tesseract) some time to response before giving up on CMake for the unit-testing.  @theraysmith, pull request #1051 adds the required pieces for GoogleTest.   Hi guys ! 
I'm try training tesseract in Japanese.
In Japanese has some type of char. In my case it's about Halfwidth and fullwidth in Katakana table.
Half-width Katakana Example : ｱｲｳｴｵ   ｶｷｸｹｺ
Full-width Katakana Example : アイウエオ　カキクケコ
It's really look like similar or look like uppercase and lowercase but diffirence
When input a Halfwidth katakana, Tesseract can't recognize  or some times out with Full-width katakana.

I try to using text2img make image and box, doing ltsm.train. But have some problem with unicharset!
`set_unicharset_properties -U unicharset -O unicharset -X jpn.xheights --script_dir=./langdata`
I have checked in langdata/Katakana.unicharset. Don't have any half-width katakana symbol.
Because of this i can't make a unicharset file with all the fields set to the right values, like in this [example](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Training-Tesseract#an-example-of-the-unicharset-file)

This is my unicharset file i got from run command

`unicharset_extractor jpn.msgothic.exp18.box jpn.msgothic.exp32.box jpn.msgothic.exp48.box jpn.msgothicb.exp18.box`

Thanks! @Shreeshrii  I think halfwidth katakana not include 
@theraysmith  sir ? can you tell me how to get glyph_metrics in unicharset?  **Related issue on Tesserocr:** [here](https://github.com/sirfz/tesserocr/issues/63)

### Environment

* **Tesseract Version**: 4.00alpha
* **Commit Number**: latest as of 2017-07-19
* **Platform**: Ubuntu 16.04

### Current Behavior:

Tesseract header files since commit [da03e4e](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/da03e4e9105b6262706d40ef2b4436eae4ebe19f#diff-4376fff11de6717e265623d40f1b0820) added the use of `string` in the `unichar.h` header file that is used during compilation by `tesserocr`. This causes the compilation of `tesserocr` to throw an error because the `std` library is not imported.

    In file included from tesserocr.cpp:484:0:
    /usr/local/include/tesseract/unichar.h:164:10: error: ‘string’ does not name a type
    static string UTF32ToUTF8(const std::vector<char32>& str32);
              ^

**Changing**  `static string UTF32ToUTF8(const std::vector<char32>& str32);` **to** `static std::string UTF32ToUTF8(const std::vector<char32>& str32);` **in** `/usr/local/include/tesseract/unichar.h:164` **fixes the problem for me.**

I am aware that you do not provide support for product that aren't the command-line Tesseract but I thought you might want to know since it worked before the commit.

### Expected Behavior:

Hopefully make it work again, if that's not an option, confirm that this is expected behavior.

### Reproducing the error

- Compile Leptonica from source
- Compile Tesseract from source (I used --disable-openmp if that matters)
- Install `tesserocr` with `pip3 install tesserocr` (obviously you need pip3 installed)

 Try this code before including Tesseract header files:

    #include <string>
    using std::string;

According to @theraysmith, the Google coding standards require `string` instead of `std::string`. Can we do something in our side that Ray will be okay with? That's my question too, while I do understand the desire to respect Google's coding guidelines, this probably won't bite only Tesserocr users... @theraysmith Is it? Because I had that problem about 3 hours ago on Ubuntu. Tesseract does build, it's the modules built with its header files that doesn't.

I'll try adding -DUSING_STD_NAMESPACE and report back. >The same define will be required for anything that uses the library too,

We need to document that requirement somewhere. It looks like `USING_STD_NAMESPACE` must always be defined. I wonder why the Tesseract code does not add `using std::string` unconditionally (making `USING_STD_NAMESPACE` unnecessary). Ray already fixed the issue with `USING_STD_NAMESPACE`. @Belval, please try the latest version from git. Indeed the issue is fixed (at least for tesserocr). Thank you! @Belval, are you using cmake and do you see the problem since commit c67c2e9f416e0b41b5e055e67ba5281e04dd5e6c (but not before that commit)? @Belval? Please answer to the questions from Ray and Stefan. Quoting my comment from [here](https://github.com/sirfz/tesserocr/issues/66#issuecomment-321010839):
> I installed the latest pull from the master branch. These changes were added in [unichar.h](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/da03e4e9105b6262706d40ef2b4436eae4ebe19f#diff-4376fff11de6717e265623d40f1b0820R163) on 2017-07-14 (tesseract-ocr/tesseract@da03e4e9105b6262706d40ef2b4436eae4ebe19f) and [unicharset.h](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/b0ead95d64a3667339775b2f99ac37e97e90c2a0#diff-ef746075ef360a166f1cfce7657fce21R241) on 2017-07-24 (tesseract-ocr/tesseract@b0ead95d64a3667339775b2f99ac37e97e90c2a0).

Setting `USING_STD_NAMESPACE` didn't make a difference (same [error message](https://github.com/sirfz/tesserocr/issues/66#issuecomment-321016343)).

I had to manually replace `string` with `std::string` in both unichar.h and unicharset.h to get it to compile properly. The correct macro which must be defined is `USE_STD_NAMESPACE`. `-DUSE_STD_NAMESPACE` works 👍 I am finding same issue in tesseract fb359fc ```
#include <string>
using std::string;
```
before tesseract's includes works again for current master ebbfc3ae8df8 (thanks to @stweil)  ### Environment

* **Tesseract Version**: tesseract-ocr 3.04.
* **Platform**: Windows 8 64-bit

I am using A .NET wrapper for tesseract-ocr 3.04 found here: "https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract"

### Current Behavior:

 Tesseract treating the above image text as image.
So for this do a threshold and erode image using any image processing libraries and pass it to tesseract.  Platform is Debian Jessie - Tesseract 4.00 Git Version.

Tesseract crashes with "Illegal Instruction" when using anything other than --oem 0

 Found SSE

```
I can scan with --oem 0 though. Ok, so now I reinstalled tesseract just to make sure I did everything right.
Tessdata files like 'eng.traineddata' have now been downloaded directly from the repo into  /usr/local/share/tessdata

Current content: 
`configs  deu.traineddata  eng.traineddata  pdf.ttf  tessconfigs`

Now Tesseract starts but tells me that it can't load any language. Which is quite odd.

`tesseract --tessdata-dir /usr/local/share/tessdata/tessdata -l eng  test.jpg out`
results in:
```
Error opening data file /usr/local/share/tessdata/eng.traineddata
Please make sure the TESSDATA_PREFIX environment variable is set to your "tessdata" directory.

Could not initialize tesseract.
```
`tesseract -l eng  test.jpg out`
results in:
`Error opening data file /usr/local/share/eng.traineddata` 

and
`tesseract --tessdata-dir /usr/local/share/tessdata -l eng  test.jpg out`
also results in:
`Error opening data file /usr/local/share/eng.traineddata` 

And whatever I set the TESSDATA_PREFIX to, (like TESSDATA_PREFIX=/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/tessdata) does not get honored at all. 
I simply don't get it. What's going on here?
 Ok, I solved the language problem.  After unsetting TESSDATA_PREFIX and simply using:
`wget https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/raw/4.00/deu.traineddata`
Tesseract seems to be able to load the language files from the default `/usr/local/share/tessdata` again.

But still --oem 1 results in:
```
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v4.00.00alpha with Leptonica
Detected 35 diacritics
Illegal instruction

```

 When using the data files from:
` git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata.git tessdata-repo`
tesseract fails to load the language files.

But when using the data files from: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Data-Files
by downloading with:
wget https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/raw/4.00/eng.traineddata 
I can start tesseract with --oem 0, but --oem 1 or --oem 2 results in the  illegal instruction message

Both ways I put the files into /usr/local/share/tessdata That's correct.  Please test tesseract with phototest.tif, as Shree suggested.
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/testing/phototest.tif OK. I tested it with the traineddata above. But also it's the same I'm using here. 
I also confirmed that tesseract in indeed using the right data folder. 

But again the phototest.tif works fine with --oem 0 and results in the same error "illegal instructions" for any other --oem option or none (default should be --oem 2 if I'm not mistaken)

And although compilation seemed fine. I didn't see an error or warning. So I guess there must be some library missing here. 

Also I reinstalled Leptonica and Tesseract multiple times now.

Here's how I've installed the tools:
```
1. Make sure that the following libraries are installed:

       # nickbe:  I had to replace libpng12-dev for debian jessie

	apt-get install autoconf-archive automake g++ libtool libleptonica-dev pkg-config
	apt-get install libpango1.0-dev

	# sudo apt-get install g++ # or clang++
	sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool
	sudo apt-get install autoconf-archive
	sudo apt-get install pkg-config
	sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev
	sudo apt-get install libjpeg-turbo
	sudo apt-get install libtiff5-dev
	sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev

	sudo apt-get install libicu-dev
	sudo apt-get install libpango1.0-dev
	sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev

2. Install Leptonica:

	git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica.git leptonica
	cd leptonica
	./autobuild
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
	ldconfig

3. Install Tesseract:

    git clone --depth 1  https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract.git tesseract-ocr
    cd tesseract-ocr
    ./autogen.sh

    ./configure --disable-openmp --disable-shared --disable-static
    or
    ./configure        # nickbe: I TESTED BOTH CONFIGURATIONS JUST TO MAKE SURE
    make

    sudo make install
	sudo ldconfig

	# sudo make training
	# sudo make training-install

	sudo make install-langs      # nickbe: Never does anything so far
      sudo ldconfig

4. wget tessdata from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Data-Files
   to /usr/local/share/tessdata

   Example: wget https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/raw/4.00/eng.traineddata

``` Do not install `libleptonica-dev` with apt-get, since you manually intsall leptonica later.   apt-get uninstall libleptonica-dev OK I enabled debug. I also installed the gdb package, but I have no experience with it. How can I provide more information? >sudo make install-langs      # nickbe: Never does anything so far

The comment is correct, so there's no point in doing that.   I think one quite important information is that I just installed the package on a fresh instance of debian stretch. I had no problems with installating Leptonica or Tesseract, but after everything was installed I have exactly the same behaviour on this machine. Tesseract runs with --oem 0 but throws the "illegal instruction" message when trying to use --oem 2 or 1.

Seems that there's something very profound missing in the installation procedure. Ok. I managed to run Tesseract with gdb. Here's the output:
```

You mean `make uninstall tesseract` ?

You don't have to in this case.

``` After recompiling everything with the changed flag the new output is:

```

DotProductAVX can't be used on Android

```

Android?! According to the output of `cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags`, your cpu does not support avx.
 The latest recompile was already done with the modified configure.ac. 
That was the output when running:  tesseract -l eng --oem 2 ......
As always --oem 0 works.
 OK. You will have to do another change in the code.

I will tell you later/tomorrow what to do next. 
 In arch/simddetect.h

Change this line
`static inline bool IsAVXAvailable() { return detector.avx_available_; }`
to
`static inline bool IsAVXAvailable() { return false; }`

I hope we will finish with this change :-) It's strange that `tesseract -v` reports `Found AVX` while your CPU obviously does not support AVX (see output of `/proc/cpuinfo`. That's causing the crash which you observe. What kind of CPU are you using? Are you running on a virtual machine?

Could you use the GDB debugger to step through the function `SIMDDetect::SIMDDetect` (in `arch/simddetect.cpp`) which is executed right at the beginning? Maybe you have a buggy `__get_cpuid` function (or a buggy virtual machine). Try to print the value of `ecx` which is set by that function.

Removing the code `avx_available_ = (ecx & 0x10000000) != 0;` will work around the problem and fix the crash. The change suggested by @amitdo will have the same effect. and recompile of course. Do what I said before listening to @stweil :-) @stweil 

Yes. It's strange.
I want to make sure the problem will be solved after disabling (cheating) avx detection.
If that happen, nickbe will need to undo the 2 changes and recompile. Then you will do your analysis... 
 >What kind of CPU are you using?

`cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep name`
 It's a vServer. Probably XEN but I'm not sure. We do use them quite often without problems. So I have no idea why this case is indeed so strange. I'm recompiling now... Yay. It's working finally. Thanks you so much guys 💃 Will the changes in the make make it into the official repository.?

So now that I can in fact test the new 4.0 feats, is there a way to speed up scanning? Any switches that are recommended? 

 > Will the changes in the make make it into the official repository?

No, they won't, because those changes disable AVX support which is highly desired: AVX makes Tesseract faster. The problem is most probably caused by your vServer which returns a wrong cpuid. That cpuid claims that your vServer supports AVX, but it does not. You can try to get more more information on that vServer (is it XEN, which version?) and report the problem.

We could add a Tesseract option to select SSE / AVX (overriding the automatic detection). Then Tesseract would still crash by default in your case, but it would be possible to make it work using that new option. Is this something new to the 4.00 version? Because the 3.x Versions ran just fine. Yes, it's new. AVX is used for the calculation of the dot product which is needed for LSTM (new in 4.00, not used with `--oem 0`). Maybe there's a safer method to detect the capability? Can I find out if other methods show the correct capabilities for you guys? 
If you like I'd be happy to grant you access to the server.  https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1043#issuecomment-316519350 No I meant maybe there's a better and more secure way for you guys to recognize these kind of features @nickbe, you could help by providing more information on the kind of vServer which you were using. Sure. 
https://www.df.eu/de/cloud-hosting/
Currently it's the second smallest vServer I just wrote to Domain Factory (in German, translated here):

Tesseract: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1043#issuecomment-317283770

XEN can set the CPUID seen by guests to avoid exactly that kind of problem: it can mask the AVX bit even when running on a new CPU with AVX support, thus allowing migration to an older CPU. @nickbe, could you please also run `cpuid --one-cpu` and `cpuid --one-cpu --raw` and post the output?  Similar problems: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=646549, https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13007. Intel manual: https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-manual-325462.pdf#G16.42695. Nick, Domain Factory support asks for the name of your Jiffy Box. Could you send me your e-mail address (get my address [here](https://www.bib.uni-mannheim.de/stefan-weil/))? Then I'll forward their request to you. @nickbe, did you manage to solve the issue? @amitdo, I had contacted Nick's provider. They use XEN servers which do not support AVX, but the CPUID which is seen from the vServer claims that AVX is available. As far as I have understood, this happens when a XEN vServer initially runs on a server with AVX, but is migrated to another server without AVX later.

Only the provider can handle that correctly. Either the XEN vServer must always run on servers with AVX, or the XEN configuration must disable the AVX settings in CPUID even if the server has AVX support.

On the Tesseract side we could try to get a more robust AVX detection which not only checks CPUID. In addition we need an option or parameter to override the automatic selection of SSE2 / AVX. Ok, @stweil. Thanks for the info.  hi guys, yes I successfully solved the problem by following your instruction to patch the settings.
Thanks again for your support here. Very appreciated indeed :)

This looks strange, because the error here comes from the legacy OCR engine, not the LSTM engine. @amitdo  Can you please say what can i do to avoid this and train tesseract normally.

Can u give any clue why this is happening. Sorry, I don't know why it is happening. @Shreeshrii @amitdo 

i am able to generate training data with tesseract code, which i have downloaded around april.
this is the text output regarding that. everyhting seems normal

  @Shreeshrii @amitdo 

I request any body give me brief overview,  how to train tesseract 4 with image files. How to give box and tif pairs to tesseract..

In the above command we can only see text file has been given to tesseract. What should be done if i want a image and box file is to given to tesseract.

Please advise me. you need add
--linedata_only  From general testing, it appears as though I'm I/O bound while using tesseract, and not CPU bound. I checked out the CPU Cache performance (profiled with valgrind and perf, but perf's output is easiest to read) and found that my machines have a high number of cache misses, and even a high number of iTLB misses. After inspecting the code, I also noticed that almost every function was defined as 'inline'. The high rate of iTLB misses surprised me. Usually iTLB misses are reduced after running a program for a longer period of time, but increasing the run time (for instance with an image with a lot more text) saw my iTLB miss rate increase, perhaps indicating that I am filling my iTLB, which is rare.

The iTLB misses worry me, especially because running a program for a longer period of time typically reduces them (one inevitably has cache/tlb misses when executing something that the CPU has not seen, but once it is in the cache, it should stay in the cache...). iTLB misses are expensive on Intel CPUs. I have used OpenMP in the past, but I'm not sure how it handles an iTLB miss per 'thread'. If each thread hits a miss and hits a page fault exception, and it's non blocking (which makes sense), then it'd mean that each thread would cause a page walk for the same instructions. Not sure if that's what happens, but I'd love to know what does happen (or a book or resource) if someone knows more about how OpenMP handles them.

I have seen code styled similarly at my last job, where the main part of the program was written over 25 years ago. At the time I expressed surprise (and alarm) to a co-worker, who explained that compilers used to be terrible at attempting to inline functions, and it wasn't until GCC 4 that there was a decent attempt to improve them. GCC 4 was released in 2005. (The version of GCC 4 you are using now has many updates and improvements, and is different from the GCC 4 in 2005, so GCC 4 is not that 'outdated', but it was the first major time where there were improvements.) So before 2005, best practice was to write code similar to how Tesseract identifies almost all functions as 'inline'.

The 'inline' specifier carries some interesting aspects too, and was more 'important' to use with C, since C++ defaults to 'inline' when... (From [https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-7.1.0/gcc/Inline.html#Inline](url))

> As required by ISO C++, GCC considers member functions defined within the body of a class to be marked inline even if they are not explicitly declared with the inline keyword.

Also, GCC can ignore 'inline' as it sees fit. The -O2 optimization option includes -finline-small-functions, which inlines functions that do not generate additional code. -O3 includes -finline-functions, which is more or less the same as writing 'inline' before every function, and only ignoring it if GCC decides that it may reduce performance. -O2 is in the default configure options, so adding 'inline' before each function is similar to just compiling with '-finline-functions', except that it is slightly more explicit.

There are many downsides to defining a function as 'inline', but the one people usually seem to notice is increased compile time. There's plenty of information available on Google/GNU's documentation about inline, the history of inline, and slight differences between inline in g++ and GNU C back in the day.

The biggest example of what I'd call (modern) "overactive inline use" in tesseract is probably in these files:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/lstm/functions.h
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/lstm/functions.cpp

functions.cpp has two lines of code, with almost everything in functions.h.

This is also an example of compiler output with default options, i.e. keeping '-O2' and all of the different functions 'inlined' (with -Winline: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-7.1.0/gcc/Inline.html#Inline ), defined as:

>  Using -Winline warns when a function marked inline could not be substituted, and gives the reason for the failure.

As a test on my target machines, I copied my 'tesseract' repository, removed all (easy to remove...) 'inline' functions, shifted the definition to the .cpp file instead of the .h file (leaving the declaration in .h as is standard practice), and compiled a separate version, installing it with a different prefix. This allowed me to have multiple versions of Tesseract on the same machine, and to run tests with all of them.

Next, I made a script. Fairly simple, utilizing GNU Parallel
CITATION:

>   O. Tange (2011): GNU Parallel - The Command-Line Power Tool,
  ;login: The USENIX Magazine, February 2011:42-47.

The simple bash scripts look like this:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# CONTROL SCRIPT
TESS=/usr/bin/tesseract
F_LOC=(location of my test images)
parallel $TESS $F_LOC/{1} stdout ::: img1.jpg img2.png img3.jpeg
```
and
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# TEST SCRIPT
TESS=/home/hotchkiss/usr/bin/tesseract
F_LOC=(location of my test images)
parallel $TESS $F_LOC/{1} stdout ::: img1.jpg img2.png img3.jpeg
```
I'd run them ~50 times randomly(as random as /dev/urandom can afford on two options), 'randomly' defined as I randomly chose which to run, and collected the average run times and percentages as an aggregate using perf. Each run was after a fresh reboot, with no other programs running other than X, i3 (my windows manager), and my default kernel + kernel modules (less than 110MB when running 'free -m').

Results look something like:

As expected, with no compiler optimizations and all functions with the 'inline' identifier removed, the performance was worse by a significant amount (8% to 10% worse). Also as expected with modern compilers (gcc 6.3 and gcc 8.0... I haven't run 7.x stable yet, although I could tomorrow), the performance seems to be ~the same and (perhaps, although requires more testing to be definite) better on a CPU with smaller cache/tlb sizes.

I used parallels to ensure that things were running in parallel, similar to what I will be using in production, and, what (hopefully) everyone else is doing too. I checked the other things people have posted, and it seems as though most others are doing the same too.

### What I'm asking
1. How are you collecting cache and performance information, is it standardized, and how would you like any statistics or data to be submitted/displayed?
2. Is it alright if I remove and submit code without 'inline' declared on every function?
3. Should I submit code with 'inline' removed from functions others have written?
4. What are your (other developer's) target machines like, and are my results and thought process similar?

Personally, I'm not a fan of manually marking all functions as inline, but I'm also (quite) used to re-writing code/libraries to optimize performance for my use case(s).

I can wait on posting any code changes until @theraysmith has the new beta tag out though. I'm not sure how these types of issues are handled on github either. I've spent most of my time working at a FFRDC, and haven't submitted much FOSS code publicly at all because of it, but I can post what I've done with this, which is great. Typically, I'd either write my own tests and submit along with compiled code (and a 'NO MERGE' pull request), or follow already provided tests and submit according to them, however I haven't seen any. What do you all prefer to use, and would this be something you're interested in? I absolutely abhor, detest, and strongly oppose programming for the compiler, but I feel like these changes would actually do the opposite, and allow the compiler to take over.

I'm also profiling functions for more detailed optimization with cachegrind, and I'll absolutely post those after the changes have been submitted. Again, it's less of a 'logic' change, and in some cases more of a logic 'reordering' (like order of conditional if tests, what to inline/skip/spend more time on and the like).

Another option that (might?) be decent, if it turns out that removing 'inline' does hurt performance on CPUs with large cache/tlb spaces, is that I can do something similar to what the Linux Kernel has. There is a "Allow gcc to uninline functions marked 'inline'" option (under 'Kernel Hacking') because they have run into the same issue.

 > What are your (other developer's) target machines like, and are my results and thought process similar?

I'm just processing a larger number of images and run Tesseract on 4 Xeon servers of different age with (16 + 16 + 32 + 8) tesseract processes using GNU parallel. The binaries were built without OpenMP to avoid the overhead related with multithreading and to allow optimal use of the available CPU cores (one process per core). This setting produced [150,000 hOCR files](http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/periodika/reichsanzeiger/ocr/film/tesseract-4.0.0-alpha.20170703/) during the last 10 days ([example](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/periodika/reichsanzeiger/ocr/film/tesseract-4.0.0-alpha.20170703/011-9418/0018.hocr)). Regarding OpenMP thread affinity: I think that the problem won't be fixed by binding OpenMP threads to a fixed CPU core nor will other thread libraries help. The current Tesseract simply creates too many threads even if a single process is started because it uses interleaved `#pragma omp parallel` statements. As soon as more than one process is running things get even worse because the number of threads then will exceed the number of CPU cores, and scheduling overhead will occur. >because the number of threads then will exceed the number of CPU cores

but you can limit the number of threads being used. I'm afraid you can limit it only by recompilation (either without OpenMP or with modified source code). Well, we can change the code...

(if we can prove the change will really make things better) Did you try ` OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1 tesseract...`? No, I did not – obviously I missed that environment variable. I only had tried `OMP_NUM_THREADS`. Setting `OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1` indeed stops thread creation. Many thanks. Now I no longer have to build special binaries without OpenMP. Great!

I just discovered this variable an hour ago :-)
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libgomp/Environment-Variables.html  ### Environment

Tessearct 4.00.00alpha
Windows 10 64 bit Visual Studio 2013 Win32 build. 

This issue is also present in earlier versions of Tesseract including 3.0.4 (which I fixed for our own use). 

### Current Behavior:

The GetUTF8Text() method (and other similar methods) allocates a buffer, but there is no call to free the memory, and it cannot be freed by the caller without heap corruption. 

### Expected Behavior:

### Suggested Fix:

Add a method called FreeXXText() (or whatever name is preferred) which does no more than free the memory along these lines: 

void TessBaseAPI::FreeXXText(char *text)
{
	delete[] text;
}

Deleting a null pointer is not a problem (on Windows anyway).  https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/10779bd9e50d/api/baseapi.cpp#L1273

I assume it is a Windows-only issue similar to https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1029#issuecomment-314152843, right? This happens when you do **not** use CRT dynamic link and the heaps get confused. In projects using many dependencies, this can get tricky because all the dependencies should use the same (unless you really know what you are doing).

See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/abx4dbyh(v=vs.80).aspx but also 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10820114/do-statically-linked-dlls-use-a-different-heap-than-the-main-program

In vsprops (or directly in GUI) you should use something like
```
    <ClCompile>
      <RuntimeLibrary>MultiThreadedDebugDLL</RuntimeLibrary>
    </ClCompile>
```
 Another link:

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235460.aspx
>Potential Errors Passing CRT Objects Across DLL Boundaries That's right, the app and DLL have their own heaps.  You mean `STRING`? :-)

That's what Tesseract uses in the API. I'm afraid that you will get an endless list of problems as long as your program uses more than one C runtime library on Windows. With only a single runtime library, all those problems should be solved.

It is possible to force the MS linker to always use the same msvcrt(d).dll.

You could also consider building Leptonica and Tesseract with Mingw-w64. With that combination I never had such problems. I only use one C runtime library, multithreaded DLL for release builds and multithreaded debug DLL for debug builds.  "It's better to return std::string"

Surely that has the same issue if it is allocated in the library, but freed in the application.  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235460.aspx

>The DLL and .exe file are built with /MD, so they share a single copy of the CRT.
>
>If you rebuild with /MT so that they use separate copies of the CRT, running the resulting test1Main.exe results in an access violation.

How do you build the dll and exe? > I only use one C runtime library

Nevertheless your program uses more than one C runtime library if it crashes. Use the [Process Explorer](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processexplorer.aspx) to see which DLLs are used at runtime. For command line programs which run very short, you'll have to add a `sleep` in the `main()` function to delay the execution. dumpbin provides an alternative way to see the linkage of statically linked DLLs. For example:  

**dumpbin /IMPORTS libtesseract304.dll**

All my components use msvcr120.dll.   I need a Windows Win32 build of the Tesseract DLL version 4. I've tried and failed to build the code from the \Tesseract-4.00.00alpha branch. The first issue is that cppan.yml need editing to fix a known bug at the end: 

    pvt.cppan.demo.danbloomberg.leptonica: master

Please help me, thanks.  I try to use sudo apt-get install libleptoncia-dev on linux.

It displays that I have already installed libleptoncia-1.74, which is the newest one.

While I use ./configure to congigure the package on my system, it shows an errors again:

` error: Leptonica 1.74 or higher is required. Try to install libleptonica-dev package.`

SO I try to remove the libleptoncia-1.74 and reinstall the dev again, but it put up another error:
`Failed to connect to socket /com/ubuntu/upstart: `

I have no idea to deal with those, can anybody give me some advices? Thanks, it is helpful. I fix it.  https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/training/merge_unicharsets.cpp

Should we add it to `training/Makefile.am` ? Good questions, Shree. Unfortunately, I simply don't have the answers...


 I just found this file, and saw it isn't in the Makefile.am which means it won't be compiled, so you can't actually use it. It takes two or more unicharset files with this format:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Training-Tesseract#the-unicharset-file-format

I don't know when you are supposed to use it. It calls this function to do the merge:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/29f3de9be1fbae76925e946b9fb04bb976c3f9a0/ccutil/unicharset.cpp#L439 For next time, I suggest not to mix unrelated commits in one PR. Thanks anyway!  If Tesseract is called with a non-existing image file, it creates an empty output file.

I'd expect that no output is created in that case.

Examples:

    # Empty output.txt is created.
    tesseract nonexisting_image.tiff output
    # Empty output.hocr is created.
    tesseract nonexisting_image.tiff output hocr
  Hi,

i was trying to make fine tuning for the lstm file yet i got this error

**Deserialize failed: /home/ibr/tesstutorial/aratrain/ara.2_Baran.exp0.lstmf read 0/81 pages**
keep in mind that the path is correct so the error is **Deserialize failed**: not **Deserialize header failed**
and tesseract freezes after the error message and should press Ctrl C to stop it

i already used the same version of tesseract to tune for japanese, but for arabic i got the previous error
the command was 

`training/lstmtraining --model_output ~/tesstutorial/arabic_tuning/"arabic_tune" \
  --continue_from ~/tesstutorial/extracted_aralstm/ara.lstm \
  --train_listfile ~/tesstutorial/aratrain/ara.training_files.txt \
  --max_iterations 100000`

Thanks i was able to tune Arabic ara.lstm with the same lstmf files, but the difference i made tuning against a different version of tesseract which is: **367-g5baa8c8**. while the version that failed was: **547-g8c29e68**

strangely that the version **547-g8c29e68** passed for Japanese tuning yet it failed for Arabic tuning, as for the version **367-g5baa8c8** i didn't try it for Japanese tuning, only for Arabic and it succeeded
NOTE: both versions are running on the same VMware, and with the same leptonica version which is Leptonica1.47.1 actually all the LSTMFs (Arabic & Japanese) were created by the same version **547-g8c29e68**  yet fine tuning at the version **547-g8c29e68**  worked only for Japanese, but for Arabic (which was also created by the version **547-g8c29e68**) its fine tuning worked at the version **367-g5baa8c8**  Is this issue still happen with latest code?

Strange. It looks like a bug. Thank sir We are still able to reproduce it in the **Arabic** language in **LSTM mode**.
Most BBoxes are correct but there are some boxes that contain valid text and wrong coordinates (the region contained in the bbox is empty). I'm getting the same behavior for Thai language in LSTM - BoundingBox() often returns the whole image size.
The image size was 400, 266. Here is a small portion of some results [X1, Y1; X2, Y2].

What is the expected behaviour in this case - should multiple choices (clearly) in one character be handled?

### Suggested Fix:   
Any idea?
 I'm using the lastest source yet. I have the same Error (*) in two different OS. 

(*) Error: Illegal Parameter specification!
"Fatal error encountered!" == NULL:Error:Assert failed:in file globaloc.cpp, line 75 @Shreeshrii I'm using g++ 7.1.1 in Arch and 4.8.2 in CentOS 6.7.
I launch tesseract from Java. No problems with 3.05 version but I get the error previously commented with 4Alpha version.

`tesseract 4.00.00alpha`
` leptonica-1.74.4`
`  libgif 5.1.4 : libjpeg 8d (libjpeg-turbo 1.5.1) : libpng 1.6.29 : libtiff 4.0.8 : zlib 1.2.11 : libwebp 0.6.0
` No problems detecting langs with _tesseract --list_langs_ (eng, spa and osd trainned files for LSTM based 4.00.00alpha version).

About command line recognition, I have done fine an example from testing folder properly. 

Perhaps, some Java code has changed from this 4Alpha version? The problem with _3.05.01_ version is that I get different resutls from both OS using same Leptonica and Tesseract ver. in a PDF recognition.

Example:

 _0000 0340 **º71º** ZL_ (in CentOS) and _0000 0340 **0710** ZL_ (in Arch).

For that reason I'd like to improve the 4Alpha but it's impossible for the error commented some lines back. If you have an issue with a wrapper to Tesseract's C/C++ API, please report the issue to the developers of that software. >I'm using g++ 7.1.1 in Arch and 4.8.2 in CentOS 6.7.

Ray said, many years ago, that you can get different results with different compilers. >Perhaps, some Java code has changed from this 4Alpha version?

Yes.
https://github.com/nguyenq/tess4j/commits/master Updated to the lastest libs from **Tess4J-3.4.0-src** I get same error when launch the OCR from Java code. 

From 3.05.01 version, is there any solution to solve the fail recognizing "zeros" ( º instead of 0)? 3.4.0 does not include the 4.00 changes.
https://github.com/nguyenq/tess4j/commits/tess4j-3.4.0 >From 3.05.01 version, is there any solution to solve the fail recognizing "zeros" ( º instead of 0)?

You can try to compile with a newer version of gcc. I can't promise that this 'solution' will help you with this issue. Ok, that's the problem? Tess4J-3.4.0 (Java) is not supported by 4.00Alpha release? Then I will try compilling with a newer version of GCC. >Ok, that's the problem? Tess4J-3.4.0 (Java) is not supported by 4.00Alpha release?

I assume that's the source of the problem (It's Tess4J 3.4.0 that seems to not have support for Tesseract 4.00, not vice versa). To be sure, ask the developer.

https://sourceforge.net/p/tess4j/discussion/1202294/
https://github.com/nguyenq/tess4j/issues tess4j's master branch is for Tesseract 4.0alpha and includes the latest Tesseract 4.0alpha Windows binary. All of its unit tests passed on Windows 10. We have not tested on Linux OS yet.

Since you link against Leptonica 1.74.4, make sure you use lept4j-1.6.0. Hi .. it seems you just have to add environment variable LC_NUMERIC="C" ... and it works. :) I dug into Tesseract's code and found that the string "Illegal Parameter specification" only exists in one place, namely in the file classify/clusttool.cpp. After some debugging I realised that the function ReadParamDesc() calls sscanf() at line 82 (for git commit hash 2b854e3749d62012787dd4160fc30e86603cc540), which is locale dependent. It fails since the numeric input (two floating point values) are written with dots (example: 1.23), but using a different locale other than en_US for LC_NUMERIC may cause sscanf() to expect other characters, like commas (1,23).

With other words, the error is in tesseract, assuming a locale. It should rather be set explicitly. The workaround is to set LC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8. https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/FAQ#error-illegal-min-or-max-specification

  In 3.0,I get a list of choices,but in 4.0 just one,is it a bug?  ### Environment

Tesseract Version: <4.0>

Platform: <Ubuntu 14.04>

### Current Behavior:
I am wondering how the time steps(or to say the lstm cell numbers) for the LSTM unit is determined during the training process? If the width of the input image is various, though the summaring LSTM unit is used to collapse the Y-dimension into one,  but the width of the data can still be different values. 
So each iteration ,the LSTM is unrolled for img-width times? Or is there any scaling operation on the input image or any other func I am missing?

 @Shreeshrii As I understand, the summarizing lstm unit is to reduce the height of the input image, so that each time-step of the output sequence becomes a 64-d vector, with the image width (after conv and max-pool) as the length of the seqence. So in the training step, it's not possible to use batch since the width of the images in each batch can be different？  I think padding is added to each text line image to make each image the same width.
   I don't think this is related to Tesseract. The same sequence works for me on Debian Jessie and Stretch. Maybe a damaged local Leptonica build or installation? So 3.05 tries linking without the Leptonica library. That cannot work of course.

You used `LIBLEPT_HEADERSDIR`. I did not find it in the code, so I think that is without any effect. The other options for `configure`, namely `--with-extra-includes` and `--with-extra-libraries` should not be needed. Setting `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` should be sufficient if you have installed code in `/usr/local`. I try to avoid such extra settings because they are confusing: which installation of Leptonica is used? Therefore I usually install in `/usr` (see my packages at https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/leptonica/). I don't know what the breakage is.  In this thread I see the failure to load liblept in 3.05, which might have followed from the failure to find lept_free() for some reason.

@shreeshrii  you say it works for the master branch; for what version does it fail, and what is the failure? @Shreeshrii , please try these four commands:

    pkg-config --cflags lept
    pkg-config --libs lept
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig pkg-config --cflags lept
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig pkg-config --libs lept

Here is my output (only two commands, as I have no installation in `/usr/local`):

    $ pkg-config --cflags lept
    -I/usr/include/leptonica
    $ pkg-config --libs lept
    -llept

Your build output neither shows something like `-I/usr/local/include/leptonica` (for the C++ compiler) nor `-L/usr/local/lib -llept`, so I expect that you have a broken file `lept.pc` somewhere on your computer. The above test will check that. lept.pc.in  is from Jan 2016, and lept.pc.cmake is from Apr 22, 2017.

Neither have changed since 1.74.2, which was May 19, 2017.

 My 1.74.4 builds fine with autotools on linux.

I don't have a conftest.cpp file, and configure doesn't look for it.
Attaching my lept.pc (generated from lept.pc.in).
[lept.pc.txt](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/1089399/lept.pc.txt)

 @Shreeshrii, your `pkg-config` output looks good. I was surprised that `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` did not change the result. Have you set that as an environment variable, too?

Does the build work with my [3.05](https://github.com/stweil/tesseract/tree/3.05) (I just added a [backported commit](https://github.com/stweil/tesseract/commit/e7610d86c97de4c29777892465fc4c3bc77e8da8))? Sorry, the fix for `training/Makefile.am` was missing. Updated now. Try this:
`find /usr -name *lept*`
 You need to recompile Tesseract after you re-installed Leptonica ... or use `ldd /usr/local/bin/tesseract` to see which libraries are used by default. Maybe `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib /usr/local/bin/tesseract -v` gets the expected Leptonica version. > You need to recompile Tesseract after you re-installed Leptonica

In most cases this is not necessary, because typically Leptonica is not linked statically. That means Tesseract uses a shared library for Leptonica, and that library can be replaced by a newer one without harm (as long as there are no incompatible changes). >... (as long as there are no incompatible changes).

https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/issues/240 So it's using the Leptonica from `/usr/local` which claims to be leptonica-1.74.2. @shreeshrii  Is it worth doing a mini-postmortem on this?  Just a couple of paragraphs on what went wrong and what we might do to prevent this from happening again. @shreeshrii

Thanks!  Very nice summary.

We have several ways to build tesseract and the associated libraries.
An embarrassment of riches, as the French would say (except
in their own way).

It seems to me that the current suggestions in the leptonica
README.html for building with autotools are still valid.
It also references the documentation in
     https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling
and I see that you updated that page 2 weeks ago.  Would
you make any further changes there?

 I seem to be hitting the problem too - trying to add in a cross compile for powerpc into our travis build setup, building leptonica first and then tesseract and I seem to be hitting this same issue no matter what I try, if I use 3.0.5.01 download. If I pull latest straight from git, it compiles fine. Also builds fine for android, mac, windows, probably even native ppc. 

@Shreeshrii you mention some backports to 3.0.5.1, could you help with any details on those? I looked through the commit log but from a quick look from around Jun I didn't spot anything immediately obvious. I'm wondering if its something I can apply as a patch, just that pulling a non-release version usually ends up with headaches down the road >git clone -q --branch=3.05 https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract.git tesseract-3.05

This will fetch https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/tree/3.05, but the latest 3.05.x is 3.05.1: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/tree/3.05.01

Currently, version 4.0 still has the legacy engine from 3.0x (plus the new LSTM engine).
It can be used with the 3.05/3.04 traineddata files (--oem 0 or --oem 3).  ### Environment

I don't know how Tesseract works in its core but the image contains clear and readable characters, even in English. Yeah, that's a lot better. Thank you! @Shreeshrii What have you used to preprocess the image? I tried it with imagemagick but the result isn't quite good and therefore the OCR result too. @Shreeshrii The best I can get is this:

![frame_24721-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3123549/27321677-64de42d2-559b-11e7-8d3a-f405b18d5fbf.png)

Using this command:
```
convert -units PixelsPerInch input.png -resize 1200 -density 300 -colorspace gray -depth 1 -negate output.png
```

Not sure if imagemagick can do better.  It would be good to decide about using semantic versioning soon. Maybe it can be used for the next tag. We could tag the current release as a pre-release or as a release candidate. According to [semver.org](http://semver.org/#spec-item-9), it could be called something like `4.0.0-rc.1` (that's how semver.org named its own releases), `4.0.0-beta.1` or `4.0.0-beta.20170619`. @theraysmith, can you give us an update on your work? When are we going to see it? Hi, same: can you give us an update on your work? When are we going to see 4.0 released? +1 for a new tag.

Since Ray does not reply, I suggest to still use 'alpha'.

`4.0.0-alpha.YYYYMMDD` @zdenop, can you do it, or at least add your comment here? Superb. Anything we could do to help you ? Cheers. > I'm about ready to update the traineddatas.

That's good news.

> The above change makes open source training impossible.

If I got that right, it would be horrible. Being able to create new traineddata is essential for me. >The new traineddatas will mostly be smaller than the older ones, as they
won't contain the legacy components, and no bigram dawgs are needed.

Will you remove the **code** of the legacy engine in this round? > 2 parallel sets of tessdata. "best" and "fast". "Fast" will exceed the speed of legacy Tesseract in real time, provided you have the required parallelism components, and in total CPU only slightly slower for English. Way faster for most non-latin languages, while being <5% worse than "best" Only "best" will be retrainable, as "fast" will be integer.

@theraysmith, thanks for providing "fast" now. Are you planning to release free documentation / tools for everybody to produce "fast" data? I noticed that apart from the LSTM model the rest of the traineddata files for "best" and "fast" are identical. Wouldn't it save space and make the handling easier if both variants were in the same traineddata container (this requires an option to select the desired one, of course) instead of having two parallel sets? Jeff, see this comment:

 @roozgar, it is possible to extract the parts of a traineddata file using `combine_tessdata -u traineddata_file output_path_prefix`. Usually the largest parts are the LSTM model and the word list, but not all languages have a huge word list like `eng.traineddata` or `Latin.traineddata`.

LOL. It happens to me too. I keep discovering mistakes **after** I post a comment. Thank you! Hi everybody, so what are now the remaining tasks in order to release Tesseract 4.0.0 ?  USE_OPENCL should be turned off in CMAKE if OpenCL is not found. Also, potentially should be enabled by default if it is found unless there are reasons otherwise. CC: @egorpugin Adding USE_OPENCL by default would be a bad idea. The OpenCL code is still buggy and does not improve the performance very much (or even not at all). Only developers who know what they are doing should use it. Should this issue be closed then? IMO, there's no point to keep it open if nobody going to do something about it. I see no need to keep it open.  Hi,

while i was training the LSTM through this command
`lstmtraining -U ~/tesstutorial/jpntrain/jpn.unicharset \
  --script_dir /home/ibr/langdata --debug_interval 0 \
  --continue_from   tesstutorial/jpn.lstm \

  --max_iterations 5000 &>~/tesstutorial/basetrain.log`

it went fine and started the iterations until the iteration 900 it gave the error:

although the error came, it created checkpoint file, I'm using Tesseract 4.00alpha, leptonica 1.74.1 and OS is Ubuntu 14.04

i got the command from this [website](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00---Replace-Top-Layer)

 i installed and compiled both leptonica 1.74.2 and latest tesseract and ran the command but i got the following error:

as you can see, this deserialization error is different from the one that i got  #992

 its not saying that the header deserialization failed, so what does that mean? and the path is correct thanks for the response, i modified the path yet i deserialization fails, but as you can see that error has gone

NOTE: the terminal freezes after running this command, until i stop the command by "Ctrl C" @Shreeshrii  actually I switched back to liptonica 1.74.1 and started fine tuning since I decided I need the old unicharset and I just want to add layers to existing lstm file, so I needed to finish this task ASAP and as you know fine tuning takes many days, so I didn't have the chance to try your solution which is creating lstmf by the latest tesseract as it requires installation and compiling and the machine is already occupied by the tuning.
BUT since I don't need to create from scratch anymore I can close this issue, so if its fine by you I will close it, reply back to me for the next action.
Thanks  Hi,

 @zdenop  @Shreeshrii @stweil 
can you guys give me some advice about  this ? thx. I've also tested jpn and kor images , the results have similar problem.
there might be something wrong related to LSTM engine or its parameter. sorry for my bad english
in my case Japanese  and OCR mode set to LTSM may by related .
i'm try to get single char only by using ResultIterator but sometimes final char in word doesn't have right coordinate. if change OCR mode to Tesseract Only it's okay.
Example :
大阪株式会社 
[debug] -Char value = 大 left= 16 top = 243 right = 68 bottom = 295 conf = 99
[debug] -Char value = 阪 left= 75 top = 244 right = 128 bottom = 295 conf = 99
[debug] -Char value = 株 left= 130 top = 244 right = 185 bottom = 296 conf = 99
[debug] -Char value = 式 left= 190 top = 243 right = 281 bottom = 296 conf = 99
[debug] -Char value = 会 left= 306 top = 243 right = 362 bottom = 296 conf = 99
[debug] -Char value = 社 left= 2214 top = 2991 right = 2214 bottom = 2991 conf = 99
 great, it works. Actually I noticed this variable, but I misunderstood and set it to false, definitely it doesn't work as expected. ~_~
> SetVariable("preserve_interword_spaces", false); @Shreeshrii  can you  help me ? i'm get wrong coordinate for last char in word. Thanks!  Hi,

while i made some Images Recognition for the Japanese language i found that the resulted Japanese text has different spacing between its characters, i have no background in Japanese but in the original documents or images the spacing is different meaning some times its more like spaces between English letters and other times the space similar to the space between English words, while in the resulted text all spaces are similar between all characters.

Thanks @Shreeshrii  Thanks Hi,

just adding information, this `-c preserve_interword_spaces=1` argument works good with Japanese (i didn't try it with English) but for Arabic its better not to use it, since the Arabic language has Cursive  writing system, so i detected a text with both cases, with the argument and without it, when i used the argument for Arabic some of the words were detected correctly but are joined to the next word which is incorrect, but without that argument the same words didn't  join to the next word which is correct   What's the point of this option?

  ### Environment
Version: 4.00.00alpha, from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/4.00.00alpha)
`uname -a` output: Linux T1 4.4.0-21-generic #37-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 18 18:33:37 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Current Behavior:
Running two or more programs which all attempt to process images with Tesseract seems to lock up all programs indefinitely.

### Expected Behavior:
Running two or more programs involving Tesseract would not block all programs from executing.

### Suggested Fix:
I don't actually know enough about the codebase itself to to suggest a fix, but would be interested in more information or a workaround. This actually has nothing to do with training though, just evaluation with the LSTM. I'm running on an Ubuntu 16 VM which has 16GB RAM from the host and 4 cores, so I doubt it has anything to do with the hardware. I'll try the latest code and see what happens The problems which we observed with training also exist for the tesseract ocr process. It uses multithreading causing a significant overhead for thread synchronisation. Your 4 cores will be sufficient for a single tesseract process, but if you run more than one, the effects which you have seen are not surprising.

Disabling OpenMP and the related multithreading would help for your case. Use `configure --disable-openmp`. Then I expect that you will be able to run up to four tesseract processes simultaneously. Thanks @stweil and @Shreeshrii. Will disabling OpenMP affect processing time in a negative way though? For example, if I'm only running one process using Tesseract, will it run more slowly with OpenMP disabled? It sounds like there must be some kind of tradeoff here Yes, for a single process disabling OpenMP will increase the run time – not by a factor 4, but maybe 2. You'll have to try it yourself.  Great, I'll give that a shot and see what happens. Thanks again for the support, closing now  Hi,

I wanted to install and compile leptonica and then tesseract on a server following this [website](https://medium.com/@lucas63/installing-tesseract-3-04-in-ubuntu-14-04-1dae8b748a32)
i installed and downloaded leptonica 1.74.1 and tesseract 4.00.00alpha on VM and VB before following the same steps exactly, yet today i found this error coming out on the terminal
![env_error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26926171/26831244/5b97d520-4ad4-11e7-9a87-bf86bc754e79.png)

i tried to comment the error section but that caused another problems, i even tried to get the leptonica.gz again and running the steps once more, yet the same problem.

keep in mind that the OS on the server is Ubuntu 14.04, which is the same OS that i used on VM and OS on VB and worked on both cases, is this issue cause by a dependency or what exactly?
Please any ideas? as i need to get the server up and running as soon as possible
Thanks thanks, but what is the command to get the newer version, its not:
wget http://www.leptonica.com/source/leptonica-1.74.2.tar.gz

and is it an alpha version too or a full release?
and would  the compilation for it be same as 1.74.1 ? According to the snapshot, your Leptonica build fails. Then that's unrelated to Tesseract, isn't it? @Shreeshrii same problem has occurred with Leptonica 1.74.2, it i feel its kind of a compiler issue, isn't it?
@stweil yes you are right, the compilation of the leptonica has failed, and i couldn't continue to install tesseract
@zdenop i really didn't know why you have closed this issue before i even got the chance to try what was suggested by shree??!! at least if something is wrong with the question, or its irrelevant to this group at least mention that in a comment then close it !!!!! :(



  The newer version contains fixes for the pixUnsharpMaskingGray*
functions which are relevant for Tesseract (used in ImageData::PreScale
which calls pixScale).

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil <sw@weilnetz.de> See [Dan's comment](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/644#issuecomment-306073620) for issue #644. Should we refuse builds with Leptonica < 1.74.2? Then additional changes for `CMakeLists.txt` and `configure.ac` would be needed. The newer version not only fixes problems with undefined memory for `lstmtraining`, but also for `tesseract --oem 1`:

 Tesseract cmake builds are broken with Leptonica 1.74.2 because Leptonica now requires an installation: the `Leptonica_INCLUDE_DIRS` refer to /usr/local/include. Therefore Travis CI fails. @egorpugin, how should we fix that?  The new test in LSTMTrainer::UpdateErrorGraph fixes an assertion
(see issues #644, #792).

The new test in LSTMTrainer::ReadTrainingDump was added to improve
the robustness of the code.

I was trying to get the text of the image i am providing bellow (i am using extract_text before the apply of tesseract) and i wanted to get the result of fitting room above which is very clear and in white background with black letters. I didnt get that result on the output file so i tried to cut only that part of the image and use the tesseract and i got the result i was looking for. Probably there is a bug how tesseract is detecting the edges, any helpful information about this?

The problem is that many people are either not noticing or ignoring this 'banner'.

Any reason to not have a link to this page instead of the other links?  The new README.md can be seen [here](https://github.com/Shreeshrii/tesseract).  Attached are two images, one with the word Keyword, and the other with a random string. The file with the word Keyword outputs an accurate result (Keyword). The second file though outputs something very odd: `"'Eﬂ'fé'i'ibiboss`

Any idea why? The second picture is the result of someone taking a photo of a serial number, which is what i am trying to achieve in my app. The Keyword image is a screenshot from the web, so it is perfectly skewed with a white background. Was I wrong in assuming that ocr could accurately determine the text in the second photo?

I had to fix the assertion issue first. I currently think that the timing regression is related to bug #644. @Shreeshrii, could you please try git master with the patch shown there? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/556405/what-do-real-user-and-sys-mean-in-the-output-of-time1 The fact that the 'user' time is a few times longer than the 'real' time is expected with multi core CPU and OpenMP enabled.

However, the fact that the real time with or without OpenMP is roughly the same is not expected. See also [my comment](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/943#issuecomment-304132980) in the RFC on performance. Even on Linux, OpenMP requires a large percentage of additional CPU time. That's why Tesseract with OpenMP is not much faster in the "real" time, but uses much more "user" and "sys" time. On Windows the situation gets worse because thread switching for OpenMP seems to be slower than on Linux. A dual core CPU will produce a very high overhead when OpenMP with four or more threads is used, so yes, disabling OpenMP might help. The Tesseract code could also be improved with OpenMP enabled: it could set the number of threads at run time, either based on user's choice (command line parameter) or based on the number of available CPU cores. Set a higher "nice factor" for Tesseract, in this situation? It's normal that programs like `lstmtraining` which mostly do computation use all of the CPU which they can get, so 99 % is good (as long as it is spent for training, not for busy waits during thread scheduling :-)). And running it as `nice lstmtraining` is a good idea if the same computer is also used by other processes / users.  They do not work for me. I've been trying versions: 3.05.00 and 4.00.00alpha.
My file date.user-pattern contains one line:
2014-\d\d-\d\d
Picture is one line with date, like: 2014-03-19
I run: tesseract img.jpg stdout --user-patterns date.user-patterns -psm 8
and output: "mum-w" which obviously does not match the pattern. 
Character whitelisting helps a bit, but format from pattern is not preserve and accuracy is poor.
I also tried some other examples - does not work either.
Many people have the same problem, aggregated links under this one:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34560697/tesseract-ocr-user-patterns
also #403
Should we assume that this feature does not work at all? Is there any official comment on this? Same problem with user dictionary:
`tesseract H3.png stdout --user-patterns date.user-patterns --psm 8 --user-words date.user-words -c language_model_penalty_non_dict_word=9999999999999999999 --oem 0
`I tried different language_model_penalty_non_dict_word values with no luck
Related #297, which is closed, so I assume the feature doesn't work. I think it would be better for users if those flags are removed from command line and configurations, because it is misleading as long as they don't affect engine. No, sorry, I never used that option. Nevertheless I also have a [scenario](https://av.tib.eu/media/21360) where working user patterns would help. >No, sorry, I never used that option.

Same answer. User patterns are documented in [`doc/tesseract.1.asc`](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/doc/tesseract.1.asc#config-files-and-augmenting-with-user-data) and in [`dict/trie.h`](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/dict/trie.h#L193). With 4.0 the problem might be that the Dict class is instantiated twice
```

and both initialise

The real problem is that variables are set between these calls so LSTM dict does not get the value from user defined variables. Does this issue only happen on the command line executable? I mean I can workaround this issue by writing some C++ source file to directly call the API? Thanks.  Hi Ray,

I'm going to compare different OCR engines on University of Washington (UW3) dataset.

Did you use the UW3 dataset during training your LSTM model? If so, the comparison will be useless.

Thanks. >Did you use the UW3 dataset during training your LSTM model?

I'm not Ray, but AFAIK the answer is NO.

What are the other OCR engines in your comparison?
 Hi Amit,

Thanks for the answer.

I'm going to compare the following OCR engines:
1) Tesseract 4
2) Tesseract 3
3) ABBYY Cloud OCR SDK
4) Microsoft Computer Vision API
5) Google Cloud Vision API @vaasily, what were the results of your comparison?  The accuracy of Nepali trainned data is low is some documents. Whole line is recognized as a single word and recognized text seems to be just a string of random character. Here is sample -

I faced issues in recognizing mostly the Italicized text. And have little difficulties with bold faced text. Is there any way to tackle them?  If you build and install leptonica from a source, then libleptonica.so is created, but not liblept.so
However tesseract ./configure scripts requires liblept.so:
```
(...)
checking for leptonica... yes
checking for pixCreate in **-llept**... no
configure: error: leptonica library missing

```
As a workaround I just link liblept.so to created libleptonica.so, but I belive that tesseract scripts should recognize if we have liblept or libleptonica installed and use proper -l... flag for pixCreate.
Note that liblept.so is installed when you install leptonica from debian/ubuntu repository by e.g. apt-get install. Btw maybe it should be also fixed by leptonica guys to standarize library name no matter you build it by your own or install from repo (?). Neither the stable version 3.05 nor git master tests for pixCreate.
Did you test with Tesseract 3.04 or older? Then please update to a supported version. Previously I checked out to a tag: 3.05.00dev
Now I've just checked to a branch: 3.05 - and now it passes ./configure script, but there is some new problem with make:
```
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lleptonica_OUTPUT_NAME-NOTFOUND
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [libtesseract.la] Error 1
make[2]: Opuszczenie katalogu `/home/m/OCR/download/tesseract/api'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Opuszczenie katalogu `/home/m/OCR/download/tesseract'
make: *** [all] Error 2
```
And for branch 3.04 without liblept.so I get:
```
checking for leptonica... yes
checking for l_generateCIDataForPdf in -llept... no
configure: error: leptonica library with pdf support (>= 1.71) is missing
Line 122 - configure error
```


 1) leptonica 1.74.2 builded and installed from source
2) Yes, I run autogen before configure.
As I mentioned in 1st post: leptonica builded from source does not create liblept.so, instead it creates libleptonica.so.
 It seems that with **CMake** it's `libleptonica.so`
 Commit f52d445074d0e3863dfbe4f0b6acbf92c0f46d7d changed the library handling to use `pkg-config`. The branch 3.05 includes that commit. Tesseract 3.05.00 still uses the old code. Thanks guys. To summarize:
Yes, I've got only 1 leptonica, and yes, when cmake is used then liblept.so is created instead of libleptonica.so (to be precise: cmake path/to/repo; make -j; sudo make install). For the same reason "checking for l_generateCIDataForPdf in -llept... no". But nevermind, because indeed f52d445 from 3.05 branch fixes  liblept vs libleptonica. However as I mentioned some posts ago: when I use 3.05 or f52d445 I've got a problem with "make" which is connected again with leptonica.
But if you ask me, I'm satisfied with using 3.05.00 and just symlink liblept.so to libleptonica.so.
 @wosiu, the error `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lleptonica_OUTPUT_NAME-NOTFOUND` comes from an error in the Leptonica build. The string is part of `lept.pc.cmake` and should be replaced when `lept.pc` is generated. I'd try building Leptonica with configure / make instead of using cmake – maybe that fixes this problem. Try to build both leptonoica and tesseract with the same build system (cmake / autotools) https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/issues/253 Now I build and install leptonica like this:
```
./autobuild
./configure
make -j 
sudo make install 
```
and indeed liblept.so is created.
However now during tesseract (branch 3.05) "make" I get:
```
/usr/bin/ld: tesseract-tesseractmain.o: undefined reference to symbol 'lept_free'
/usr/local/lib/liblept.so.5: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```
3.05.00 build is fine. Does anyone have a solution to this problem without changing the debian version of the leptonica library soname (made with autotools), which is liblept.so? @jbreiden @DanBloomberg, I see no problem with the name of the library here. `./configure && make` builds `liblept.so` which is fine. `liblept.so` also provides `lept_free`. @wosiu, do you compile for Linux or for Windows? Could you provide a complete build protocol?

  for some reason, the network in my country is very bad!!

so i want to use the lib and dll directly.
and finally i found no where to download it?

compile it is so hard for me, is there a solution? @Shreeshrii Thanks for the links! How can I use this build in my QT C++ project? @Shreeshrii

1. zlib128-static-mtdll.lib @zdenop and you know where to get what we want? @weituotian, get the code and compile it yourself. You won't save much network bandwidth if you could get libraries. And libraries must match your compiler. You did not say which compiler you are using.   On an Intel Xeon Server the new code is significantly faster.

The results are less impressive on a notebook with Core i7 where it is also more difficult to reproduce a timing test. That's why I suggest independent tests by other people. Er, what's with the low-level SSE/AVX programming instead of trusting tools like `#pragma omp simd` and even optimised higher-level libraries, unless it is to leave ample opportunity for further optimisation?

BTW, how is alignment at 32-byte boundaries achieved, and has this been verified? I was blinded by all the other uses of "align", so I didn't find any uses relating to memory alignment... As far as I know, `#pragma omp simd` is not restricted to Intel CPUs, so it could also improve the generated code for ARM and other architectures.

Tesseract currently does not assume 32-byte alignment, but tests the alignment at execution time and chooses different code paths for aligned and unaligned arrays of double values. Just a note: `#pragma omp simd` is not supported with MSVC. @stweil Has anybody verified that this differentiation actually does some good? If you leave it up to chance, I don't think that the odds are in your favour, especially if both arguments have to be aligned at the same time, because the current code does not choose load instructions independently for each parameter; so if it does make a difference, you had better make sure that it's not just once in a while if you're lucky. One parameter aligned is actually the worst case, because you don't necessarily have to start at the beginning of a vector for the SIMD instructions, so what matters is whether the arguments are mutually aligned or not.

@amitdo I don't think that the laggard should set the pace, considering how relatively easy the pragma is to use. @rfschtkt, it looks like one parameter is (mostly?) aligned while the other parameter is only aligned in one of four steps (it increases in steps of sizeof(double) == 8). As far as I see the code could also be modified to handle one aligned parameter with the other parameter unaligned.

I'm still not sure how much the aligned access is faster. As reported by @Shreeshrii, some CPU models don't show increased speed where others show significant faster execution. Memory caches also play an important role.

That's why I want to offer several implementations in Tesseract, and users can choose which one is best for their environment. Do you have any evidence that such differentiation might be useful beyond the purpose of experimentation? I would expect cache-oblivious code, techniques like blocking/strip-mining, to benefit all architectures more or less equally. It doesn't seem very efficient to try to reinvent the wheel here, but I haven't yet looked into any issues like licensing associated with the use of an external library with Tesseract, so... See https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/DDOT-Bench and the associated article for more research on this. They also have code which can be used freely. How about #983? The idea is to primarily rely on OpenMP 4.0's simd where available, then try explicit code for specific implementations, then fall back to serial execution. If you're confident that you have a better implementation than OpenMP, this order can of course be changed, but I don't think this is the case yet. Could you share some details on how you test performance here? Could this be reframed as a unit test that immediately rejects a suboptimal implementation choice? My conjecture is that OpenMP wipes the floor with (relatively speaking) naive use of SSE/AVX intrinsics, and that you only need the latter if you are stuck with Visual C++ (for now). Typically I use these test scenarios for the OCR process (`tesseract` executable, all images available on https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/~stweil/tesseract/):

    # OCR of a very large image (performance test with focus on OCR).
    tesseract 0604.jp2 /tmp/0604-eng -l eng
    tesseract 0604.jp2 /tmp/0604-frk -l frk
    # OCR of a very small image (Valgrind, performance test with focus on pre OCR steps).
    tesseract hello.png /tmp/hello

Recently I added a [test scenario for training](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/~stweil/tesseract/issue961.sh). It is based on issue #961 provided by @Shreeshrii.

I started writing a [standalone test](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/~stweil/tesseract/dp-test/) to test the effects of cache size, but that is still unfinished.
 The conflicts are resolved now. I suggest to keep the PR open until more people have reported their timing test results.  Add two build dependencies which were missing and update the hints for
building ScrollView.jar.

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil <sw@weilnetz.de>  Would it be possible to preserve layout? I'm thinking of something akin to:

pdftotext -layout

I'm working with images of tabular computer printouts. Although the OCR function is impressive, without the layout, the result is largely unusable. If text stayed roughly in its columns, it would be readable. I wasn't sure if --psm 5 might have been intended to be helpful but it produced junk: could it be broken? All the other psm options I tried produced something reasonable. I have now - they aren't mentioned on the default usage, so I didn't know about them. For what I want to do, the tsv fomat may work well. I'm not sure what some of the columns mean, but the coordinates are clear.

Your suggestion lets me develop a solution for my problem better than my original suggestion. In particular, it lets me make my own decisions about text which doesn't align well such as superscripts or font changes within a line.

However I think my change request as originally stated would be useful. If you try pdftotext with/out the -layout option on something like a bank statement you'll see what I mean! 

To summarise: 

Thanks, you solved my problem. My proposal would still be useful. The --help option should document tsv/hocr (a new change request)?. Thanks for an amazing tool.  I've been creating Tesseract 3.02 application uses Visual Studio and already train and have tesseract data for 3.02. Now my company want me to develop on android which I'm using rmtheis TessTwo API which uses Tesseract version 3.05. So how can I convert my 3.02 data to 3.05? Or is it 3.02 can be used on 3.05 without need to change (though I believe this i not true)?

Please help.

Thank You Thank You soooooo much. It worked and now it is running. Once it is finished then I will let you know.

Thanks again friend. @latifwirelessmaker which fonts you added? I am using Nic Id Print, its a custom font created for some specific data @LatifWirelessMarketer 
ok good
just your training finished tell us about the accuracy you reached..

Thank you OK Sure but I am still in training phase as I just started with v 4.0 so maybe with current data I will not reach that much accuracy so I will run it again for last amount of training text.

So will keep updating about accuracy improvements.

Thanks.  Btw, can anyone tell me how much of text is required to get a good accuracy? I've read in the documentation that original training was done on more then 400000 lines of text so is it necessary to have that much text of languages like (english, arabic, etc...) or not.

Also let me know if I can get the original source of text used for training the languages that are available to be downloaded freely from original source?

Thank You  Regarding the Arabic language, the number of Lines required to produce a decent Model depends on the complexity of the typeface. But it is proven that you are able to create an Arabic Model capable of achieving +90% recognition rate using ~800 lines in your training.

Have a look at the research done by the OpenITI​ team, implimented using Kraken engine:
[1)The Research paper
](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzDVkBcqiyEsbC16ZGktOWNiUDg/view)
[2)Kraken](http://kraken.re/)
 @LatifWirelessMarketer can you post your test results such as recognition rate and time.
waiting for your updates @christophered I was training on huge text before but it was a never ending task to now I am trying to train it on small text with different fonts like arial, tahoma etc. and text lines are less then 30. It took me more then 3 hours to train at first with error rate below 0.9 but the problem is that after I was able to generate ara.lstm file which is the final training file. Now I am unable to generate ara.traineddata

Command I used:
..\combine_tessdata -o ..\tessdata\ara.traineddata ara.lstm ara.unicharset ara.number-dawg ara.punc-dawg ara.word-dawg

and I am getting this error:
Failed to create a temporary file ara.traineddata.__tmp__

no matter what, if I change the traineddata directory. The error remains the same.

Does anyone know this problem and it's solution, then please help.

Thank You @Shreeshrii  @Shreeshrii I checked everything already and even after you explained it to me. There are no files in any directory like ara.traineddata or ara.traineddata.__tmp__ etc. I deleted all previous ones and now trying from scratch but still it's giving me same error.

see attachment.

![lstm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19776088/26761448/5742efe8-4938-11e7-8c09-6afbccc49b3f.png)
 @Shreeshrii what percentage recognition rate for the Arabic language you where able to get? @christophered My char error rate was 0.78 but how to check percentage recognition rate? I think we can only check after generating the trained data right? @christophered  I uninstalled tesseract engine after coping my files and reinstalled it, now its working.

 @Shreeshrii , One questions brother.

I want to know if there is no ara.traineddata already present in the folder, then how can we create a new file? I mean I tried several times and the error I was getting yesterday was just because there is no ara.traineddata file present. If I copy any ara.traineddata from the internet in my tessdata folder then it combines the new trained data with that.

For example the size of original data was 11.9mb but I used only 20 lines of text and my trained data size become 11.0mb. How is that possible? @Shreeshrii Thank You soo much brother.

Btw do you know what is the difference between ara.word-dawg & ara.lstm-word-dawg?

I mean I know how to generate word dawg as it is generated based on word list but what about lstm-word list?

Thank You @LatifWirelessMarketer send me an email, I want to talk with you regarding the training process.
Also please delete the gibberish after `Deserialize header failed:` your making your topic hard to go through @christophered sorry for it man, I removed it. @LatifWirelessMarketer Are you using Tesseract 4.x on Windows or Linux? @christophered Tesseract 4.00alpha on windows
 @christophered I am facing one problem. After 2 weeks, I've achieved error rate of 0.61% which is good but after I generate the traineddata and tested, it give me bidi joined characters as opposite.

For example if I test it on my name as: SALMAN (سلمان) and when it detects it almost detects it correctly but lets just say سل is one character based on a whichever font I am using. So when this is what it will return (لسمان) it detects سل as لس which is wrong. 

Can you help me with this? What can be the reason behind it? As it happens with every joined character.

Thank You  Can someone help me?? @christophered ? @LatifWirelessMarketer Error rate of 0.6 is very bad, my guess is that you either:
- Have some mistakes or inconsistencies in your training data, **Your training data**
- Or there are some characters that are causing confusion, **Tesseract itself**

Please upload your training data and the created module, so that we can have a closer look.
Also, list your step-by-step commands that you used to create the training data, create and train the lstm model, and recognize the images. Arabic has some known issues, like the one you described.
Hopefully, Ray will able to fix them.

  Hi ,

Anyone please help me in finding / Creating lang.cube.* files for all the other languages in tessdata folder. like eng language has. Please help me out in training data for cube. Or anyone already have those cube files please share with me.

Thanks and Regards,

 can i know the forum insite details See https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki#support.  I installed the tesseract through pip install. The latest version of it is 3.04.01. When I tried to compile my C++ code, it has errors with libtiff. Since the 3.05 version has abandoned such dependency, I am wondering if there is a way to upgrade my tesseract, AND AT THE SAME TIME, I can write both C++ and Python code on that. Thank you so much in advance.  Performance is important for real time OCR, mass production OCR and training.

In this RFC I'd like to discuss performance bottlenecks and potential improvements.

See also the [Tesseract wiki](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/4.0-Accuracy-and-Performance).

According to my tests with Valgrind's tool `callgrind`, these functions have the largest computational costs (ordered by decreasing time):
- memory allocations / deallocations
- `tesseract::UnicharIdArrayUtils::compare`
- `tesseract::DotProductAVX` (or the other implementations of the dot product)
- `vfprintf` (called from `snprintf`)

`tesseract::UnicharIdArrayUtils::compare` and memory allocations / deallocations are also the functions which are called most often.

I recently had a closer look at the dot product calculations and noticed that at least some input vectors are converted from `float` to `double` (which takes time). The dot product is always done with `double` values (more expensive than `float`). If memory bandwidth is the limiting factor, using `double` means doubled time compared with `float`. The current code uses 4 parallel threads. I have run some timing tests without that parallelization and got nearly the same execution time. @theraysmith, did you try using `float` for the dot product, and do you get better performance from parallelization in that part of the OCR process? Valgrind shows all callers, so I can provide that information (next week, as I'm currently busy with other things).

Regarding precision of the dot product: the addition is the critical part for the accuracy. Did you ever try some of the algorithms which help to improve that part, e. g. [Kahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm)? Maybe that would be sufficient to allow using `float` everywhere.

I used OpenMP and disabled it only in `lstm/fullyconnected.cpp` and in `lstm/weightmatrix.cpp`. The original code of the master branch shows that OpenMP works, as the real time is much less than the user time:

    real    2m50,958s
    user    7m39,712s
    sys     0m2,128s

With OpenMP disabled for the parts mentioned above, OpenMP still works, the real time increases moderately while the user time decreases:

    real    3m9,378s
    user    7m33,084s
    sys     0m2,092s
 Stack for tesseract::UnicharIdArrayUtils::compare (called 2651872 times for small hello world image):

    tesseract::UnicharIdArrayUtils::compare
    ELIST::add_sorted_and_find
    ELIST::add_sorted
    tesseract::UnicharAmbigs::InsertIntoTable
    tesseract::UnicharAmbigs::LoadUnicharAmbigs
    ... It is for LSTM:

    valgrind --tool=callgrind --dump-line=yes --verbose api/tesseract --oem 1 hello.png /tmp/hello

The output is a large file called something like `callgrind.out.1234` (replace `1234` by the process id).
I suggest using `kcachegrind` to see the results. No, it was built with `./configure  --disable-shared --disable-static 'CXXFLAGS=-Wall -g -O2'`. I usually disable the library builds because they take additional time. My first results reported above were from a very small image (single line hello world), so initialization contributes significantly.
 
With a really large image (newspaper), the result changes and `tesseract::DotProductAVX` is the dominating element. Surprisingly it is followed by `gomp_team_barrier_wait_end` and `gomp_barrier_wait_end` which according to Valgrind use nearly as much time as the dot product. Those two functions are part of OpenMP.

See also issue #898. Unrolling the loop in `tesseract::DotProductAVX` results in nearly 7 % improvement:

    # tesseract 0604.jp2 /tmp/0604 # git master, without OpenMP
    real	2m54,469s
    user	2m54,160s
    sys	0m0,304s

    # same test, but with improved tesseract::DotProductAVX
    real	2m41,855s
    user	2m41,576s
    sys	0m0,272s
 Latest numbers based on code from [FAU Erlangen](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/DDOT-Bench/blob/master/DP/src/ddot_kahan_avx_intrin.c) (thanks to @moebiusband73), Kahan part removed:

    real	2m31,514s
    user	2m31,220s
    sys	0m0,280s

That is an improvement of 12 %. Using assembler code could improve further, but I'd expect the largest improvement from using `float` instead of `double` (trying to compensate the loss of precision by using the Kahan algorithm). The conversation here is largely over my head, but I came to the bug tracker to discuss performance in 4.0, and this bug is titled "RFC: Tesseract Performance" so it seems like the right place. (Apologies if I'm wrong.)

Simple question: On the "[Neural nets In Tesseract" wiki page][nn], it says:

> On a machine with multiple cores, and AVX, an easy English image may take twice as much real time, and use 7 times the CPU as base Tesseract

But [above][a] (and elsewhere) says:

> I have had some very good results in this area, with a network 3x faster than the legacy code (for English)

I do a lot of batch OCR using Tesseract. Can I expect 4.0 to be faster by 3× or slower by 7×? If the latter, that'll be something that we'll need to plan on, since our current infrastructure took over a month to complete the last batch OCR job using 3.02. If we need 7× more servers that's a huge deal — I don't know that we'd ever upgrade if that was the case. If it's 3× faster, that's incredible.

(Sorry again if this is the wrong place to bring this up. I'm trying to get a grasp on this situation. Thank you all for all your great work.)

[nn]: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/NeuralNetsInTesseract4.00#hardware-and-cpu-requirements
[a]: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/943#issuecomment-303239929 The current 4.0 still supports the "old" OCR recognizer and is comparable to 3.05 if that is used (command line argument `--oem 0`), but there are plans to remove this feature from 4.0.

4.0 supports a new recognizer based on LSTM (`--oem 1`). The new code for LSTM uses parallel processing, so OCR can finish faster, but need more total CPU time. As 4.0 is still experimental, all timing results can change. Ray announced new trained language models for 4.0 with a smaller neural network. If that works, it could reduce CPU‌ time in comparison to 3.05.

Currently you won't reduce the infrastructure requirements with 4.0. That sounds promising, thanks @stweil. I'm perfectly happy not reducing infrastructure requirements, but increasing them 7× would be a very big deal. 

FWIW, decreasing wall time via parallelization while increasing CPU time sounds good on paper, but unless I'm missing something (totally possible), it doesn't mean much for batch jobs like ours since we run 24 OCR processes in parallel already. Our server looks like this when doing a job:

![screenshot from 2017-05-10 16-18-40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/236970/25925259/58c72140-359c-11e7-8f05-f03ba6c022fc.png) For your use case (which is similar to my own) I'd compile Tesseract without OpenMP support. Otherwise the parallelization will take a significant part of the CPU performance. What's the method you use to disable OpenMP?

Commenting `AC_OPENMP` or something else? `configure --disable-openmp` `--disable-shared --disable-static` seems to be equivalent to just `--disable-shared`.
  I got error during compilation of latest Tesseract 4.0 (5a06417eb273a3cc3e5f720ca8fa4bbaa7940ae6).
OS: Debian 7.11 x64
gcc version 4.7.2 (Debian 4.7.2-5)

Any suggestions please? Thanks a lot!

``` Oh, sorry for that. There were no problems on Ubuntu 16.04, but for compatibility purposes I have to compile with older `glibc` on Debian 7. I haven't realized that Debian 7 is that much old :smiley:  I had very limited success doing OCR in Kurdish using the trained data. I think this is because it was trained on a mix of Kurmanji (the largest dialect, written in a Latin alphabet with a few circumflexes) and Sorani (the second-largest dialect, written in a modified Persian alphabet) sources. It keeps wanting to find Arabic/Persian characters in my Kurmanji documents. I imagine that splitting the training data by alphabet (say, into Kurdish-Kurmanji and Kurdish-Sorani) would improve the OCR quality dramatically.

Please let me know if there's any way I can contribute to the Kurdish transcription quality.  Hello!

In #700 we added the packaging to release tesseract to the snaps store. But it hasn't been published there yet. Now we have a very cool new service that can help you doing that, and will take care of the continuous delivery for you.

Please take a look at https://build.snapcraft.io/
After logging in there with your github account, you can tell it to make a new release to the unstable channel in the store every time that your master branch changes. Then your latest changes will be available to all the ubuntu users out there with no effort.

We are in beta, so I would appreciate any comments about your experience using the service.

pura vida. @zdenop oh, that's sad. But I understand.
The work of automating the continuous delivery is very simple, so would you mind if I set up a mirror that keeps tesseract in the Ubuntu store updated after every change in your repo? I think that the maintainers are unnecessary intermediaries if we design good tools to automate the delivery, and safe and isolated packages so upstream developers can't break users' machines. We are working towards that, and if we do it right, at some point in the future you might like me to transfer the ownership in the store to you. We will see :)

Now this aligns nicely with a few things I have to test constantly, so happy to maintain it. I'll keep you posted about stats, feedback and such. If you need something snap or ubuntu related, just ping me.

 Hi Anida.qin, Your links return 404 page error? Thanks that worked. Sorry to reply late. I solve the problem now. Maybe I did something wrong when do the command box.train  . It goes with the invalid .tr file. But there is also broken line there, but finally i found it can be ignored if you only have few CreateInt() lines when use command mftraining. So i closed this issue.  Reading the forum, it seems a lot of people would benefit from having a screenshot mode where Tesseract would automatically process the image to increase the accuracy. I.E. enlarging image, making into black and white, and so on.
Is it possible to implement such feature?
Thanks! >https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/blob/master/prog/pdf2mtiff

It's just a bash script that calls ghostscript.

Users can invoke it directly. VietOCR has this mode already and improves the quality significantly, sometimes sharpening the image helps as well. If not adding this feature at least the "golden" standard what to do with screenshot to make it work with tesseract would be helpful. 

I'm just guessing upscaling by 312.5% to get from 96dpi to 300dpi of windows screenshots, then I do sharpening and then putting it to grayscale. Is there something I shouldn't do? Or something I'm missing? If there is no screenshot feature, at least tell us what we should do in the scripts imagemagick . You have guidelines for scanned text, rotate, remove noise, remove borders etc... Give us at least something which is focused for screenshots.  An implementation could also get pairs of _image file name_ and _output base_ from the file list instead of image files only. That would allow more flexibility. CC: @jbreiden  The sum of the 5 individual tesseract processes is ~2m 46s real time, quicker than batching images in a single process. That's not quite what we were expecting to see. Anyone know why? @jbarlow83 

This might be related to the adaptive learning that Tesseract does. Here are my results for a simple hello world image.

Summary for default language (identical to `-l eng`):

- PNG and TIFF show similar performance
- TIFF multi-page and list of single page TIFF show similar performance and are much faster than calling Tesseract for each single page
- LSTM takes more CPU time than old engine for this example

Summary for language with very large `traineddata`:

- no text recognized
- old engine takes much longer (otherwise similar to the results above)
- LSTM comparable to result with default language (but no text recognized)

 Yesterday I had a look on the implementation to see where I could add the page separator and found that it is already there:

The parameter `include_page_breaks` enables a page separator string in output text after each image / page. It is disabled by default.

The parameter `page_separator` sets the string used as page separator. It is set to the form feed character by default.

So the desired behavior is achieved by `tesseract multipage.tif /tmp/multipage -c include_page_breaks=1`. It adds the `FF` character after each page (also after the last page which would not be necessary).

I noticed that Tesseract also adds an empty line at the end of each page. Do we need / want that? I'd prefer to get rid of it. I suggest to remove the `include_page_breaks` parameter, remove the empty line at the end of each page, and always use the `page_separator` parameter. Then each page will be terminated by the `FF` character by default for text output. Setting `page_separator` to the `LF` character would restore the old behaviour, setting it to an empty string would omit page separators.

Would that be fine for everybody? @theraysmith? There was no answer to my previous suggestion. If people agree, I'll prepare a pull request which removes `include_page_breaks` and which always uses the `page_separator` parameter. https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/4c7c960bfd57c5863fe639afab801080d9ef8bbe

 My question is: Are you sure that any text editor can handle form feed? The ones which I know (more than 10) can handle form feed. So do all printers (which really do a form feed).
 Including Notepad?

See the discussion which led to the patch:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/tesseract-dev/VsgJ9R-cTQ0/OMeDjYWoAdQJ Notepad cannot be used reasonably with text files which use the common LF line endings – it expects CRLF. So it does not work with text files generated by Tesseract, and FF is only an additional detail. Maybe that's why I did not count Notepad as an editor.

As I suggested to keep the `page_separator` parameter, it would still be possible to use the tricks mentioned in the discussion which you cited. >There was no answer to my previous suggestion. If people agree, I'll prepare a pull request which removes include_page_breaks and which always uses the page_separator parameter.

I agree :-)  I'm trying to create a C++ project by visual studio 2015. But I can not find anywhere that I can download the include and lib file to import to my project. Anyone help me plz.  Use the [RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization) idiom, e.g., to help prevent memory leaks.

RFC about ccutil/raiileptonica.h?

(2017-05-18 Heavily edited down.) Code freeze.

To review the latest commit, start with ccutil/raiileptonica.h; the other files can then be considered independently of each other. If there are no global issues, I can still divide up the latest commit (by directory, by file, ...but hopefully not by function!).

(Added) Hold on... renaming Ptr->Ref. :-)

(Added, edited) Which is better: `/*non-const*/ PixRef pix(...);` with `return pix.release();`, or `const PixRef pix(...);` with `return pixClone(pix.get();`? I'm leaning right, because const is better than non-const, but it has an extra `pixClone()`... and it suggests sharing semantics while `release()` is more like `std::move()`.

(Added) Which is better: `/*non-const*/` or `/*var*/`? Unfortunately, `const` was added to C/C++ as an afterthought, where it should have been the default. (Leaving the reader in limbo by omitting the comment impedes _instant_ comprehension and therefore seems inefficient and impolite to me.) Interesting proposal.

Here are a few things to consider with respect to the use of RAII with leptonica (I'm sure there are others, but I haven't thought much about this):

* does tesseract already use safe or shared ptrs, and if so, how does this proposed implementation fit with that; or if tesseract does not, would RAII be extended to all allocated data?

* leptonica is a C library with relatively little use of const (pretty much just for c strings).  An application that uses a lot of const leptonica variables will be very messy.

* leptonica uses ref counting clones to simplify resource ownership and make it easier for the developer to avoid memory leaks and double frees.  Clones are not thread safe; there's no locking in leptonica.  Would RAII change that?

* do the methods proposed here for exception handling clean up memory, or would they leak and therefore you have to crash the program?  (Does tesseract have exit calls on error?) >does tesseract already use safe or shared ptrs

It uses C++11's `unique_ptr` in the new lstm code.
C++11's `shared_ptr` is not used.

Old code does not use RAII.

>how does this proposed implementation fit with that; 

It uses `unique_ptr` with custom deleter that automatically calls pixDestroy() when the scope ends.

>would RAII be extended to all allocated data?

That's what we wish to do.
 Regarding Dan's points, in the same order, and with `Pix` standing in for any leptonica type:
* See Amit's answer. I've only applied the types in local scope, so none of the function/procedure signatures have changed, let alone the public API. Interestingly, you could also apply RAII to `FILE`, although that raises the issue of error handling when writing. BTW, currently Tesseract very rarely evaluates the value returned by `fclose()`, even when writing!
* The `const` only applies to the `PixRef`, not to the referent. So it's like `Pix* const pix`, not `const Pix* pix`.
* `PixRef` merely calls `pixDestroy()` at the appropriate time, nothing more. None of C++'s smart pointers make their _referents_ thread-safe. You can't even reliably change a `unique_ptr` or a `shared_ptr` _smart-pointer instance_ while another thread could be using or changing it. The only thing you know is that `shared_ptr`'s underlying reference count handling is thread-safe. BTW, a `PixRef` would manage just a single reference count, because `boost::intrusive_ptr`, which would also call `pixClone()` at the appropriate time (not possible for, e.g., `Pixa`) would be... too intrusive (Tesseract does not yet use that library), and neither it nor `std::shared_ptr` would be very useful for local-only usage.
* So far it only lightens the mental burden of guarding the exits of the functions/procedures (unfortunately I only found 1 leak for leptonica types), and it makes the code a bit shorter (at the expense of having to use `get()` a lot). This is low-hanging fruit, exception safety would require a lot more concerted effort. There was an issue #529 recently with `exit()` and a static variable that was destroyed while a non-static variable was still holding references to it, causing the static variable's destructor to complain... so even `exit()` has problems, in C++ at least. :-)

(Edited) "These types merely call"->"`PixRef` merely calls", "from another thread without locking said instance"->"while another thread could be using or changing it", removed repetitive "so far" @Raf

Thank you very much for your clear and thorough explanation of my questions!

I was also glad you found that "unfortunately" there are essentially no memory corruption/leak issues from leptonica usage in tesseract, even though nearly everything happens on the heap  ;-) Ah, but I only looked at local usage, and I did actually "wonder" whether using a `PixRef** pix` parameter without looking at the current value of `*pix`, as happens often in Tesseract, was always a responsible thing to do: I would require it to always be NULL as a precondition (with a check or at least a diagnostic), or always `pixDestroy()` a non-NULL value as part of the contract.

So the idea of my (off-line) query was to make you aware of a proposed set of C++ types to help manage those references, perhaps even to standardise them as part of leptonica++, so to say (an add-on, not a replacement). Any thoughts there, about the names perhaps (I thought PixRef would better fit the limited responsibility than PixPtr)? It would also be easy enough to _derive_ `PixPtr` from `std::unique_ptr<Pix>`, and give it an extra function to allow `pix.p()` with the same meaning as `pix.get()`, saving two characters each time and not letting the raw-pointer access function tail visually wag the variable dog, which together might otherwise get annoying to the point that people reject the idea of using a smart pointer, and I actually think it was a bad decision to make it that _difficult_ to access the raw-pointer value.

(Was initially incomplete, now fixed.) Prefer const + clone() to non-const + release(). The rules may be "simple", but this is C++, so we should expect to be able to program at a higher level of abstraction than C allows, and leave matters of ownership and guarding all the exits (mostly) behind us, even if there are still too many problems left to achieve exception safety.

I do remember the example you're talking about, in baseapi.cpp, which looked particularly weird to me because it would first sort of _abandon_ `lbox` (`L_INSERT`)... and then still `L_CLONE` it further down, so that was sort of a surprise. This is probably straightforward enough if you are familiar with the function `boxaAddBox()` where the `L_INSERT` occurred (assumedly the instance gets added to a container as-is, and not, e.g., serialised and destroyed), but it _feels_ wrong because it forces you to still think at that level. In my replacement, the `BoxRef` keeps the object alive throughout its scope (until the eventual `~BoxRef()`), whatever else happens, and in the meantime it can be `L_CLONE`d an arbitrary number of times. Strictly speaking, there are 2 more reference-count manipulations (one for `L_CLONE` instead of `L_INSERT`, then one for `boxDestroy()` inside `~BoxRef()`), but I think you have to strip the program of all functionality before that becomes noticeable. The story with `pix` is even simpler.

A `PixRef` just manages one reference count, whether it's from copying or cloning: the constructor takes over one reference, and the destructor destroys it. See for example `const PixRef word_in_xheight(pixCopy(NULL, pix));` in devanagari_processing.cpp... well, the other occurrences are all with `reset()`.

(Edited) "feels"->_feels_, are [->all] with >(Edited) "feels"->feels, are [->all] with

@rfschtkt, you don't have to add notes after fixing typos / grammar mistakes.
Just fix it :-)
 Don't get me wrong.  Lots of C++ users of leptonica prefer to use them with scoped ptrs, and I think that's fine.  Chacun à son goût.

I did wonder about the CLONE vs COPY case for adding a pix to a pixa, for example.  If you use the CLONE and later change the pix, the version in the pixa is also changed.  So sometimes you'd prefer to use a COPY, which gives you two instances of the image.  The copy cannot be wrapped with a scoped ptr, because it's made internally in pixaAddPix(), but it probably doesn't matter because that pix will be destroyed when pixaDestroy() is called.

Does this also work when you INSERT a PixRef->p() into a pixa?  (i.e., how does the scoped ptr handle know that it has transferred ownership to the pixa?  Do you have to do an explicit reset?) _Not_ paragraph by paragraph:

It's just a reference, i.e., a notch in the `refcount` (that's why I renamed it `PixRef`). Use `pixref.p()` like `pixpointer`, `pixClone(pixref.p())` or (equivalently) `pixref.clone()` like `pixClone(pixpointer)`, and `pixref.release()` like `pixpointer` later followed by `pixpointer = NULL;` (typically omitted, of course).

You could equivalently do `pixaAddPix(pixa.p(), pix.p(), L_CLONE);` or `pixaAddPix(pixa.p(), pix.clone(), L_INSERT);`, or, if you aren't using `pix` afterwards, `pixaAddPix(pixa.p(), pix.release(), L_INSERT);`, but I would avoid the latter (no `const PixRef`) and prefer the first over the second (shorter, doesn't needlessly use extra feature `clone()`).

The `PixRef` doesn't "know" what happened with the pointer you got from `p()`, so if you are granting/releasing ownership you must use `clone()`/`release()` instead (again, I would prefer a `const PixRef` and cloning, just because we can, because it's reference-counted, no unique ownership implied); "explicit" `reset()` after `p()` would be incorrect because the `PixRef` would call `pixDestroy()` on the old value.

(Added) I think the correct expression is "À chacun son goût.", but that's probably a lost battle.

(Added) Well, maybe if the scope is short, `release()` could also be used, but for a longer scope I prefer to know in advance whether something is a value or a variable, so to say.

(Edited) [[-> (typically omitted, of course)]], [[The [pointer->`PixRef`] doesn't "know" what happened with the pointer you got from `p()`, so if you are [explicitly->] [transferring->granting/releasing] ownership you must use [->`clone()`/]`release()` instead]], [[just->"explicit"]] :-P Just keeping myself honest... Hmm, should it be `clone()`, or `detach()`? They would have the same effect, but the former is clearer if you're more familiar with leptonica, and the latter if you're more familiar with `boost::intrusive_ptr`. If you would want to also add, e.g., `copy()`, then the obvious choice is `clone()`, but I don't think that it would be beneficial to go down that road.

(Added) Why is there no `boxaClone()`, even though there is a `Boxa::refcount` field (which seems to be used by `boxaCreate()` and `boxaDestroy()`)?

(Added) On the other hand, `intrusive_ptr` has a _non-explicit_ constructor that by default _doesn't_ consume its argument (unless there's a second argument `false`), so maybe taking it as a model would be more confusing than beneficial... :-)

(Added) So basically the last 3 commits are tentative, just exploring some possibilities. OK, let's get this done, because _RAII is awesome!_
* 1st Leptonica: `PixPtr` (you can't use -> with a "reference" in C++, dummy!) / `PixRef` (as in "one reference")?
* 2nd Leptonica: yes (far less visual dog wagging) / no (straight-up `unique_ptr`)?
* 3rd Leptonica (only if 2nd, I suppose): yes (more `const`) / no (straight-up `unique_ptr`)? if the former: `detach()` (like boost) / `clone()` (Leptonica-specific)?
* 4th Leptonica (only if 3rd, and only if `detach()`, I suppose): yes (more `const`) / no (lame!)?

(My current preferences are weakly or strongly on the left, so not exactly the current code.)

Once the design is fixed, I should probably collapse 1+2 and 3+4, or 1+2+3+4, and then maybe split them up again by directory, or something else.

(And to think I was actually just looking at the code to find out how to maybe get Tesseract to avoid recognising dotted lines as extra characters...) OK, I'm confused, but you should really be having this conversation with tesseract maintainers and developers, and in particular with Ray Smith.  Leptonica isn't going to change (e.g., into a C++ library).

To clone a boxa, use boxaCopy(..., L_CLONE)

As for the const issue, as mentioned before, leptonica doesn't use const as part of the function contract except for char* names (e.g., file paths).  Therefore, using const leptonica data in tesseract will be very ugly with all the const-removing reinterpret_cast<...> stuff
 "OK, I'm confused"
Then I have failed miserably... :-(

"Leptonica isn't going to change (e.g., into a C++ library)."
Smart pointers can be used with unchanged C code, no active cooperation required.

"To clone a boxa, use boxaCopy(..., L_CLONE)"
Ah so... but it still seems easier to just directly manipulate `refcount` for all types, as an orthogonal implementation of `detach()`.

I think I already mentioned that the `const` is about the pointer, not the referent: it's a const pointer, not a pointer to const. BTW, in C++, if you want to change a type that's declared `const`, use `const_cast`, not `reinterpret_cast`, which is not even allowed to remove `const`.

(Edited) 1st sentence of 4th paragraph I agree with everything, except perhaps blame for my confusion ...  :-)

Don't know how much benefit you get from enforcing constancy of the pointer, which typically only changes if it's "in-place" with a free and a heap allocation.  These are very infrequent; e.g., pixTransferAllData() and pixSwapAndDestroy(). It's a zen thing, it achieves stillness... (I don't know what I'm talking about.)

More prosaically, you can probably grasp code far quicker if you can instantly distinguish between values and variables. If you see `const`, you know you wouldn't have overlooked `pix.reset(pixConvertTo8(pix.p(), false));` somewhere between the definition of `pix` at the top of the function and its use half a page lower, because the compiler already checked that for you. So why not use it wherever you can? And that's even before potential concurrency, where invariability _really_ shines, and where `const` becomes even more valuable (pun not intended)!

Unfortunately, in C/C++, `const` was an afterthought, with a (5+1)-character handicap for values, unlike, e.g., Scala's `val`/`var` equal start. That's why I compensate or overcompensate by documenting variables, preferably providing a rationale. Those `/*non-const*/` comments look ugly to me and make the code less readable. You mean `std::unique_ptr</*non-const*/ T>`? Yeah, that gets unwieldy.

Maybe I can do better:
```
$ grep 'UPC\|UPNC' api/baseapi.cpp
template<typename T> using UPNC = std::unique_ptr</*non-const*/ T>;
template<typename T> using UPC  = std::unique_ptr<      const   T>;
  /*used with reset()*/ UPNC<PageIterator> page_it(GetIterator());
    if (! UPC<PageIterator>(AnalyseLayout())) {
  const UPNC<ResultIterator> it(GetIterator());
    const UPC<char[]> para_text(it->GetUTF8Text(RIL_PARA));
  const UPNC<ResultIterator> res_it(GetIterator());
      const UPC<char[]> grapheme(res_it->GetUTF8Text(RIL_SYMBOL));
  const UPNC<ResultIterator> res_it(GetIterator());
      tsv_str += UPC<char[]>(res_it->GetUTF8Text(RIL_SYMBOL)).get();
      const UPNC<char[]> text(it->GetUTF8Text(RIL_SYMBOL));
  const UPC<char[]> text(GetUTF8Text());
  const UPC<PageIterator> it(AnalyseLayout());
$ 
```

Here you started a line of code with a comment. This makes my brain read the whole line as a comment. You also implanted a comment in the middle of line, which makes it even worst.

IMO, comments should be put before code block or at the end of line. but not at line's start or in the middle of line. Then you should re-train your brain, because only `//` does that.

Also, syntax highlighting is not frivolous. Use an editor that supports it!

(Added) Oh well, it might as well be omitted. I would always wonder whether `const` is missing for a reason, but I guess that's just me... Any other general impediment(s) before I re-stage this (once!) for detailed review and merge? Or is it OK after a change back to PixPtr (instead of PixRef) and removing those non-const-related comments? Anything related to "TODO"?

(Edited) re-educate->re-train to make it rhyme :-) Eliminated even more *Destroy() calls, squashed commits for "RAII: Leptonica types".

If you like to have 159 fewer lines of code (~~after~~before the addition of ccutil/raiileptonica.h), please review now, otherwise I'll probably just close this by the end of the month.

(2017-05-30 Added) TODO: member variables?

(2017-05-31 Added) Interesting problem with that (think baseapi.h -> thresholder.h -> `ImageThresholder::pix_`): how do you isolate a header file from leptonica's/Leptonica's (which?) "allheaders.h" (BTW, why not "leptonica.h"?! imagine if all libraries used "allheaders.h"!)? People do all kinds of altogether harmful things to limit the amount of included code and/or isolate from possible changes (less relevant here), like using forward declarations (if you misspell anything or there's a change, you won't know until link time) and the pimpl idiom (not only are you responsible for all the boilerplate to hook it up, but you pay for it forever with runtime overhead). But what when it gets to a `unique_ptr` with a custom deleter? The compiler inevitably has to know the internal layout of the deleter to know the size of the `unique_ptr` (if the deleter has state, it is kept in the `unique_ptr` instance, not at arm's length as with `shared_ptr`... right?). Surely the client shouldn't have to forward-and-a-half-declare the deleter... You probably need two headers: one for forward declarations, and one normal header (or one header that can wear two hats, guided by a macro). Time for some modernisation of the legacy `#include` mechanism! Do [modules](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html) address this?

(2017-06-03 Added) Current tally for Leptonica-related commits: 169 fewer lines (before the addition of ccutil/raiileptonica_forward.h and ccutil/raiileptonica.h).  I followed the steps in https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling#linux

thanks  I installed tesseract 3.05 (because other version previous one the 3.05 I don't find) and all it's ok, but so isn't the version 4.0 ready?
thanks 4.0 can be compiled without an error by the continuous integration tests, in several of my test environments and by other people, too. So we need your help to find what is special in your case.

Could you have a look at the file `ccstruct/.deps/blobbox.Plo`? It must include an entry `/usr/include/inttypes.h`. That file defines the `PRId32` macro.

Try also a simplified build like this:

    git clone https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract.git
    cd tesseract
    ./autogen.sh
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
    ./configure
    make
 From checking for similar error messages it appears that CentOS 7 and a few other versions of CentOS only define the PRId32 macro when the macro `#define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS 1` is set. @oscaroxy, check if manually passing this via `CPPFLAGS='-D__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS=1'` resolves the issue.

It's not clear to me where Tesseract actually includes <inttypes.h>, so define it globally as a test.

 We have two options:
1) Fix this issue (only relevant when the system glibc < 2.18)
2) Document the solution with the environment variable. I'd fix the issue by always setting `__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS` (that won't harm for newer glibc).

For the future, the format macros (also `REFFORMAT`) could be avoided by using C++ code instead of C format strings. Would including `cinttypes` instead of `inttypes.h` also fix the problem? In fact:
#ldd --version
ldd (GNU libc) 2.17

I think using `cinttypes` is the better solution for C++ code like it is used in Tesseract.
Done in pull request #927. I prepared definitions of Docker containers and scripts that helps to compile and run Tesseract 4, take look at this: https://github.com/tesseract-shadow/tesseract-ocr-compilation  This error case results in fout_ == nullptr.
Closing a nullptr file is not allowed.

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil <sw@weilnetz.de> The problem was reported as part of issue #529.  Was it solved? No, this is still an issue. `./configure && make distclean` fails in the source root directory. @Shreeshrii, now you can close this issue. It was fixed with PR #968 for the master branch and PR #971 for 3.05.  but allow failures

currently failing all this does it show you that the patches that are used in `brew` to build tesseract from source aren't up to date.

the long build time looks like an anomaly, try killing the travis process and restart it That new test now [passes without errors](https://travis-ci.org/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/jobs/233010095) (the brew formula for tesseract was fixed). Nevertheless building Tesseract with brew takes some time, so this test adds about half an hour to the Travis test time for each pull request or update of a branch. I‌ wonder whether that's reasonable.

> try killing the travis process and restart it

That won't help, because it takes that time to build Tesseract and all of its prerequisites.  When Tesseract terminates by calling the exit function,
the destructor of any local auto variable is not called.

Fix two cases by using static variables.

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil <sw@weilnetz.de> Maybe we should use return instead of exit() Tesseract code includes more than 70 calls of `exit()`. Using `return` is a lot of work, even in `main()` (I already tried it). And static variables also reduce the stack frame size. I know someone who will be happy. :-) Yes, that sounds like the correct solution for C++ code. but not in Google projects... The 2nd commit fixes issue #529. Now Valgrind is happy, too:

Up to now, little endian tesseract works with the new zip format.

More work is needed for training tools and big endian support and also to maintain
compatibility with the current proprietary format.

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil <sw@weilnetz.de> Open questions:

- Do we want a new format? As I'm not the first one who had the idea, I think the answer is yes.
- Do we need support for both old (current) and new format? I'd drop support for the old format
  and remove `combine_tessdata`.
- Should the `traineddata` files in the new format add `.zip` to the file names? I'd omit `.zip`.
- Should the code for minizip be added to the Tesseract sources, or should we add an external dependency to libminizip-dev?
- Which one is better, zip or compressed tar? `libminizip-dev` was added in Ubuntu Xenial (16.04), so the current Travis build environment which is based on Ubuntu Trusty does not provide it. On my Debian system I find these libraries: [`minizip`](https://github.com/madler/zlib/tree/master/contrib/minizip) (supported since 16.04), [`libzip`](https://nih.at/libzip/) (supported since 12.04), [`zzlib`](http://zziplib.sourceforge.net/zzip-file.html) (supported since 12.04), [`libarchive`](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive)  (supported since 12.04). As far as I know all use licenses which are compatible with Tesseract. I assume any of those can be used and expect that none of them will be available as a binary for Windows (maybe also not for macOS), but I did not have a look. Zip format reduces `eng.traineddata` from about 31 MiB to 16 MiB (48 % compression) by default. `zip -9` improves the compression to 49 %. Other compressed formats achieve even better compression values:

See [this discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!searchin/tesseract-dev/zip|sort:date/tesseract-dev/U5HSugUeeeI) in the forum. I added a link to GitHub there. > libarchive handles all formats

It is also supported by current Linux distributions and would be interesting if compressed tar instead of zip is preferred. I added it to my previous post. > What about lz4?

It does not compress very good (see result added to the list above). Rebased and added support for `libzip`. This is experimental code, as there is still no decision whether compressed archives should be supported at all, if yes with which format and which library.

The current code uses `libzip`, if that is not found `minizip`. If neither of those is found, it uses the normal code. I prepared the code for more experiments to support compressed tar archives with `libarchive` for example. As you can see [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/pull/911/files#diff-4ec9988bbd350d92539e7ee9a30a2f91R48), the implementations for the two currently supported libraries are very similar. The latest code also supports `libarchive` (highest priority). With that library, all kinds of compressed archives should work (up to now I tested with zip only). As `libarchive` indeed supports all formats, I could compare the time needed for each format. Tesseract was run 5 times on each format with English on a simple hello world text. Below is the result sorted by time in seconds for each test. Interpretation:

- The original Tesseract format, uncompressed tar and lz4 tar are similar and fastest.
- zip needs about 150 ms more time than the original Tesseract format.
- 7z and xz tar need about 850 ms more time than the original Tesseract format.
- bz2 tar is slowest and needs about 1450 ms more time than the original Tesseract format.

The file i/o from disk did not play a role in this test because of the Linux file cache and the SSD of my computer.

 lzma created the xz files. 7zip and lzma gave the best compression ratios, but both also need some time for the decompression (which is relevant for Tesseract): they need about 1.9 s more time (but still are faster than bz2).

Please note that the current code for all formats reads all parts of the `tessdata` file, no matter whether they are used or not, so the decompression overhead could be reduced. The current Tesseract code reads the whole `tessdata` file into memory and gets all data from memory. My implementation for compressed archive files does that, too. Therefore random access is trivial: all component files are in a vector of byte arrays. Why zip not tar? Maybe because zip is supported on Windows by default, while tar and other formats need additional installations? I use 7-Zip on Windows to compress and decompress files. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_archivers. > I have no objection to switching to zip (with no tar) for the tessdata files. That should be usable by everybody more easily.

On Windows, that would require a rename with `.zip`extension, or the installer must register `.traineddata` as a zipped data type. Otherwise the Windows explorer won't decompress such files easily. Personally I prefer to keep the `.traineddata` extension even for zip files (like Java does it with its `.jar` extension). Now I added implementation and timing results for zziplib. It looks like this is the fasted code for reading zipped `traineddata` files. > combine_tessdata is used for extracting components, replacing some, etc.
Probably first step can be a zippeddata file which after unzipping provides the traineddata.

Zipping a tessdata file means extracting the components from that file and writing a zip archive file which includes those components. So combine_tessdata can be replaced by your favorite zip / unzip program. We are talking about 2: files in zip archive format which include compressed components.

Such files can be written and read by all common operating systems. Linux file explorers are clever and know how to handle such files even if they are named `eng.traineddata`. The Windows explorer is not clever. It expects a know file extension. So if users want to see what is inside of `eng.traineddata` and use the Windows explorer as a GUI replacement for `combine_tessdata`, I must set a Windows registry key which tells the file explorer that the `traineddata` extension is handled like `zip`. > This would help us to have installation of 3.05 and 4.00 at the same time and to avoid mistakes like using combine_tessdata on compressed data.

Currently `combine_tessdata` crashes when it is tried with a compressed archive. It can be made more robust to simply fail with such data, or it could report if it gets a zipped archive (if we restrict to zip support). Such code can also be back ported to 3.05. I don't think that using the same `tessdata` directory for 3.05 and for 4.x is a good idea. Therefore I don't think that 4.x needs a different file extension for `tessdata` in zip format.

Platform support is good on Linux (minizip in latest distributions, libzip, libzzip and libarchive also in older ones), but macOS with brew should also support all four libraries (untested), and so does Cygwin with Mingw-w64 for Windows. I don't know the situation for Visual Studio, but expect that small libraries like `libzzip` for example are much easier to build than larger libraries with more functionality like `libarchive`. Then I suggest to use `libzzip` (sometimes also called `zziplib`) if zip support is sufficient because it looks like the fastest one, and it is also small.

`libarchive` is a good choice (the only one I know) if any common compressed archive format should be supported. > Would same extension cause confusion as to which version of traineddata file was being used?

Software can detect the format automatically. That can be added to 3.05, too, so that version would simply refuse to read files in the wrong format.

With a standard archive format (like zip), it would be easy to write additional information into the archive files, for example a README or a VERSION file. Tesseract would ignore any such component which it does not know. zziplib seems to be inactive for years.

Choosing more than one library and one format for compression will make maintenance more complicated. > zziplib seems to be inactive for years.

Then either it is a small and stable code, or it is unsupported for some reason.
Which library would you suggest? Check what other well known projects use.
For example, the Debian cmake package depends on zlib and libarchive. > zziplib seems to be inactive for years.

It was unmaintained for several years until some weeks ago. I found it maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/gdraheim/zziplib). Speed is more important than disk space. That means LZ4 is probably the best candidate, as the English test indicated. It was designed for this sort of situation and is the tool of choice for e.g. Linux kernel and initramfs decompression on low memory devices.
https://lz4.github.io/lz4/#interoperable-lz4 > Speed is more important than disk space.

We are talking about typically less than 300 ms needed for large zip archives, so a Tesseract run with several languages would maybe run 1 s longer with zip archives. Is that too much when typically Tesseract runs for much more than 10 s?

Tesseract could be optimized by processing many image files in a single run. Then loading of `tessdata` files is needed only once. If a standard format is used for `traineddata`, we no longer can derive the data endianness from the file format. So either endianness information must be added somewhere in the archive (in the `config` component?), or all code must be changed to read and write a fixed endianness. I have a personal opinion on this issue, but in the end that's something @theraysmith must decide. @stweil My typical Tesseract workload is tens of thousands of images in a cloud. Combining disparate images into a multipage TIFF is a pain. My files come as PDFs anyway; it's a good format to normalize files to. Then I use my program ocrmypdf to split them into one page images and recombine. In short, I map-reduce Tesseract processes over single page images, with all the usual scaling and robustness benefits. A long running process that does a lot of work is expensive to have crash.

Since AWS compute time is per unit time, adding 1 second per Tesseract process would be something like a 1-2% increase in my bills, while decreasing storage would have no measurable savings because the incremental gain is small compared to the size of the operating system. (And most charge for a pool of storage rather than storage actually used.)

I do support the change, I just think LZ4 hits the sweet spot for this sort of problem. @jbarlow83, I did not mean using multipage TIFF images, but enhancing the Tesseract command line API to allow passing more than one image file. That should reduce the compute time for your use case already with the current `traineddata` file format. Another Benchmark:
https://github.com/powturbo/TurboBench >Tesseract could be optimized by processing many image files in a single run. Then loading of tessdata files is needed only once.

Actually, this feature is supported with 4.0/3.x. > Actually, this feature is supported with 4.0/3.x.

I did not know that. How would I start Tesseract to process page1.png and page2.png in a single run? Prepare a text file that has the path to each image:

```
path/to/1.png
path/to/2.png
path/to/3.tiff
```

Save it, and then give its name as input file to Tesseract.

`tesseract savedlist output` Thank you, good to know that. It looks like the ChangeLog, other documentation and the program help text need an update.

Currently all pages are written to one output file (per format). Some formats include page information (hOCR, PDF). Others like TXT don't, but could use a page separator character (ASCII 0x0C = FF). Would it help to support an output base parameter with placeholders like page number or image base name to generate one output file per input image? Maybe we should discuss the multi page feature in another issue.

I don't like mailing lists. Also Ray replies more in Github issues/PRs. 
What about opening a new repo on Github for dev discussions via issues? The multi-page feature was added in 2014 by commit 25a8c7b72006a11ba0b31dfd5210f7b9401eb27d. Guys, can you add checkboxes to the eng.traineddata?

 I'd like to summarize the current status:

- A new format would be good, and there is a preference for the `zip` format.
- The new format would replace the old one for Tesseract 4 (no fallback necessary).
- We can keep the current names (*.traineddata). 3.05 won't load new format, 4.x won't load old format.
- `libarchive` seems to be the best choice to implement the `zip` format as it is widely available and supported.
- The `zip` format no longer includes an implicit indicator for the endianness of the trained data. A fixed endianness (little endian) for stored data does not look like a possible option for now, so an explicit endianness indicator must be added to the data in the config component.

Is there anything I missed or are there other opinions? If not, I'd implement the code and create a pull request. Rebased PR and fixed merge conflicts. @theraysmith commented:

@stweil commented:

>We are talking about 2: files in zip archive format which include compressed components.

It seems to me that Stefan and Ray are thinking about two different ways to implement compression:

Stefan's way is to create one zip archive from the files in traineddata. 
combine_tessdata won't be needed anymore. The user will use an external program to compress and decompress the traineddata (zip) file. 
Stefan patch adds the ability to read (uncompress) the zip archive by TessdataManager.

Ray's way is to use the zlib library directly to compress individual files inside traineddata without creating a zip archive.
combine_tessdata will still be needed by the user.
 Thank you, Amit, for the clarification. Yes, I'd replace the proprietary `tessdata` format by the standard `zip` format. Users could still use `combine_tessdata` (it would support both old and new format), but they could also use any other program (for example the Windows file explorer which can handle zipped files) to create or expand the new tessdata files in zip format.

As there was a preference for using `libarchive`, there would even be more options because that library supports a whole range of compression and archive formats. Some of those formats compress the whole archive (typically a `tar` format) instead of compressing the single components. Ray seems to want just zlib without anything else.

We need an 'OK' from him to go in your way which depends on another library.  A wrong array index must raise an assertion instead of printing an
error message and continuing program execution.

Replace also floor by floorf which can be faster.

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil <sw@weilnetz.de> Some random thoughts while waiting for my pull requests to be merged:

How about C++-style `static_cast<int>()` instead of C-style `(int)`? Since casting to integral types rounds toward 0, you can also omit the `floorf()` if `bottom` is known to be nonnegative... unless any overhead is known to be negligible or eliminated by the compiler anyway (probably not, unless the compiler can somehow deduce the sign of the value at compile time)? If you capture this in a macro or in an always-inlined function (has C++11 standardised that?), it doesn't even have to be explained every time.

It's also quite ad hoc: a separate issue, and only addressed locally. That's true. While looking closer on that code, I noticed that it can be more simplified. We don't need float operations here. I'll update the commit. Shree, Ray does his reviews **after** Zdenko merges PRs here. @stweil Hmm, I suspect that g++ kept -Wconversion out of -Wall/-Wextra because otherwise too much existing code would have to be adapted, not because not using casts for floating-integral conversions is necessarily a good idea... just my 2 cents. MS VC produces 1453 warnings for Tesseract (see results from Appveyor CI), most of them caused by data type conversions. It looks like most developers don't like fixing this kind of warning, and gcc simply supports that. :-) Should we make it less verbose there? No, I don't think so. We should make the release builds with configure / make more verbose (`gcc -Wall` is currently only used for debug builds).  Hey, i have been using tesseract for text extraction from images. But due to some unknown reasons, it is unable to extract text from some images even if the image is clean. I am unable to find the reason for this. Is there anything that i am missing in preprocessing?

  Use the [RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization) idiom, e.g., to help prevent memory leaks. Build error: https://travis-ci.org/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/jobs/230329088#L290. Yes, I think it's a bug in that g++ version (4.8.4). I had successfully built with 5.4.0. I'll try again with an explicit move constructor... Are they all tested? I think that it was valid C++11, though.

Amended, pushed...

And again... Since you change the API, I think we need Ray's approval for this PR. If that's public API and cast in stone, maybe there should be two versions, with the backward-compatible version calling the safe version with release(). Or the leak could be fixed ad hoc, but that's not really progress.

(Added) Is the public API not tested?

(Added) I don't see any documentation mentioning `ccmain/resultiterator.h` as part of the API? Ah, apparently the result of `tesseract::TessBaseAPI::GetIterator ()`, that sounds very API-ish. I would start with fixing the leak with the current API.
~~If you want to do it, open a new PR.~~

Fixing a leak is still progress... Maybe tomorrow, but I would still suggest to add a new version and deprecate the current one, because this is C++, and RAII is one of C++'s most useful idioms (to put it mildly). That's why I made a new thread called `RAII`, not `lookifoundaleak`... Yes, but it can also return nullptr, and I hadn't yet figured out whether there's a difference with the empty string. Adding to a STRING is apparently the same for nullptr and empty string, but maybe not other applications. And there's at least one use of release() that would then instead have to make a new copy.

(Correction) I meant strdup() instead of strcpy(), but that's even more expensive because it needs two passes, so let's stick with "make a new copy".

(Added) virtual ResultIterator::GetUTF8Text() hides non-virtual LTRResultIterator::GetUTF8Text, that doesn't look great... Amended without API change, checks successful.
 LGTM. @stweil? I plan to run a test with Valgrind later (~ 1 day) and will add my review comment then. >but I would still suggest to add a new version and deprecate the current one, because this is C++, and RAII is one of C++'s most useful idioms (to put it mildly).

The new version of this PR uses RAII technique, without an API change :)
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29372976/is-stdunique-ptr-an-application-of-raii  There seems to be another leak in `void POLY_BLOCK::fill(ScrollView* window, ScrollView::Color colour)`, which doesn't do `delete segments;`. But I've had enough fun for now...  >I've had enough fun for now...

:laughing:  Well, it seemed to be leaked, from comparing with other uses, although I'm not 100% certain... Rebased.  Important warnings warrant attention because they may indicate real problems.
Unimportant warnings warrant attention because they obscure the important warnings.

Unfortunately for me the nicest example of the former category, where I also immediately had a solution, was already fixed independently...

This replaces earlier attempts, now up to date, on its own branch, and with some revisions. >Warnings are people too!

I see that you changed the title this time... :-) I suggest to make smaller pull requests which focus on closely related problems. That would make reviewing and pulling them much easier. Example: Make a pull request for all changes related to `NumFeatureSets`.

For that example, the `decltype(CharDesc->NumFeatureSets) i` will work. Nevertheless I personally prefer the much simpler `uinT32 i`. Even better because we want to use POSIX instead of Tesseract data types: `uint32_t i`. You mean like the diminutive "Use POSIX data types and macros" with only 21 commits and 243 files changed?

Yeah, at first I thought `typedecl()` would be less unpopular than a public `GenericVector::unsigned_size()`, but I went a bit overboard with it, and I let the cat out of the bag with `STRING::unsigned_size()` anyway, so... I've amended the pull request without any `typedecl()`, with public `GenericVector::unsigned_size()`, but with `size_t` rather than `uintT32`/`uint32_t`. I don't expect that pull request #878 will be applied like that, but yes, it consists of smaller commits which cover limited modifications and which can be applied individually. Even individual #878 commits are _way_ bigger than this whole pull request (or at least the one I randomly picked). Feel free to split it up further as you like, but I don't see the point: it's already themed by kind of warning, and the larger of the two commits is only +32/−24. Rebased.

Can someone explain me what is happening?

For information I have  2471 megabytes of memory remaning

Thanks in advance I did not built it with ubuntu.
I read in the referenced issue that we should not use it in docker image. Do you know why ? 
I need to use it in such way I will try to use it without enabled-debug option and give you the output I try using with and without --enable-debug and nothing is working.

Still the same issue:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc

My issue is not a build failure.

Build is going well. The issue is when I launch tesseract

**EDIT:** I made a try outside of a docker image by simply running the command manually and I have the same error with or without the --enable-debug
 Concerning the multiple version I have only one installed.
I won't be able to see installation directory tonight because I deleted my instance aws. I will create a new one tomorrow. Can you tell me the normal installation directory so I can check tomorrow ? 
However according the "make" documentation it should be in /usr/bin Here is my configuration:

**EDIT:** Same error with leptonica 1.74 and 1.74.1 :(

What is the minimum resources configuration to run it? Use GDB to get more info about the cause of the issue.  Asi in my previous comment I had:

I'm also still surprised that my docker test produced a different kind of error with the wrong trained data files. Sorry updated (typo issue :)) we can also use:

    mv  -v tessdata/* /usr/local/share/tessdata/ && \
    rm -rf tessadata

To have all the languages
 ~~Tesseract should verify that the tessdata file is a TIFF file.~~ My installer for Windows includes both files unconditionally. I think they should be in the docker container, too. >@amitdo Is the tessdata a tiff file???

I thought that it is a TIFF file without the tiff extension. I was wrong.  After doing much search I have found Kraken which is an open-source fork of ocropus that solves a number of issues including:

- clstm compatibility
- Right-to-left/BiDi support
- Explicit input/output handling
- Word and character bounding boxes in hOCR
- Removal of runtime dependency on gcc
- Clean public API
- ets ....

Stating Kraken's most important advantage, its workflow allows one to train new models relatively easily.

[In this research, they have managed to get 97% to 99% recognition rate of Arabic language, this rate excludes spacing and punctuation errors (2-5%).](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzDVkBcqiyEsbC16ZGktOWNiUDg/view)

What is really bothering me is that Kraken is a fork of ocropus that is using clstm, while Tesseract 4.x is the more complex and most sophisticated software that have improved ocropus techniques from scratch, but still can't achieve such practical results of Kraken.

Karken is the key to recognizing Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Persian/Farsi, etc....

@theraysmith @Shreeshrii @amitdo @zdenop 
I hope that we will be able to solve the Arabic Language in Tesseract 4.x similarly to Kraken.
Please have a look at the Kraken project, and their method as guidance:
https://github.com/mittagessen/kraken
http://kraken.re
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzDVkBcqiyEsbC16ZGktOWNiUDg/view After testing kraken v0.9.1 using provided Arabic models, I believe that 97% is in theory even with the same font that used in the training or at least not for the real situations.

same basic tests are attached
[Kraken_test_results.tar.gz](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/982008/Kraken_test_results.tar.gz)
 @bmwmy have you tested training yourself?
Kraken developer told me that those models that you presented, he made, and are not that sophisticated, maybe just for testing.
Please try to train clstm, then reply back @bmwmy have you trained using [train.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mittagessen/kraken-vagrant/master/training/train.sh) No, actually I used the downloadable models which is on the repository.
Will try to train and will give feedback. @bmwmy have you seen [this update by Ray](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/commit/3ab6581a11eea90d4dc2ba46a811447ef231b644#diff-b8c77a8bc89ffb301d80233f2874c9d3),did he add the Arabic diacritics "Harakat"?
is that a good thing or a bad thing for ocr, what do you think?
Will adding Arabic diacritics (harakat) in lstm training degrade the recognition rate, or it will it remain the same?
Can you test training text with arabic diacritics, and without diacritics and post the comparison? 
[kraken75000_vs_Tesseract.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/1176821/kraken75000_vs_Tesseract.pdf)
Hi I used @christophered trained Arabic kraken model for about 75000 lines and did comparison with latest ara.traineddata with lstm. I used standard Arabic font e.g. (Times New Roman)
The result is that tesseract make it 100% except the bug of flipping combined letters but letters are correct (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/758).
kraken mix up some letters with similar letters achieves ~97%.

for Arabic diacritics I think OCR engine should be aware of that but neglect it in the output or during ocr process.
  This is a test with caching. The [Appveyor cache](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-cache/) does not seem to work currently. According to the [documentation](https://www.appveyor.com/blog/2016/09/28/the-new-build-cache/), it is only enabled for new user accounts by default. @zdenop, you have to apply to get it enabled for your account. Wow! 3.05 now works and still needs 30 minutes. So we need the cache there, too. By the way: I think 0 warnings is not normal. Are they suppressed by compiler options? Then I suggest to raise to the next warning level. `text2image` is obviously not built, maybe because `pkg-config` is missing. See code [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/training/CMakeLists.txt#L231).  It should work without that change. If no branches are specified in `.travis.yml`, all branches are covered by Travis CI according to the [documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build#Building-Specific-Branches). I use that setting in [my own fork](https://travis-ci.org/stweil/tesseract/branches).  When I run tesseract command line program (Windows prebuilt binary, 4.0.0 alpha) on this image in LSTM mode, I get:
LoOrenm 1pPpSsSUlI

Why letters repeat? Stuttering?
In Tesseract mode (oem=0), I get correct text: Lorem ipsum

See [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/707#issuecomment-280096372) for the related discussion. I dug into this and found that letter bboxes are narrower than they should be.
Debugged hand-built Tess4 on another platform so output is a bit different from above but PageIterator::BoundingBox returns bbox narrower than actual as shown below. Seems like the same glyph image is recognized a couple of times while horizontal scan striding shorter than it should:

letter L BoundingBox=(2, 48, 375, 230)

letter I BoundingBox=(3548, 74, 3582, 236)
letter M BoundingBox=(3790, 76, 4172, 230) I also noticed double characters in the output, but they disappear (although not completely) as soon as the model gets better (~ < 0.1%).  I drew bounding box around each recognized letter in this image. While some are spot on but many off even though text is correctly recognized as "Simple Test". Note boxes are intentionally drew off at top and bottom to minimize a chance of box overlaps.

  Hey friends! 
First thanks for mantaining this open source project. 

However I must tell you that when I Installed this and clicked on Add to Path and Set TESSDATA_PREFIX variable almost everything I had on the path stopped working.
very similar to what happened to this guy here: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43014724/how-to-reset-system-variable-path-after-tesseract-installation

I've tried the solution proposed, but unluckily windows didn't make the shadow copies of my old PATH.

So now I'm here trying to piece toghether again my path...
 That's why there is a [hint](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) which suggests not to use that option. The default settings are fine. Hi Stweil, thanks for answering so fast! 
I completely missed that... guess it's my fault.

But just for a heads up I installed the 3.05.00dev version which I understand is the latest one that is stable. 
and the problem of the path happened anyways, so it's not on older versions of the installer (I understand that since 4 is experimental, version 3 isn't "old", correct me if I am)

 anyways thanks again for answering, you can close this!

If anyone gets to this thread in the future and had this happened to them, then I'll leave you the default system path that comes with WINDOWS 10, so you can restore it: 

`%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\
` > Please update the windows binaries on your site with the latest version.

Done now for both Tesseract 3.05 and Tesseract 4.  How can I reproduce this crash? `updates_` looks strange. No wonder that the code crashes when it tries to add a 0 x 0 matrix. Ray said that he needs to fix training after his last commits. When I run all but the last step with older executables, I get an error from `lstmtraining`:

    Deserialize failed: tess4training/eng/eng.Arial.exp0.lstmf read 0/72 pages

That might confirm that the last commits introduced some incompatibility. I could confirm that commit 8e79297dcefecdb929d753d28554fec51417ec39 introduced a regression. Before that commit, lstmtraining did run the iterations. https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/83588bc7a18e50fb435b5ca8a45fd7e00ab2ccdf#commitcomment-22019959

>Now back to finding out why training isn't working properly... [Here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/8e79297dcefecdb929d753d28554fec51417ec39#diff-1e1ab755e307f14ddffbad6f38cdf54aR169) `language_` is added to the serialized data, so old and new data are incompatible (this is the reason why I get the above error message). The new data is correctly handled in [ImageData::DeSerialize](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/8e79297dcefecdb929d753d28554fec51417ec39#diff-1e1ab755e307f14ddffbad6f38cdf54aR186) and in [ImageData::SkipDeSerialize](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/8e79297dcefecdb929d753d28554fec51417ec39#diff-1e1ab755e307f14ddffbad6f38cdf54aR198).

Does the training process use old files which contain old incompatible `ImageData`?  Are you sure that `--tessdata_dir ./tessdata` is correct? Shouldn't it point to the parent directory of `tessdata`? https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/881#issuecomment-299391463 I could now reproduce the assertion and the crash. @Shreeshrii, please try reverting [line 491 in `lstm/lstmtrainer.cpp`](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/8e79297dcefecdb929d753d28554fec51417ec39#diff-2321d66b4e371b97cfc510763d8f1283R491) (s/TS_ENABLED/TS_RE_ENABLE/). That fixes the assertion for me.  Hello all,

 Thank you for your help. I solved it by removing "--append_index 5"   Ray, this commit has a high probability to conflict with your work, so please select single commits as you like or just tell me which changes can be applied next or when is the best time for such changes.

It would be good to finish the transformation to POSIX data types and macros in the not too far future.  Rebased PR to trigger a new AppVeyor build ([previous build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/zdenop/tesseract/build/master.813) failed, reason unknown).  Could we just remove the i/o redirection in `cmake --build . --config Release > bin\Release\log.txt`? Writing compiler error messages to a file which cannot be read looks strange. Appveyor also supports caching. That could reduce build time significantly. Build now works. The previous errors were caused by ambiguous calls of `ClipToRange`.

Appveyor needed about 30 minutes total time with i/o redirection removed. Fixed merge conflicts and rebased PR. Fixed merge conflicts and rebased PR. Fixed merge conflicts and rebased PR. @theraysmith, as you are just preparing a new larger code change: is it possible to use POSIX data types for the new / modified code, and can we switch to POSIX for the rest of the code directly after your update? Rebased PR and fixed merge conflicts. Not this one.

>.. after the legacy engine is removed...

The legacy engine is still alive.
… @stweil estimated elsewhere that a merge of this PR will happen sometime in the next 5 years.

Optimistic guy... 😆   I'm sure that some parts of the PR are not related to the legacy engine. Maybe those can be applied now. Replacing the types and macros can be done automatically, so doing it yourself in your code could save the review. It took me more time to fix indentation of in-line comments, but I think you can do that using tools, too. Fixed 7 files with merge conflicts. Fixed merge conflict in `training/normstrngs.cpp`.  Hi,I want to build the Tesseract using the master branch.
I followed the steps as you mentioned.
But when I enter **cmake ..** I am getting the following error.
Help me on this.
Thank you

I'm using tesseract 4.00alpha with leptonica 1.74.1 on Ubuntu 14.04, first i was training on the a VirtualBox and i was able to create LSTMF files, but now i use the same tesseract, lepptonica and Ubutnu versions on a different machine (VMware) and i couldn't create LMSTF files, and i compiled the tesseract in both cases the same, according to this [website](https://medium.com/@lucas63/installing-tesseract-3-04-in-ubuntu-14-04-1dae8b748a32) ,I'm pasting part of log file that is created at tmp file......

keep in mind i copied the tessedit from the working version of tesseract and replaced it at the new machine but the same error occurred

Thanks UPDATE :-
i have installed the tesseract again today and the same error was generated but the only difference that the line number has changed

It just an info message, not an error message.

The two issues does not seem related to each other.
 as i understood from the issue 893, that guy is facing a trouble with building the tesseract with liptonica, but i built it fine and I'm even capable to detect text from images, if you can see in the log message when I'm using the tesstrain.sh i'm able yo create the data that is stored in the tmp file, my problem is in the last phase which is generating lstm files.
keep in mind that i have installed and complied the tesseract 4alpha and leptonica 1.74.1 twice, within month in between i guess, the first one works fine and I'm able to create the lstmf files, but in the second i can't amd i followed the same steps in both cases
Thanks Hi Shree,

i was thinking the same thing, its just i always follow the steps and links to install and compile from this [site](https://medium.com/@lucas63/installing-tesseract-3-04-in-ubuntu-14-04-1dae8b748a32)
so is there a way currently to solve this issue? cause i might need to install the tesseract on a server because all the work i did already on a VMware for testing purposes 
Thanks Hi,

i looked at the config.log of the tesseract revision that works, took the revision  number  and switched the tesseract to that branch while installing the tesseract, and that revision was **"4.00.00alpha-367-g5baa8c8"**
i made sure that its the correct revision by making detection of an image, i noticed that on the terminal the tesseract prints its revision number
![ocrerror](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26926171/25889397/49639c4e-3572-11e7-909e-5c7fcf8eab3c.png)
yet the same error was generated at the phase E where creating lstm files
i even tried to install the suggested revision: **"4.00.00alpha-458-g2ea946d"** and the result was the same error but different line number at the tessedit.cpp, at the revision  **"4.00.00alpha-367-g5baa8c8"** the error is: **stm_recognizer_->DeSerialize(&fp):Error:Assert failed:in file tessedit.cpp, line 202**
and at the revision **"4.00.00alpha-458-g2ea946d"** the error was
**stm_recognizer_->DeSerialize(&fp):Error:Assert failed:in file tessedit.cpp, line 193**
i even deleted that line from the tessedit.cpp and the error stayed the same, after that i tried to delete the whole tessedit.cpp and same problem, so is it loaded on somewhere ? or is it not compatible with VMware because the revision **"4.00.00alpha-367-g5baa8c8"** works fine with the virtual box but not with the VMware 
Thanks @Shreeshrii 
no worries :) i mentioned the virtual box and the VMware just in case, i just like to share the details in case they were any help, i dont know either if its virtual box or VMware, the interesting point that in both cases or in both revisions the same line of code failed 
thanks for the response @Shreeshrii are the libraries and leptonica version at this [site](https://medium.com/@lucas63/installing-tesseract-3-04-in-ubuntu-14-04-1dae8b748a32) are valid? meaning did you install them with the tesseract v4.00.00alpha-460-gb86b4fa ? Finally I'm able to create LSTM files, without switching to any other branches, the version of the tesseract is in the image below
![lstm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26926171/27028983-3370d0e8-4f6f-11e7-9377-60158f0c11a8.png)
  We are an enterprise utilizing tesseract for years, and we recently upgraded to 3.04.1 successfully by compiling from source code. When running the command below, segmentation fault is received from Ubuntu 10.04.4 (code 139). 

Does anyone have ideas as why this might occur? Thanks heaps.

   Up to now, Insight.io only shows the files with syntax highlighting. I got an error message that code analysis failed for my projects. I have sent a [pull request](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract-ocr.github.io/pull/1) which updates the documentation.

It is possible to automatically update that documentation, but that would add a new revision for each change of the master branch. Travis needs write access to the [tesseract-ocr/tesseract-ocr.github.io repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract-ocr.github.io). That part is a little bit tricky (see links above collected by @Shreeshrii).

Maybe it is sufficient to update the documentation each time a release is tagged.

New documentation is also visible [here](https://ub-mannheim.github.io/tesseract/). It's based on the latest git master branch. @stweil Hi, insight.io creator here, tesseract-ocr should work fine on insight.io with full code intelligence not just syntax highlighting. Would you mind shooting an email to chongzhe@insight.io with regarding to the errors you see, we will help you solve the issue:)

 The brew formulae is for version 3.05, while the HEAD is 4.00 (alpha). Thanks, wouldn't adding --head option like "brew install tesseract

I'm wondering how to tell brew to skip the patch...
 Dunno. I don't have a a Mac... @zdenop, maybe a new release 3.05.01 would help making such patches unnecessary. same here

I need more information because I currently cannot reproduce the build problem (building training tools works for me with MacPorts and with Homebrew).  Hi,

I'm using tesseract 4.00alpha with liptonica 1.74.1 on Ubuntu 14 to create LSTM files for multiple Arabic fonts, which some of them have the common numerical system, (1 2 3 4 ...) but some of these font contains the a different numerical system, which usually more common in the Arabic scripts, 
which are ( ٠ ١ ٢ ٣ ٤ ٥ ٦ ٧ ٨ ٩)
yet the last set of numbers were not recognize but as symbols such as ! instead of ١ ,are these numbers are not integrated in the tesseract?
Thanks  If that numerals are indeed missing from the official traineddata, I suggest to open a new issue in the langdata repo. Did Anyone fix this problem? I am not using Unix in order to be able to train tesseract on new data, but I need to use the Eastern arabic numerals. if someone fixed it and has the traineddata file, please share it with us

Thanks Persian's number's shape mostly the same as Arabic's but their Unicode is different!
Persian numbers= ۹ ۸ ۷ ۶ ۵ ۴ ۳ ۲ ۱ ۰
Arabic numbers = ٠ ١ ٢ ٣ ٤ ٥ ٦ ٧ ٨ ٩
Persian numbers' Unicode= \u06F9 \u06F8 \u06F7 \u06F6 \u06F5 \u06F4 \u06F3 \u06F2 \u06F1 \u06F0
Arabic numbers' Unicode =\u0660 \u0661 \u0662 \u0663 \u0664 \u0665 \u0666 \u0667 \u0668 \u0669
you can check them [here](https://r12a.github.io/apps/conversion/) Yes, it mixed Persian with Arabic numbers (unicode) for example the image had these numbers
۱-۲ and it recognize ۱ as Persian number and ۲ as Arabic number their shape is the same but for searching and Unicode, they are different.
in another hand 3 and 4 and 5 and 6's shape are not the same see below
6 5 4 3 
۶ ۵ ۴ ۳ >Persian
٣ ٤ ٥ ٦  > Arabic
you can check it at [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/issues/70#issuecomment-320441157) with the output txt file
 for more information see [Unicode Number, Decimal Digit' Category](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Nd/list.htm) usually, people use the un-standard keyboard (Arabic keyboard for typing Persian text) so there are many scan images of Persian's text  which have Arabic numbers like ٣ ٤ ٥ ٦  but the OCR should convert them to Persian Unicode @zdenop, please close this issue.

The issue is related to the trained **data**. not code.

As said, the right place for this issue is the langdata repo.
See https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/issues/71, https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/issues/72
  Those files can be built by doc/generate_manpages.sh.

The manpages are needed for the installation,
so add Makefile rules for them.

Git must ignore the generated manpages.

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil <sw@weilnetz.de> This is a request for comments. The patch removes documentation files which can be easily created if `asciidoc` is available in the build environment. Man pages are now not built and installed by default. They are build and installed in maintainer mode (`./configure --enable-maintainer-mode`).

Removing the documentation files which can be built simplifies the maintenance, because it is no longer necessary to update three generated files for a simple documentation update. I just tried to install the asciidoc package on Debian with Synaptic.
Synaptic lists additional **59** required packages.

 Are you sure that those packages are _required_? On my Debian Stretch, I see 4 required packages (1.4 MB disk space): `asciidoc`, `asciidoc-base`, `asciidoc-common`, `libxml2-utils`. As long as you don't want to create LaTeX and PDF documents, you can keep the installation pretty small. It may depend on what is already installed on the system. I get the following list:

 https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=asciidoc
http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoc By the way, builds which use `cmake` don't install any man pages, only `autoconf` based builds do. Cmake is used by people that use MSVC and by the CI. If this PR is accepted, we will need to add this to the `Compiling` wiki page:
`apt-get install --no-install-recommends asciidoc`, but we only have instructions for Debian-based distros. If other package managers in non-Debian-based distros have a similar behavior like
`apt-get install asciidoc` (install also recommended packages) users will get a lot of unnecessary packages.

@stweil, what do think about this issue?  Yes, we have to add documentation for package maintainers who want to install the man pages with the Tesseract package.

I expect that a person who wants to build a distro package won't have problems with installing too many packages with `asciidoc`. My main machine, for example, already had TeX installed, so the installation of `asciidoc` did not add many more packages.

Normal users who want to build Tesseract would not automatically build man pages, so they don't need `asciidoc`. The main question is whether that is acceptable.

Instead of building man pages in maintainer mode only, it would also be possible to build them only if `asciidoc` was found. Would that be better? OK. No objection to this PR.

BTW, Git does the same thing:
https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation
 https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.13.0-rc1/INSTALL#L160
Stefan, I suggest to do something similar in Tesseract.
(Of course, don't copy even a single line from that GPL codebase) Thank you for the report. This is fixed in PR #862. Don't forget to run `./autogen.sh` after that patch.  From time to time Ray cleans the code by using `clang-tidy`. It would be nice to document that process to allow other developers to check their code contributions and avoid style problems from the beginning.

The current tidy process does not cover some significant code style issues. Most noticeable: it does not change from `( xxx )` (about 480 lines of code) to `(xxx)` (which is the preferred [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Function_Declarations_and_Definitions), more than 50000 lines of code).  L_Bmf works for C++ code, but the common form is L_BMF, so use that.

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil <sw@weilnetz.de> @theraysmith, maybe you a referring to the [Leptonica style guide](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/blob/master/style-guide.txt#L48). I think it's a style guide for the Leptonica code, not for code using Leptonica (like Tesseract). https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/blob/master/style-guide.txt

>(c) Use typedefs for structs like Pix; e.g.,
          function(PIX  *pixs)
       Do not do this (omitting the 'struct' keyword); it is valid C++,
       but not C:
          function(Pix  *pixs)

https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/blob/150c8d0051/src/bmf.h#L45

Since Tesseract code is based on C++, we should use a C++ style guide.
https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Type_Names
  I must admit that I'm confused now. If Dan prefers `Pix`, I'd change the Leptonica to allow `Pix` for C as well (and maintain `PIX` for backward compatibility, maybe with a deprecation attribute).

Ray, the code in `opencl/` needs much formatting. Could you do this with your internal tool (or make it public, then I could assist)? Ray,
According to some of your commit messages you use clang-tidy.

What about adding a `.clang-format` file to the public repo?
https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html

 Ray reverted this pull request with commit 7a116ce8bbfe6c1772b0b5055c7574a27c35eaac. My new pull request #855 fixes the remaining exceptions which currently don't use the preferred struct name.

Ray, thank you for formatting `opencl/`. I noticed that some issues like _[There is never a space between the parentheses and the parameters](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Function_Declarations_and_Definitions)_ were not fixed (see also issue #854).  Hello All,

You may need to give the path before *.lstmf or the next step will not find the files.
 The [line break](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) must be `\n`. This is what is inserted automatically when you hit the `Enter` key in the keyboard in Linux/macOS. In Windows it's by default `\r\n`, which will confuse Tesseract.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8195839/choose-newline-character-in-notepad Thanks @Shreeshrii, thanks @amitdo! 

This raises a new question: how do I generate `.lstfm` files? I'm trying Tesseract to train on [New York city directories](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/b42866fb-b877-e4fc-e040-e00a1806275e), I have box files and TIFs. (Another question: can I already use `WordStr` box files, some parts of the documentation say I can, others say I can't?)

ZIP file with one TIF and box file I'm trying to use: [Wilson1852_0.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/958420/Wilson1852_0.zip). Out of the box, Tesseract already performs pretty well, but 150 years ago, house numbers in New York sometimes included ½, so I have to include this character in the `desited_characters` file:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1194896/25436113/477a23b6-2a60-11e7-967f-c4b97b21e3a9.png)


 WordStr box files are not yet supported (AFAIK).

If you have box files in 3.0 format, you can use jtessboxeditor to add the
end of line tab character and use them.

When I want to test using box/tiff pairs, I copy the files to the training
directory - by modifying tesstrain.sh.


mkdir -p ${TRAINING_DIR}
tlog "\n=== Starting training for language '${LANG_CODE}'"

#cp /home/shree/tesstutorial/larmbig/*.tif "${TRAINING_DIR}/"
#cp  /home/shree/tesstutorial/larmbig/*.box "${TRAINING_DIR}/"

Then use a command similar to following (based on location of your files)
and use just one font similar to the one used in your box/tiff pairs.

You may need to modify tesstrain_utils.sh to make sure that all your
box/tiff pairs are selected (based on the naming).

 What's the output for the 388½ in this example and in other places in this book? @amitdo 388½ becomes 3884. @Shreeshrii : but I have no `fonts_dir`, `fontlist`, etc, since I am only training from images. I'm afraid this way of training is not well documented right now.

I have not yet tried training with 4.00. @amitdo Is it not well documented, or not yet possible at all? @Shreeshrii Do you have examples of this process? Your box file is in wordstr format. That cannot be used with existing
process.

If you had box file in older 3.04  format, then the hacked version of
script would work.

 I can provide a box file in 3.04 format tomorrow, I'll post the file here. As said, the WordStr format is not really supported right now.

You can still train with the regular box format + tab lines to signal line breaks.

Training from 'real' images as opposed to synthetic ones (with text2image), that what's not well documented.  >Out of the box, Tesseract already performs pretty well, but 150 years ago, house numbers in New York sometimes included ½, so I have to include this character in the desited_characters file:

@bertspaan the desired_characters file is not directly used for training. It is used at Google for building the large training text required for LSTM training.

I couldn't find any font which has 1/2 the way it is printed here, so it maybe difficult to create synthetic image for it.
 Update: The LSTM training process has been modified since this post was written. These will not work as is. You can use them as reference.
---------------------------------------

Here are the modified scripts:
[boxtrain.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/961633/boxtrain.zip)
You will need to copy your box/tiff pairs to the 
../langdata/eng/ directory 
for them to be used.

You cannot use finetune process because 1/2 i not included in the unicharset for current LSTM traineddata for English. @theraysmith , will this change with your  next update?

The following commands outline the process you may need to follow to do the LSTM training - top layer.

``` Thanks so much, I will try all this next week! Also see https://github.com/nypl-spacetime/ocr-scripts
 @Shreeshrii: ha, that's my repository! @bertspaan

I see that you have trained models for ocropy.

Is there anything you want to share about ocropy vs. Tesseract 4.00, accuracy wise, with your dataset? 
  @amitdo: yes, we've trained ocropy on a very small amount of sentences, and already the results are pretty good. See [`1854-55.lines.ndjson.zip`](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/967991/1854-55.lines.ndjson.zip), this file contains all bounding boxes with ocropy output. However, ocropy sometimes crashes and its documentation is not too good, that's why last week we've started experimenting with Tesseract 4. I haven't compared out-of-the-box output of Tesseract 4 with our trained orcopy model in detail.

@Shreeshrii: ok, I'll try some of the commands you've posted here, but I'm not going to spend much time on trying to train Tesseract, I'll wait until training from scanned images is improved. 

We are also building dictionaries of possible names, streets and professions, so we should be able to fix many OCR errors afterwards.

Thank you both so much for your help! **@Shreeshrii** 
I am also trying to fine tune tesseract4.0 with images. I am confused by several parameters below.
First, what is the training_text(**nyd.training_text**) file? Do I need to create it? If yes, how to create it?
Second, do I just need to specify the **--training_text** and **--output_dir** while leaving other parameters unchanged?

 Training tutorial ? 
Do you mean [https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00](url)
but I just have tif/box pairs, so i come here for more information。 @Shreeshrii 
I want to use tesseract4.00 to recognize models of machines. All model information are combines whit characters and numbers and located in somewhere of nameplate, so I have collected lots of pictures which contains  various nameplate of each machine. 
After a series of processing, I have got lots pictures of model as follows:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22894599/29905526-d8207088-8e41-11e7-8a94-60661df186c8.png)

And then I put all model pictures into tesseract for recognize, but the accuracy is not so good, so I am trying to train teaaeract4.00 with model pictures.
The tesseract4.0 training tutorial said that there are two ways to create training data, and I use the first option: each line in the box file matches a 'character' (glyph) in the tiff image. 

If 4.0 training with tif/box pairs is not yet supported then how can I do to raise the accuracy?

 @minly, hello, I have the same problems with you ? have you resolved them? @CoCa520, hello, did you generate lstm files finally? I want to know how to generate lstm files according to  *.tif and *.box files? Bumping this..

I tried running the steps mentioned here: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/841#issuecomment-298174100

I'm getting this error: 
```
ERROR: Non-existent flag -D
ERROR: /var/folders/vz/yqbfrgj91hqdj76mmpl2vjmw0000gn/T/tmp.W8q07ZtQ/eng/unicharset does not exist or is not readable
```
It does not create a `.traineddata`, which is what I expected from doing `--linedata_only` parameter..

I'll try to compare what edits @Shreeshrii put in place, but any guidance would be appreciated.

Edit:

[boxtrain.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/1468814/boxtrain.zip)

I've diffed the three files to a version in April, grabbed the "intent" of @Shreeshrii 's edit, and applied it to the newest versions of the three files.

```
boxtrain/boxtrain.sh --fonts_dir ~/Library/Fonts/ --training_text ../langdata/eng/eng.training_text --langdata_dir ../langdata --tessdata_dir ./tessdata/ --lang eng --fontlist "Calibri" --output_dir ./lstm1
```
While editing, I saw that @Shreeshrii was creating a folder named "${LANG_DATA_DIR}/GT", and copying TIF/BOX in/out from it. I tried placing my TIF/BOX pairs in the "GT" folder, and to be honest I have no clarity on what the `.traineddata` contains .  Both 3.05 and latest git master produce unusable results with OpenCL (tested on Linux and macOS). It looks like that problem only occurs with [large images](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/~stweil/tesseract/0604.jp2).

Disabling OpenCL in `ccmain/thresholder.cpp` fixes the problem. #635
Maybe it's the right time to remove the OpenCL code entirely.

I have a feeling that you (Stefan) will disagree...  :)
 Indeed. :-)

Other projects using LSTM strive to use the computing power of graphic cards.

Should Tesseract be an exception because people are satisfied with the CPU based computation, should we try to fix the known problems of the current OpenCL based implementation and improve the code, or is there another solution how Tesseract can use advanced computing power? The problems I see with the OpenCL code:
It mostly duplicates parts of Leptonica, which is an **external** dependency.
It was contributed by someone from AMD. He does not keep maintaining it.
Google does not seem to want to invest time in maintaining it.
The only one that cares and tries to fix bugs is you.

 I respect your work, but I still think the benefit here is quite small and we should drop it.  

A compromise could be that you will maintain that code as a separate project and we will have an optional dependency on it. I tried to sell it to Dan but he didn't buy it :laughing:

Please read his answer. I removed a duplicated part of Leptonica in PR #843. Are there more of them? At least I no longer find a comment naming Leptonica in the OpenCL code. At least some with 'pix' in their names. pixSubtract for example. > I'd roughly guess that includes about a dozen methods.

Good guess. It's a little bit more. I'll send a pull request which reduces the code in `opencl` to less than 5300 lines. Ray's DAS 2014 tutorial, slides set 8 has some statistics about the OpenCL code. PR #849 now removes most of the TIFF related code. Maybe I can remove more in the future. >... reduces the code in opencl to less than 5300 lines.

>Maybe I can remove more in the future.

Only ~5300 lines left (to remove) ... :-) It's still used by one of the benchmarks. As soon as I'm sure that this benchmark is not needed, we'll make a large step in Amit's preferred direction (currently 5074 lines left). http://www.anandtech.com/show/10613/discrete-desktop-gpu-market-trends-q2-2016-amd-grabs-market-share-but-nvidia-remains-on-top

Benchmarks should done on intel's integrated GPU and NVIDIA's GPU.

I read somewhere a claim that the performance of OpenCL with NVIDIA card is significantly worst than with AMD cards.

Another claim is that OpenCL performance on Macs degraded significantly with the last macOS versions. Like NVIDIA, Apple now has an API which is competing with OpenCL. >Both 3.05 and latest git master produce unusable results with OpenCL (tested on Linux and macOS). It looks like that problem only occurs with large images.

Is the issue still exists ? Yes. At least I am not aware that anybody fixed it. Since you opened the issue, you dropped a lot of opencl code. Maybe the issue was related to that code? No, it is caused by one of the remaining (unchanged) OpenCL code blocks. An idea: Maybe you want to add an environment variable to disable opencl at **runtime**, similar to the openmp trick? That environment variable is already there: `TESSERACT_OPENCL_DEVICE`. Set it to the number of the "native device" (or to an illegal value: less than 1 or greater than the number of OpenCL devices) to disable OpenCL. Ok :-)   WordStr Box file option has been defined in the training wiki for 4.0 LSTM. However it is not yet implemented in the code.

This will be useful for using scanned images for training.

Thanks!

I am guessing that Travis build does not include training tools.

Do they build locally for you on Mac? Yes, Travis CI builds currently without the training part. Of course it is possible to add `make training` if that is considered necessary. Travis also does not cover builds based on the `autotools`, as it uses `cmake`.

> My local test was successful with configure and make.

`make training` also was successful on Mac. Tesseract 3.05 uses `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` to detect `pango` and `cairo`, this should be fairly robust. Closing this as @stweil confirms build on mac with the PR and there is no response from original poster. I had a look on that shell script. The published version does not work because it tries to build Tesseract without building the dependencies (libjpeg, zlib, libpng, leptonica) first. This can be easily fixed in the first lines of the script. Now it builds those dependencies. It also starts building Tesseract 3.05, but fails when linking the `tesseract` executable because of a missing symbol `_fmemopen` in liblept.

This problem is caused by an unusual build of Leptonica: instead of the normal configure / make, the script calls `./make-for-local` which uses a hand-built makefile (maybe made for Linux). I'm also surprised that TIFF support is disabled for the Leptonica build and doubt that this will work with Tesseract.

Building Tesseract with HomeBrew or MacPorts is much easier than with the shell script, and it simply works. End users who want to run Tesseract don't need HomeBrew or MacPorts. They only need some libraries which can be copied and distributed with the Tesseract executable. Even that can be avoided by adding linker flags to use static linkage. See [here](http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/mac_standalone/) for a [modified build script](http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/mac_standalone/mac_standalone_tesseract_build_script) which produced a [stand-alone `tesseract` for macOS](http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/mac_standalone/tesseract). The [build protocol](http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/mac_standalone/build.txt) shows some remaining errors, like a wrong URL for getting the language model files. Thanks Stefan.  Actually the shell script does build the dependencies first if you turn on the switches at the start. They are set to 0 or 1 depending on whether you're trying to rebuild/build some or all of them.  If you set them all to 1, the dependencies are built in the order libjpeg, zlib, libpng, leptonica, followed by tesseract.

I found the original script on github and modified it minimally since I didn't understand it fully. The unusual Leptonica build has come directly from that original script. I didn't understand this, so I left it as I found it!

I agree that HomeBrew/MacPorts is much easier if you are an IT person, but my users are analytical chemists or linguists, etc. who just want to run an app. The coding system I use (LiveCode) generates executables that can be run from anywhere without any installation, you just place the folder containing the app and any supporting files/folders wherever you like (e.g. the desktop for short term use).  I don't want the user to have to run an install process, either directly, or by my app doing an initial install on 1st run.

For Windows users there's a portable Tesseract readily available that works as I intended.  For Mac users, there isn't, which is why I looked for and found the shell script that seemed to offer the prospect of generating a portable Tesseract for Mac users.

You mention that it's possible to generate Tesseract using HomeBrew/MacPorts and then "some libraries can be copied & distributed".  Can you tell me exactly which libraries and where they need to be copied to.  Also, would this mean copying libraries to areas outside the user's filing system, i.e. system areas.  If so this would require admin permissions which I can't rely on being available (sometime my users have locked-down computers).  The shell script can generate a portable Tesseract that is located simply by setting 2 environment variables.  I've tested this and it works for my purposes for both JPEG and PNG graphics, which are all I need. However, I'd happily add TIFF support if I knew how to do it!

Thanks again.

You need to copy all shared libraries which are required by the `tesseract` executable. When you try to run it, macOS will tell you which shared library is missing (only first missing, so repeat until you have found all of them). With MacPorts for example, this means copying 15 files from `/opt/local/lib/*.dylib` (`liblept.5.dylib`, ...). You can choose any destination directory. By setting the environment variable DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to that directory, Tesseract can find the shared libraries. Thanks Stefan, your suggestion works well.  I did the following:
1. using Terminal, install Tesseract using HomeBrew
2. copy the folder "3.05.001" from /usr/local/Cellar/tesseract into a folder on my desktop called "tessport"
3. created a test shell script "tesseract_test.sh":
    #!/bin/bash
    export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/Users/peter/Desktop/tessport/share
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/peter/Desktop/tessport/lib
    tessport/bin/tesseract -v
4. ran the test shell script "tesseract_test.sh" to confirm it works
5. uninstalled Tesseract using HomeBrew
6. re-an the test shell script "tesseract_test.sh" to confirm it still works

So I now have a recipe for generating the latest Tesseract in portable form for the Mac!

Thanks again.

 The warnings are ugly but seem harmless.

With `--oem 0` and `--psm 0` Tesseract works as expected.

With `--oem 1` and `--psm 0` Tesseract segfault.
The reason - the new LSTM engine has no OSD feature **currently**, only the older engine has it.

For now, the solution is to always use `--oem 0` when using `--psm 0` BTW, you should use `osd` instead of `eng` with `--psm 0`.


Using `eng` will result in always detecting `Latin` as the script, even if the text is written in another script. From what I have read, tesseract v4 greatly improves ocr due to LSTM.  If I know that my text is going to be of a certain orientation and script  (top to bottom and English), how do I take advantage of the newer engine?  Thanks for the help and sorry for the delay in my response. The 4.00 version is in alpha stage. It's not yet considered ready to replace the stable 3.05 version.
There is a plan to add an OSD feature to the LSTM engine. Is there any update on this?  Let me know if you want me to do any testing etc.  Thanks! I'm sorry, but there is no update on this issue. try this:

 Times New Roman is in the list of Persian fonts in
training/language_specific.sh. Doesn’t it mean that the Farsi trained model
is trained for Times New Roman?Or the listed fonts are just recommended?

@xlight,

Why the `--enable-debug`? With this option Tesseract will be compiled with `-O0` and will be VERY slow. It's not a good idea to use it with a docker image. @amitdo why do you say that it is not a good idea? I built it with enable debug , because I want to know the reason why lstmtraining with eval_listfile coredump.
But It does not help  >why do you say that it is not a good idea?

Because of its slowness. I think that users of Docker Hub images expect to get an optimized build, not a debug one.   Ah oh course. I tried without but I am getting the issue 893...
Btw thx to @xlight for his docker file. I just added the download and move of some traineddata. @stweil, can you fix it? >The docker image fails to build. Host is Ubuntu 16.04.

The file `Dockerflle` in our repo is still not fixed.

Maybe we should remove this file (and `docker-compose.yml`).  It supposed to be used by users that want docker image of Tesseract.

I think we should remove it from our repo.  The Dockerfile configures a Docker container which builds Tesseract using the Travis configuration, so it can be used to locally test problems with that configuration (only the Linux part, not the macOS part). I can fix it, but that needs some time. >I can fix it, but that needs some time.

OK. If you plan to fix it, we can keep it. See pull request #932 for a fix. Does your PR solves the OP issue?

>CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.7/Modules/CMakeDetermineCCompiler.cmake:48 (message):

>  gcc-4.8. @benstadin, could you please retry your docker build with the changes from #932?

@amitdo, I did not get the same error message initially, therefore I don't know. The `Dockerfile` uses the master branch of https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build. If there is an issue with that latest version, it might damage the docker build process. I looked for a stable version of `travis-build`, but the latest release was made in 2014.  Hello,
Using tesseract v3.04.01 on Fedora 25, a standard transformation like
```tesseract somefile.png pdf -l eng > output 2> error```
will write ```Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v3.04.01 with Leptonica``` to error file even if the transformation worked as expected.
tesseract v3.02 on Ubuntu 12.04.5 writes to stdout instead of stderr.

Regards,
Ozy.  Hello!

Latest Tesseract version built from GIT with mingw-w64-i686 toolchain (gcc/g++ 6.2.0) crashes when run on Windows XP 32 bit (confirmed both for SP2 and SP3 OS versions). It crashes after several seconds of image processing and shows standard Windows dialog with this error text: "Exception unknow software exception (0xc000001d) in application at address 0x655b25f0".

On Windows 7 and 8 (x64) same images are recognized fine without any issues. I'm afraid that nobody will care about support for a Windows version which was abandoned by MS [three years ago](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/end-of-xp-support).  Does Tesseract on Windows 7/8 **32 bit** work well or crash too?  Tesseract version built from GIT with mingw-w64-i686 toolchain (gcc/g++ 6.2.0)

Does it have to be built with special flags for win32? There is currently not enough information for this issue report: As far as I know, 0xc000001d means illegal instruction. So the program is running machine code which is not defined for that machine. This could be caused by a program bug, or code and hardware simply don't fit.

* What is the hardware used for the tests (exact CPU models)? I assume that the tests with different versions of Windows also used different hardware. This problem could be eliminated by always using the same hardware (or a well defined virtual machine).

* Does Tesseract try to use SSE or AVX? Run `tesseract -v` to check that.

* More details on the build process are needed (cross or native build, origin of toolchain, exact commands used for build, build protocol).

What about running Tesseract under control of a debugger like gdb for Windows? Then the debugger would show the illegal instruction. > Does it have to be built with special flags for win32?

No, no special flags are needed for win32. My 32 and 64 bit builds for Windows only differ in the prefix for build tools and installation:

    ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --prefix=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32 && make
    ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --prefix=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32 && make
 Thank you all for respose! I'm well aware of the fact that XP is quite outdated OS, but some people still prefere to use it despite troubles with outdated drivers etc. If it would take too much effort to fix it then it probably doesn't worth it. But if there is a chance of fixing it without going too deep in debug process then it would be great.

Now in order of questions:

1) It works just fine on Windows 7 32 bit, no crashes at all. On the very same PC it crashes constanly under XP 32 bit.

2) 1st crash machine: Intel Core i3-2120 3.30GHz.
2nd crash machine: Intel Core i5 3570 3.4 GHz (OS run under VirtualBox Version 5.1.18 r 114002(Qt5.6.2)).

3) tesseract -v:

> tesseract 4.00.00alpha
>  leptonica-1.74.1
>   libgif 5.1.4 : libjpeg 8d (libjpeg-turbo 1.5.1) : libpng 1.6.26 : libtiff 4.0.6 : zlib 1.2.8 : libwebp 0.6.0
> 
>  Found AVX
>  Found SSE

4) Build is done under Windows 8 64 bit using latest MSYS2 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/) distributive, updated with "pacman -Syuu" to get latest leptonica version.

> (gdb) @paukonen, you are using a relatively new computer (with AVX and SSE support) on an old operating system (Windows XP). A quick search gives lots of hints that AVX does not work with XP. Tesseract will detect AVX support of the CPU and use it, because it does not test whether you are using an old operating system. So I expect that is the reason of the crash which you observe.

You can test that hypothesis by building a new Tesseract with AVX disabled: simply remove all lines which set `avx_available_` in file `arch/simddetect.cpp`. The resulting Tesseract should work on any Windows version. If is does not, disable SSE support as well. >You can simply remove all lines which set avx_available_ in file arch/simddetect.cpp.

**Edit**: Do what stweil suggested. Thank you very much!

It works fine when AVX is disabled. Looks like a good reason to stop using XP completely. Great, thank you for testing. Maybe we can add a test for old Windows versions in `arch/simddetect.cpp` to handle this automatically. I don't think we should add any code to support OSes that are >10 years old and even not supported by their vendors anymore. Nevertheless, I think what we should do is to add an option to disable **all** the simd  compile-time & runtime checking. In any case, I applied attached patch to my working copy.

It automatically disables AVX for XP and older OSes.
Maybe it would come in handy to someone. It seems the current 4.00alpha version would also crash in Windows 10 running on an old i7 CPU, which probably does not have AVX or SSE support. The patch may fix that. I may try it out when I get a chance. >It seems the current 4.00alpha version would crash in Windows 10 running on an old i7 CPU also.

This is also going to come handy for whenever tesseract will make use of AVX-512 (which brings in another new architectural state), which is [only](http://support.sisoftware.net/knowledgebase.php?article=70) going to be supported on W10
(not sure if already, or in a future version - in the latter case that would be another point for this check)

The plain text output generated de-skews the image and is giving the correct output.

So,Is there any way to get the coordinates of the words of image which is deskewed by the tesseract or can we get hold of deskewed image itself?

  frustrated. Why is open source always so sloppy when it comes to stuff like this? 
How does one build tess for Windows? The 2 lines for "how to build", which is basically finding and installing cppan, and running it, is not sufficient instructions by far. So how do you guys expect somebody to want to use this software if they have to spend a weekend trying to figure out how to get it to build? How about some serious steps of how to build it on windows, this time? Do I use a developer command prompt? Do I need cmake? Do I need mingw installed? What, exactly, are the steps? What are some of the common failure issues? A complete release includes complete how to build and how to install instructions.
 If you just want to use Tesseract for Windows, I suggest using one of the binaries which already exist.

The [Tesseract wiki](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling) has more than two lines of documentation on building for Windows, and you are free to improve it. Pull requests to enhance the documentation which is provided with the source code are also possible and welcome.

I think the first problem is that there are several ways how it can be done. You have the choice of using either cmake or autoconf. It's possible to build with gcc, clang or MSVC. And you can use MSYS2, Mingw-w64 or CYGWIN. You can even cross compile on a Linux machine. Finally, you have to decide whether you want 32 or 64 bit binaries.

Personally I use cross compilation on Linux because compilation on Linux is much faster than on Windows.
As soon as you have installed all prerequisites, building becomes easy. I use autoconf:

    # Run autogen.sh once
    # (and after updates of your sources or your autoconf installation).
    ./autogen.sh
    # The remaining commands not only work from the root of the Tesseract source tree
    # but also from any directory.
    # This is useful if you want to build different kinds of binaries
    # (32 / 64 bit, debug and release code, ...).
    # Just adapt the `configure` command to your needs.
    ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 CXXFLAGS="-Wall -g"
    make install training-install
    make ScrollView.jar

64 bit binaries require `--host=x86_64-w64-mingw32`.
Exactly the same commands also work on CYGWIN where you can also cross build using Mingw-w64.
 >Why is open source always so sloppy when it comes to stuff like this?

If you have an issue with the software, just report about it. Do not insult the developers!
 > Why is open source always so sloppy when it comes to stuff like this?

@erichfrazer, I see from your GitHub profile that you are working for a software company in Redmond? Then please help us improving the documentation. oh sure, easy to bash my company. When I release software to consumers in the form of SDKs or code that is visible to the public, you can be damned sure I have to document the heck out of it and ensure it at least compiles. This tesseract stuff has taken me days to compile, not hours or minutes. The thing is, it's so easy (in the end) to simply write an actual Visual Studio makefile and then get the whole thing to compile. But no, everybody has to try and go as far as possible to avoid The Big Bad Company, using mingw, cppan, msys2, cmake, blah de blah de blah, and none of that shit works well or is obvious, and none of it allows you to compile w/o having a degree in college-kid Linux.

SOMEBODY should write some VS2015 compatible vcxprojs and make them so they glob in place right in the middle of the tesseract / leptonica / whatever enlistments, and allows you to compile the darned thing.

Even cmake is silly that you can't target a bunch of different processor type and release mode builds all at the same time. I want to build x64, win32, release AND debug. This is not easy, and is very error prone trying to get this done with cmake.

Not as angry, because I got it to compile, but still cranky.
 >But no, everybody has to try and go as far as possible to avoid The Big Bad Company, using mingw, cppan, msys2, **cmake**, blah de blah de blah....

I have news for you. Microsoft officially supports CMake these days.

https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues/465
 I'm not the one releasing the software!! Why don't you come debug my Traffic App? It was nice talking with you... First Thanks for Tesseract team for great work
Building form source for Windows using visual studio is not straight forward as described in tutorial
it failed to run VS2010 and succeeded in VS2015 but the generated files can't run in my machine.

most of VS developers like me not familiar with cross platform tools , i just want ask , would you create something like OpenCV? , it's just one zipped file  contain all what you need to build including the dependencies , GUI Cmake just used to select src path, dst pat and target Developing IDE  then build.

Is the previous scenario can be achieved ? 

 Hi @essamzaky,

Just to let you (and others who will read this comment) know, the build scripts are maintained mostly by a very small community team. For the VS/CMake build, there is only one man that works on it currently (not me) in his spare time.

 @Shreeshrii  Building from source using manual way might work for VS2010 , VS2008 as egorpugin commented
so if there is someone succeeded to build using manual way , it's better to describe how to use the manual way.
i succeeded to build most of dependence in my spare time i will back and build the rest of the solution and write about  my trial to build using the manual way.

  I had problems myself and finally decide to do it the hardway. I do not see why this needs to re-invented. Hence I have provided a complete solution kit along with binaries for Windows. Solution kit is made for Visual Studio 2015. Please check the link below and do replicate this, so we do not have this as an issue anymore.
https://github.com/vdevan/TesseractTrainingTools See also:
https://github.com/peirick/VS2015_Tesseract Yes I have added his link as well. Main difference is I have provided 
the training tools which was not there on the Peirick's link

 Thanks for useful links, hope to update it soon for tesseract 4.0 Hi @egorpugin 
Finally i run the cppan today with build the VS2015 and it's working, i did the following steps 
delete the following folders "C:\Users\emz\tesseract" , "C:\Users\emz.cppan".
launch cmd from run and execute the following:
git clone https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract.git
cd tesseract
cppan
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" -DCPPAN_USE_CACHE=0

 @essamzaky -> Thank you very much! The information provided in [wiki](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling) did not worked for me, bu this worked. Why don't you change the wiki?

For x64 this worked for me:

Really weird. Arabic is not fully accurate with 4.0. there are already open issues

  Something went wrong, bailing out! No feedback from the OP. I suggest to close this issue.  I think we should publish in the README the official supported compilers, including minimum version for each compiler. Something like this:

## Supported Compilers
* GCC 4.8 and above
* Clang 3.4 and above
* MSVC 2015, 2017

Other compilers might work, but are not officially supported. Clang is not tested right now with CI. Can someone fix that? I mean Clang + libc++ on Mac.

Testing Clang + libstdc++ on Linux would be nice. Thanks Egor.

Zdenko, I'll send a PR in the following days.  //Keeping 
const int kMinCharactersToTry = 5
//Since working with text extraction from vehicle number plates needs less minimum number of characters. kMaxCharactersToTry may be //modified accordingly. The algorithm is designed to work with the current minimum value. Changing that const value might break it. I suggest not to accept this PR without Ray's approval.

Sorry, @ShahrukhSatti21. Another thing, Ray said he has a better (LSTM-based) OSD module that will replace the current one. @theraysmith, I think this PR should be rejected, right? Hi,
I was a beginner and too immature to ask such a basic question that too as
an issue. Later, I dug deeper into tesseract and a ROI finding algorithm
and compiled an executable to extract characters on number plates. There's
no need to consider this PR as the algo might not stay as generic as now.
Thanks for considering anyway.

  I'm forking this issue from #739 because the resolution of that issue has _not_ helped me fix Homebrew/homebrew-core#10380.  As logged [here](https://github.com/RandomDSdevel/Homebrew-Installation-Logs/blob/master/Tesseract/v3.05.00/Third%20Attempt/reinstall.out#L1179–L1311), my latest build attempt fails as follows:

Both I and those other GitHub users who were helping me with this issue downstream thought it was another instance of the aforementioned #739, but I now think that we were mistaken in believing this given how said issue was resolved.  Basically, the crux of the problem is this:  is there something that previous committers have neglected to add to Homebrew's Tesseract build formula other than Homebrew/homebrew-core#10596, or is Tesseract at fault here and does solving this require Homebrew to mirror an upstream patch until the next release?   Whoops; I should have given that to you in the first place, shouldn't I?  Ah, well, here those details are now:  

* I initially built and installed Tesseract from within Homebrew by running `brew install -vd --build-from-source tesseract --with-all-languages --with-opencl --with-serial-num-pack --with-training-tools`, update it by running `brew upgrade -vd --build-from-source tesseract --with-all-languages --with-opencl --with-serial-num-pack --with-training-tools`, and retry doing either procedure when they fail by running `brew reinstall -vd --build-from-source tesseract --with-all-languages --with-opencl --with-serial-num-pack --with-training-tools`.  Executing either causes Homebrew to process `"$(brew --repository homebrew/homebrew-core)/Formula/tesseract.rb"` (a GitHub copy of which is available [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/tesseract.rb),) where `"$(brew --repository homebrew/homebrew-core)"` is `/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core` (its default, officially supported location,) according to the `brew` sub-command given, Homebrew's DSL, and the options I provide using the processing defined in the relevant formula.  @JCount confirmed in [this comment](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/10380#issuecomment-282604860) on [my downstream issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/10380) that the option causing trouble is `--with-opencl`, which, as shown on [line 94](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/tesseract.rb#L94) of the Homebrew Core tap's `tesseract.rb` formula, corresponds to Tesseract's `./configure`'s `--enable-opencl` option.  
* The output I get from `./configure` is present in [my most recent Homebrew installation attempt logs](https://github.com/RandomDSdevel/Homebrew-Installation-Logs/tree/master/Tesseract/v3.05.00/Third%20Attempt) as both [`02.configure`](https://github.com/RandomDSdevel/Homebrew-Installation-Logs/blob/master/Tesseract/v3.05.00/Third%20Attempt/02.configure) and [lines 134–339](https://github.com/RandomDSdevel/Homebrew-Installation-Logs/blob/master/Tesseract/v3.05.00/Third%20Attempt/reinstall.out#L134-L339) of [`reinstall.out`](https://github.com/RandomDSdevel/Homebrew-Installation-Logs/blob/master/Tesseract/v3.05.00/Third%20Attempt/reinstall.out).  
* The versions of the build and run-time dependencies required by Tesseract under Homebrew I have installed on my machine are as follows:  
  * `autoconf` v2.69
  * `autoconf-archive` v2017.03.21
  * `automake` v1.15
  * GNU `libtool` v2.4.6, but patched by the Homebrew Core tap to resolve Homebrew/homebrew-core#3056 and Homebrew/homebrew-core#3882.  (_Not_ the `libtool` provided by Apple as part of its command-line tools suite, which I _also_ have installed.)  
  * `pkg-config` v0.29.2
  * Leptonica v1.74.1 (Built with the following dependencies:  
    * `pkg-config` v0.29.2
    * libpng v1.6.29
    * jpeg v8d
    * LibTIFF v4.0.7, but patched by the Homebrew Core tap to resolve Homebrew/homebrew-core#8639 and Homebrew/homebrew-core#9409.  —&thinsp;Dependencies are as follows:  
      * jpeg v8d
      * xz v5.2.3
    * GIFlib v4.2.3 with a dependency as follows:  
      * X11 (supplied by XQuartz v2.7.11)
    * OpenJPEG v2.1.2 with dependencies as follows:  
      * CMake v3.7.2 with a dependency as follows:  
        * Sphinx v1.5.1
      * Little-CMS2 v2.8 with dependencies as follows:  
        * jpeg v8d
        * LibTIFF v4.0.7 as described above for Leptonica itself
      * LibTIFF v4.0.7 as described above for Leptonica itself
      * libpng v1.6.29
    * WebP v0.6.0 with dependencies as follows:  
      * libpng v1.6.29
      * jpeg v8d
      * LibTIFF v4.0.7 as described above for Leptonica itself
      * GIFlib v4.2.3 with a dependency as described earlier.)

Is that everything you need, or do I need to provide anything else?   @zdenop:  Roger, wilco.  That _is_ odd, though, so whatever could have caused _that…?_   @zdenop:  I keep getting the following error from `./configure` despite the fact that I have Cairo installed even when I add `-I/usr/local/opt/cairo/include` to `CPPFLAGS` (though should that be `CFLAGS` instead…?) and `-L/usr/local/opt/cairo/lib` to `LDFLAGS`:  

```
checking for cairo... no
configure: WARNING: Training tools WILL NOT be built because of missing cairo library.
configure: WARNING: Try to install libcairo-dev?? package.

⋮

You can not build training tools because of missing dependency.
Check configure output for details.
```

Should I be worried about this, or can I just ignore this error since the build problem I'm trying to solve is, IIRC, in Tesseract itself?  I was going to try and make my out-of-Homebrew build and install as close to my _in_-Homebrew one, which said it was going to include the training tools if it had succeeded, if you're wondering why I'm asking.  I don't want to overwrite my current _non_-development version of Cairo in the process, so what do I do?   @stweil:  Ah, thanks.  

<hr />

@zdenop:  Heh, whoops; looks like I was mentally applying the conceptual equivalent of `-Wwarnings-as-errors`, then; my mistake!  In any case, that's what I thought (I just wanted to make sure my judgement was correct by checking with you,) so I'll go ahead and continue this build attempt.   See https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling for a list of required dependencies. For training tools you need the Dev version of libraries. @Shreeshrii:  That's what confused me in the _first_ place, as _Homebrew_ seems to be able to build the training tools just fine with the _production_ versions of their dependencies.  Perhaps it implements some sort of hack to make this (mostly) work, but I'd have to check the package manager's Tesseract formula to be sure of that, as I don't remember seeing anything special there before, which is odd…; maybe the difference is further up in the dependency chain and has to do with Homebrew presents some of its nodes to other software packages?  Or perhaps there's a Homebrew shim I don't know about, but I _thought_ I remembered that the package manager only instrumented system-level build tools…   Now that I've kept thinking about this discrepancy for a little bit, maybe it has to do with Homebrew's [`superenv` shim](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/extend/ENV/super.rb)…?   @zdenop:  OK, [here](https://github.com/RandomDSdevel/Homebrew-Installation-Logs/tree/master/Tesseract/v3.05.00/Fourth%20Attempt) are the logs from my attempt to build Tesseract manually outside of Homebrew.  [The new failure](https://github.com/RandomDSdevel/Homebrew-Installation-Logs/blob/master/Tesseract/v3.05.00/Fourth%20Attempt/make.out#L840-L973) looks identical to [the one produced when building _inside_ Homebrew](https://github.com/RandomDSdevel/Homebrew-Installation-Logs/blob/master/Tesseract/v3.05.00/Third%20Attempt/reinstall.out#L1179–L1311) at first glance modulo the `make` procedure's exit status, and I don't think I see `-framework OpenCL` anywhere in my build logs, either, which is weird since you say Tesseract's `./configure` should add that in where needed.  

P. S.:  I have now compared the undefined symbols diagnosed by each of the log files I just referenced and found them to be identical.   @zdenop:  Would like me to run another attempt with `make`'s verbosity increased?   When this issue first cropped up in Homebrew, I tried building it outside of Homebrew's framework in a clean VM. I unsuccessfully tried various approaches, which I have of course forgotten, but it always fails with:

Also, I can confirm this is still an issue using Xcode 8.3 on macOS 10.12.4 as well, no magical, mysterious fix with the latest update. @JCount:  Well, _that's_ not encouraging.  I'd update my environment to Sierra and the latest Xcode myself, but I'm stuck on an unsupported machine for the time being.  Since it doesn't help in this particular instance, however, I guess I shouldn't push myself to worry about that!  😆

<hr />

@zdenop:  Given that this issue is consistently reproducible both inside and outside of Homebrew, should we perhaps change this issue's title to something more like 'OS X/macOS OpenCL Linkage Errors?'   Maybe it's not a macOS issue, but a Clang issue.

Did someone tested 3.05 on Linux with Clang & OpenCL? @amitdo:  Not that I know of.  I don't personally have a Linux install available for testing, either.   > Did someone tested 3.05 on Linux with Clang & OpenCL?

I just tested the build, and it worked without any problem using `./configure CXX=clang++-3.8 CXXFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall" --enable-opencl && make training`. @stweil:  What about Clang 4?  According to Homebrew, that's what I've got installed:

==> Caveats
LLVM executables are installed in /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin.
Extra tools are installed in /usr/local/opt/llvm/share/llvm.
To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include


If you need Python to find bindings for this keg-only formula, run:
  echo /usr/local/opt/llvm/lib/python2.7/site-packages >> /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/llvm.pth
``` Scratch that:  now I feel somewhat silly, as, according to [Apple's list of Macs that support OpenCL](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202823), my machine (a mid-2007 aluminum iMac) is listed as supporting a 'non-applicable' version of the standard&thinsp;—&thinsp;that is, none at all!  This issue may still be relevant if @JCount's still seeing issues with _his_ setup, though, unless he _also_ has an unsupported machine….  The runtime might still be present in my installation, though, as I've seen the Metal binaries just floating somewhere waiting for when I clone this drive's contents into a machine that supports _that_ API, so I'm not entirely sure whether that means I should be seeing link-time errors or not.  With 3.04.01, I was seeing _run_-time errors, possibly even with _return values_ (can't remember what they were off the top of my head, unfortunately, but I'm _pretty_ sure I still have my old Tesseract installation around, so I can go check.)   I think you need OpenCL **1.2** or higher. @amitdo:  Well, again, that _might_ explain things… I have a machine that supports OpenCL 1.2, both with the Intel Iris Pro Graphics 5200 iGPU and the AMD Radeon R9 M370X dGPU. Yes, it seems to detect the presence of the OpenCL headers, and therefore framework. The issue seems to be in the linking as you say, and I honestly have no idea what is going wrong there. @zdenop, @JCount:  Strangely enough, here is the result of a bit of investigation I just did on my end:  

```
…$ ls -@aHhl /System/Library/Frameworks/ | grep OpenCL.framework
drwxr-xr-x    8 root  wheel   272B Dec 13 16:41 OpenCL.framework

So the OpenCL runtime _is_ present on my machine even if it's not _doing_ anything other than just _sitting_ there.  Either this just gets installed with the OS whether your machine supports it or not or the framework's presence is a relic of that one time I tried to install OS X so as to make it bootable on both this iMac and a newer MacBook Pro (can't remember the exact model ATM, sorry…) by _first_ running a clean OS install to this external drive from the latter and _then_ doing an _delta_ install to said drive from the _former_&thinsp;—&thinsp;though I _think_ I may have once done a clean install to the drive in question just from the iMac, so maybe my earlier hypothesis is correct…?  :man_shrugging:   I got vanilla (no homebrew) Tesseract 3.05 to compile and run. Machine is late 2013 iMac 27" with Sierra and OpenCL 1.2 support.

Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.38)
```

```
./configure --enable-opencl LDFLAGS='-framework OpenCL' LIBS='-ltiff'
make -j
```

When the explicit `LDFLAGS='-framework OpenCL'` is removed the build fails. For some reason  `--enable-opencl` does not enable linking `-framework OpenCL` everywhere it should. Doing this causes `-framework OpenCL` to also show up twice sometimes, based on skimming the logs, so it works partially but incompletely.

Likewise, removing the explicit `libtiff` linkage will fail.

I don't have a lot of time to investigate the build machinery this week, but hopefully this analysis is enough of a clue to figure what is not working. If nobody bites I will look into it next week.

I did not try building training tools.

 @zdenop, @stweil, @JCount, and/or @jbarlow83:  What testing remains to be done with respect to tracking down exactly what's going wrong here?  Might there be anything _I_ could do to help?   @RandomDSdevel In `configure.ac` there is some logic that says "if we get `--enable-opencl` and we are only a Mac, set the variable named `OPENCL_LDFLAGS="-framework OpenCL"`, the special argument for Mac frameworks. Other platforms are working fine because they don't have or don't use `-framework` as far as I know. I actually don't know the details of what it does.

Most likely there is a `Makefile.am` (probably) that should set its local `local_LDFLAGS= $(OPENCL_LDFLAGS)` because it uses OpenCL, but does not. Or perhaps it is the main Makefile at the link step.

The lazy way would be to jump back about six months or so to find a version that compiled and git bisect your way to the breaking change, since it did work until recently. @jbarlow83:  Well, I'm not very fluent in Autoconf, Automake, and/or makefile syntax and have never used `git bisect` before, but I know `bash` shell scripting syntax well enough that I _think_ I can at _least_ point others in the right direction to _look._  The v3.05 logic in [`configure.ac`](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/3.05/configure.ac) that's responsible for handling that script's `--enable-opencl` option occupies [lines 173–248](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/3.05/configure.ac#L173-L248)&thinsp;—&thinsp;specifically, `OPENCL_LDFLAGS` is set to `"-framework OpenCL"` on [line 223](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/3.05/configure.ac#L223) in the middle of the code ([lines 211-225](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/3.05/configure.ac#L211-L225)) responsible for setting up the correct OpenCL compilation and linkage flags for use on Darwin-based operating systems like OS X/macOS.  I haven't yet looked for or at a `Makefile.am`, but I _do_ remember seeing one somewhere in the source code earlier; I'll just have to look for it again (hopefully it's in the repository's root directory or not far from it.)  If _that_ doesn't give us any clues, I'll check this 'main Makefile,' whatever it happens to be called.   @jbarlow83:  I checked in my last local build attempt and neither `"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/Makefile.in"`, `"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/Makefile.am"`, _nor_ `"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/Makefile"` (the first and third of which are generated by `"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/aurogen.sh"` and/or `"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/configure.ac"`&thinsp;—sorry, but I can't exactly remember which script does what at the moment…) mess with any kind of `local_LDFLAGS` variable.  In fact, I ran `find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep "*local_LDFLAGS*"` inside my local checkout of the Tesseract repository (still on branch `3.05` with artifacts left over from my last failed out-of-Homebrew/vanilla build) and came up _empty_&thinsp;—&thinsp;but maybe I was doing something wrong with this command pipeline invocation…?   As I mentioned I can look into this next week, just not now.

The issue is likely that some new code was introduced and the build system was not properly modified so there is no code to search for it. It is the absence of some necessary code that is the trouble. As you're not familiar with autotools my rough problem sketch is probably not helpful. What would help is to run `git bisect` and find the commit that breaks the build on macOS, since it used to work. That is likely a strong indicator of what kind of fix is needed. @jbarlow83:  Sorry to bother you with details you probably could have figured out easily enough yourself, then.   @RandomDSdevel, please try pull request #808. It fixes `make training` with OpenCL on macOS for me. Don't forget to run `./autogen.sh` after applying the change. @stweil:  Thanks, but I'm not sure that will help with _this_ issue, as it has to do with not being able to linking Tesseract _itself_ with OpenCL…  As I mentioned before, though, _this_ problem might _alos_ have something to do with the fact that invoking OpenCL functionality on my machine probably only returns responses indicating the fact that the library doesn't work with my graphics card, as Apple never supplied drivers for it.  @JCount, however, has a machine that _does_ support OpenCL and said he's getting similar link-time errors.  IIRC, @jbarlow83 has also reproduced this issue and has said he'd look into trying to fix it some time this week, but I'm not going to invoke him any further than that, as he advised not to badger him too much about it (I've _probably_ already annoyed him _enough_ as it _is_, what with my overly enthusiastic impatience to get this fixed and all…)  That being said, I'll still take a look at the PR you've pointed me towards and see if does anything to help.   I'm not annoyed at all, I just have to do the work that pays the bills first. :) @jbarlow83:  Whoops, look like I was reading a little too much into things, ha-ha…   @jbarlow83:  Just saw your work start popping up in #814.  I have one comment on it, but I'll leave it in the relevant discussion thread.    Hi,

  I am running the same command line as for the 3.x versions with

as option. The resulting text does not preserve the white spaces, which it correctly did for the 3.x version.

Thanks
Andre I am also facing the same problem. After using "preserve_interword_spaces", there is actually no significant difference noticed between the normal OCR and "preserve_interword_spaces=1" parameterized OCR.
Is there any solution? Same problem here. "preserve_interword_spaces" has no effect.
Also many other parameters do not work in v4.0 :/
Would be nice to get some feedback from the developers (which parameter works/which not) I have the same problem in version 4.0. I have tried with version 3.0.2 - It does not have this option. I also noticed this problem and it seems related with the trained data, because if I use tesseract 4 with the trained data of 3.05 I do get the interword spaces.

The traineddata files for 3.05 does not have lstm data, so oem 3 in your case is equivalent to:

>0    Original Tesseract only. Thanks for pointing out !
I dived on tesseract source code and found an almost solution to the preserve_interword_spaces problem, it seems that when transferring the words in ccstruct/pageres.cpp the spaces were not transfered see patch bellow.
With this patch the output is almost identical with the 3.05 version except for the missing spaces for the first column (need more research to see where the first/second word is transfered and why the spaces/blanks are not).

 Where is the user forum? Where can I ask questions?

I need to build static library of tesseract so I can compile everything into one binary  After installing `3.05` I still get `3.04` when running `pkg-config --modversion tesseract`

How I installed `3.05`

```
cd /var/bin && wget http://www.leptonica.com/source/leptonica-1.74.1.tar.gz && tar -xvf leptonica-1.74.1.tar.gz
cd leptonica-1.74.1 && ./configure && make && make install

cd /var/bin && wget https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/archive/3.05.00.tar.gz -O tesseract-3.05.00.tar.gz && tar -xvf tesseract-3.05.00.tar.gz
cd tesseract-3.05.00 && ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install && ldconfig
```

When compiling my program that uses tesseract its also still using `3.04`

```
g++ -std=c++11 txtocr.cpp -o txtocr -llept -ltesseract
``` I will uninstall everything and try to clone master  Hello!

  I want use opencl to speed up tesseract. I define USE_OPENCL in C/C++->Preprocessor->Preprocessor Definitions(VS2015) .
and include"CL/cl.h" in openclwrapper.h.
And rebuild the libtesseract  project , and succeeded.
When I use GetUTF8Text, the  String return is NULL but return correct string when I don't use opencl.
Can you tell me ,where is the problem?
Can Opencl use in teseeract 3.05?
Thanks!




 Hi , zdenop ,
   Can you help me at there. I can't use the tesseract user forum because I don't have a Google account .I am very sorry for that.
Thanks!  I want know  in persian's tesseract what fonts are there and also what is priority  for training them?   @stweil I think you mean `fonts` instead of `languages` in the above.  The current master only builds Win32.  Are there x64 builds or build processes available for tesseract4?  I use for persian and it is ok but if in text ,there were two language  (persian and english) how can detect and convert them ? which traineddata are you ussing for persian? what accuracy rate do you get?

for multiple languages use

-l per+eng @roozgar - which is the better traineddata for persian - fas or per? The tesseract-ocr/tessdata repo on GitHub only has 'fas'.
 > The tesseract-ocr/tessdata repo on GitHub only has 'fas'.

See https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/issues/24
At one time both per and fas were there.

 Shree,

I don't see 'per' in any commit in the **tessdata** repo. Both were there in langdata. Ray has since deleted `per`.

PersianOCR is an external project using Tesseract (3.02 I think) - see https://github.com/reza1615/PersianOcr ​no 'per' is removed and changed persian traindata to 'fas'​
​and also its not capable with end or any other language​
 Maybe Arabic.traineddata also includes Persian. Ray? @amitdo no,i checked
the Arabic train data cant detect the symbols that is included in Persian and not in Arabic lstm dont merge trained files in run time?  SVSync::StartThread() is used in api/ , backporting the GRAPHICS_DISABLED fix
Backport api/ libtfiff missing dependency for win32 platform @voyageur:  @zdenop said in [this comment](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/739#issuecomment-286849254) on #739 that [your second commit](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/pull/760/commits/7e0352f5276a68d7c58b750279273f25a868efaa) to this PR's staging branch isn't really needed for branch `3.05` since `configure` _should_ add the relevant linker flag automatically when Tesseract is being built with OpenCL support&thinsp;—&thinsp;at least, I _think_ that was his reasoning…   @RandomDSdevel oh you're right, this is not needed for #739. Windows builds may still need as there is a direct call to tiff library in api/ for win32.
I will update the commit message, but can drop this commit of course if not really desired for 3.05 branch @zdenop I don't ;) the (outside of opencl) TIFFSetWarningHandler call at https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/3.05/api/tesseractmain.cpp#L396 is wrapped in  "defined(_WIN32)" so probably needs the -ltiff linking  I'm trying to process the following image using tesseract 3.04
<img width="157" alt="number" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/115446/23871059/3ae3fb32-07ff-11e7-8d02-f1c33e7a8d10.png">

The image seems pretty clean. however, it extracts the following from this image using the `eng` lang

> .ESHBEE

**Questions**
1. Is there a way to read numbers like these from tesseract? 
2. If I have to train a separate lang for these type of numbers, can the trained lang be integrated into the `eng` lang?  I have found that the error goes away when NOT using --eval_listfile,
please try without the following

--eval_listfile
/home/stweil/src/github/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/frk/train/frk.training_files.txt

Though this means that there is no regular eval during training.

 A link to the relevant line in the source code:  
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/134a2537584b5bd6000841dbcb0a9489cd2548f5/ccstruct/imagedata.cpp#L648 Maybe it's a memory problem. How much RAM do you have in that machine? About fonts, I believe that for LSTM training Ray used much more fonts for each language than with the old engine.  So little RAM? A University server, I guess...  :-)  On Mon, Mar 13, 2017 at 3:42 PM, Amit D. <notifications@github.com> wrote:

 ​@stweil You can increase the number of box/tiff pairs by adding
--exposures "-1 0 1" or even --exposures "-2 -1 0 1 2" ​with the same fonts
to get images which are lighter and darker than the original font.

```
training/tesstrain.sh --fonts_dir /usr/share/fonts --lang frk  \
  --linedata_only --noextract_font_properties --exposures "-1 0 1" \
   --langdata_dir ../langdata --tessdata_dir ./tessdata \
     --output_dir ~/tesstutorial/frk
```

Also, please check whether the fonts you are using have support for the
paragraph marker etc, otherwise they might get dropped as unrenderable.

@theraysmith I think it will be useful if training using non-synthetic
box/tiff pairs is also supported for LSTM.

Thanks.
 @stweil I had  generated box files for different Fraktur font alphabet images using makebox. However these need to be reviewed for correctness and tabs need to be added at end of lines.

I do not recognize the letters so can't update them. jtessboxeditor could be used for adding tabs.

https://github.com/paalberti/tesseract-dan-fraktur/files/721936/fraktur-png-box-to-be-corrected.zip I know. I do not have those fonts,but found these images on the net on some
font sites. If you or Ray have the resources to get these fonts, you can
use them to create appropriate trainingdata.

 These are the freely available Fraktur fonts that I found:

```
FRAKTUR_FONTS=(

  "Cloister Black, Semi-Light" \
  "Proclamate Light, Semi-Light" \

    "Walbaum-Fraktur" \
)
```

sample files via text2image that I had posted in the issue

https://github.com/paalberti/tesseract-dan-fraktur/files/721956/frk.box-tif-pairs.zip @stweil The page about fonts will be very useful. I have added info about Devanagari fonts and will update more later.

Please see pages 2-9 in http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/genzmer.pdf
which show samples of many fraktur fonts - again it does not have ligatures and all letters - but would something like that be helpful for training/testing German Fraktur.  You can also check the following as well as other font related documents on website by  Ulrich Stiehl.
http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/gutenberg2.pdf
http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/gutenberg.pdf
http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/walbaum.pdf `INT_PARAM_FLAG(max_image_MB, 6000, "Max memory to use for images.")`

I don't know if it is actually related to the reported issue, but you can increase the default value from the command line. @amitdo It is probably memory related, since  the assertion does not occur when I omit --eval_listfile.

And, https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/training/lstmeval.cpp uses a smaller memory size for images.

`INT_PARAM_FLAG(max_image_MB, 2000, "Max memory to use for images.");`

How would you change it from commandline?
 The same way you do it with text2image.

You should take into account the RAM in your PC. @Shreeshrii  I changed the max_image_MB to 8000  /training/lstmeval.cpp, and complie it .

``` @Shreeshrii  I am trying to fine-tune tesseract for Arabic and Persian.

thanks for answering my question.
No, it's not overfitted. I tested it and the results were acceptable.

@theraysmith, the current code includes a hard coded value of 70 dpi as the minimum resolution and sets any resolution which is smaller to that value. This is also done for images which don't include a resolution information ("0 dpi"). Maybe it would be better to assume 300 dpi for that special case. Why does the resolution matter at all? IMO, assuming Tesseract really needs to know the resolution, when the dpi is absent or seems suspicious, the program should not try to guess the dpi and ocr the page. It should just print an error message. Maybe. It is not clear why the dpi information is needed at all. I can read text of any dpi (just have to adapt the reading distance or get some glasses) without knowing the actual dpi value, and ideally OCR software can do that, too.

If the dpi value is important, we need an option to set it for images without (or with wrong) resolution metadata. https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/search?q=resolution Many thanks for this analysis and your efforts. +1 this is biting me as well. I have a small demo which was working a year ago, but now it is giving:

```r
> text <- ocr("http://jeroen.github.io/files/inlove.png")
Warning. Invalid resolution 0 dpi. Using 70 instead.
Too few characters. Skipping this page
```

I guess the problem is that the default resolution is too low?  https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/tesseract-ocr/OJI3bsi_JMY/NHlt8uEfEAAJ

>I'm new to tesseract and wondered why the lstm dataset creation for the training process has to write the file again and again in TrainLineRecognizer. I've seen 200MB/s IO on the disk while creating the training data set. As far I can see for the training case it would be sufficient to just load it once and write it at the end.

I call it "MRZ" because it has the OCR-B as the only font and trained with characters A-Z, 0-9 and the lesser-than symbol (<). Seems to be fast and accurate in my projects. Is there a list where community contributions for traineddata are listed?

This should be tested and added. Is that what you want?
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/AddOns#community-training-projects Thanks. Added to community Training Projects.  If you really want to piss @theraysmith off, then fine... I understand Ray's messages on this topic differently.

Peace :-) @egorpugin 
Is there no good alternative to AppVeyor?  Blacklist and whitelist no longer work in 4.00alpha. They used to work in 3.04.

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tesseract-ocr/cpcJHTE2xMo Same problem for me with 4.00alpha, I tried to set `tessedit_char_whitelist` by using:
- cli with option `-c tessedit_char_whitelist=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
- cli with config file
- tesserocr python module

But I keep getting non letter results

I can provide Dockerfile + python script + images if needed Same problem for me. Still getting symbols and alphabets despite setting `tessedit_char_whitelist="0123456789"`. I encountered the same issue today when using --oem 1,2,3. It works fine for --oem 0 (Original Tesseract).  I am encountering the same issue, is there a solution for this issue yet?.
 >I am encountering the same issue, is there a solution for this issue yet?.

No. I am facing the same issue. Is it really a bug or is it just not supported for LSTM?  It's currently not supported for LSTM.

People, please do not add another "I have the same issue" comment. Are there plans to support whitelisting on LSTM in the future? I also have this problem when using Tesseract 4 from C++

    tess->SetVariable("tessedit_char_whitelist", "01234567890abcdefg");

has no effect on the output. The same with blacklist.

Tesseract returns not only ascii + language-specific characters but also some strange other characters from UTF-8. 

Is there a way to get a full list of all possible characters, specific for a language or not? Basing on such list one could make a workaround to map such wrong characters to best fitting ones that are expected (like EM DASH to plain ASCII dash etc.) and remove those without any sensible fit. It would be useful for me in current circumstances and maybe it could be useful for others in need of whitelisting.
 I would like to exclude everything except letters and digits from the result. I started from eng.traineddata and trained my font from graphical images (@shreeshrii: thanks!!)) . Is there a way to get rid of all the other symbols, especially !"=)() ... ?

I am using --oem 1.

Thank you very much,
Ernst  Increase portability by insulating `autogen.sh` from platform variance.  

<hr />

Specifically, test for the existence of either `libtoolize` or `glibtoolize` and caching its location into a script variable prior to running the utility in order to prevent either utility's invocation from spawning error messages of the form './autogen.sh: line $LINE: $COMMAND: command not found' (with the $LINE and $COMMAND pseudo-variables replaced with content relevant to what line the command that spawned this error message was on within `autogen.sh` and what command's invocation was attempted at that point, of course.)  In particular, this takes into account macOS's wonky `libtool` semantics, which involve the following idiosyncrasies:  

* The version of `libtool` that Apple bundles within both Xcode and its separate associated 'Command-Line Developer Tools' package comes _without_ a copy of `libtoolize`.  
* macOS package managers like Homebrew and MacPorts typically install the GNU versions of `libtool` and `libtoolize` as `glibtool` and `glibtoolize`, respectively, when needed by another package as a dependency or otherwise requested by an end-user.  

The pre-existing code which was _supposed_ to handle this case was _not_ resilient with respect to errors finding either the system copy or the GNU variant of `libtoolize`, as it ran _both_ `libtoolize` and `glibtoolize`, in _that_ order, _without_ checking for the existence of _either_ utility!  (From the `man` page of the copy of `bash` included with macOS 'El Capitan' v10.11.6, which is reported to be `GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin15)` by `bash --version`:

This pull request should also be backported to at _least_ branch `3.05`.   By the way, did I put the `libtoolize`/`glibtoolize` existence check in the right place?

I thought the commit message did a pretty good job of explaining things myself, but I'll change it if you feel like that isn't the case.

Every commit that we push to this repo, at some time in the future (few weeks/months) will be reviewed by Ray or someone else from Google. If they don't like something they will change it. Then it will be merged with the internal Google branch, which might diverge significantly from the public repo's master branch. I think they do it infrequently, which means that when they try to merge with us they have quite a lot of work to do and it is not so simple as you might think.

@theraysmith, @jbreiden
You are invited to correct me if I'm wrong here. See also:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/pull/752#issuecomment-294258915 I rebased the code to fix some merge conflicts.

Ray, I noticed your recent changes which introduced `TFile` in those files. IMO removing memry.{cpp,h} would also be a good step to clean the code. I‌ could do that in two steps to simplify reviews if you agree:

1. switch to using malloc / calloc and free in a first step (like it is done in this PR)
2. replace all those allocations by C++ code (new / new[] and delete / delete[]) >replace all those allocations by C++ code (new / new[] and delete / delete[])

Isn't this remark from Ray also relevant here?
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/pull/11#pullrequestreview-12160316 It isn't, as I promised to use C++ code in step 2 (see above). >How about replacing the underlying pointer variables with std::array, thus hiding all calls to allocate and delete the memory?

If you know what he meant, consider implementing it.  Teseract 3.04 - Was trying to command line OCR a 9206 multi-page tiff document on Mac OS 10.11, but it stops at page 3000.  Turns out opencl/openclwrapper.cpp line 93 (static const l_int32 MAX_PAGES_IN_TIFF_FILE = 3000;) specifically limits OCRing Tiffs to 3000 pages.  This const appears to only control the bounds of a for loop, so maybe this variable should be more dynamic and be based on the number of pages the input Tiff has instead?  just a thought. Sorry about that.  

Removed the 3000 page restriction on multipage tiff files.  There are now no limits, and this is pushed to the leptonica master: https://github.com/danbloomberg/leptonica Only relevant to 3.05. yeah, I might have a make my own custom build of 3.04.01 with the change to openclwrapper.cpp. @jbreiden I would think it's faster with it on, but haven't tested it.  Kinda new to tess - is there a way to easily turn it off to see? oh...looks like build flags    Hello,

Tesseract-3.04.01 (and having briefly glanced at the code, likely so does 3.05.00) does not explicitly link libtesseract against libtiff even when the former references symbols from the latter.

Manually adding -ltiff to the list of libraries in api/Makefile allows tesseract to build successfully, then again it is not a proper solution because e.g. the pkg-config file it installs still doesn't list that library.

 Thank you so much Shreeshrii!  That tip got me pointed in the right direction.  For anybody else that stumbles up this here is the config command that worked.  The second library path contains the libtiff libraries.

./configure CC=gcc CXX=g++ CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/56.1/include LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/56.1/lib -L/usr/local/lib" @idiosyncraticee  Glad you have solved your problem but for the record, that was completely unrelated to the issue at hand. Indeed, the command-line snippet you have posted suggests that libtiff underlinking has been fixed in the 4.x branch - one can clearly see -ltiff there. Which may make fixing this in the 3.x branch a simple matter of backporting a patch. >Tesseract does not reference any libtiff symbols

This issue is about 3.05. Should we remove the calls to these two functions in 3.05 as you have done in 4.00? Looks like @zdenop is busy. Is he the only one who can push these changes and tag patch releases? @mkszuba, @idiosyncraticee, @Shreeshrii, @jbreiden, @amitdo, @egorpugin, and/or @zdenop:  If you don't mind my trying my hand at resolving this issue, what's the local procedure for submitting backport PRs, at least with respect to the Git/GitHub workflow?  Do I just have to mention the commit from which the new one backports changes, or will I have to do something more complicated (like, say, use `git cherry-pick` or something…?)   @mkszuba, @idiosyncraticee, @Shreeshrii, @jbreiden, @amitdo, @egorpugin, and/or @zdenop:

…or would one of you guys rather handle this yourselves since you're more familiar with the codebase than I am?  Like I hinted at [earlier](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/739#issuecomment-283486022) in this thread, I'm just bumbling around trying to fix an [issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/10380) downstream in [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew)'s [Core tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) that I referenced back then.   @stweil:  I already got the `libtoolize` issue fixed here upstream in #750, but that has turned out to be _completely_ orthogonal to this one and is also just coincidentally waiting for said fix to be backported (from `master`, in its case.)  As for OpenCL, that's _actually_ what I've been wanting to get working _all along!_  I believe my rationale for efforts in this space agrees, at least at some level, with the sentiment you expressed earlier:  

> Depending on the graphic card, it [(OpenCL)] can be a great gain. That is relevant for some OCR projects which would take years on a single CPU.

As such, I'll be ready to propagate the backport of [`9ec0c4f`](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/9ec0c4fa9c983) from 4.0.x to 3.0.5 postulated [earlier](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/739#issuecomment-283117301) as the only change needed to resolve this issue here upstream to Homebrew as a downstream mirror of an official upstream patch if a new version of Tesseract is not tagged.  If a new version of Tesseract _is_ tagged, then I would be perfectly happy with propagating _that_ downstream to Homebrew instead of the patches containing the resolutions for this issue and, simultaneously but, again, orthogonally, #750.  Either way, all I currently wish to do is get Tesseract to build with `--enable-opencl` set by Homebrew (via the `--with-opencl` option to its build formula for Tesseract) _independent_ of any further reworking of Tesseract's OpenCL support, such as that suggested by [_this_ comment](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/739#issuecomment-283608563), that is undertaken in the future.  The intermediate resolution of #750 was, for me, just a nice little side bonus in the meantime.   @zdenop Turns out my glance at the code was not accurate and the problem has indeed been fixed in 3.05.00. My bad, sorry, @mkszuba:  Did the fix involve linking Tesseract with a copy of Leptonica linked with libtiff?   OK, so I communicated with @mkszuba via private e-mail to see if he would be willing to answer my previous comment, but he's looked at my downstream issue, and he has the impression that it's different enough from his that I should probably open a new one here upstream, so I think I'm going to do that if troubleshooting Homebrew/homebrew-core#10380 by trying to build Tesseract under Homebrew fails again (I suspect it will if the problem I'm having is distinct from the one addressed by this issue's preemptive resolution, but maybe I'll get lucky…)   Aaaaannnd…the build failed again, so the issue is as reproducible on my machine under Homebrew as I thought.  I'd better fork my issue off into a new one and stop derailing this one, then, because I'm starting to believe @mkszuba that it's not the same…   Per the GitHub issue mention notification above, I've now opened #786 to pursue Homebrew/homebrew-core#10380 further here upstream.    Hi,
Sorry for asking here.
I want to get the bounding boxes of the paragraphs and the paragraph breaks in the scanned image using tesseract.I went through methods in ResultIterator class but was not able to find the required one.
It would be great if anyone could help me on this.
Thank You.  @theraysmith

## Copied message:


I have been trying to train Tesseract 4.0 with my own data in order to extract text as a mix of natural language words and domain-specific (non-natural language) words (acronyms, identifiers, abbreviations). The Tesseract standard model has troubles in recognizing domain-specific words where “visual” words from source are either dropped or recognized with missing parts in them. So, I decided to train my own model.

I went through tutorials, set up a number of experiments, but so far with no real success. While I could fix the entirely dropped words problem by lowering the hard coded confidence threshold, and a partial success in recognizing domain-specific words, the accuracy on natural language words went down.

Two observations I have made so far by following experiments:

In Experiment 1 I use the available data (as it is) for training (~1 M tokens, and ~150 fonts). After that I generated an evaluation data set for another ~200 k tokens and ~15 most relevant fonts. Then, I trained the model by replacing the top layer from the existing Tesseract traineddata as described at https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00---Replace-Top-Layer The training converged a couple of days later and I evaluated the model on a held out dataset with gold standard (tiff – plain txt). The accuracy I received was lower than by using the standard Tesseract model. I noticed that the model is able to recognize some (not all) domain-specific words, however the performance on the natural language words went down (where the standard model worked fine). So, I analyzed the errors and designed another experiment in which I addressed the observed errors, which were, in my opinion, caused by data skewness = confusions between characters in rare and complex contexts.
In Experiment 2 I used the entire data set I have (~120 M tokens) and extracted word and char bigram statistics. Then I took all words with frequencies over a certain threshold as part of the final training data set. In addition, I boosted word statistics for words containing low-frequency char bi-grams (which made me troubles in the experiment before) and appended them into the final training data set. In the end, it resulted in a ~600 k unique words training data set. This was then rendered with ~ 150 fonts into tiffs, the evaluation data set remained a natural language text of ~200 k tokens in ~15 most relevant fonts. It turned out that training converges too slow – it has been running for over a week now with the best model of a ~ 0.17% error rate . Evaluations of pairs of different subsequent model snapshots on the held out dataset showed no general improvement over each other, rather random fluctuations between more accurate natural language words vs. domain-specific and vice versa. More interesting, models with lower char error rate (< 0.5%) perform worse (especially on natural language words) than models with higher char error rate (~ 0.5%). I also noticed that the model captures “language modeling features” which makes the recognition of misspelled words, “non-natural language” unique identifiers and acronyms difficult. Moreover, unique identifiers, rare words etc. in text are a big problem, however can be already recognized in chunks, but not as a whole word. More specifically, trouble cases are “like-this”, “like/this” or “this-or-like-this”.


At this point I am doubting the way I am training Tesseract is correct. So I would like to ask the community the following questions:
Should I use a natural language text or a dictionary of words for training and evaluation data set?
How important is the effect of token redundancy? (Are the errors in recognition of natural language words caused by the only single instances of those words in the training data?)
How to get Tesseract to recognize freely generated tokens not available in the training dataset? 

Thanks,
Alex

 I have had similar results, though with smaller training sets, both with Devanagari and san_latn (Sanskrit in Latin Script). Update:
After preparing new training and evaluation data, I trained a new model once again. Now, the data comprises 4,6M tokens of about 600k words (with a controlled, "shape-similar" to real word distribution) for 150 fonts. Then, I used ~ 80 % of data for training and 20 % as "held out" eval data.
After about 6 weeks (:)) of training the model converged to 0.01. Then I took a single page of the training TIFF file and ran Tesseract on that page. 

Despite a high quality level for "alpha-numerical" words, **ALL** words which contain "-" are wrong. I thought that the word I was looking at is the one of those which cause 0.01 char error rate, I dug deeper into the log file. I see the word as well as the entire line were perfectly recognized during training. Moreover, this word exists at least 5 times in the training text, and thus at least ~750 times in all fonts. 

So, I am a bit confused that the words which were perfect during training are wrong when evaluated separately. And, it is the case for all words containing "-".

Alex  how to build tesseract 3.0.1 on mac OS X?  >What is the reason for this change? Shouldn't Tesseract get credit for its PDF output?

If someone embeds libtesseract in his his product 'myOwnOCR', he probably prefer that any output will use this name instead of 'Tesseract'...

Maybe it will be more fair if 'libtesseract x.yz' will be kept in the output, especially if the developer doesn't apply any change to it, or apply only minor changes. I'm against this as well. It's too important to be able to trace Tesseract-produced PDFs back to the version of Tesseract that produced them. Tesseract should not allow changing the /Producer field.

The /Creator field, which Tesseract does not set, is the appropriate one for this use case.  I will training a new model to recognize chinese, english and some special symbol, now i can not create the image with text2image because the font file may not cover all text. How could I to solve this situation. What version of Tesseract are you using?

Have you tried using multiple languages for recognition, eg. -l eng+chi

 @Shreeshrii , I am using Tesseract 4.0, and I want to train a model including English, Chinese and some math symbol like △. 
Now the problem is I can not generate the training image via a single font. (text2image) The training process drops unrenderable words. So the letters not included
in the font will get dropped, if you use a combined text with multiple
languages and run text2image with different fonts.

You will then get some images with text in one language and some in the
other.

However, I don't know how successful this will be. You will need a large
amount of text to train.

I have not had much success in training 4.0. please share your experiences
if you try the above approach.

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/ca16a08c10/api/pdfrenderer.cpp#L729  I want to build a model with a image of bar code as input and output the number sequence corresponding to the bar code.

Output:

This task is similar to speech recognition. Can tesseract be used to do this?
  I know, that `tesseract --version` outputs the exact version and github commit hash, **if** it was compiled with `./configure --enable-debug`, example:
```
tesseract 4.00.00alpha-278-gc768b58
 leptonica-1.74.1
  libjpeg 6b (libjpeg-turbo 1.3.1) : libpng 1.2.50 : libtiff 4.0.3 : zlib 1.2.8

 Found AVX
 Found SSE
```

I wonder, why this is not output, when the configuration setting was not given and I suggest to modify the build code so that the version and github commit hash is **always** shown with the `--version`command.  Yes. I agree, adding version info with github commit hash in non-debug builds will be very helpful.

 @zdenop Is https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/fd0683f9e03934bbdf7fbebb4d21d64c37b68bc0/api/baseapi.cpp#L140 the only change needed, and would you accept a corresponding pull request ? @zdenop Where exactly is your problem to print the GIT_REV when users use --version ?

I *have a problem when, as an expert, I run always the latest version, but sometimes after git pull the latest build is not the "installed" build. As a user I want to have the fastest code, i.e. built *without* --enable-debug.

I again request to think over it, and to always - if available - burn the GIT_REV into the code. I ask you for this. Not using `--enable-debug` increases processing speed about 6%.
  @zdenop, what about using GIT_REV only for versions without tag, no matter whether it is a debug or a release build? Then released stable versions would not show GIT_REV. >Not using --enable-debug increases processing speed about 6%.

Only ~6%? With LSTM mode?

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/40#issuecomment-263432042 BTW, maybe we should add another debug/optimization option with `-Og`?
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html  I compile tesseract 3.04 with OpenCL support and I install it on an Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit machine. The machine  has an intel core i5 CPU and an nvidia geforce 1080gtx with cuda 8.0 GPU. 

When I run tesseract from command line  I get:

I make a lot of tests using C++ API, python wrapper and command line but I didn’t notice any improvement on speed. Do I miss something?

 Maybe we should print a warning:

Using oem 3, which is the default mode.

Something similar should be used for psm out-of-range value. you need
--oem and --psm now

instead of -oem
-psm is still accepted for historical reasons

two dashes instead of one

``` Hi there,

if you still get the message "DotProductAVX can't be used on Android", could it be that you try to run 32-bit code on a 64-bit machine ? This is what I'm experiencing.

If I build the lastest version with MINGW64-32 bit and try to run on a 64-bit Windows, I get this error and a crash.

If I build with 64 bit all is fine running on Windows 64 bit.
If I build with 32 bit all is fine running on Windows 32 bit.

Maybe somebody could look into the code again and check if the test for AVX is performed at runtime, not at build time.

Greetings. I will uninstall and check again tomorrow.  @stweil You are right, I messed up in giving the version command.

I reinstalled versions for 2/2/17 as well as 1/30/17. Getting the error regarding AVX for both versions.

Is it possible that your local version of binary is different from the one linked from wiki?

I think this is due to me abusing the psm. It's probably a bit much to switch off segmentation and still expect tess to handle tables properly.

 So, when? Maybe you want to use this strategy:
 
1. Make one unified deb package for Debian 9, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 17.04.
2. Push it to Debian & Ubuntu 'backports' repos. For Debian 9 and Ubuntu 17.04 you will need to wait until they are released. For Ubuntu 16.04 you can start when you want to. @zdenop 

I think, you should tag the 3.05 branch with the 3.05.0 release. It can be updated in case there are any additional changes. @manisandro

Have you tried building gImageReader with 3.05  release candidate?

https://github.com/manisandro/gImageReader/issues/156 Hi, 
I'm the maintainer of gimagereader in Debian. I just checked with the debs @jbreiden provided. Gimagereader crashes when compiled against 3.0.4 but run with 3.0.5, see https://gist.github.com/innir/a4662ad7043c9cc27e9f7bdaff8f8acf.

Recompiling gImageReader against 3.0.5 resolves the crash.

This is really easy to fix upstream. You just have to bump the SONAME if your symbols change! Not too hard to get! Please make a 3.0.5.1 release and bump the SONAME!

Philip @manisandro no problem on your side, gImageReader works fine with 3.0.5 :) Thanks for checking @innir , I haven't yet had time to build 3.0.5. @jbreiden I think it's in Recognize() or one of the functions Recognize() calls. Hard to tell as the next two lines in the crash log are empty :(
Anyway, if symbols are removed, the SONAME has to be bumped, if symbols are only added that's not necessary - AFAIR. Those ABI trackers are good, but I'm not sure if they catch things like this: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/pull/259/files

About the tracker: https://abi-laboratory.pro/index.php?view=abi-tracker Next release - 3.05.1
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tesseract-dev/7vwsJNCAUcQ  PDF Output being a standard feature has some problems in Windows.
If you use stdout as tesseract output and pipe or redirect the PDF Output to another Executable, e.g pdftotext, every linefeed is converted to CR/LF in the resulting PDF, corrupting this PDF file.

It could easily prevented by implementing

`#ifdef WIN32`
`  if (_setmode(_fileno(stdout), _O_BINARY) == -1)`
`    tprintf("ERRROR: cout to binary: %s, strerror(errno));`
`#endif`

somewhere near TessPDFRenderer call, maybe in tesseractmain.cpp.
You would need to include fcntl.h and io.h too.

I tested it and it worked fine redirecting and piping in Windows.

Many thanks to the whole bunch of developers.

 Hi again,
I'm not sure about the appropriate location to put the code.
If all output is sent binary, not only PDF but text output will be binary too.
I don't know if this breaks any other compatibilities, especially with piping or redirecting the text output in Windows.

Maybe somebody could look for the correct place to insert.

I think this modification is quite necessary if we want to pipe PDF output to e.g. pdftotext.exe in Windows.
Running pdftotext on the tesseract PDF output is the only way for me to have text output with a decent layout and piping would save me from using temporary files.

Best regards  To recap, when a Tesseract PDF (3.0x or 4.x) is run through Ghostscript the OCR layer will be mangled. Ghostscript's pdfwrite (`gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -o out.pdf in.pdf`) will display spaces between every character and get confused about word boundaries. Other PDF viewers tend to work but usually have problems with searching for text, because they read as the text as having spaces in between.

(A related issue I reported was fixed in Ghostscript 9.20, but unfortunately that is not complete solution. Ghostscript <9.20 *also* corrupts any characters above U+00FF that happen to be present.)

There are lots of reasons someone might run a Tesseract PDF through Ghostscript pdfwrite: producing lower DPI renderings, PDF/A conversion, merging PDFs, changing paper sizes, sanitizing potential security holes like Javascript. There are also a lot of programs and services that use Ghostscript internally, sometimes without the user being aware of this. It's unfortunate that Tesseract PDFs don't play nicely with Ghostscript.

Ken Sharp (Ghostscript PDF dev) swears up and down that he can't do anything about it, essentially because Ghostscript interprets the input PDF into a page description language that is then rendered using pdfwrite. The output is visually identical, but otherwise the file is rewritten. Artifex also views preserving OCR text or other metadata as a bonus; if pdfwrite produces visually identical output they are satisfied.

See this comment from 2015:
https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=696116

Ken Sharp explains the essential difference is that the `/DW` (default glyph width) parameter on the GlyphLessFont is not understood by GhostPDL so it sets `/DW 0` and manually positions each glyph (the `-500`). 

```
[(T)-500(h)-500(e)-500]TJ
```

In English, Tesseract renders OCR with a font whose glyphs are 500 arbitrary units wide. Ghostscript reinterprets this as glyphs that are 0 units wide and moves the cursor 500 units between characters, and insists that it's the same thing.

I tried surgery on a pdfwrite-mangled file. I removed all of the `-500` offsets, set to `/DW 500` on the main font object, and removed the individual glyph width array `/W [...]` from the same. That works. (pdfwrite makes other minor changes to the PDF output too, but these don't matter as far as I know.) Writing a little script to fix mangled PDFs is possible, but it would be better to find a workaround.

So, is there any possibility of adjusting the glyphless font to work more like what Ghostscript expects so it survives the trip... without losing all of the other considerable and much appreciated effort that has gone into making glyphless work great with most other interpreters?

What are the commercial OCR tools doing to avoid similar issues?  Yes, I should have included an example, but it seems to affect just about everything so it didn't seem that hard to come up with one....

After Ghostscript, here is Acrobat showing that a search for the word "p o i n t" matches because it is now convinced that there are spaces between each character. The highlighting is now misaligned as well.

Versions..

Preview 909.12
Firefox 51.0.1
Adobe Acrobat Pro 10.1.3
Chrome 55.0.2883.95
poppler 0.51.0 For control.pdf and experiment.pdf, I checked that:
* using Acrobat XI, Chrome (pdfium), Firefox (pdf.js):
    * selecting a word will completely highlight that word rather than missing about half of the final character
    * random text that is copied and pasted will preserves word breaks
    * searching for "rela" will select all occurrences of "relativity"
* `pdftotext` produces a reasonable representation of the document contents with no extra spaces

Both files passed.

I then created control_gs.pdf and experiment_gs.pdf using Ghostscript 9.20.

[control_gs.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/769175/_control_gs.pdf)
[experiment_gs.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/769173/_experiment_gs.pdf)

For these two files, control_gs.pdf failed all tests, and experiment_gs.pdf **passed** all tests. The change in the experiment, assigning a width to the .null glyph, is therefore an improvement without any known regressions (yay!). The outputs of pdftotext on experiment.pdf and experiment_gs.pdf is binary identical.

I must have been mistaken on my early remark that there was a search functionality regression on "pdf.js" (by which I meant pdfium). I cannot replicate whatever problem I found with either my test files or experiment_gs.pdf. @amitdo With the way this experiment is set up, finding that pdf.js gives the same result on control and experiment is not a regression. It just means there are more cases of text extraction not working perfectly unrelated to running them through Ghostscript. I confirmed that experiment.pdf, experiment_gs.pdf and control.pdf all have the problem you identified with "making use of the theory". Maybe there's something else we can do.

@RNCTX In this issue we're discussing how *Ghostscript*'s pdfwrite utility seems to utterly ruin spacing in Tesseract-produced PDFs that *previously appeared correctly* in most viewers, rather than the general issue of spacing between characters not working in Tesseract PDFs. The real problem is the PDF spec itself:

>Identifying Word Breaks
>A document’s text stream defines not only the characters in a page’s text but also the words. Unlike a character, the notion of a word is not precisely defined but depends on the purpose for which the text is being processed. [...] applications all have their own ideas of what constitutes a word. I read that with Windows 10 the default pdf reader is the Edge browser. Someone should test it. Checked Win10/Edge. Same thing, control_gs.psf fails and the others are
acceptable. Someone other than me should check things though.

Yes, I understand the context, perhaps I should have clarified my post a bit better.  In working with the output in other tools, as you say in the OP, "ghostscript is used in many utilities, perhaps without even the knowledge that it is being used by the user." In my case the PDF output of Tesseract is fine, in fact in terms of cleanliness as input for other tools it fares better than any other. But I arrived at this thread after attempting to resize a tesseract output PDF with Imagemagick (which, of course, uses ghostscript).


I am looking at your files in my various tools...

OSX Preview, pdf.js, and poppler output remain un-usable, but I agree that the others are improved.  Interestingly, OSX Preview is different for the two files you posted.  The run-on words are in different places.

Your change leaves us with Chrome and Acrobat working flawlessly, which is a pretty good start.

Also tried iBooks on iOS but predictably the same output as Safari.

Acrobat reader on iOS does not allow text highlighting, but it does not find multi-word searches in either control_gs or experiment_gs, so Acrobat on iOS seems to be using a different renderer than it does on the desktop apps.  Acrobat Pro X on the Mac desktop app does find multi-word searches on experiment_gs, but not control_gs.

The dropbox viewer on iOS is apparently using Chrome's desktop renderer, but Chrome on iOS is using Safari's/Apple's instead of the Chrome desktop pdf renderer going by these results.

Firefox on iOS has very poor touch recognition in pdf files, so all I could do was pick the first word and "select all" which gave me 'some' text from each file but not all text on a page in either control_gs or experiment_gs

 I compile it myself in Ubuntu 14.04. The version is 3.04  These files will be removed soon with the rest of the legacy ocr engine, unless you'll persuade Ray to keep that engine...  Ray wants to get rid of the legacy OCR engine, so that the final 4.00 version will only have one OCR engine based on LSTM.

From #518:

@stweil commented:
>I strongly vote against removing non-LSTM as we currently still get better results with it in some cases.

@theraysmith commented:
>**Please provide examples of where you get better results with the old engine.**
Right now I'm trying to work on getting rid of redundant code, rather than spending time fighting needless changes that generate a lot of work. I have recently tested an LSTM-based OSD, and it works a lot better than the old, so that is one more use of the old classifier that can go. AFAICT, apart from the equation detector, the old classifier is now redundant.


 Is the intention that the legacy OCR engine will be available in 3.0x branch and LSTM engine in the 4.0 version? I support @theraysmith  removing the legacy OCR engine as we are getting better results in LSTM-based,
however we have to increase support to multilanguage and need many fixes to 4.0 final.. My personal opinion is that we should drop the old engine. It will be much easier to maintain and support Tesseract in this form. I also support dropping the OpenCL code. I also think we should release a last 3.0x version in the upcoming 2-6 weeks. I cannot agree with removing old ocr engine, until new lstm engine has support vertical text.

Of course I know that the new LSTM engine is very good ( in Japanese text including English words especially).
In the meantime, maintaining the old engine provides the option of using the old OCR engine only for vertical text.

c.f. #627 , #641 
 :+1:  for a side-by-side 3.05 and 4.00.

A possible way to achieve this goal:
For 3.05 you can append `3` to libtesseract and all the installed programs.
The traineddata will live in `.../share/tessdata3`.
  I agree with zdenop

tessdata should be used for the 3.0x series, so as to not break any
existing use

New naming can be used for LSTM 4.0

 @jbreiden Good idea to do a code update for 3.05 for Ubuntu 17.04. There are a number of bug fixes and changes and it would be good to get them out to the users. Thanks! **@theraysmith:**  Here I try to provide examples of where you get better results with the old engine.

I did a lot of LSTM training with OCRopus on real images of historical printings and noticed that LSTM recognition was inferior to classic Tesseract in these cases:

1. glyphs rarely seen in training (capital letters, numbers, certain punctuations)
2. unusual patterns (letter-spacing, e.g. R U N N I N G   H E A D)
3. very short lines (catchword at page end, page numbers)

My explanation is, that single letters get decoded using the combined evidence of the whole line. If this is either rare and unusual (1, 2) or mostly absent (3), decoding is uncertain, no matter how clearly single glyphs are printed and preserved (and therefore easily recognized by methods based on feature detection).

So I tried both the old (OEM = 0) and new (OEM = 1) recognizer on these 10 lines (the last line is a regular text line for comparison from a 1543 printing, where a trained model yields 99.5% accuracy for the book):

But it still is less consistent than the old method in treating spacings. The last line shows the potential that may be reached when training on real images becomes available (long ſ, proper inter-word spacing model, historical glyphs).

**So I vote for keeping the old code just for these edge cases which are otherwise hard to recognize at the same level of consistency.** >Admittedly, although this is all Latin text, the recognition looks much better **without any language model**

Without explicit `-l LANG`, Tesseract will use the eng traineddata, so

is equivalent to:

>There is always going to be a significant speed penalty for multi-lang mode.
The multi-lang mode could still do with more work to run it at a lower level, (inside RecognizeLine) but the legacy engine could do to go before that, or multi-lang could get really unnecessarily complex.
 I think that there is reason to keeping the old ocr engine while LSTM engine is not ideal. 
This will allow use two engine simultaneously. 
For example ABBYY [uses several ocr methods](https://abbyy.technology/en:features:ocr:classifier) in his OCR engine: Bayesian classifier with about 100 features, raster classifier, contour classifier, structure classifier and then differentiating classifiers. The problem is that the code for the old engine is too large and complex. As Ray indicated, keeping it will make improving the new LSTM engine much harder. https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/733

theraysmith commented:

>... yes I would still like to remove the old classifier and take out a lot of code with it.
I'm going to review the replies to my request for "old better than new", and thanks to those that provided them, with a view to making new better than old on those problems. From 518
theraysmith commented:

@stweil commented 29 days ago:

Stefan, we are still waiting for it ...  :-) As you know, unlike almost all the other files in the tessdata repo, the '_frak' traineddata files are not based on Google manpower (& machine-power) efforts. 
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Data-Files#fraktur-data-files

Maybe you and and your friends from @UB-Mannheim can prepare a new  deu_frak traineddata for Tesseract 4.00 and share it under open source license (preferably Apache 2 or other permissive software license) ? https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/681#issuecomment-275801448
Just a reminder for Ray.  From tesseract-ocr/langdata issue 59

theraysmith commented

>I'm also going to fix the single char/single word issue that was raised as
an objection to deleting the legacy engine.
 There are community training projects for MICR and SSD but these are not included in upcoming training by Ray.  Just documenting differences between 3.0x and 4.0 ... listed as issues in langdata:

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/issues/65

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/issues/64

 Based on my testing, I agree with @stweil - `adding (good) LSTM support for a language is much more difficult than for the old engine. `

Most recently I tried creating traineddata for Armenian based on a request in the forum - see https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/issues/67

While with my limited fonts and training text, I was able to get a legacy version of traineddata within a few hours which had reasonable accuracy, with the same inputs and 3-4 days of processing, the lstm version of traineddata did not better the accuracy, took more time while OCRing the same file. Of course, my test sample is very limited.

On the other hand, the accuracy and speed of complex scripts such as Devanagari has improved with the LSTM traineddata (though I haven't been able to add a top layer or fine tune those because of unicharset limitations).

I hope the new codebase and traineddata will address these issues. Thanks! As discussed in issue #1074, currently only the old recognizer is able to detect text attributes like font size, bold, italic.  https://github.com/blog/2309-introducing-topics Suggested topics:

That's yet another case of bad UX in GitHub IMO. >I found out that it adds 'org' to any topic in any organization.

 Hello @Shreeshrii 

Do you know how to set learning rate by hand??  ![test1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/23392731/22503425/a5baa5fe-e8ac-11e6-9d5e-36db771b3654.png)

When i use command "tesseract test.png out", the result is "01234567Beabcdelghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". 
It has 4 wrong text.
But when i use command "tesseract test.png out pdf", the result is perfect correct.
Does someone know how to also make the result is correct when output is txt? Are you just looking at the PDF or the text in it?

The difference could be based on the default page segmentation mode used by
each method.

 No feedback from the OP, so I suggest to close this issue.  I want to build Tesseract using visual studio 2013.
I have followed all the steps as mentioned in https://vorba.ch/2014/tesseract-3.03-vs2013.html which is the site mentioned in the compiling section.
Everything went well but in the last step while building the solution I got a link error which is cannot read liblept171.lib and cannot include "allfrex.h".
I am new to this and haven't figured out any solution yet.
Is this the right way or please guide if any other way is possible to build tesseract in visual studio 2013

Thank you.

These are the steps mentioned in that link:

 
17 [Previously](tesseract-cygwin.html) I wrote about how to compile Tesseract OCR 
18 using Cygwin. While this is nice if you want to compile Tesseract for your own 
19 system where you can install Cygwin on your own, compiling with Visual Studio is 
20 better if you intend to distribute the compiled package so users don't have to 
21 install Cygwin. 
22 
 
23 Compiling Tesseract 3.02.02 with Visual C++ 2008 (Express) is [covered by the 
24 documentation](http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/vs2008/doc/setup.html) 
25 whereas compiling Tesseract 3.03 isn't covered at all, though. 
26 
 
27 Unfortunately newer versions of Tesseract also require a new version of 
28 [Leptonica](http://www.leptonica.org/), a C library for image processing and 
29 image analysis applications, which in turn requires new versions of zlib, 
30 libpng, libtiff, libjpeg and giflib. Tesseract provides pre-compiled versions of 
31 Leptonica, which prevents you from having to collect and set up projects for all 
32 of these libraries in Visual Studio, which can be a tedious task. 
33 
 
34 Yesterday I found a project on GitHub that includes a Visual Studio solution 
35 file for all dependencies required to compile Tesseract 3.03: 
36 [charlesw/tesseract-vs2012](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract-vs2012). While 
37 following the build instructions there, I stumpled over several build errors, 
38 which I could easily resolve by removing a definition. The necessary change is 
39 in [my fork](https://github.com/pvorb/tesseract-vs2013) of the repository 
40 mentioned above. 
41 
 
42 This is a write-up of all steps that are required to compile Tesseract 3.03 with 
43 Visual Studio 2013. 
44 
 
45 ## Prerequisites 
46 
 
47  1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/). 
48  2. Install SVN. There are many versions of SVN. You can, for example, install 
49     the binary package from [SlickSVN](http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download) for 
50     free. 
51  3. Install [Visual Studio 2013 for Windows Desktop](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) 
52     (the Express version will be enough). You don't need the optional features 
53     except for "Microsoft Foundation Classes for C++". 
54 
 
55 ## Building the dependencies 
56 
 
57  1. Create a directory where you want to compile Tesseract. In this document, 
58     I'll assume it's `C:\Tesseract-Build\`. 
59  2. Open a CMD prompt and change to that directory. 
60 
 
61     ~~~ 
62     cd \Tesseract-Build\ 
63     ~~~ 
64  3. Clone the dependencies repository from GitHub. 
65 
 
66     ~~~ 
67     git clone git://github.com/pvorb/tesseract-vs2013.git 
68     ~~~ 
69  4. Open the "VS 2013 Developer Command Prompt". (It can be found in the Start 
70     Menu.) 
71  5. Change to the newly cloned repository. 
72 
 
73     ~~~ 
74     cd \Tesseract-Build\tesseract-vs2013 
75     ~~~ 
76  6. Build the dependencies 
77 
 
78     ~~~ 
79     msbuild build.proj 
80     ~~~ 
81  7. You can close the "VS 2013 Developer Command Prompt". 
82 
 
83 ## Building Tesseract 
84 
 
85  1. Re-open the first command prompt and ensure it's still in 
86     `C:\Tesseract-Build\`. 
87  2. Get the latest source from SVN. 
88 
 
89     ~~~ 
90     svn checkout http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tesseract-ocr 
91     ~~~ 
92  3. Change to the newly checked-out repository. 
93 
 
94     ~~~ 
95     cd tesseract-ocr 
96     ~~~ 
97  4. Apply the patch provided in `tesseract-vs2013`. 
98 
 
99     ~~~ 
100     svn patch ..\tesseract-vs2013\vs2013+64bit_support.patch 
101     ~~~ 
102  5. Copy both directories in `C:\Tesseract-Build\tesseract-vs2013\release\` to 
103     `C:\Tesseract-Build\`. Now you should have 
104 
 
105       - `C:\Tesseract-Build\include\` 
106       - `C:\Tesseract-Build\lib\` 
107  6. Open `C:\Tesseract-Build\tesseract-ocr\vs2013\tesseract.sln` with Visual 
108     Studio 2013. 
109  7. Press `F7` on your keyboard. Both `libtesseract303` and `tesseract` should 
110     compile without errors. 

 see https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling

section under windows re building with cppan

@egorpugin  will it work with vs2013? Thanks!

It would be helpful to users if you update the wiki regarding cppan
compilation of tesseract. Right now it seems to me that it is for training
tools since that comes on top.

Many users compile tesseract not for development or training but just to
get the latest version of the software.

I don't have Visual studio so I haven't tried it.

 Thank you very much!
I followed all the steps as mentioned and I was able to build the solution successfully without any errors.
Now I added a new cpp file with the code given in api example.But I did not get any ouput .I also tried writing the output to a txt file but in vain.
Can  you please help me how to get the txt,hocr,pdf output file after building the solution.
I am currently trying it in visual studio 2013  as well as 2015 version.
Regards.

API example:
#include <tesseract/baseapi.h>
#include <leptonica/allheaders.h>

int main()
{
    char *outText;

    tesseract::TessBaseAPI *api = new tesseract::TessBaseAPI();
    // Initialize tesseract-ocr with English, without specifying tessdata path
    if (api->Init(NULL, "eng")) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Could not initialize tesseract.\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    // Open input image with leptonica library
    Pix *image = pixRead("/usr/src/tesseract/testing/phototest.tif");
    api->SetImage(image);
    // Get OCR result
    outText = api->GetUTF8Text();
    printf("OCR output:\n%s", outText);

    // Destroy used object and release memory
    api->End();
    delete [] outText;
    pixDestroy(&image);

    return 0;
} Thank You,It is working.

I  would like you guys to provide videos on step by step process of building tesseract on various platforms which would really guide us especially the beginners and save many hours of searching in the net. I want to build Tesseract with vs2013. I have followed all steps of this tutorial:
https://vorba.ch/2014/tesseract-3.03-vs2013.html
but in the last step, I got this error:
can not find include file: 'version.h' 
what should I do?
Thanks try with cppan and directions given in
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling

 I am so sorry for the incomplete report and not testing this issue properly. Running "tesseract filename.jp2 out -l deu_frak" resulted to the above given error message and an empty out.txt file or freezing of app, so I automatically (but little bit stupidly) assumed that the OCR scanning is not working. After you reply, I tested it with lots of other jp2 files, and it in fact works despite of the warning. The jp2 files that I was using were simply somehow corrupted, it is my mistake, which I apologise!

By the way, I encountered problems also with multipaged TIFFs, tesseract now outputting empty txt files. But I am probably doing something wrong here as well and it's not a bug. I am using Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS Server without any graphics system and installed tesseract with "apt-get install".

>Deserialize header failed occurs when a training input is not in LSTM format or the file is not readable. Check your filelist file to see if it contains valid filenames. It's a moving target, and it's not guaranteed to read files generated by a previous alpha snapshot.  Back in 2015, I used some tools I found that came with tesseract that performed post-processing to correct ocr errors (i.e. they accepted text in and returned it out). I used them for my dissertation work in text error correction. Now it looks like tesseract has been refactored and they're gone. Regrettably I don't remember what the executables were called. Is there any way to get that old version of tesseract, or is there a way to use the new tesseract for OCR postprocessing instead of OCR directly?  @stweil @egorpugin  

It would be great if you can provide for download windows binaries with the latest 4.0.0 alpha code,  including the new training programs 
Lstmtraining
And

Thank you. + tesseract-ocr google group

Thank you both so much for your prompt response in providing the windows
binaries.

I have added links to both at
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/4.0-with-LSTM#400-alpha-for-windows

Unofficial experimental binaries of tesseract-ocr 4.0.0-alpha (Jan 30,
2017) are available from the following links:

   <http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-setup-4.00.00dev.exe>
   from UB Mannheim <https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki>
   - zip file with cppan generated .dll and .exe files
   <https://www.dropbox.com/s/obiqvrt4m53pmoz/tesseract-4.0.0-alpha.zip?dl=1>,
   You have to install VC2015 x86 redist from microsoft.com in order to run
   them.

Please correct the description if it is not correct.

 @stweil Thanks. I have downloaded the new version and will give it a try.

Wondering though how  it is related to win32, since I am running under windows 10, with wit 64bit os and x-64 based processor. 

![sysinfo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5095331/22583959/cf6cf428-ea15-11e6-8d88-dc4f92a59acc.png) Thanks for clarifying.

Have you/others at UB Mannheim tried LSTM training with the windows binaries?

In my earlier test, I found that lstmtraining was not reading .lstmf files created on windows. I will have to test the exact same case under bash and windows to confirm it.  I am wondering if it could be related to Unix vs DOS/Windows EOL differences.

Is there a way to compare the .lstmf files (binary files)?  Hi,

I have put my effort by making changes to necessary project files. I have used the solution file present at the following location:

https://github.com/peirick/VS2015_Tesseract/

Unfortunately, that is based on Tesseract - 3.05. I took the latest 4.0 version of source code to build in visual studio. I'm getting following linker errors only for the newly introduced code part in 4.0 i.e., lstm and simddetect:

 I ran the above command but still no luck. 2 weeks gone but still no progress on build. Can you kindly describe the step by step procedure so that I can have a successful build. Thanks in advance. Can you provide a video of installing Tesseract 4.0x along with it's step-by-step description, on Ubuntu 16.xx from scratch. Uploading it to Youtube so that all people interested in the matter can follow from scratch.  Hi Egor,

Thanks for your response. Forgetting what happened in the past, I now ran the following steps for building Tesseract from source:

git clone https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract tesseract
cd tesseract
cppan
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..

Build is now successful.

But, when I'm trying to run tesseractmain.cpp program in Debug mode, I get the following error:

Can you kindly assist me in getting rid of this error and run the main program? Perfect. Setting tesseractmain as the default project worked. Thanks a ton for the help. Closing the thread.  I also meet the same problem, but I can't resolve it with your answer. can you give me some suggestion? Hi @BrianZhu01 , can you let us know what all steps you've tried from beginning? thanks, I download tesseract, but I do not how deal with cppan? ,I had download cppan.exe .what can I do? I do steps as you list, but have the follow problem, and I just put the cppan.exe in cmake path? what I have wrong?@saint1729

 Add **cppan** to you system variable **PATH**.

Go to directory where you extracted tesseract source code
**cd tesseract**


Run the following commands after that:

**cppan
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..**

 Can you list what all files are present in your tesseract-ocr directory by running **dir** command and upload the screenshot here? thanks a lot,  If I run the cmd using administrator, I reslove the problem. when I run cppan , it can download the need files. thanks for your help,

 What if I have cppan that stops when launching it? I can't install Tesseract using cppan. I really need help! Thank you. 
Windows 10 64bit
opencv installed correctly.
Visual studio community 2017  I compared the HOCR output generated with recent builds of tesseract 3.04.02dev and 4.00.00alpha on various test images.

It seems that font recognition is broken in 4.00.00alpha:

With the command line parameter
**-c hocr_font_info=1**
3.04 generates font info for every word, which looks like this:
`x_font Verdana_Bold; x_fsize 21`

When I do the same with 4.00.00alpha, the font info looks like this:
`x_fsize 61491592`

The x_font attribute is missing entirely, and x_fsize has an incredibly large value.

The complete command line was:
`tesseract test-0.png  result --oem 1 -l deu -c hocr_font_info=1 hocr`

Version information:

3.04:
```
$ tesseract -v
tesseract 3.04.02dev
 leptonica-1.74.1
  libjpeg 6b (libjpeg-turbo 1.3.1) : libpng 1.2.50 : libtiff 4.0.3 : zlib 1.2.8
```

4.00:
```
$ tesseract -v
tesseract 4.00.00alpha
 leptonica-1.74.1
  libjpeg 6b (libjpeg-turbo 1.3.1) : libpng 1.2.50 : libtiff 4.0.3 : zlib 1.2.8

 Found AVX
 Found SSE

```
 The new LSTM engine does not support font recognition. OK, but then the presence of the x_fsize attribute is misleading.

Will the LSTM engine ever support font recognition?
 >Will the LSTM engine ever support font recognition?

Only @theraysmith can answer this question.

I don't think that exact font identification is important feature. The estimated size of a word/line might be useful information. Same for emphasis of words.  output using 4.0.0-alpha traineddata

I would suggest that if the best match for a word comes to be blank, then it be replaced by a string such as @@@@@ so that it is easy to identify missing text and correct the OCR output. Other similar issues:

Is it possibly related to `--strip_unrenderable_words` during training? I have noticed that the images created by text2image have a blank space instead of the missing word when the font is not able to render it.  >The underlying question is, if there is a word that is almost certainly incorrect, would it be better to have it with the error, or have it disappear?

I do not think it should disappear. However, if the word is almost certainly incorrect, then it should be marked in some easy way for users to fix the OCRed txt.

Request feedback from others too - @zdenop @jbreiden @amitdo @stweil etc. > I think the cause of all of these is the precision-recall tradeoff that takes place in linerec.cpp

I find that the words which are getting dropped are also the same ones which are not being picked up by tesseract when using 'makebox'. I has posted a sample with devanagari in another thread. (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/664#issue-201505043 )

Here is a kannada sample:

 Hi

Yeah @Shreeshrii  is correct ,The words not being picked,Is it problem with Segmentation??
@theraysmith Even though the recognition is wrong it should be display with any alternate character either "-" or any thing...  It also might be useful to add a few(1-4) alternative words for each word when using the hOCR format. Please see
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dc3e/f1e05b4b629de5db721efb156d82556ff362.pdf
The ISRI Analytic Tools for OCR Evaluation

> A tilde (~) in an OCR-generated text file is treated as a reject character. A circumflex (^) is interpreted as a suspect marker and serves to mark the following character as suspect. For example, in Ne^vada, the v is marked as suspect. The value of these special characters is assessed when computing marked character efficiency.

I thought that this maybe a standard in OCR evaluation and hence had suggested a marker.

Regardless, I do not think that incorrect words should just disappear.
 > I am not convinced that the unicharset and/or compression are applied correctly to Kannada, which might explain its rather stubborn refusal to improve in accuracy.

@theraysmith Are there any specific issues that you have noticed which I can check with native Kannada speakers? Some feedback regarding Kannada recognition from MNS Rao 

```
I request you to analyse where special efforts are required to improve the program

Essentially kannada script has many problems from OCR point of view.

1. many characters with a very little difference making recognition difficult.
eg: ಅ ಆ; ಉ ಊ; ಎ ಏ ಐ; ಒ ಓ ಔ; ಅಂ ಅಃ
     ಡ ಢ; ದ ಧ ಥ; ರ ಠ ಝ; ಪ ಫ ಘ ; ಬ ಭ ; ವ ಮ ; ೦ ಂ ; ಕ೯ರ್ಕ; ೬ ಕ್ಮ 
    
2. in-consistencies in guNita formations
eg: ವು ಪು 

3. vottu of ತ ನ ಮ ಯ ರ ಲ  not like main character.

4. ಯ ಝ ಮ can lead to wrong recognition because of splitting of parts of the character by OCR process

5. ೕ is part in three different situations ಕೀ ಕೇ, ಕೋ 

I would like to know if the input from my side is helpful to improve the program.

If the sequence U+0924, U+094D is not followed by another consonant letter (such as "na") it is always displayed as a full ta glyph combined with the virama glyph "dev-ta-virama".
Unicode provides a way to force the display engine to show a half letter form. To do this, an invisible character called ZERO WIDTH JOINER should be inserted after the virama:
U+0924	0924	DEVANAGARI LETTER TA
U+094D	094D	DEVANAGARI SIGN VIRAMA (= halant)
U+200D	200D	ZERO WIDTH JOINER
U+0928	0928	DEVANAGARI LETTER NA
This sequence is always displayed as a half ta glyph followed by a full na glyph "dev-half-ta-na". Even if the consonant "na" is not present, the sequence U+0924, U+094D, U+200D is displayed as a half ta glyph "dev-half-ta".
Unicode also provides a way to force the display engine to show the virama glyph. To do this, an invisible character called ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER should be inserted after the virama:
U+0924	0924	DEVANAGARI LETTER TA
U+094D	094D	DEVANAGARI SIGN VIRAMA (= halant)
U+200C	200C	ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
U+0928	0928	DEVANAGARI LETTER NA
This sequence is always displayed as a full ta glyph combined with a virama glyph and followed by a full na glyph "dev-full-ta-virama-full-na
For more detailed information, see Chapter 12, South Asian Scripts-I in The Unicode Standard. For related issues, see "Where is My Character?" [MC] There are at times multiple ways of typing a character, some of the web text may look ok but maynot be correct. There probably needs to be a normalisation step before training.

Vowel letters are encoded atomically in Unicode, even if they can be ana-
lyzed visually as consisting of multiple parts. Table 12-28 shows the letters that can be ana-
lyzed, the single code point that should be used to represent them in text, and the sequence
of code points resulting from analysis that should not be used.

I found that when using Marathi traineddata words which used half ra (repha) were not being recognized correctly, it could be related to the ZWJ and ZWNJ problem.

Since unicode has evolved over time, there maybe legacy representations still around in the webtext.

In both examples there are two words separated by hyphen. The hyphen looks unclear, and thus Tesseract replaces it with another character. Other than this char all the chars in the two words are recognizes well.

This is not the desired behavior. There is a (slow) fallback function that runs when no simd is found. This `#else` code will prevent its execution.

Are you sure? This should not happen.
 >I don't believe clang compiles at the moment so not sure if it works for that.

If you can test with clang on macOS and report issues, if any, please do it.  I looked into what compilers provide the __get_cpuid() built-in intrinsic - GCC (including mingw) and clang. Microsoft's compiler has an equivalent named __cpuid(). It doesn't matter what OS we're running on, so after establishing we're on x86, it's better to check for the compiler than exhaustive list all platforms. I changed it to reflect this.

I believe the #error should stand. Code that lacks an implementation for a specific compiler should be a build error. This should be better than silently building an inferior tesseract. In any case only compilers outside of GCC, clang, mingw, Microsoft C++ and Intel C++ (which behaves like GCC on Linux and Microsoft on Windows) should hit the #error so anything left is quite rare. @stweil, what are your thoughts on this? (please read my remarks) I'm stuck without a full dev environment for a few days and can't do this
easily. I support the change @stweil proposed if anyone else wants to do
it.

How to reproduce:

1. Assume one page with a colored background `in.pdf`, converted to `in.ppm` image
1. preprocess `unpaper in.ppm in-cleaned.ppm` 
1. process with (example) `tesseract in-cleaned.ppm out -l deu+eng --oem 2 pdf txt`
1. tesseract mixed output file `out.pdf`has now a blotchy background (from the `unpaper` step above)

Is there any way to "feed-in" the original `in.ppm` as image, so that this is used instead of `in-cleaned.ppm` when creating the `out.pdf` ?

So what is wanted is original input image plus ocr layer, so that output looks like

 This is a complicated way of asking for an option to send one image through OCR and insert a different image in the output PDF.

```
tesseract --pdf-image original.png cleaned.png -l eng --oem 2 pdf  # not implemented, could work like this
```

I know this was requested before and I believe @jbreiden said it would be added to the PDF renderer  at some point. Sounds reasonable.

It is fairly simple to swap an image using qpdf's C++ API.

 @jbreiden It's the last really missing issue. 
The new algorithm is already a boost in quality. I reach here up to 100% OCR quality (for `--oem 2 -l deu+eng`) including these beasty "Umlauts" äöüÄÖÜß....

If this helps, I will donate some mBTC for implementing it just right now. Just post your receiving address. @jbarlow83 background info. As you know, I recently wanted to try your OCRmyPDF because I found the interesting `-clean` option (source: https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/ocrmypdf/latest/ocrmypdf.pdf ) which would have solved my problem:

which "does not alter the final output":

```
--clean
uses unpaper to clean up pages before OCR, but does not alter the final output.  This makes it less
likely that OCR will try to find text in background noise.
•
--clean-final
uses unpaper to clean up pages before OCR and inserts the page into the final output.  You
will want to review each page to ensure that unpaper did not remove something important.
```
but unfortunately this does not work with tesseract 4, at the present.

So I looked for bug reports, if tesseract could pass the original input image to the output; and filed the present issue. I think invisible text only output would be far more useful for developers that integrate tesseract or anyone who wants to do something fancy. It would still make sense to keep the existing OCR with image option of course. As a plus, it's should be easier to suppress the image than add a different one.

OCRmyPDF (which I maintain) use Ghostscript to rasterize and then runs one of its two PDF renderers. One uses Tesseract hOCR and provides more features but is not as good at producing the OCR text layer as Tesseract PDF, so I also provide Tesseract PDF. If Tesseract could produce a invisible text only I could offer all the features for both, and work towards phasing out the hOCR renderer. When possible I already do graft the text layer onto the existing PDF instead of constructing a new one.

In addition to OCRmyPDF `pdftk multibackground` could merge an OCR layer onto an existing PDF (by "watermarking"), so there is at least one other supported tool out there that should work out of the box. There's some other tools that wrap tesseract for use with PDFs as well.

In writing this I've made a case for not using qpdf because other tools should be able to do the job with an invisible text PDF, but for interest's sake case here is [example code](
https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/blob/master/examples/pdf-invert-images.cc) that inverts black and white for all images; clearly this is close to how one would replace an image outright. Looks really good @jbreiden. 

Works great in pdftk. No display issues and PDF syntax looks fine.

PyPDF2 is also capable of merging. It does not have the equivalent of "multibackground" but merge pages manually. Here is merging one page:

```python
In [1]: import PyPDF2 as pypdf

In [4]: pdf_text = pypdf.PdfFileReader(open('text.pdf', 'rb'))

In [5]: pdf_image = pypdf.PdfFileReader(open('images.pdf', 'rb'))

In [6]: page_text = pdf_text.pages[1]

In [7]: page_image = pdf_image.pages[1]

In [8]: page_text.mergeRotatedScaledTranslatedPage(page_image, 0, 1.0, 0, 0, expand=False)

In [9]: out = pypdf.PdfFileWriter()

In [10]: out.addPage(page_text)

In [11]: with open('pypdfmerge.pdf','wb') as o:
    ...:     out.write(o)
    ...:     

```

For reference, pdfbox did not work out of the box. As far as I can tell the closest command in pdfbox is
```
java -jar pdfbox-app-2.0.2.jar OverlayPDF images.pdf text.pdf pdfboxoverlay.pdf
```

However pdfbox takes the unusual approach of rasterizing the overlay PDF as a bitmap and drawing it on top of the base page, making it useless regardless of image/text order. (I suppose when you go to the trouble implementing a full PDF renderer in Java you feel compelled to use it even when it's not strictly needed.)
 I don't know about calling it a naked PDF because there's nothing exciting to see in it. It's more of a phantom or spectral apparition PDF, having form without substance.

`ocr_text_only` would do, or `suppress_images`? Not nearly as fun, but practical. How about `text_only_pdf` ?

@jbreiden  is it also possible to use a .pdf file as input to tesseract directly?  `pdf_invisible_text_layer_only`
+
a config file `pdfinvisible` (or maybe `pdf0`) @Shreeshrii PDF is a very complex vector-based file format. Tesseract works only on images. It is much easier to write PDFs that use a limited set of PDF features than read arbitrary PDFs. Have a look at OCRmyPDF (which I develop) - it addresses the details of using tesseract to apply OCR to PDFs. @jbreiden @jbarlow83 @amitdo  info: I just built the *whole*  toolchain from their git repos (tesseract, ocrmypdf, unpaper), and have ghostscript version 9.20 ready in a dedicated debian 9 "OCR VM" on my Qubes OS system.

Pls. let me know, what (if) you want me to test - I have time to test and want to help you. @Shreeshrii  http://kiirani.com/2013/03/22/tesseract-pdf.html

The PDF/invisible text output you guys are implementing works quite well for me using OSX 'Preview' but for a little jerkiness depending on scaling, of course.

This is quite a big deal, in my opinion, as it will allow those who have, for instance... legal documents containing notary stamps in color, or in my use-case aviation emergency manuals with color-coded pages, to keep their original copies unmodified from their scanners, but modify them in a clean way into searchable documents.  Thanks for this. Thanks for info on pdf to images conversion for use with tesseract. 

I usually use ghostscript for the purpose e.g.

```
gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH  -r300x300 -sDEVICE=tiffg4  -dFirstPage=168  -dLastPage=174 -sOutputFile=sample%03d.tif ./sample.pdf
```

I will give the other suggestions a try (including a new one suggested by zdenop in the forum- https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/tesseract-ocr/vvMldrkcuOQ/xLES3_ZoEwAJ )

@jbreiden Thanks, Jeff, for this invisible text output pdf which can be merged with the original pdf.

 >Ray will eventually merge this patch, but it is hard to predict when. I am posting here for anyone who is impatient or excited.

I suggest to merge this to master now. Ray can modify it later if needed. @zdenop https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/effa5741e6ef8bcb37d68250ca39c92fae85f6a9 does not work: breaks tesseract [UPDATE:] ~~and creates broken files~~. Who has tested that patch, and how ?
 >effa574 does not work: breaks tesseract and creates broken files. Who has tested that patch, and how ?

I had the impression that Jeff tested it. Maybe I was wrong.  @amitdo with "it breaks" I mean, that the "normal" function of tesseract is broken, https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/effa5741e6ef8bcb37d68250ca39c92fae85f6a9 always creates a blank pdf. And now, if I combine my original input pdf with the created output, I appear to have two text layers. Who can help, it's getting more and more complicated. 

Let's go back to the roots:
Why not simply passing the original input image to the output, inside tesseract ?

#### my wish
```
tesseract image.png image.ocr -c image_passthrough=1 pdf
```
which then creates
* image.txt (with the ocr-ed text)
* image.ocr.pdf (mixed-mode pdf with the original image.png and image.txt)

And this setting ( -c image_passthrough=1 ) should be the tesseract default, in my view.
 Tested. With effa574, `tesseract -c textonly_pdf=1` works correctly and `tesseract -c textonly_pdf=0` produces an invalid PDF.

The problem is missing a "/" in front of XObject.
 Fix in #667  @jbarlow83 works. But when I look to capi.cpp then - I think - you have to apply the corresponding change in capi.h see
https://github.com/Wikinaut/tesseract/commit/5e8089107a4bc77c3eca51f6404c41a1854e652e#diff-1ff9fac4997a03321dc873248bcf1309

(I am not sure, whether my patch is correct.))
 @jbreiden regarding "image_passthrough", pls.allow me to explain my workflow, which in my view, is quite common.

* I already _have_ mixed-mode multi-page PDFs ("input.pdf") -- for example, ocr-ed with the old tesseract.
* I already found that the new LSTM mode is very much better and want to regenerate the text layer for all my archived PDFs...
* ...without loosing the high image quality of my existing scans.

With the new `textonly_pdf`mode I managed this, but it requires this additional ugly step (marked with (*)

* split input.pdf into single pages for tesseract (use pdftoppm, or gs or whatelse)
* for each $image do `tesseract input-$image.ppm textonly-$image -c textonly_pdf pdf` command
* `pdftk textonly-*.pdf cat output "textonly.pdf"
* (*) remove text layer from input.pdf -> input-without-text.pdf
* `pdftk input-without-text.pdf multibackground textonly.pdf output new-mixed-mode.pdf`

So it's still very long way with your new option.

Please, perhaps you find a possible way when input image type is a single page (and losslessly coded)

* gif (not really needed)
* **png** ; or 
* **ppm**, pbm, pgm

(**preferred**)
 to pass-through such image types.

I think, it's possible. why again *.jpg (step 1) ? Never ever use jpg with text files.
Please don't tell the mass about jpeg. Use png, ppm, or tif... I already developed code for this using -c textonly_pdf=1, thanks Yes and no, why can't tesseract do this (pass-through the "bunch of input images") ? Pls. elaborate your step
"Extract the images from the PDF file (don't render!). For this example, we'll assume jpeg."

I use
        pdftoppm -aa yes -r 400 -scale-to-x 2000 -scale-to-y 2800 in.pdf image
 Was there a final resolution to this request for putting back in the original images? @Wikinaut? Yeah, that doesn't work for me: `Could not set option: textonly_pdf=1`

I'm using version 3.05.00 installed via homebrew.  @Jmuccigr I am definitely _not_ happy with the current implementation, and decided some months ago to stay silent and let other users come back with the issue (hoping, that my original proposal - pass-through the original input image without transcoding it - will be implement in forthcoming versions). >I'm using version 3.05.00

The `textonly_pdf` parameter is only available on the HEAD (4.00) @Wikinaut, yeah, my workflow at some point involves adding OCR'ed text to an optimized PDF. Having the OCR step degrade the quality of that PDF kind of spoils it. Just getting back to this now that 3.05.01 has hit homebrew and wanted to say that it seems to be working.

I've tested it out by running text-only tesseract on a 2x version of an image - which tends to give better results if the original dpi is too low - and then combining that text-only PDF with a PDF made from the original image, which keeps the file size down.  @theraysmith 

Ray, Thanks for updating the Wiki page for LSTM training. A few more changes in the following may be required in light of the updates:

> In theory it isn't necessary to have a base Tesseract of the same language as the neural net Tesseract, but currently it won't load without something there.

> Finally, combine your new model with the language model files into a traineddata file:

Please also provide command for building traineddata with just the .lstm file or with just .lstm and lstm-dawgs (so as to minimize traineddata filesize, if only LSTM is going to be used).

 Also helpful will be info on:

1.  how big the training text should be (number of lines) for:

- fine tuning and 
- adding a layer. 

2. what kind of text is recommended/can be used?

- paragraphs, sentences
- word lists
- orthographic syllables

e.g. For Sanskrit, I want to train by adding a layer using a list of most frequent orthographic syllables so that the unicharset is expanded to include all possible aksharas. Will this work?

3. Should training be done using different --ptsize ? If so, is it possible to modify tesstrain.sh to take a list of --ptsize options (similar to the array for exposure --exp). My own question - the answer can also be added to the wiki.

Is it OK to mix b/w images, produced by text2image, with gray and/or color images from book scan? 
 Also, is there a way for tesseract to create line boxes for a scanned image.

It will make it easier to put the truth text if the box dimensions are
pre-made.

This feature is not implemented. I will try to implement it sometime in the next few days and send a PR. Another question:

what effect does the add a layer type of training have regarding the unicharset in the new traineddata.

For add a layer, a unicharset if required eg. `lstmtraining -U ~/tesstutorial/bih/bih.unicharset` 
Does this

- add to the unicharset from the existing lstm file
- replace the unicharset from the existing lstm file
- replace parts of the unicharset in the existing lstm file

Meaning, if we just want to add a few characters to the unicharset, is it enough to have good sampling of those or do characters from the lstm unicharset (which are unknown at this point) need to be there too. Traineddata files in tessdata for 4.0 were trained with `--perfect_sample_delay 19`. The dafault value for the variable is 4.

The training command examples do not specify this. What are the recommended value to be used for finetuning and adding a layer?

 @theraysmith 

Please see 
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tesseract-ocr/-N5uPdSvJGA
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/642
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/561

'core dumped' error in these cases seems to be related to using --eval_listfile as part of the lstmtraining command eg.
`--eval_listfile ~/tesstutorial/saneval/san.training_files.txt`

Please update the wiki, if you can confirm this, so that people are able to run the tutorial.

Thanks. @amitdo Question to you, let me explain as briefly as I can:

* I have successfully LSTM ocr-ed 700 pages of a book using `tesseract in.ppm out -l deu --oem 2 txt`.
* I manually corrected the output file out.txt to out.corrected.txt.

I found certain *groups* of ocr failures in my scan case, two examples which were always wrongly detected
* "Citroén" instead of the original word "Citroën"
* "fiir" instead of "für"

#### Question

Is there an easy way - I guess, it could be possible and would be very userfriendly -

* a way to easily retrain a Tesseract language (or a copy) by re-feeding a corrected txt version in order to retrain ?
* What will be the commandline ?
 Hi @Wikinaut!

Believe it or not, I haven't started yet playing with training the LSTM engine, so I don't know enough to answer your question. Hopefully, this serious 'bug' will be fixed sometime in the next month :-)

Some observations: 
Both 'für' and 'fiir' are in the wordlist.
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/master/deu/deu.wordlist

'ë' does not appear in the training text, 'é' appears 4 times.
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/blob/master/deu/deu.training_text

>Café So für

Cafés
André

'für' appears 10 times in the training text.

>OCR Engine modes:
  0    Original Tesseract only.
  1    Neural nets LSTM only.
  2    Tesseract + LSTM.
  3    Default, based on what is available.

Did you try `--oem 1`? @amitdo my original text uses a very "bad" font, where the characters overlap very often, and the characters often look, but are not, "ligatures". This explains the "fiir" in many cases (in my case).

I also tried `--oem 1`. but found, that `--oem 2` gave the best results. However, I did not find an explanation, what this "mixed operation modes" are really doing, pls. can we add a short text to `"2 Tesseract + LSTM", I can supply a PR, but do not know what a correct and short description is.
 @amitdo and regarding my question above, can I "quickly" retrain my "deu" training data (or a copy of it) with a corrected text, this would be really great?

Promise: some mBitcoins for this today! Whoever coded the LSTM: Big APPLAUSE for him or her! LSTM - New OCR engine based on neural networks.
Tesseract - old OCR engine  (started in the mid 80s) - does character segmentation and shape matching.

 @amitdo yes, but what if one selects `--oem 2` ? Are then the results of both engines being compared or otherwise evaluated together ? The two engines runs and the results are combined in some way. :+1:  As said, I have zero experience training the LSTM engine.

What you want is described here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language#Orthography
It's not in the a German alphabet. it's from French. Still, maybe it should be included with the deu traineddata. It does looks like 'ii' (two 'i's), doesn't it?

Maybe the training text needs some examples of 'ii' so it can learn to distinguish it from 'ü'. @Shreeshrii in my conversion, these words "für" were recognized as "fiir". May be due to use of "unpaper" as preprocessor, and/or my use of "-l deu+eng --oem 2" for the conversion.

There were many more occurences of false-detecting "fiir" in my about 700 pages of text. This was the most frequent conversion error and triggered me to aksing you how I could retrain tessdata by using my corrected text file. A simple command line would be very helpful for such cases.

@amitdo regarding "ii": In my text, tesseract correctly ocr-ed "ii" in the words "Gummiisolation", and "Daiichi" (a name). @theraysmith You appear to be the expert for answering my question, if such a procedure for re-training (tesseract + LSTM) is easily possible, or not:

(I described it already above:)

Can I "quickly" retrain my "deu" (or "deu+eng") training data (or a copy of it) with a corrected text ?

* in.pdf -> tesseract -> out.txt
* out.txt -> manually corrected -> **corrected.txt**
* retraining tesseract (to get tesseract' )with these inputs: in.pdf + **corrected.txt**

re-running with re-trained tesseract' should in the best case result in
* in-pdf -> tesseract' -> corrected.txt 

I found but do not (yet) understand the present training explanations in the Wiki, and perhaps is my idea not yet covered. @theraysmith Thank you for your swift answer.

In my case, many "für" were detected as "fiir", when or when not using `unpaper` (I cannot remember, because I tried many different runs).

I will retry - and report here - with only `-l deu` in order to present a correct case for reproduction. @theraysmith to be more precise:

I tried tesseract with  `-oem 0, 1, 2` and found that `"2"` gave the best results (for a 700 pages scan). I rerun with and without `unpaper`, and found some differences. And I only used `-l deu+eng`, because my German text used some English terms. Now, as I have a manually corrected reference output text I can present (later) a kind of matrix with the results. New box renderer
https://github.com/amitdo/tesseract/issues/3 @stweil @amitdo Stefan, please can you also make sure that common words with a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaeresis_(diacritic) (Deutsch: Trema) like `Citroën` are correctly trained ?
 @stweil Thanks for your swift answers. Let me know, if I can help. Wikinaut, you can try the new best/Latin.traineddata @Wikinaut, 

The best/eng.traineddata doesn't have the marks you want. 

Try the new best/Latin.traineddata.
 The problem with "fiir" instead of "für" is a typical example of the ii / ü confusion which still exists in the current best traineddata. The wordlist for `best/Latin.traineddata` includes "dafiir" (correct: "dafür"), "fiir" (correct: "für") for example. >The problem with "fiir" instead of "für" is a typical example of the ii / ü confusion which still exists in the current best traineddata. The wordlist for best/Latin.traineddata includes "dafiir" (correct: "dafür"), "fiir" (correct: "für") for example.

Try to correct the mistakes in the wordlist and see if it helps to recognize these words. ... or run Tesseract without a wordlist. I recently removed the wordlists from the best traineddata to see and compare the real quality of the trained LSTM data. This is impossible when Tesseract uses a wordlist. With wordlists, Tesseract also invents words which don't occur in the original text ("computer" and "Google" in historical documents).

PS. Is there a parameter which disables the post OCR steps (like wordlist evaluation) in Tesseract without the need to remove the wordlists from the traineddata files? Yes, there is a parameter which disables the wordlist evaluation.

I don't remember its name right now... The parameter is lstm_use_matrix. >I guess, you can make the following two config variables as false to not load the wordlist dawg files. load_system_dawg T

load_system_dawg should work.

load_freq_dawg seems to have no impact on the lstm recognizer.

I'd expect that a word list is different for different languages, and it is also reasonable to use different word lists for different kinds of text (topic, date) of the same language, but it should not depend on the OCR algorithm.  @DanBloomberg

See https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/696122/ara.TRAINING.zip for box/tiff pairs and https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1JdJ8IXNweRX3NEMkZfX3gtdlk/view?usp=sharing for  some sample image files for Arabic.

 Improve with respect to what?   What is in leptonica?  What is in tesseract?

Have you looked at these prog files:
    arab_lines.c
    livre_figures.c Dan,

Thanks for your prompt response and links to the appropriate leptonica program files. 
https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/blob/master/prog/arabic_lines.c
https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/blob/master/prog/livre_pageseg.c
I will take a look at those. 

FYI,  I am not a C programmer. I am interested in good open source OCR for Indian languages and am trying out/testing tesseract for that. I am looking for improvement in tesseract in correctly identifying the textlines for complex scripts such as devanagari etc so as to get a more accurate OCR at the end. I also tested recently for Arabic text with diacritics.

A search yesterday led to your presentation on the net. Since tesseract uses leptonica already, I thought that you might be able to suggest better ways of textline finding in tesseract, specially for Arabic Diacritics, Devanagari script etc. (I have edited the earlier post with links to some sample files).

I am building the leptonica programs now and will try out the arabic_lines program on your sample image as well as other samples provided by Arabic users of tesseract.

 I tried arabic_lines with both arabic diacritics and devanagari sample and it is marking the texlines well. Results attached.

 Yes, the colors tell you at a glance if you've broken or merged textlines.

Of the 4 bad merges that you show (6 lines into 2), all but one are
trivially fixed with small changes in the morphology parameters.  I'll do
some experimenting.

 I've finished experimenting and will push some modified code to leptonica
to make this a bit more robust.

Changes will be in both pixExtractTextlines() and the demonstration code in

 @theraysmith 

Maybe ocropy's lines finding algorithm can help. AFAIK, it was designed to work well with Arabic. 
https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy/blob/master/ocropus-gpageseg

See this remark:
https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy/issues/46#issuecomment-112153537

It should be given a block with uniform size font. I would like to give these hints to the developers: 
In Arabic there are to kinds of diacritics
1- letter attached diacritics (dots like ب ت ج ث and أ آ ؤ) which stick to the letter and is mandatory
2. Vowel diacritics like ( ْ ّ َ   ً    ِ  ٍ   ) used with letters any letter can be conjunct/combined with it and is optional. Kids learn it to read properly as it help get rid of ambiguity, because عَلم and عِلم are two different words but we use the context to distinguish when vowel diacritics are absent.

N.B. 
لَاْ إِلَهَ إٍلا الله note that this َ   ِ  are different vowels has same shape exactly but used differently e.g. أَ is pronounced a while ِأ pronounced e. one used above letter latter used below letter.


bottom line: vowel diacritics in Arabic should be recognized alone (e.g separate box) (but I am thinking how to distinguish between the above case if it is the same box!!!) because it can be on any letter and is limited ( ّ  َ  ً  ُ  ٌ ِ   ٍ   ْ  ) special case also this ّ  can be conjunct/combined with other vowel diacritics also   ًّ    ّْ  

it is limited as entity but can be heavily repeated on letter because every letter has the capability to combined with

hope this could help Tesseract developers  I'm having a problem with number 8, it is read as 3...
I'm usin PSM 6, language english and pattern A to Z, 0 to 9 and ":" to ";"
Result:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1447491/21891559/67411cec-d8ba-11e6-8fdd-98fb73780d66.png)

I already change PSM, but no success.
Anyone can help?  In order to minimize the RTL/LTR effect, I created a training text file with arabic language text, one word per line. However the image generated by text2image has some pages with RTL text and some with LTR text i.e. aligned with right margin and left margin.

[ara.one-word-per-line.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/701624/ara.one-word-per-line.zip)
 This behaviour is controlled by the pango library that text2image uses. It's also happening with gedit, which  also uses pango.  https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/648#issuecomment-271987456

>Indic may be troubled by the length of the compressed codes used.

@theraysmith Can you explain a little more about this? 

 Devanagari script has a large set of ligature forms forms for consonant conjuncts. These are combinations of Consonant + Viraama + Consonant (CVC) or CVCVC or even rarer CVCVCVC. 

Currently the generated unicharset uses the combination of the conjunct ligatures followed by vowel maatraas as well as vowel modifiers as a recognition unit, leading to unicharset of 5000+ lines.

You may want to consider recognizing the conjunct cluster as a unit and vowel maatras and vowel modifiers separately. A special case can be the i maatraa that comes before (to the left of)  the consonant for Devanagari.

Thank you for explaining regrading unicharset compression and your new
strategy for Indic graphemes.

Since the unicharset is being used as a filter, it will be important to
include the most common conjunct clusters in it, which may differ from
language to language.

Some more questions

Are the desired_characters and forbidden_characters used in the process of
creating the text corpus for different languages?

How many text lines are you using for training of Devanagari, e.g.
Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi etc. Is it all/only from Wikipedia?

Thank you for the info on corpus building.

I have added links for resources for bih and snd in the langdata repo just now. Please see

* https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/issues/39 (Bihari)

* https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/issues/42 (Sindhi in Arabic script)

I also added a link to this discussion at https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/622 for support regarding Khmer.

I will forward your post in the tesseract-ocr group for reach other community members too. >I recently stopped training chr, iku, khm, mya after discovering that I
have no rendered textlines that contain anything other than digits and
punctuation.

@theraysmith

I tried creating training data for khmer and was able to create box/tiff pairs with khmer text. It is possible that the fonts directory you used did not have khmer fonts or for some reason 'latin' fonts were used instead of khmer fonts. I will post the files separately under an issue in langdata.

I used --find_fonts function of text2image to find the fonts that covered 70℅ of the khmer training text. 

It maybe useful in the training process to check the given font list for coverage and give an error or warning if it falls below a certain threshold, before going ahead with building the box tiff pairs.

edit: --oem 0 works with the khm.traineddata, --oem 1 recognizes it incorrectly. ```

text2image --find_fonts \
--fonts_dir /usr/share/fonts \
--text ./langdata/ara/ara.training_text \
--min_coverage .8  \
--outputbase ./langdata/ara/ara \
|& grep raw | sed -e 's/ :.*/" \\/g'  | sed -e 's/^/  "/' >./langdata/ara/fontslist.txt

```
Commands similar to above can be used for getting a fontlist that can be plugged into language-specific.sh to ensure that it calls fonts that are available on the system and have adequate coverage. Here is the output file from the above on my system.

Can you please explain the training process of tesseract-ocr with LSTM ?  Having an easily accessible unicharset will be useful for:

1. Checking whether to do fine-tune training or add a layer. e.g. if a required character is not in the unicharset within the lstm file then finetune does not work.

2. For viewing the wordlist/dictionary included in the dawg file in traineddata.

3. For replacing the wordlist/dictionary dawg-file in the traineddata.

4. For processing the user-words file. (Also see issue https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/403) https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/dc8745e6fd4c Some more changes are needed to fix this issue. >Is Wordstr format supported with the new commits?

- **Box file disorder**
The Arabic box file generate using Tesseract 4.x is in LTR ( Left to Right ) which is reversed, the Arabic language is from RTL ( Right to Left ). That means that **the first box should start from from the right side.**
( Have a look at the **wrong and disorder Tesseract 4.0x Arabic box file** )
[ara.Traditional_Arabic.exp0.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/697557/ara.Traditional_Arabic.exp0.zip)


Tesseract 4.0 lstm puts the spaces between the words into boxes, as you know. 
Thus a problem arises caused by the **box file disorder** since the boxes are **mistakenly** set to be in LTR ( Left to Right ) for Arabic which is wrong, causing jumps from ( the end of the first line) to ( the end of the last letter of the line after it).
See the image attached

 While tesstrain.sh takes into account RTL languages while creating the DAWG files, text2image process does not seem to have specific RTL processing. will there be modifications for text2image ? What you show here is 'by design'. This should not cause any problem in training process and characters recognition for RTL languages. Ray,
There seems to be a bug. I have tried training a couple of times to 2-3% char error rate. But the OCRed text seems to be way off. During training, it seems that the diacritics are being recognized well., eg.

According to your tests, how does Hebrew (another RTL language) perform?

Do you have accuracy report for various languages that you can share with us, other than the one in the DAS2016 slides? @theraysmith Hope you have seen comments by Chris on the other thread also - https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/642

> i was merging the letter extender with the Arabic letter into one single box, and putting that Arabic letters as the character of the box, basically, i was trying to train the engine to recognize that Arabic letter in it's multiple positions, as you know the Arabic letters have multiple forms based which is based on it's position in the word ( beginning, middle, ending, isolated )
Example:
( كـ ) is not ( ك + ـ ) in the box file, it should be ( ك )
also ( ـكـ ) or ( ـك ) they are a single character ( ك ) in different positions, this is important in the box file.

Ray,
Please see https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/552 and https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/issues/35

Arabic Diacritics are included in the Arabic.unicharset. 

@bmwmy had offered to provide additional training text with diacritics - see https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/552#issuecomment-269961851

I was able to get the diacritics recognized during training by adding the following line to ara.config, however for some fonts it seems to be treating diacritics as a separate line. Do not know whether it is related to x-height for fonts. 
```
#Diacritics
textord_min_linesize 2.5
```
Related question, for lstm training, I am using
```
--noextract_font_properties
```

while creating the box tiff pairs and lstmf files since @amitdo mentioned that font_properties are not needed for LSTM training, please confirm. Please also see https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/318#issuecomment-218381668 and other comments regarding unicharset. 

Are the glyph metrics updated based on the fonts used for training? 
Are glyph metrics used for LSTM training? 

Answer:

**No. Most of the unicharset fields are irrelevant to LSTM training and recognition.
_The mirror and normalized string fields ARE important though.**_ I examined @Shreeshrii  training set and I appreciate his effort, but seems the text in generated tiffs image files are very small than it should be. It is hard to read even for humans. The vowel diacritics looks like noise also some letter glyphs as ( فـ /  ـمـ ). I suggest using 16-22pt font. 
Also this:
Iteration 1702: ALIGNED TRUTH : انَدبْعَ ىلَعَ انَلْنَ امَّمِ بٍيْرَ يفِ مْتُنْكُ نْإِوَ نَومُلَعْتَ مْتُنْأوَ ادًادَنْأ هِللِ اولُعَجْتَ الَفَ مْكُل

are reversed order (RTL issue)

comparison between noisy text example which was used in training and good one:
![testdia](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24265205/21882655/8d157326-d8bc-11e6-8a6a-7e6e6d49120e.png)

I think using bigger text image input will result in very high improvement. I am satisfied with this result taking in consideration this noisy input but (RTL issue) should be solved.

@christophered  ara.Traditional_Arabic.exp0.zip was good input image file
but @Shreeshrii  https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/696122/ara.TRAINING.zip  is noisy input image. About `--noextract_font_properties` . Ray confirmed it here:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/634#issuecomment-272027231
 >Are glyph metrics used for LSTM training?

I believe the answer is 'No'.

@theraysmith, can you confirm that? @amitdo I have been training using `--noextract_font_properties` since you brought it to my notice.

However, I am wondering whether some type of fontinfo / xheights is still required for LSTM training.

eg. in order to avoid the diacritics being discarded as noise, I had to add `textord_min_linesize 2.6` in ara.config. But different fonts have different sizes, even at same point size. I had to play with different values, but couldn't figure out a value that would work with multiple fonts.

So, I am trying the training again with only one font, Traditional Arabic font at 32 point, as suggested by @bmwmy.

Ray might have a different solution - will wait till the changes in wiki for training are updated.

  `textord_min_linesize` is a hint for the layout analysis step in Tesseract.

If the layout analysis step does not 'cut' the lines properly, the next step - the lines' text recognition, will suffer. [Tesseract release notes July 11 2015 - V3.04.00](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ReleaseNotes#tesseract-release-notes-july-11-2015---v30400)

>Major change to improve layout analysis for heavily diacritic languages: Thai, Vietnamese, Kannada, Telugu etc.

From DAS2016 slide 5 - 'Page Layout Analysis':
>Tesseract's existing text-line finding is also weak wrt diacritics,
especially for Arabic and Thai. > There is Bidi processing inside the post-recognition processing of
Tesseract that reprocesses/re-orders the text for output, so it appears in

@theraysmith 

Ray, Can the bidi post-processing be applied as an experiment to these debug messages? Then we can very easily see whether it is working.
>Answer: No. That would be very difficult. They are intended to be displayed completely without any RTL smarts. Shree, you might want to use this text2image option with Arabic:  
`--leading  Inter-line space (in pixels)  (type:int default:12)`

As a minimum it should equal to ptsize. For Arabic, you can try to increase it (20-50 percent bigger than ptsize)  IMO, 32 ptsize is too big. Try 14/16. Arabic also has presentation forms i.e. spacing forms of Arabic diacritics, and contextual letter forms.

Please  see 
http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/arabic_presentation_forms_a.html
http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/arabic_presentation_forms_b.html
and
https://github.com/w3c/alreq/wiki/Should-I-use-the-Arabic-Presentation-Forms-provided-in-Unicode%3F

Though, it is not recommended to use these for content under newer versions of unicode, I am wondering whether it will make OCR easier if these were used...

There can be a post-processing step to convert them to regular unicode points later.
 >Are glyph metrics used for LSTM training?

No. Confirmed by Ray here: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/issues/31#issuecomment-272261739
>... the glyph metrics aren't used. >Shree, you might want to use this text2image option with Arabic:

> As a minimum it should equal to ptsize. For Arabic, you can try to increase it (20-50 percent bigger than ptsize)

tesstrain.sh process uses default --ptsize which is 12. 

language_specific.sh sets --leading to 32 by default and to 48 for Thai fonts.


 @Shreeshrii here is a sample text for you, please test and post the findings
[Arabic sample variation.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/736942/Arabic.sample.variation.zip)

@theraysmith Most if not all languages related to Arabic (example: Farsi, Urdu, etc..) use such diacritics.
The Arabic diacritics are **often** but not always used in the Arabic text, sometimes in all the text, and sometimes at one letter in each word, but believe me the diacritics are frequently used.
Have a look at [The Quran](http://quran.ksu.edu.sa/tafseer/tafheem/sura1-aya1.html#tafheem)
 @Shreeshrii your sample of box/tif that you provided had an some errors that I've notice:
1) The U+640 (tatweel) issue
example: بِسمِ
wrong: ب ـِ س ـِ م
correct: ب س م   only 3 letters بسم
@theraysmith got it right, Tesseract should have the capability to generate it in .tif, but not consider it as a single character in the .box file, the correct thing would be that the box of U+640 (tatweel) be combined with the box of another letter, while setting the box as the character of a single letter, never even mentioning  U+640 (tatweel) in the .box file , ever.
 U+640 (tatweel) is a special case, people dont usually use it while writing text, so dont use it, or merge the boxes and remove it.

2) As @bmwmy mentioned earlier, in your .tif the charachters of the text are seperated, thats wrong. 
wrong: بـ ـسـ ـم
correct: بسم

I tracked the problem, and the cause was the txt that you were using, it contained the 1st U+640 (tatweel) mistake that I mentioned earlier The box tiff pairs are as generated by text2image program.

Any changes to that will have to be done by Ray.

I will test with the files you have provided.

 @theraysmith i suggest that you give capability to convert tesseract 3.0x box files to tesseract 4.0x since many of us have tif/box files based on the older version 3.0x

@theraysmith Also, Ubuntu have released the Snaps project, giving the ability to distribute a software as a universal Linux package. Would it be possible to release a Snappy version on Tesseract 4.0x, this would save us alot of time and effort by skipping the building process and it's issues.

I wonder if the bidi integration is working correctly for LSTM, as the

> tesseract4 reads الأ as األ which is pretty close, because we need to switch the position of the last 2 letters to have ا ل أ, this happens with similar word forms too like لا reads as ال and should be ل ا, and i wish to correct it. I can't believe my eyes. Ray commented in the users forum.

Shree, you are a magician!

:laughing: :rofl: :laughing:  Here is Ray's response:

>Thanks for spotting this!
I understand why it makes this error, but it will take some thought to fix it properly!
It is using a sort by x-position to re-order the boxes for RTL language training, but that doesn't work in the case of heavily kerned characters like ل in your example.
It needs to simply reverse the RTL characters, but has to avoid messing up the order of the common script, which is why I was using a sort to begin with.

 @theraysmith meanwhile can you give Tesseract 4.x the ability to Train single words each with a single Box.
This feature that I'am suggesting will give the ability to provide Semi-Automatic transcription capabilities. Please help to add space after text in Punjabi(Panjabi or Gurmukhi) sentance.  @theraysmith the recognition rate of the Arabic model is impressive, you really made a big recognition leap from 3.x to 4, Have you managed to solve issue #758 relating to لا is wrongly flipped as ال

 @Shreeshrii @amitdo @theraysmith 
I have read [a research that conclude by developing a recurrent neural network
that predicts diacritics in non-diacritized texts for Arabic](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D15-1274), how is that possible?
Does that mean if I train an Arabic Model with text that have Arabic diacritic, then use this model to recognize an image with Arabic text that dont have diacritic, the ocr txt result will have diacritics?
is that true? @theraysmith have you solved the problem of لا ? it really effects the error rate
  @theraysmith The main problem is caused by the reorder and normalize function in Tesseract.
Kraken have managed to fix many of the RTL langues bugs, along with using python-bidi, kraken reorder and normalize the writings, including alphabets and even diacritics.
Have a look at: http://kraken.re/ketos.html
https://github.com/mittagessen/kraken

Example, Arabic RTL:
![000021](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16248376/28440171-d5e05612-6dad-11e7-9315-d498cd7f1d34.png)

After using Kraken:
# امو مهسفنٔا الٕا نوعدخي امو اونمٓا نيذلاو هللا نوعداخي
Kraken reorder and normalize the text so it could be trained in Left To Right, the reordering can:
- Reverse the text and the marks are moved to the next letter to the right
- Or just reverse the text while maintaining the structure of the marks.

Example, the word أنفسهم it can be converted to:
- مهسفنٔا 
- مهسفنأ

Have a look at the NFD and NFC options

Ray, I hope that you could replicate Kraken's solution, once Tesseract solves this problem, Arabic and Hebrew would be able to achieve the golden recognition rates.
 @theraysmith

Dear Mr.Smith,

I am so grateful for answering my questions.

It came to my mind, maybe it is the problem. I thought, it is not a bad
idea to share it with you.

I think the problem of لا happens because of this:

for example if we have this:

الا انفسهم

Tesseract first reorder it this way:


8

7

6

5

4

3

2

1

ا

لا

ا

ن

ف

س

ه

م


Then it substitutes لا with two separate characters ل ا. So , the sequence
of characters becomes like this:


9

8

7

6

5

4

3

2

1

ا

ا

ل

ا

ن

ف

س

ه

م


After doing OCR, it reorders the characters to show them in the correct
order. So it becomes:


9

8

7

6

5

4

3

2

1

م

ه

س

ف

ن

ا

ل

ا

ا


So, the problem happened.


About the he dropped last space on each line of RTL text output, I have not
faced this problem.


I am really looking forward for the new traineddata I do appreciate your
kind help.

 @theraysmith have a look at some reordering script as an example code,[ reorder.py:](https://gist.github.com/mittagessen/1cefa68d2903b1cd0758574aaa1dd9df)

ا        ا       ل       ا      ن       ف     س    ه         م

So, the problem happened. @theraysmith  that could be a solution ( well not sure ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script_in_Unicode#Contextual_forms
these contextual forms are standard any form other than these can be considered as combination and thus inverted in the output Ray, I intend to open a new issue about Hebrew soon. For Hebrew, see https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/issues/82 @theraysmith Sorry for taking so long to reply back, I was training lstm models and conducting tests for days to have insight and solution on the matter of Arabic and diacritics.

**Intro:**
What is the Arabic diacritics issue: it's when the ocr engine recognition rate is reduced when introducing a foreign element/mark to the text, in this case diacritics; meaning if the text has few diacritics can the ocr engine recognize the text and achieve decent rates?

**Reply to Ray:**
- Note that you are fully correct in regards to `Tatweel`.
- Note that you are mostly correct in regards to the Arabic diacritical marks, they are mostly optional, but for some conditions are necessary, mostly the `Maddah` & the `Tanwin`.
Nevertheless, nowadays Arabic diacritics are moderately used.
Example of some situations that it is necessary to use marks:
![wer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16248376/28754294-5ae417a0-754b-11e7-82f0-87d22103ed54.png)


**Results of my tests related to diacritics:**
- Training a model with Arabic text, without diacritics
 `100% Recognition rate` on the training data.
`+90% Recognition rate` on scanned documents without diacritics.
Note that it cant recognize words with diacritics.
**Verdict: Suitable for real-life situations, but recognition rate can be further improved.**

- Training a model with Arabic text, the rendered images contains moderate diacritics but the transcription/groundtruth is without diacritics.
 `100% Recognition rate` on the training data.
Note that it cant recognize words without diacritics well.
**Verdict: Fail, not suitable for real-life situations.**

- Training a model with Arabic text, with text containing a mixture of both: lines with few diacritics and lines without diacritics .
`+95% Recognition rate` on the training data.
`+90% Recognition rate` on other images.
Can handle both images with/without diacritics.
**Verdict: Best of All tests, most stable and consistent, the model can recognize text with and without diacritics, has minor mistakes here and there that can be easily corrected via Microsoft Word, suitable for real-life situations.**

**Conclusion:**
The diacritics issue with regards to the Arabic language  can be solved by creating a model with a combination/mixture of both: lines with & without diacritics.
Example, include in your training non-diacritized lines:
![000008](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16248376/28755946-039a6152-756e-11e7-86e1-8df15f3f34fd.png)
Also include diacritized lines:
![015401](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16248376/28755958-46e6b9c4-756e-11e7-9f00-b5196fbb4223.png)

Certainly, the non-diacritized training data should be more than the diacritized, say +80% non-diacritized.
Thus the model will be able to recognize normal text, and also will know how to handle the few foreign elements if introduced.
 
This problem can be solved by wisely introducing few variations and mixture of data, thus the trained model will be more complex. Therefore, for now, there is no need to modify anything except the training data.

As for Hebrew @amitdo is conductor at https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/issues/82
 Question
@theraysmith I understand that for training, Tesseract 4.x reorders the Arabic text to tesseracts's reading order, meaning it converts RTL to LTR & then normalizes it.
For normalization, which form does it uses, NFD or NFC?
Example:
![000000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16248376/28756220-cca7bcb2-7572-11e7-937f-80b9ca2c4540.png)
GDT: آمنا بالله إن شئتم الآخرة هم بمؤمنين يا أيها
NFD: اهئا اي نينمٔومب مه ةرخٓالا متٔيش نٕا هللاب انمٓا
NFC: اهيأ اي نينمؤمب مه ةرخآلا متئش نإ هللاب انمآ

The difference between NFD vs NFC, is that after the text is is reordered to LTR for training, NFD pushes the marks/diacritics to the right-side, while in NFC the marks/diacritics remain on the characters itself. text2image should have an option to randomly add tatweel every n lines.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashida

>Kashida is generally only used in one word per line and applied to one letter per word. 

>Furthermore, kashida is recommended only between certain combinations of letters (typically those which cannot form a ligature).
 @amitdo No, No.......! That is very bad
Tatweel reduces the recognition rate, and makes the model unstable and confused `theoretically speaking`
Ray stated earlier that he have fixed the tatweel problem, he even gave the option to render it if you want to,  but it will be removed as a singular sole character from the training data.
I think he solved this issue by Merging the tatweel Box with the earlier glyph box, and removing the tatweel as a character, the final remainder is 1 box with the earlier glyph. >For normalization, which form does it uses, NFD or NFC?

It seems it uses NF**K**C. Hi @christophered, I don't think you understood my meaning.

I Re-read what Ray said in this issue.

>it needs to be preserved in the training text, so it gets rendered

>I understand that tatweel is a rendering artifact, that should be rendered for training, but not occur in the output text (or in the language model).

>The tatweel and ligature problem are fixed and will be corrected in the new traineddatas coming soon

So it seems he already implemented (but didn't push yet) what I just now suggested.


 text2image is the program that **renders** images from ground truth.

>text2image should have an option to randomly add tatweel every n lines.

'add' here means 'render'.


 the new version of traineddata has been uploaded a lot of time ago.

lstmtraining: ../ccutil/genericvector.h:696: T& GenericVector<T>::operator[](int) const [with T = char]: Assertion `index >= 0 && index < size_used_' failed.
 No, I did not see that assertion up to now. How can it be reproduced? The non-debug build continues, but uses a bad index internally, so the results are invalid.

Replace `assert` (which is only used in debug builds) by `ASSERT_HOST` in `ccutil/genericvector.h`, then the non-debug build should show an error, too.

Can you get a stack trace for the assertion? @Shreeshrii, please open a new issue about that regression. @Shreeshrii, I am sorry, but somehow my last comment got lost. So once again:

The assertions are caused by an index of 0 used for an empty vector. Since commit 907de5995f698e2a01da25fa09f8cadaf31a095f the constructor of GenericVector no longer allocates memory for an empty vector. `tesseract::LSTMTrainer::ReadTrainingDump` tries to read 0 bytes. Issue #561 is identical. Here is a patch which fixes the assertion / core dump:

I don't know whether returning `true` would be better. I tried to analyze the problem ("why is there a data size 0?") and noticed that the behavior of the program is totally erratic when I run it in a debugger. There are several threads involved, and depending on my breakpoints the problem with the data size occurs or not. That looks like a synchronization issue, and so I decided to use Valgrind. The result is horrible:

So some more work is needed. The patch shown above does not fix the real problems. It looks like the pix which was created by pixScaleGeneral contains uninitialized pixel data.
The Tesseract function ComputeBlackWhite operates on that data with random results.
@DanBloomberg, do you have any idea how to fix that?

 Using valgrind, I am not able to find uninitialized pixels starting from pixScale (or pixScaleGeneral).  I did something simple like:
    pix3 = pixScale(pix2, 0.6, 0.6);  // pix3 is 8 bpp
    pixGetDimensions(pix3, &w, &h, NULL);
    for (i = 0; i < h; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < w; j++) {
            pixGetPixel(pix3, j, i, &val);
            tot += val;
        }
    }
where every pixel was read and used.

Try to replace line 1705 of pix2.c, which is pixCreateTemplateNoInit(), with
    pixCreateTemplate()
If this solves the problem, then it may be originating in pixUnsharpMaskingGray1D() or in pixUnsharpMaskingGray2D() and to make sure that valgrind was catching it, I used a conditional in the inner loop:
    pix3 = pixScaleGeneral(pix1, 0.8, 0.8, 0.4, 2);
    pixGetDimensions(pix3, &w, &h, NULL);
    for (i = 0; i < h; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < w; j++) {
            pixGetPixel(pix3, j, i, &val);
            if (val == 0x12345678)
                break;
        }
    }

If any pixel were uninitialized, we'd have a message like:
   Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
     ==65877==    at 0x40481C: main (...)
There were none.
(We did have an issue with normalization in these pixUnsharpMaskingGray*() functions back in April, that gave rise to some artifacts.)
 My short test program `pixtest.cpp` was successful:

    #include <leptonica/allheaders.h>

    int main(void)
    {
      PIX *pix1 = pixCreate(2047, 71, 8);
      PIX *pix2 = pixScaleGeneral(pix1, 0.676056325, 0.676056325, 0.200000003, 1);
      int width = pixGetWidth(pix2);
      int height = pixGetHeight(pix2);
      int y = height / 2;
      l_uint32* line = pixGetData(pix2) + pixGetWpl(pix2) * y;
      int prev = GET_DATA_BYTE(line, 0);
      if (prev != 0) {
        return 1;
      }
      return 0;
    }

I compiled it on Debian Stretch using `g++ -g pixtest.cpp -llept`.
Valgrind reports the same problem as in Tesseract:

    ==22626== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
    ==22626==    at 0x400832: main (pixtest.cpp:12)
 > We did have an issue with normalization in these pixUnsharpMaskingGray*() functions back in April, that gave rise to some artifacts.

Could that be the reason for the problem? Debian has a Leptonica version 1.74.1-1, so maybe that fix is missing? Then Debian needs a newer version (and Tesseract should require Leptonica 1.74.2). CC @jbreiden. Stefan, can you run your test program from our github head, or replacing the 1.74.1 scale.c with the most recent one?  That would determine if the normalization change fixed this problem.

I ran your exact program with the current pixScaleGeneral(), on valgrind, and got no error. After failing to find the problem with an uninitialized value from pixUnsharpMasking(), I will do the most simple thing, which is make sure that the pixel values are initialized.  Use of pixCreateTemplateNoInit(), instead of pixCreateTemplate(), is clearly a poor optimization.  I will also remove other uses of the NoInit version in places where it's not obvious by inspection that all pixels are set. Committed (#512) to leptonica.  Hoping that this solves any uninitialized value problems. As far as I see Leptonica 1.74.2 is sufficient (it solved the uninitialized value problems for Tesseract), but of course you can use the newer version, too. 1.74.3 has a fix for the uninitialized issue (the topic of this thread),
and some other bug fixes on windows.  It has far fewer coverity scan
'bugs'.  And I also made it configure-ready, as advertised in the README.

 Dan, the uninitialized issue was already fixed with 1.74.2, and so were the Coverity scan issues. Somehow I didn't realize that 1.74.2 fixed the uninitialized issue in
unsharp masking.  So now it's double-fixed.  And 1.74.3 has even more fixed
coverity scan issues  :-)

For 1.74.3, I wanted to make a configure-ready version available (and also,
I hadn't done a tarball release before on github).  I plan to make all
future releases that way.

So it seems that both 1.74.2 and 1.74.3 can be used with tesseract.

For the future, I'd like to remove the pixWriteDisplay*() functions from
the library, which are only there to support some older versions of
tesseract.

 Hi there!
The problem seems still there, at least on my MBP :( 

I had exactly the same issue after exactly 100 iterations: 
`Assertion failed: (index >= 0 && index < size_used_), function operator[], file ~/tesseract/ccutil/genericvector.h, line 713.`

I was using Leptonica 1.74.1 provided by Macports, then built manually 1.74.4 (just 1 hour after Dan put out it :) ), still the same problem. 
I make sure `lstmtraining` is linking to the correct version of Lept library (using `otool -L `on Mac)

What baffles me is, the `scale.c` file - which I presume includes the fix to the problem - is **identical** for 1.74.[1 | 2 | 3 | 4]... is it correct?


I'm using a 2015 MBP running OS X El Capitan (10.11.6) with Xcode 8. 
The command I'm using to train:
> ./tesseract/build-mac/bin/Debug/lstmtraining -U tesstutorial/engtrain/eng.unicharset --script_dir langdata/ --debug_interval 100 --net_spec '[1,36,0,1 Ct5,5,16 Mp3,3 Lfys64 Lfx128 Lrx128 Lfx256 O1c105]' --model_output tesstutorial/engoutput/base --train_listfile tesstutorial/engtrain/eng.training_files.txt --eval_listfile tesstutorial/engeval/eng.training_files.txt --max_iterations 5000 

Thanks! @dudullz, there were several problems, and updating Leptonica to 1.74.2 or newer fixes one of them. Pull request #978 fixes the assertion. It's still unmerged, that's why you got that assertion. @stweil first thanks for TRULY swift reply!

It has been training for past 2 hours for about 3,000 iterations and still going - it's just enjoyable to see it continuing after days of struggling :)

So has `updating Leptonica to 1.74.4` + `pull request  #978`  fixed the real problem? means the trained results are valid to use now (not like non-debug builds continue but with invalid results)?
 That fixed at least the currently known problems and should produce more stable results as the trained data no longer depends on undefined values (which could produce random results). so,  is this issue fixed ?

  IMO, most of the OpenCL code should be part of Leptonica.

There are two questions here:
1. Does @DanBloomberg want this code in Leptonica?
2. Are the authors of the code willing to relicense it (Apache 2 -> BSD) Dan,

The code is here: 
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/tree/master/opencl Amit, there are several good reasons why this code should NOT be in leptonica.

(1) Maintenance: I (and any competent C programmer with a background in image processing and analysis) can maintain all of leptonica.  From the beginning of the leptonica project, I understood that maintenance is critical: over the lifetime of the library, the time spent fixing/improving it will far exceed the time spent on the first implementation.  There is no way I could fix errors in the low-level code in this file.

(2) Portability: We have enough trouble maintaining portability with just plain old ansi C over several OS platforms.  The operations here take it to another level: hardware.  What restrictions are there on the hardware for this code to be compiled properly?  Does it work seamlessly on all Intel processors?  What about AMD?  What about ioS and Android?

(3) Benefit: Are the multiple complications from introducing this code into leptonica worth the pain?  As Jeff said, we've already fixed the multipage tiff wrapper, so the time is now O(n), where n is the number of pages.  And this is just a wrapper into tifflib.  Most other operations that are easily parallellized are already fast enough for most applications. Leptonica is intended to be a general utility that gives good performance with a simple implementation.  Emphasis on simple. If in production for a particular application, it is necessary to speed up a particular low-level operation (such as convolution) this should be done as an adjunct to leptonica, not as part of it.

Other image processing libraries have a different genesis and philosophy.  OpenCV was built by Intel engineers in Russia, and is now maintained by Itseez.  It is large and heterogeneous, and might be a good place to house this Intel GPU-based image processing code. OK Dan, thanks for your detailed response! Here are the files with `#ifdef USE_OPENCL`:

I'm not sure if the LSTM engine needs this step. I am using tesstrain.sh . The ngram file creation, which is used for font properties is done even before creation of images.

--linedata_only is the option used for creating the lstmf files.

```
training/tesstrain.sh --fonts_dir /home/shree/.fonts --lang bih  --linedata_only \
  --langdata_dir ../langdata --tessdata_dir ./tessdata \
  --output_dir ~/tesstutorial/bihnew
``` >I am using tesstrain.sh . The ngram file creation, which is used for font properties is done even before creation of images.

Yes, I know...

I think the LSTM engine does not need this info. If that's true, it should not activated in `tesstrain.sh`  when training witn the `--linedata_only` option.
 ```
           --noextract_font_properties)
                EXTRACT_FONT_PROPERTIES=0 ;;
```

So, for LSTM training we should use both of these -

`--linedata_only --noextract_font_properties` Yes, probably... :-)  When using command mode and -l hin+fra on an image with both Hindi and French, the French text is being misrecognized as numbers. 

The recognition of French part of text is not fully correct if whole image is given via command mode using single language French.

However, when sections of same image are offered via gimagereader gui using single language French, the recognition is correct.

The above comment is out of date. In theory, this is now working, but it looks like it doesn't work as well as intended. Thanks for the info, Amit.

  Using Tesseract 4 (libtesseract) in my project [decipher_text](https://github.com/rudrabhoj/decipher_text).
When I use OEM_TESSERACT_ONLY, it takes little over 7-8 seconds to complete the recognization of a page in English. But when I try to instead use OEM_LSTM_ONLY, it takes 10-15 minutes, if not more, to do the same. I am using i5 2400. Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64.

If you were to write the vectorized loop yourself using intrinsics you’d be certain that the loop works and it’s vectorized (duh!) but you’d have to manage the portability, alignment and aliasing yourself. That’s not a trivial task if you are aiming for a portable program.
 The non-SIMD version of the dotproduct method can be significantly sped up by doing manual loop unrolling.   Also, this version can use OpenMP (with `#pragma...` above the loop) Here is one source:

 @stweil The pull request #698 seems to solve the problem on x86 not entirely; On Windows 7 x64, VS2015, x86 target using the latest tesseract-ocr:master branch (which includes the merged pull request #698) still results in "DotProductAVX can't be used on Android" for me (Intel i7-4650U). However, the workaround in the comment above to remove `# define X86_BUILD 1` from `arch/simddetect.cpp` resolves this. @stweil Ah, I see! Yes, I used cmake - never mind then!
Thank you for the clarification! I still encounter this error "DotProductAVX can't be used on Android" with the latest source from master. I built the .exe in VS2015 with x86 target. It would work with 3.04 language data but throw exceptions when using 4.00 language data.

The workaround (commenting out the `#define` directive in `simddetect.cpp`) works, but a permanent fix is desired. Thanks. @stweil, I undid the change to `simddetect.cpp` and made the change to `dotproductavx.cpp`. The compiled exe still crashes with the same error.

I'm not sure if I have AVX support. I run Windows 10 64-bit on i7-7500U CPU. Here is output on my machine:

What repo do you use for Tesseract?
This one?
https://launchpad.net/%7Ealex-p/+archive/ubuntu/tesseract-ocr

  i understand that much of the new Tesseract 4.0 is using a customized implementation of Ocropus, relying basically on the new LSTM recognition engine.

But the main problem is that most of the decisions that are being taken focus mostly on English (Latin Languages)  which already able to reach +95% recognition rates easily.
My concern is allowing the other languages such as Arabic to be able to reach the **PRECISION CEILING.**

Methods such as **BLSTM** (Bidirectional LSTM) , and the two-dimensional 2D LSTM which is called **MDLSTM**, can achieve without explicit segmentation of words, a character-level accuracies of 92 and 96% !!!!!! and I repeat, **without explicit segmentation.**

So my question is that, will there be plans to implement and ascend the current LSTM to a **MDLSTM (Multi-dimensional LSTM)**, this will radically make ALL THE LANGUAGES ABLE TO PASS THAT PRECISION CEILING.

i am planing to engage in testing Tesseract 4.0 LSTM on the Arabic language, and wanting to post results in the future, i hope that there will be recognition improvement while testing.
Thank you Ray for your hard work, and all contributors, you are appreciated.

 In principle, Tesseract is probably as accurate (or slightly more accurate) than ocropy/clstm.

Tesseract has official trained models for ~100 languages. ocropy has official models for English and German only. Unlike ocropus, Tesseract works on Windows.

BLSTM is implemented and used.

2D-LSTM is also implemented in the library. I think (not sure) it's not used by the released traineddata. Using 2D-LSTM means much longer time to train a model. and for OCRing printed text, the accuracy will not necessary be better than 1D-BLSTM.

BTW, ocropy doesn't have 2D-LSTM support. Please see https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/VGSLSpecs

This is not really the situation with the LSTM engine.

The difference in accuracy between Latin script based langs and Arabic is due to
1. Better traineddata files for the Latin script based langs.
2. The 'complexity' of the script. Arabic is much more complex.   Also, the OCR stage is dependent on the layout analysis stage which is weaker for Arabic.  Shree, indic scripts are even more complex... @amitdo Thanks for clearing things up,  improved pre-processing may make 1D-LSTM outperform the more complex MDLSTM. You were right.
I see, the main issue is not the ocr engine directly, but is of analysis/segmentation/classification.
Perhaps, i should focus on a combination of Tesseract LSTM & a Computer Assisted Transcription method.
somewhat similar to:   https://sites.google.com/site/paradiitproject/project-definition

@Shreeshrii So Tesseract 4.x has the capability of producing more sophisticated and complex structures.

@roozgar i was looking for a method that gain +85% recognition rate for Arabic language.
Tesseract 3.x was using cube for arabic that made me loose hope, **But thanks to the developers of Tesseract 4.0 for introducing the new LSTM engine, the hope is back and the community is excited.** I am looking forward to test this version after reading that you've got an 80% recognition.
@roozgar can you share your training process, the tif/box files and the traineddata.
 

 @roozgar what operating system are you using? Please see Ray's comment with accuracy figures in
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/40

I have found Hindi to have much greater accuracy with LSTM engine.

- excuse the brevity, sent from mobile
 This is what is used for most of the languages:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/VGSLSpecs#full-example-a-multi-layer-lstm-capable-of-high-quality-ocr

I think it is 2D-LSTM. @amitdo thanks, I have been told that 4.x version of tesseract would be the next big leap, now I believe. https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v1.4.0-rc1/tensorflow/contrib/ndlstm/README.md  LSTM training is done on line boxes. The error/info messages from the program refer to these also as pages, which is confusing. 

When training using a multi-page tif, Page numbers of the tif being processed are displayed, concurrently another set of page numbers is displayed with respect to lstmf (I suspect these are line numbers).

```

So, it looks like AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG is undefined on OS X.

This appears related to https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/02a6970cf361ae12e2e2b5374f87bd09b3802bfd#diff-67e997bcfdac55191033d57a16d1408a

Since this error is a bit cryptic, it might be nice to add a check to see if AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG is defined is added, and perhaps print a message to give some guidance on how to get it (probably something in homebrew? upgrade autoconf maybe?).

A poor workaround for this error is to add http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=autoconf-archive.git;a=blob_plain;f=m4/ax_check_compile_flag.m4 to the project's m4 directory, then rerun autogen.sh before running configure again -- that gets around the error on my machine. https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/autoconf-archive.rb **Update**: need to `apt install autoconf-archive` to fix this issue.

Note on your expectation of user-familiarity with compile software, I personally am not that familiar with c/c++ compilers since I barely do any programming in those languages but merely compile software using (usually) autoconf with simple steps.

:laughing:  Hey @zdenop, if not keeping track of every package that I have installed makes me lazy, then I guess I'm lazy. :)

What about printing out something like "install autoconf-archive", instead of "syntax error near unexpected token"?

Would you accept a patch?  I've compiled and installed the master branch today and started to play around a bit with text extraction from japanese text. With the supplied training data LSTM seems to be a bit better at horizontal text than the old (oem 0) method.

However, with vertical text LSTM is really bad and does not produce any good results.

This is my results with the following three test images. (I have scaled them to 300 dpi)

I've also noticed that even if LSTM is a bit better with horizontal text, it seems to print out the result with spaces even if there are no space in the original text. For example:

>The neural network engine has not yet been integrated to enable the multi- language mode that worked with Tesseract 3.04, but this will be improved in a future release. Vertical text is also not yet supported, so support for Japanese and Traditional Chinese for example are limited to horizontally rendered text. @amitdo @jbreiden Ah, I missed that wiki page, sorry.

 This is usually not an error, just an info message. Your output file should be created. >Detected 386 diacritics

Sometimes, this means the image has a lot of 'noise'. I was using python wrapper and yes, it seems like it's not an error but wrapper considers it as an error and terminates process.

tesseract.exe was built and work fine.
text2image project has references on tesseract project and dependencies from ..\Debug\tesseract305d.lib This is a known issue. See https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/pull/595#issuecomment-268362325 This issue is about Leptonica and other libs, but in my case problem seems is with resolving symbols from tesseract main library that itself built fine, Not only in text2image but also in other Training Tools, for example ambiguous_words:

ambiguous_words.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "public: __thiscall WERD_CHOICE::WERD_CHOICE(char const *,class UNICHARSET const &)" (??0WERD_CHOICE@@QAE@PBDABVUNICHARSET@@@Z) referenced in function _main

 There is some other details. To make cmake work I download gtk+ from 
https://dl.hexchat.net/gtk-win32/vc14/x86/gtk-Win32.7z
set PKG_CONFIG_PATH=D:/gtk/win32/lib/pkgconfig
after cmake I also add paths 
D:\gtk\Win32\include
and
D:\gtk\Win32\lib
in text2image project I am using last sources from github from master Really, I have 3.6.2, I will try 3.7.1. Thank you. Great! It was built. Thanks again.  ```

Give us the compilation output as file(s) attachment(s). If you do have avx and sse4.1 and the new code in configure.ac fails to discover it, you can fix it like this:

#    AM_CONDITIONAL([AVX_OPT], true)
#fi
#if test x$sse41 = x1; then
#    AM_CONDITIONAL([SSE41_OPT], true)
#fi
``` It works after installing autoconf-archive as suggested by @zdenop  I am getting the same error running tesseract on Windows 10.
How should I run autoconf-archive on Windows?
Looks like there is a preprocessor directive to always throw this error on i386 architecture.
How should I fix this error on Windows? Same error is coming on running tesseract on ubuntu 16.04.someone please help.its urgent Hello sir,

Sorry for the inconvenience caused.I will not repeat my mistake.I have
installed tesseract on Ubuntu
16.04 32 bit os with the help of this site.
https://www.linux.com/blog/using-tesseract-ubuntu

Yes I can use tesseract 3.05 but i would you be highly obliged if you would
tell me the steps of properly uninstalling tesseract. And from where to
install tesseract 3.05 and which leptonica version to use.

Thank You for your help and guidance

 Use the ppa from https://launchpad.net/~alex-p/+archive/ubuntu/tesseract-ocr

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alex-p/tesseract-ocr -y
sudo apt-get update -q
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr -y


tesseract -v
tesseract --list-langs


sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-hin   -y

 Last thing i want to know ... can we use .png, .jpeg with 3.05 version of
tesseract ? On some sites it is written tesseract 4.0 version only works
with png file.

Will tesseract 3.05 version work with leptonica version 1.74?

Regards
Vidushi Gupta

 3.05 should work with leptonica 1.74.

It will work with png, jpeg etc, depending on the libs installed

tesseract -v

Should show u the info.

4.0 is using a new OCR engine, LSTM.

The info was written for 3.04 and should apply to 3.05

 I followed the above commands. And when i try to compile the code it is
giving error as-

 fatal error: tesseract/baseapi.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

For compilation i wrote the command

 g++ simple.cpp -o sim -l/usr/include/leptonica -l/usr/bin/tesseract -llept
-ltesseract

Please tell what could be the problem

 ​apt-get install installs the program.

you dont need to compile it.

give the following commands to see what you have.

which tesseract

tesseract -v

tesseract --help

tesseract --list-langs​

 After performing the above steps I am still getting the following error

DotProductAVX can't be used on Android
Aborted (core dumped)

I would be highly obliged if you would help me in resolving the issue.

Vidushi
 hi,

Is there a way to store the result of tesseract compiled code into text or
pdf file.I am using API example
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/APIExample.
I want to store the result into text or pdf file instead of displaying on
terminal.
Please tell if there is a way to do it.

 It should be possible to do it via api. I know it can be done by

? This is how it is tagged in the github repo. In the Leptonica website it is '1.74'.
You can change it if you want to :-) I did it after the `.travis.yml` [commits](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/pull/605). As you can see, I needed 3 tries to make it work :-)
1.74 -> 1.74.0 -> +drop the `v` before the version number ...

So I thought it should be 1.74.0 in CMake too. @DanBloomberg

The `1.74` vs. `1.74.0` is somewhat confusing ... Seems like we have a problem with the 1.74.0 version numbering.  What do
you suggest that we do here?  New github release?  Replacement? Nothing?

 The problem is that Leptonica's `lept.pc` has 1.74 rather than 1.74.0. If you edit that file to have the latter then it works. This value originates from `configure.ac`, which also has 1.74. @DanBloomberg, you need to be consistent with this everywhere. Seems like I should make a new github release for leptonica, with the correct version
number in configure.ac.  If you agree, should I replace 1.74.0 or make
1.74.1?

 At this point, I don't mind sticking with 1.74 for now as we've already compensated in the necessary places. My Gentoo release ended up being 1.74 as this matched the tarball and the tarball's subdirectory. But if you want to push a new 1.74.1 release out to make sure we get it right while it's still fresh in our minds, that's cool. I was thinking of RELEASE, but I can go with PATCH.

 I've put up on github the leptonica 1.74.1 release.

In theory, it solves all the existing issues with builds.  In practice,
we'll see ...

It's also up as a configure/make tarball on leptonica.org.  (The difference
between the two is just running the autobuild script on the github release,
which requires autotools.)

  This code:

```
tesseract::ParamsVectors *GlobalParams() {
  static tesseract::ParamsVectors *global_params =
    new tesseract::ParamsVectors();
  return global_params;
}
```
is causing a memory leak. I don't see any means of removing it while tesseract engine is no longer needed in the application. Thanks!  I installed tesseract using sudo port install tesseract tesseract-eng.
I took a screenshot using command+shift+3 on Mac, and try to ocr the screenshot. However, I get the following message, and the output file is empty.

What might be causing this?
Thanks for your help! You should ignore this message. Regardless the message, the output file is empty. Is it an error? Thanks! Thank you for helping with this.
Yes, definitely has text.

Is there prebuilt binary for tesseract 4 for Mac somewhere? See https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/601#issuecomment-269197286
You need an equivalent package for Mac. Do you happen to know what that might be? I searched mavx on macports, but nothing turned up. https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=library&substr=autoconf-archive  Hi there, tired to run following command on the attached Image:

Do you know where the program is installed so I can open it up with the GUI? Thank you.   I don't know why it fails 64-bit build. Perhaps @FeodorFitsner can explain. Nice to see this working.

Same errors Without STATIC=1 I get:
```

``` I removed the folder C:/Users/HOME/.cppan and re-downloaded the repository to start over. Here are my steps.
```
git clone https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract tesserac
cd tesserac
cppan --self-upgrade
cppan
mkdir win32
cd win32
cmake .. > 1.txt 2>&1
```
Then I had this issue - https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/464#issuecomment-264166445 There was two cmake.exe processes, I stopped one with memory 2304KB (second had bigger memory 4496KB). Also sometimes can hangs 3 processes.
`cmake --build . --config Release > 2.txt 2>&1`
I have build error unfortunately... Can you look at it?

https://gist.github.com/Izaron/d1116ae559c7a40cbebcf7794f7f0a35 - 2.txt

I tried to do this several times and get different number of errors in 2.txt. I have no idea the reason why this is happening I have correct VS 2015.
It's question marks because of default russian language. In UTF-8: https://gist.github.com/Izaron/071268b9ba1c863bd6b055d6f37ce077
I built it again (deleted .cppan, cmake, etc.). As you can see, quite a different number of errors Finally build it .dll and .lib, thank you very much @egorpugin!

In new example project I put all folders to includes in properties and linked tesseract305.lib, so I can include <baseapi.h>, but can not include <allheaders.h>. Should I build leptonica for windows to use allheader.h and pixRead? From command line works well, but if I want to compile this code in VS - https://github.com/cppan/tesseract_example/blob/master/with_cppan/main.cpp

Also built files are named tesseract305.dll and tesseract305.lib, is this normal? I have failed again with this **simple** command.
But I sure I understand what the problem is. In the console cppan writes that downloads and unpacks **18** different packages. But I do it every time, not all files downloads - on my PC only from 4 to 11 files random files during all this time, but sometimes this is enough to build some projects. That is why as a result of build errors is different - from 50 to 1500, and sometimes 0.
This program is also frequently breaks while downloading and unpacking (every third time around).
All I need - .lib and .dll files of the dependencies (including leptonica) and built .lib and .dll of 4.0.0 tesseract (current master branch, right?), in order that I can update it in one of my project from older version.
Can you give me all these dependency files? I can add them to any project for using leptonica and tesseract and compile , including current tesseract master (although I was able to magically compile it with **9** downloaded dependencies - excluding gif, webp and almost all unicode libs).

``` @Shreeshrii any luck with this ? I am trying to train on camera taken images and I have been getting the same error 
and training doesnt converge, i have a error rate of 70% right now @ferjad 

I am not sure what causes 'Compute CTC targets failed!' 

Still waiting on updates to code and traineddata from @theraysmith after retraining, to test further.

Which language are you trying to train? You need a large training set for 4.0. @Shreeshrii  I have a training set of 5000 images that have 15000 lines in total
Language is english but the images are camera blurred with different angles, LSTM are known to learn data is this setting 
Data shouldnt be a problem, I saw you trained some other scripts too on your  other opened issue on github
did you manage to get around it? @Shreeshrii  can you share a image and box pair? Did you use the Wordstr format for box files? Wordstr option is not fully operational yet.

Text2image creates the box file with tab at end of line.

You can use jtessboxeditor and use the option under tools to add tab for
eol to existing box files.

 @Shreeshrii The problem is I want to train on real world data and not synthetic and manually labelling character by character isnt possible
Are you proposing adding a tab character at the end of Wordstr boxes?
jtessboxeditor doesnt support the Wordstr option either Please see discussion on following issue

 @Shreeshrii hey thanks for the link, my wordstr strings are space delimited
I am fine tuning the english model so unicharset isnt needed
Did you have any luck training with wordstr format?
It would really help if you could share some working image and box pairs in wordstr format No, I did not try to train with wordstr format except for that test.

 @Shreeshrii hey any update on ability to train with WordStr format? I tried this again and still got Compute CTC Failed @theraysmith has not updated the programs for handling this yet. Hopefully it will be in next update. @Shreeshrii It would be ideal to update the training wiki to reflect this, thanks for the update  Added a note in training wiki to reflect that WordStr option is not implemented.

Also added as a separate issue. @Shreeshrii hey any update on this? the wiki still says the same  @ferjad, the 'WordStr' format is still not supported. It's unknown when it will be supported.  mkdir -p ~/tesstutorial/sanvedic

I have some  old tif/box pairs . the image width is 4000.

Will training quality be degraded if changing above constant to 4000 in order to use them?

 Also can this be changed during runtime with a  variable or do I need to recompile tesseract with the higher value? @Shreeshrii how can the problem of image being too small be fixed? actually, it's not just a few messages. I am trying to train tesseract to
recognize plate licence, and the prepared training_text is just like a
plate licence. something like this:
۵۴ ۷۲۸ ب ۱۴
each line includes one of these patterns.
I received a lot of these errors and the training process finished with
error rate equal to zero. no training!
would you please help me to figure out what the problem is?

@hanikh, please paste a short example for the errors you get. I will send the exact error message as soon as possible. but, meanwhile I
have faced a more important problem. I finetuned tesseract for farsi (40
fonts on 6000 text lines) and I got worse result than the original tesserct
on the trained fonts. what is the problem? the training_text is not big
enough? (this is a different project and not related to the licence plate)

2 Percent improvement time=0, best error was 2.167 @ 14
At iteration 14/1100/20884, Mean rms=0.049%, delta=0%, char train=0%, word train=0%, skip ratio=1798.6%,  New best char error = 0 wrote best model:/home/fanasa/tesstutorial/fastuned_from_fas/fastuned-plates0_14.lstm wrote checkpoint.

Finished! Error rate = 0
this is the error I got during training for licence plates. for the fine tuning problem:
the error-rate reaches 0.017 at about 80000 iterations. so with few
iterations like in tutorial, a low error-rate like 0.01 can not be
achieved. so you think fine tuning is a wrong solution and I should try
replacing some layers? as I said before I am trying to train for 40 Persian
fonts and they are so common.

 @Shreeshrii would you please explain about the new traineddata file? where
can the lang.lstm-unicharset file be found ? how can combine_lang_model be
used? thanks

 @Shreeshrii I want to train 40 fonts for Arabic and Farsi languages. I have tried to finetune the trained model, but I did not get a good result. I think that happened because the trained fonts were so different from mine. So now I am going to replace a layer. I want to replace just the last layer and I do not want to change the unicharset. So, can I use Arabic.traineddata as the traineddata file needed for training? these are the commands I am using:
mkdir -p ~/tesstutorial/newara_from_ara
training/combine_tessdata -e tessdata/best/Arabic.traineddata \
  ~/tesstutorial/newara_from_ara/ara.lstm

training/lstmtraining --debug_interval 100 \
  --continue_from ~/tesstutorial/newara_from_ara/ara.lstm \
  --traineddata ~/tesstutorial/aratrain/ara/Arabic.traineddata \
  --append_index 5 \
  --model_output ~/tesstutorial/newara_from_ara/base \
  --train_listfile ~/tesstutorial/aratrain/ara.training_files.txt \
  --eval_listfile ~/tesstutorial/araeval/ara.training_files.txt \
  --max_iterations 3000 &>~/tesstutorial/newara_from_ara/basetrain.log @theraysmith 
if is it helpful
i can provide a large amount of font and word list of persian and arabic language for the train material @Shreeshrii  would you please help me with using "replacing layers" as I asked before?
 @roozgar have you tested the new traineddata for arabic? have you tried to train it?   I followed the [steps](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling#windows) required to get to .sln file for Visual Studio but I get a bunch of errors.

Here is a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/puq3uAR.png). I will check these commands on Monday.

It is the latest version of cppan.

Also the hanging on 7 process still goes on. Yes, managed that problem. Now I will check the clean packages argument later on. 
Stay tuned. After 
`cppan --clean-packages .*jpeg.*`
and 
`cppan --self-upgrade`

discussion regarding compiling 3.05 branch with vs 2010.

Does 3.05 branch need Leptonica 1.74 and not 1.74.1 ?  Don't remove the 'port' dir.  (can you tell me, how I can directly cherry-pick or merge your pr into my local repo?)

I need to learn this now... (I am just trying something from https://www.startpage.com/do/search?q=github+how+can+I+cherry-pick+a+pull+request ) (I just wanted to confirm, that it solves the problem! ty all)  In leptonica:
- 95% of these are because I use floats, and floating point numbers (like 1.0) are assumed to be doubles.
- Most of the rest are implicit conversions from float to int, where the ints are indices into a 2d image array. Any program may do a few tens of these, so we're talking about a small fraction of a microsecond.

Eliminating these windows compiler warnings is not high on my todo list.  I'll try to remember to add "f" to numbers in files that I'm modifying for other reasons.  * version 6c46cd79546e927bacfcb86ad868005f63f908ff

(sorry for not having closed this!)  Currently when using debug version, tesseract reports the gitver version. However, even when using the master branch, it reports it as 3.05dev.

Please add a tag on master for 4.0.0alpha so that config.ac gets the correct tag for gitrev. It would also be helpful to remove the ifdef limiting the display of GITREV to the debug build, so that it is displayed in all builds from GitHub source.  It doesn't work when I run lstmtraining usage command like [guider](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00#training-from-scratch),and show "scrollview:waiting for server..." in basetrain.log.
First I think the training-tools are not compiled successfully,I reinstall it,but it still error.Then I think change the param "debug_interval" to 0,and it worked.
So am I wrong or it is a bug?
Thanks,sorry for my bad English. @stweil Hi,
I did "make ScrollView.jar" ans add its path to the environment variable  `SCROLLVIEW_PATH` but the program still can't find it. I found in viewer/svutil.cpp `GetEnv(SCROLLVIEW_PATH)` doesn't work, so I changed the path in program. But after started ScrollView, it stopped with error:

Do you have any idea how to solve this? Thanks.  I am running tesseract on this image [http://imgur.com/a/yIX5N](url) and i get a segmentation fault. I am wondering how i can go about to troubleshoot the problem or, in case one of the developers would know if this is a known bug. I am running on Windows and this is the version of tesseract under use:

> c:\> tesseract.exe --version
tesseract 3.05.00dev
 leptonica-1.73
  libgif 4.1.6(?) : libjpeg 8d (libjpeg-turbo 1.4.2) : libpng 1.6.20 : libtiff 4.0.6 : zlib 1.2.8 : libwebp 0.4.3 : libopenjp2 2.1.0  # Problem 
For iOS there are [many forks](https://github.com/gali8/Tesseract-OCR-iOS/network), where it's difficult to figure out what version of Tesseract that it's derived from. 

# Solution
Add a define in the `capi.h` file, like this:

    #define TESSERACT_ID "3.06.01dev, 13e46ae1c4d8acccf15654b0e6ddbddbd363618a"

This will make it easier to determine what version of Tesseract that it is.


I use Tesseract on iPhone and iPad.

I have read the contributing guide.

Thank you for this awesome ocr library. Hi Simon,

There is something like what you asked for, but currently it is only available in the debug build.

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/dc124043ec/configure.ac#L24
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/dc124043ec/api/baseapi.cpp#L139
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/dc124043ec/api/capi.h#L112
 [Tesseract for iOS](https://github.com/gali8/Tesseract-OCR-iOS) comes with `.a` files, there are no `.cpp` files. Just by looking at the code there is no way to tell what version of Tesseract that is being used. One has to actual execute the code to figure out the version.

It would be more helpful if the version string was in a `.h` file. Sorry, I overlooked that it's already here.

In the [baseapi.h](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/api/baseapi.h#L23), there is this line. Exactly something like this that I was looking for.

    #define TESSERACT_VERSION_STR "4.00.00alpha"

Thank you for your kind assistance.  I wanted to update my working tesseract (version from August) by pulling and compiling the latest version but `make install` ends with some errors:

Please can you help? I think it was due to a version conflict on my debian 8 with a packaged-tesseract. After removal of the packaged tesseract, tesseract as such  appears to work (but `make install` errors remain). this is my standard procedure:

```
make clean
git pull
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-debug
make
sudo make install
```
 Yeah, you are right. I _had_ indeed such a link when I build the last version !
I will now re-compile and report here, and close, if it solved.

Nevertheless, perhaps the "make" could be improved to catch (capture?) such a user mistake. I reported that issue, and close it now. Issue solved by removing my softlink for tessdata. root@scube014:~/qingy-fork-master/src/libraries# make clean

pls find this problem .   What about using pkg-config for detecting Leptonica version? Leptonica provides pkg-config pc file since 1.70. Any volunteer? :laughing:   I have install the icu_54 for it, but have meet some errors when make training tools. 
and  who know which  verision for tesseract4.0 ? @stweil, my system is centos6.5,  Please Google search for icu-dev or icu-devel libs for CentOS. >which version of icu for tesseract 4.0 ?
 
probably version >=4.4

As said by Shree, you need to install the package icu-devel. http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libicu-devel it's not icu version problem for me , I just forget to rebuild the static library.  so if you also meet some error , it may other reason caused!  Hi,

building training tools in current master branch under MSYS2/mingw64 throws following Error:
...x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/ld.exe: cannot find -licui18n

It seems the lib is named differently.

My quick Solution is to change libicu in training/Makefile like so:
sed -i 's/^libicu = -licui18n -licuuc/libicu = -licuin -licuuc/' training/Makefile

Then it's building fine.

Thanks for your awesome Work.

``` Was it solved? Hello, is this problem resolved?  I am fairly sure that pixGenHalftoneMask() (and the wrapper pixGenerateHalftoneMask()) are the only leptonica functions in tesseract that have a debug argument.

It should be OK in the new tesseract (4.00) to use pixGenerateHalftoneMask() with NULL for the debug pixa.  It would also be nice at the same time for the debug calls to the deprecated functions pixDisplayWrite() and pixDisplayWriteFormat() to be removed, because there is no reason that tesseract needs to generate these debug images. I believe that Ray is removing all use of temp files due to pixDisplayWrite() in tesseract.  ```

Bad box coordinates in boxfile string! 

The LSTM trainer only needs bounding box information for a complete textline,
instead of at a character level, but if you put spaces in the box string, like this:

<text for line including spaces> <left> <bottom> <right> <top> <page>
the parser will be confused and give you the error message.
```

text2image program may need to be fixed if too many errors of this kind are reported.   ```

```
Utf8 buffer too big, size=39 for र्ब्रह्माग्नौ
```

For some reason, this whole word is being used as a unit in unicharset, rather than the composing Devanagari syllables - र्ब्र ह्मा ग्नौ  As per https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00#combining-the-output-files

```
Either of these files can be converted to a recognition model as follows:

training/lstmtraining --model_output ~/tesstutorial/eng_from_chi/eng.lstm \
  --continue_from ~/tesstutorial/eng_from_chi/base_checkpoint

Finally, combine your new model with the language model files into a traineddata file:

training/combine_tessdata -o tessdata/eng.traineddata \
  ~/tesstutorial/eng_from_chi/eng.lstm \
  ~/tesstutorial/engtrain/eng.lstm-number-dawg \
  ~/tesstutorial/engtrain/eng.lstm-punc-dawg \
  ~/tesstutorial/engtrain/eng.lstm-word-dawg

The dawg files are optional. It will work without them, but they do usually provide some small improvement in accuracy.

NOTE  The unicharset used for the lstm has to match the unicharset used to generate the lstm-*-dawg files, but doesn't have to match the unicharset for the inttemp and base tesseract dawg files.

```
1. The given command does not create the recognition model. For that the command has to be appended with --stop_training.

```
training/lstmtraining --model_output ~/tesstutorial/sanskrit2003_from_full/san.lstm \
  --continue_from ~/tesstutorial/sanskrit2003_from_full/sanskrit2003_checkpoint \
  --stop_training
 ```

@theraysmith  Please review whether the modified commands are ok. thanks.

Wiki page needs to be updated for it. See Ray's comment re unicharset in https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/527

The unicharset from LSTM Training is included within the .LSTM model file. 

However this means that the old versions of dawg2wordlist cannot be used with the LSTM dawg files to get the original lists. https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00---Finetune Also see comments for https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/634

for first step of LSTM training i.e. creating lstmf files, use both --linedata_only --noextract_font_properties

```
training/tesstrain.sh --fonts_dir /home/shree/.fonts --lang bih  \
  --linedata_only --noextract_font_properties
  --langdata_dir ../langdata --tessdata_dir ./tessdata \

when trying to train frk @Shreeshrii 
Is this issue resolved coz I'm getting the same when training with Telugu language.. Please see https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00#error-messages-from-training

```
Encoding of string failed! results when the text string for a training image 
cannot be encoded using the given unicharset. 

Possible causes are:

- There  is an un-represented character in the text, say a British Pound sign that is not in your unicharset.

- A  stray unprintable character (like tab or a control character) in the text.

- There  is an un-represented Indic grapheme/aksara in the text.

In any case it will result in that training image being ignored by the trainer. 

If the error is infrequent, it is harmless, but it may indicate that your unicharset is inadequate for representing the language that you are training. @harinath141 If you are getting a lot of these errors during finetune, try replace top layer training. You can use the box/tiff pairs generated for finetune. Commands will be similar to the following:

```
mkdir -p ~/tesstutorial/tellayer_from_tel 

combine_tessdata -e ../tessdata/tel.traineddata \
  ~/tesstutorial/tellayer_from_tel/tel.lstm

  --model_output ~/tesstutorial/tellayer_from_tel/tellayer \
  --train_listfile ~/tesstutorial/tel/tel.training_files.txt \
  --target_error_rate 0.01
``` ~/tesstutorial/tel/ should have your .lstmf files. Thank you @Shreeshrii I'll try to replace top layer @harinath141

You can also see visual debugging output with scrollview.  I am integrating Tesseract into an application, but I have some questions before keep going with the process.
I think every application should have security filters and considerations in order to avoid malicious and bad input data, so my questions are:

1. Does Tesseract have special code to handle bad or malicious input data? 
2. Or just have a few validations to tell the user the correct input data?
3. Releases are performed after doing some security reviews and testing?
4. Or just functional testing?

I will appreciate your answers.
Thanks a lot!  Is it possible to add to the [APIexample](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/APIExample) wiki on how to accomplish the equivalent of `tesseract --list-langs` and `tesseract --print-parameters` via the API?

## list langs

To list languages I currently use something like the following. However the problem is that I first need to initialize the english engine which might not be available. Is there a way to list languages without initializing any engine?

```cpp
  tesseract::TessBaseAPI *api = new tesseract::TessBaseAPI();
  if (api->Init(NULL, "eng"))
    throw std::runtime_error(std::string("Unable to find training data for"));
  api->GetAvailableLanguagesAsVector(langs);
  std::vector<std::string> available;
  for(int i = 0; i < langs->length(); i++)
    available.push_back(langs->get(i).c_str());
```

## list parameters

I don't think there is a method in the API for that.
but if someone will send a PR ... I see that you made [R binding for Tessaract](https://github.com/ropensci/tesseract)

>Alternatively, for a bit more flexibility, you can define the environmental variable
#define LEPT_MSG_SEVERITY L_SEVERITY_WARNING
and use
setMsgSeverity(L_SEVERITY_EXTERNAL);
 I want the above option in the release build.
@stweil? cc: @Danbloomberg First, some more of the basics, for disabling at least all info and warning messages.

You can define the external env variable to L_SEVERITY_ERROR.  That will disable warnings, which I believe makes sense for tesseract.

If you set this severity level at compile time, you guarantee that it can't be over-ridden at run-time.

If you want to go further and suppress all messages, including those from the ERROR_*  macros (which are different from the informational L_* macros), define NO_CONSOLE_IO on the compile line (or use L_SEVERITY_NONE).

As for the suggestion that setMsgSeverity() tells you what it does, I can easily add a 2nd arg (debug) and only emit those messages when debug = TRUE.  Stefan, is that what you want? Better, I'll just comment out the comments, leaving the interface unchanged. this change is pushed to leptonica master on github and modified to keep the warning(error) message but not the info(OK) messages I was thinking that if you try to set it to the external value, and that value is not set, it should issue a warning because the attempt failed.  I am already commenting the L_INFOs out there, and I can comment the warning out as well. All leptonica messages in setMsgSeverity() are now disabled, as requested. Either `DEBUG` or `NDEBUG` is set by `configure` (depending on --enable-debug). It looks like cmake currently does not set `DEBUG`. Maybe that's the reason why `api/baseapi.cpp` also tests for `_DEBUG` (set my the MS compiler).

`NDEBUG` is a standard macro which changes the behavior of `assert`. That's also the reason why it is used rather often.

If we want to separately control standard features and Tesseract features, we need both macros. Otherwise we could stick to using `NDEBUG`.

Personally I prefer keeping both macros, but I think that removing `DEBUG` would also work.  ```

 Ray, 

Please add what are the minimum requirements for doing LSTM training in terms of hardware, software, etc.

I realized after running the process that I needed to build Scrollview.jar. I am not sure whether it is REQUIRED or only optional for those who would like to see visual debugging output. It is not built as part of the regular make install of tesseract and training tools. 

>> It will stop at 5000 iterations, (in about half an hour) 

I think that is probably dependent on the hardware used. I did not get any progress for more than one and a half hour - not sure whether it was because I did not have scrollview.jar at that point. I ran it later with 500 iterations.

I think it maybe helpful to have just a single iteration as the first step in tutorial to make sure that the process is working.

Also, the case that I think most people would like to use for LSTM training would be to use Finetuning to add a font to the existing trainingdata. It would be helpful to have a separate page on wiki for it. 

It would also be great to know how to add training data based on scanned images for typefaces that are not available as fonts. 

I will try to test 'finetuning' the Hindi traineddata for Sanskrit and post here.


   We're in the process of updating leptonica to version 1.74.0.

This will go out with debian with SO version 5.1.0.

I see in CMakeLists.txt:
   set(MINIMUM_LEPTONICA_VERSION 1.71)

Two questions:
(1) Should this be increased?  1.71 is at least 2 years old, likely still binary compatible.

(2) With autotools, the SO version defines the binary interface compatibility, which is why we're bumping it up from 5.0.0 in 1.73 to 5.1.0 in 1.74.  Does cmake use the SO version? Also see https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/536 https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling
Ray added the 1.73 requirement for 4.0.

There is a pending patch from Jeff that will need 1.74.
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/233#issuecomment-246744997

Anyway, the two build system should be updated. We now depend on 1.74.0 (see commit 11f205707) If you want to support 1.73 you can provide a patch... :-) I mean, the code will still use your patch for 1.74 but will fallback to the previous behaviour for 1.73. I thought that with 1.74, and SO 5.1, there is no longer a need for that tiff patch on debian.

btw, github release 1.74.0 is now also up as 1.74 (in the usual configure-make tarball) on leptonica.org:
     leptonica.org/source/leptonica-1.74.tar.gz  Jeff,
Any chance you will provide a Leptonica 1.74 PPA for Ubuntu 16.04? OK, I thought that you are familiar with PPAs. I didn't mean to push you to prepare a PPA. Jeff made a Leponica 1.74.1 package for Debian:
https://packages.debian.org/sid/libleptonica-dev Unofficial Ubuntu PPAs for Tesseract 4.00 & Leptonica 1.74:

 The excitement happens in api/baseapi.cpp, where End() calls Clear(), which conditionally calls SetInputImage(NULL).  That call generates the pixClone(NULL) error.

I see that the pixClone() in set_pix_original() in ccmain/tesseractclass.h was added by Ray on Dec. 5, 2016.  Related: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/issues/32

Please add version info to traineddata files and check for correct version during runtime. Thanks. @theraysmith Please consider including in next set of changes for 4.0.
 +1 Apropos `traineddata` files: what about changing the file format for 4.x? That files are just a collection of several files, and Tesseract needs a special program / code to compose or extract them. There exist widely used other file formats which provide similar features, including but not limited to zip files. Compression could also reduce the file size. What about using ProtocolBuffers / FlatBuffers / cbor to serialize the lstm model?  Related:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!searchin/tesseract-dev/zip|sort:date/tesseract-dev/U5HSugUeeeI See PR #911 for a proof-of-concept how `traineddata` in zip format can be implemented. Implemented here:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/dc8745e6fd4c >Reports Pre-4.0.0 for traineddata from 4.00.00alpha

Yes. `Pre-4.0.0` is the default if the traineddata does not contain a `version` file.  The current traineddata files for 4.0 will be obsolete once Ray will push the new ones, which will probably have the `version` file.  >What about moving to #pragma once?

This one and the ObjectCache scary messages are from Tesseract.

Looks like a bug in Tesseract. Error is related to input file not being found.

``` Did you succeed in making it run on any image? 
I get the same error message on both *.png and *.jpg Check the version of leptonica and image livs by

tesseract -v

See if png and jpg libs are listed

In my case, giflib is not included in leptonica, hence it does not process
gifs.
Png and jpg files are processed, though there are some info and warning
messages from leptonica.

The latest GitHub version of leptonica and tesseract have fewer of these
msgs.

 You are completely right, when bulding Leptonica from source I relied on instructions from Tesseract Wiki, which are incomplete. 

From http://www.leptonica.org/source/README.html#DEPENDENCIES
Leptonica is configured to handle image I/O using these external
   libraries: libjpeg, libtiff, libpng, libz, libgif, libwebp, libopenjp2
   These libraries are easy to obtain.  For example, using the
   debian package manager:
       sudo apt-get install 
   where  = {libpng12-dev, libjpeg62-dev, libtiff4-dev}.

Now png and jpeg rendering libs got integrated when I rebuilt everything again.

Thanks! The error also comes when tesseract is not able to write an output file eg. missing output directory .. or other such io issues. getting error re: LEAK!  when input file not found - wrong name given

 I encounted the same error that tesseract not able to read gif.
error look like this:
...
Error in pixReadStreamGif: function not present
...
When I checked the version of tesseract, it did not show gif library: 
tesseract 4.00.00alpha
leptonica-1.74.1
libjpeg 8d (libjpeg-turbo 1.5.0) : libpng 1.6.25 : libtiff 4.0.6 : zlib 1.2.8

So I install libgif-dev from synaptic and recompile the leptonica again.
This time when I checked the version of tesseract again, it gave me:
tesseract 4.00.00alpha
leptonica-1.74.1
**libgif 5.1.4** : libjpeg 8d (libjpeg-turbo 1.5.0) : libpng 1.6.25 : libtiff 4.0.6 : zlib 1.2.8

After I tried again using gif with tesseract, it gave no error any more. Making the PWD be where the file is located works, but I consider that broken.  If I supply a relative or absolute path to an input file, tesseract should read that without issue.  Instead it says the file can't be found, which is bizarre.  I'm going to change my script to use cat and have tesseract read from standard input, because this is so broken.

tesseract --version                                                                  
tesseract 3.05.00
 leptonica-1.74.1
  libjpeg 8d : libpng 1.6.29 : libtiff 4.0.7 : zlib 1.2.8

I'm using it on MacOS through homebrew, and my source image is a PNG.

> ShreeDevi In the image_to_string function of tesseract.py, the input image is converted to bmp and stored in /tmp directory in my Linux box. When this path (with '/') pass to subprocess.Popen, tesseract cannot find the file.  You can simulate this by running the following in the command prompt.

tesseract /tmp/tess__cwb36mk.bmp output.txt Can you break on the warning and get some more information? From a quick look, `Dict::Load()` doesn't add `load_bigram_dawg` to `dawgs_`, which either is a bug or should be documented in a comment, but I don't know whether fixing that would solve this problem. Of course, all this stuff should really be RAII-ified... :-) Well, I was thinking more along the line of inspecting the offending object. Apparently fixing what I saw in `Dict::load()` didn't solve the problem, so I'll try gdb myself. Unfortunately `./configure --enable-debug` doesn't seem to work, because there are `-O2` arguments after the `-O0` ones, and "If you use multiple -O options, with or without level numbers, the last such option is the one that is effective.", so my workaround for that is to edit `configure` and `configure.ac`. Intermediate result of analysis: the program seems to be using `Dict::GlobalDawgCache()`, which has static duration, but the Dict using the cache is not deleted before the program `exit()`s. To be continued later... My debug builds avoid the `-O0` / `-O2` problem like this:

    mkdir -p bin/debug
    cd bin/debug
    # Disable parts which are not needed for debugging (shorter build time)
    # and don't use a shared library for Tesseract (easier debugging).
    # Avoid -O2 compiler option.
    ../../configure  --enable-debug --disable-shared --disable-static CXXFLAGS="-g"
    make
    cd ../..
    gdb --args bin/debug/api/tesseract [...]

I still did not find a correct fix for `configure.ac`. I have some evidence (in a new branch [issue529](https://github.com/rfschtkt/tesseract/tree/issue529) on my own fork, unless there's a better way to present that?), currently modifying the messages coming from the global cache. It mentions "workaround" here and there, but perhaps a cleaner solution can be found. Valgrind output for the test case (after PR #912 was applied):

The output was generated using `valgrind --verbose --track-origins=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all bin/debug/x86_64-linux-gnu/api/tesseract a b`. The thing is that `exit()` was inherited from C, and all kinds of things are hooked up to `atexit()` (even variables with static storage duration), but _not_ automatic variables like `tesseract::TessBaseAPI api;`. Inside `main()` you could replace it with plain `return`, but elsewhere I think you have to avoid `exit()` and instead, until the program becomes exception-safe (RAII!) with a global try/catch in main(), perhaps use `quick_exit()`. Or adapt the code I wrote for evidence as a workaround.

Incidentally, main() has the following comment (although I have no idea why anybody would care about leaked STRING objects, as compared to, e.g., open handles to files, or the subject of this issue):

```
  /* main() calls functions like ParseArgs which call exit().
   * This results in memory leaks if vars_vec and vars_values are

Well, I guess it might matter to diagnostic tools like Valgrind, but I suppose they're empty now. When tools like Valgrind are used to search for critical memory leaks, any memory leak is bad because it creates a warning which has to be analyzed. Example: Before PR #912 there were 40,102 allocated blocks at program termination, after that PR there remain 3 blocks (see above).

    LEAK SUMMARY:
       definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
       indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
         possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
       still reachable: 41,740,480 bytes in 40,102 blocks
                          of which reachable via heuristic:
                            newarray           : 4,147,800 bytes in 4,350 blocks
            suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
 I fully agree, and I should have guessed that it had taken some effort to get it down to 4 blocks.

Anyway, after my latest commit I don't get the messages anymore.

(Added) What's the 2 all about? Is anybody using it, is it documented? Otherwise, could it be just EXIT_FAILURE instead? /pedantic An additional commit in PR #912 fixes this issue. The crash problem is handled in PR #917. I think that using `static` to pander to ghost-of-the-past `exit()` is an abomination. Exiting other than in main is most probably the result of an error condition, where all you're concerned with is returning the error value. The only place where you should be concerned with a clean Valgrind report is inside main(), where you should use `return` rather than `exit()` to be compatible with the C++ paradigm of proper stack unwinding.

(Added) Unfortunately there's also `ScrollView::Exit()`, not sure whether these messages were a problem there? C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR>tesseract aws.tif aa.pdf

installed on windows 7 Installed package tesseract-ocr-setup-4.00.00dev  Using dawg2wordlist on lstm-word-dawg with the unicharset in the traineddata files creates a wordlist with 'junk' words (similar to what one gets when cube-word-dawg is processed with unicharset instead of cube-unicharset).

So either the lstm-unicharset has not been included in the traineddata or the lstm version of unicharset has not been included in the traineddata.

 However, removal of all dawg files from the traineddata does not seem to degrade the accuracy - tested with the phototest.tif and eurotext.tif test files.

https://github.com/Shreeshrii/tessdata4alpha/blob/master/en4.traineddata has this smaller minimal LSTM traineddata for English, used for the test. Unicharset was used for converting by dawg2wordlist. Will there be a new version of the program using LSTM instead of unicharset for viewing the wordlist, numbers and punctuation lists?

I already installed the 3 dependencies mentioned at [Training Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Training-Tesseract#additional-libraries-required) :

1. libicu
2. libpango
3. libcairo

I also build leptonica  in the same machine.
All the native libraries are already added to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and binaries to $PATH.
I am using gcc 4.8.4 whic meets c++11 needed standards.

Standing at root source of Tesseract, after running **./configure --prefix=path/to/tesseract** I am still getting the message: **You can not build training tools because of missing dependency.**

Does any one can help me with this? I am stocked at this point.
Thank you so much! What OS ?
Which branch, 3.05 or master (4.0)

For training tools you need Dev versions

sudo apt-get install libicu-dev
sudo apt-get install libpango1.0-dev
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev @Shreeshrii I downloaded it directly from master branch a month ago, if I type _tesseract --version_ I get
```
tesseract 3.05.00dev
leptonica-1.73
libpng 1.2.49 : libtiff 3.9.4 : zlib 1.2.3
```
I am using Oracle Linux Server release 6.8 so, unfortunately I can not use apt-get. Also tried sudo yum update and then yum install any-of-3packages , but didn't work. That is why I decided to download every dependency and install them in a common prefix. The sites where I obtained these tools are: 
http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/libicu-dev: icu_52.1.orig.tar.gz,
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/cairo.html: cairo-1.14.6.tar.xz, http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/pango.html: pango-1.40.3.tar.xz
And all the dependencies specified in their websites.

Thank you!!
 @stweil  Actually I didn't update Tesseract, I downloaded the latest version from master a month ago and also use .autogen.sh, I will try to re build it again and will let you know if it works.

Thank you!! Please try with the following packages and their dependencies

http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/libicu-dev

http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/libpango1.0-dev

http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/libcairo2-dev It seems yum uses different packages and names are also different. Try pango_devel and cairo-devel @stweil I am trying to re build Tesseract, but now I am getting the following:

> ./.libs/libtesseract.so: undefined reference to `omp_get_thread_num'
> ./.libs/libtesseract.so: undefined reference to `GOMP_sections_end_nowait'

> ./.libs/libtesseract.so: undefined reference to `GOMP_sections_next'
> ./.libs/libtesseract.so: undefined reference to `GOMP_parallel_sections_start'

I set thevariables setenv` CFLAGS /usr/include` `setenv LDFLAGS /usr/lib` and tried` setenv LDFLAGS /usr/local/lib` `setenv LDFLAGS /usr/local/lib`

**I see libgomp.so.1  libgomp.so.1.0.0** under **/usr/lib** and **/usr/lib64** 
do you have any idea of what is happening? Becuase I also have installed Leptonica, but I don´t know if I am missing something during compilation process.

Thank you !! @Shreeshrii I tried what you mentioned, using yum and downloading these packages, but still not working.
Do I have to set anything else rather than just adding the native libraries  paths to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH? Something that might cause my GCC crash because of possible missing dependencies?

I just wonder why it keeps telling me that I can not build training tools since The aoutput shows the following: 

```
checking for pango... yes
checking for cairo... yes
```
Can´t see anything releated with libicu, have also installed it.

Thanks a lot Shreeshrii! @stweil  Those messages are appearing compiling master (4.0) using gcc 4.8.4, so I compiled version 3.05 instead. Still working on building training tools. Sure @stweil !

The make output is pretty large, so it's attached at the end. 
Also, after trying 
`./configure --prefix=path --disable-openmp` 
I'm still getting the message 
"You can not build training tools because of missing dependency."

[make-output.txt](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/634989/make-output.txt)

 Sure, actually I tried with both versions, but I'am getting the same message after `./configure`.
When I do `make`:

3.05 finishes.

4.00 throws:

```

 Thanks for your help guys, I will let you know! Hi! I am sorry for the delay.
I could build tesseract now, but still can´t build training tools, here is what I did:

I downloaded the code from master just today, after doing 
```
./autogen.sh
setenv LIBLEPT_HEADERSDIR $install/include
./configure --prefix=$install --with-extra-libraries=$install/lib --disable-openmp
```

Now I see that there are different outputs related with Leptonica and one of them is not saying yes, I wonder what does this new param says because I have installed latest Leptonica's version (1.73) under `$install`. Also In installed libicu under this location and I am seeing an issue with this either:

I can execute
```
make 
make install 
```
without any problem so I guess 6140be6 fixed it but still can not build training tools.

Here is what I have under `$install` :
**lib**
liblept.a  liblept.la  liblept.so  liblept.so.1  liblept.so.1.73  liblept.so.5  liblept.so.5.0.0  libtesseract.a  libtesseract.la  libtesseract.so  libtesseract.so.4  libtesseract.so.4.0.0  modules  pkgconfig  terminfo

**include** 
leptonica  tesseract

**bin**
bash  convertfilestopdf  convertfilestops  convertformat  convertsegfilestopdf  convertsegfilestops  converttopdf  converttops  fileinfo  printimage  printsplitimage  printtiff  sh  splitimage2pdf  tesseract  xtractprotos

I am also adding `$install/lib` to my` $LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `$install/bin` to my `$PATH` before building Tesseract.

Thank you!

Now, after this check it seems that I have all the dependencies, but still can't go to the training tools building process. :s




 Hi guys.
Thank you very much for your help.
I could now build training tools using master (Tesseract 4.0).

I be able to build them I had **to remove all the lines** `AM_CONDITIONAL([ENABLE_TRAINING], false)`   in **configure.ac**, to be specific, they were 4.

After that, then trying to build training tools I saw an error related with libicu, basically the compiler was not finding some .h files. As I have libicu installed under $install and I also added $install/lib to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, $install/bin to $PATH and also set $PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$install/usr/lib64/pkgconfig:$install/lib/pkgconfig I guess there was some other configuration to tell GCC where to look for the include files, but I could not find it, so to solve this I had to **copy all the files under `$install/include/unicode` to `/usr/include/unicode` so GCC could find these files**.  Do you have any suggestion when this happens to tell GCC specifically where to look for the .h files? (a non standard "include" directory) I think there should be another way so I don't really need to copy the include files to the standard location.

I have one final question: Do you guys know where can I ask questions to Leptonica's team? They have a mailing list in Google Code, but it seems that we can not open any other issue.

Once again, thanks for your help on this! I think that the pango-devel and cairo-devel in RHEL/Centos 6 would work with Tesseract 4. >I have one final question: Do you guys know where can I ask questions to Leptonica's team?

Sure, now you can close this issue.

Once again, thank you for helping me to solve this.
I am now running training tools on Oracle Linux Server 6.8 successfully.

The warnings seem to be given per line, so a page with 20 lines of text gets about 40 lines of messages.

I have not tested this in the linux environment. The warnings are probably from leptonica.
 There are a large number of warning messages when using -oem 4, not with other oem modes.

Is there a way to eliminate these?

How did you compile Leptonica? http://www.leptonica.org/source/README.html

>4. Compile-time control over stderr output (see environ.h)
>
>   Leptonica provides both compile-time and run-time control over
   messages and debug output (thanks to Dave Bryan).  Both compile-time
   and run-time severity thresholds can be set.  The run-time threshold
   can also be set by an environmental variable.  Messages are
   vararg-formatted and of 3 types: error, warning, informational.
   These are all macros, and can be further suppressed when
   NO_CONSOLE_IO is defined on the compile line.  For production code
   where no output is to go to stderr, compile with -DNO_CONSOLE_IO.
 https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/blob/7e0191abd/src/environ.h#L290 It's not a bug, but I agree that there is a place for improvements. In production, there should be no need to see any leptonica output (info, warnings, errors) to stderr.
Methods for suppressing them are described above by Amit.
These messages are arguably INFO rather than WARNING.

Reads and writes from/to file for in-memory I/O on Windows are no longer required for gif and tiff formats. They were never required for webp.  They are still required for jpeg, jp2k and png. Dan,

Thanks for the info.

>Reads and writes from/to file for in-memory I/O on Windows are no longer required for gif and tiff formats.

Since which version?

The solution to the optimization problem might be in this specific case to always save the textlines images to tiff in memory. Amit,

1.73 required r/w for in-memory I/O for gif and tiff on Windows. The current github master (and soon to be release 1.74.0) does not.  The tiff patch was contributed by Stefan.

Yes, any 1 bpp images (e.g., in tesseract/viewer and ccstruct) can be output in IFF_TIFF_G4, which typically has better compression than png.  Grayscale and color can be output in TIFF_ZIP or TIFF_LZW, which are typically inferior to png in compression. Stefan, we can downgrade those messages in leptonica to INFO, and you can use setMsgSeverity() to disable INFO statements. Nevertheless, this seems like a reasonable thing to do to solve this annoyance and still present other WARNING messages.
 Annoying messages have now been downgraded to INFO at github head.

You can use this in tesseract code to suppress all INFO and less urgent messages at run time:
     setMsgSeverity(L_SEVERITY_WARNING);

Alternatively, for a bit more flexibility, you can define the environmental variable
 #define  LEPT_MSG_SEVERITY   L_SEVERITY_WARNING
and use
     setMsgSeverity(L_SEVERITY_EXTERNAL);

You can also change the severity level to WARNING and higher at compile time with this compiler flag:
    -DDEFAULT_SEVERITY=4
This can be over-ridden at run time with either of the first two methods.
 >Reads and writes from/to file for in-memory I/O on Windows are no longer required for gif and tiff formats.

I wonder how giflib and libiff do the equivalence of fmemopen on Windows.
 @zdenop  That's an interesting idea.  Default setting is for INFO, WARNING and ERROR, but for a release that will be used in production it makes sense to only show ERROR. @amitdo 

Look at the leptonica wrappers for tiff (tiffio.c) and gif (gifio.c) to see how it is done.

Even better, the webp library implements compression and decompression directly with memory buffers, not with file streams. This is very nice, because it's platform independent, and you can easily read and write to files using it (see webpio.c). I wish the other image compression libraries had been implemented that way, but ...  "NOTE that if you are creating a totally new language, for which there is no existing traineddata file, **Tesseract will currently refuse to initialize with just the lstm model in it,** even if you use OEM_LSTM_ONLY as the OCR engine mode. For now, you can make it run using any existing traineddata file and adding your new lstm model and (optionally) the lstm dawgs. 

This is a point for improvement in the future. The unicharset used for the lstm has to match the unicharset used to generate the lstm-*-dawg files, but doesn't have to match the unicharset for the inttemp and base tesseract dawg files."

From: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00#combining-the-output-files @theraysmith, any chance you'll fix that for the final 4.00 release? @theraysmith, can you confirm that 5deebe6c2 solved this issue? @theraysmith

 @theraysmith Thanks, Ray. I will try the tutorial again now. @theraysmith Looks like some files maybe missing from langdata repo also since that was not updated for 4.0alpha. e.g. 

Failed to load radical-stroke info from: ../langdata/radical-stroke.txt msg in basetrain.log

May I also suggest that you update the alpha version in https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/api/baseapi.h with either git revision of just a numerical number so that it is easy to verify the version of program being used. Thanks.

Another victim is IBM POWER.
 
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/fe313521-2e95-46f2-817d-44a4f27eba32/entry/just_the_faqs_about_little_endian?lang=en

>Why is Linux on Power transitioning from big endian to little endian?
>
>The Power architecture is bi-endian in that it supports accessing data in both little endian and big endian modes. Although Power already has Linux distributions and supporting applications that run in big endian mode, the Linux application ecosystem for x86 platforms is much larger and Linux on x86 uses little endian mode.  Numerous clients, software partners, and IBM’s own software developers have told us that porting their software to Power becomes simpler if the Linux environment on Power supports little endian mode, more closely matching the environment provided by Linux on x86.  This new level of support will lower the barrier to entry for porting Linux on x86 software to Linux on Power.

 You can use QEMU for testing.
https://qemu.weilnetz.de/doc/qemu-doc.html#QEMU-System-emulator-for-non-PC-targets  He did provide a link for 'convert2le' (`convert2le` was clickable). Here is the link in a more visable form:
https://github.com/stweil/tesseract/blob/endian/ccutil/tessio.h#L15
A link to tessio.cpp:
https://github.com/stweil/tesseract/blob/endian/ccutil/tessio.cpp Little-endian is an abomination. It hurts the brain if you haven't grown up with it (like apparently in Arabic, which still pronounces numbers big to little except for units before tens). UTF-8 is necessarily big-endian by design so that lexicographical order is the same whether processing considers bytes (fast, using memcmp) or code points (slow). Packed bitmap representations like BMP and PNG (I only verified those) store the leftmost pixel in the most significant bits of a byte, so loading a range of pixels in a 64-bit integer, shifting them inside the processor, and writing them back only makes sense if integers are big-endian. Intelligent future civilisations are bound to reconsider the current accidental infatuation with little-endian, and will curse their predecessors for having to modify all those inflexible formats and software.

With C++, byte order or pre-evaluated need to reverse order ("bool swap") can easily be hidden in a file object member variable: it does not have to be passed around as a function argument, if that is considered too cumbersome. Has anybody even made a performance analysis before just postulating that little-endian is necessary for optimal or near-optimal performance on little-endian machines, considering that relatively little time is spent on I/O and that data files will also tend to be little-endian? I've had a look at stweil's proposal (endian branch), and I'm "not sure" that it will work... unless on a big-endian machine the file is saved twice, or read in again, perhaps because serialisation was the last thing the program did before it was restarted, or otherwise explicitly. The problem seems to be that the byte order is reversed in place, for serialisation as well as deserialisation. If you want to use a fixed endianness, you have to use a separate buffer, or do one of the workarounds described above. And that's if you're sure that each data item is visited exactly once, otherwise the reversal has to occur inside the lowest-level serialisation functions!

I would propose a different solution, where serialisation and deserialisation are unified into a single method, and instead of a FILE pointer you get a handle to an object that can do anything you want. This could easily simplify the existing code, without breaking compatibility with existing data files.

Another thing is to hide endianness handling in a library that can be reused and is maintained by people who do care about this issue. For example, a 64-bit swap in source code is either recognised by the compiler and optimised into a single instruction, or there is a better alternative with fewer operations. It would also be possible to use vector instructions to convert endianness. Well, it works as far as it was implemented and tested. Writing little endian trained data on a big endian host was not implemented. All other use cases (reading little endian on a little or big endian host, writing little endian on a little endian host) work according to my tests.

Nevertheless pull request #703 is obsolete, as Ray is currently working on improving endianness support. I would use a subset of boost serialisation: just one serialize() method template exactly as specified in boost (instead of largely redundant separate code for writing and reading), and minimal format-compatible ad-hoc Archive implementations without creating any dependency on boost itself or not yet anyway, except for reusing the idea. You can then hide the endianness policy in the Archive implementation: write host endianness (as it is now), write fixed endianness (as proposed above), write configured endianness (host endianness by default, unless perhaps publishing for reuse, or a default the other way around), write JSON, ... Better than reinventing the wheel with probably more code!

(2017-05-02 Added) Maybe it's a bit late for exactly that, I don't know... But if you want to use TFile, you should also have it do all the endianness handling, so it's never forgotten. If somebody else weren't already on it, I'd give that a try myself. Ray, the new code still uses a dynamic detection in `TessdataManager::LoadMemBuffer` to decide whether swapping is needed or not. This implies that the code supports both big and little endian data files. The drawback is additional runtime code on all kinds of machines.

Are you planning more changes? I'd drop support of big endian data files in 4.0 and add code to always write little endian ones. Then static swapping code would only be needed on big endian machines, and the large majority of machines would not need any swap code at all.
  This restores classify/adaptmatch.cpp to commit 1e60a8d71c591ab9562983778d6ce2541b75abc0
(+ two deleted empty lines).

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil <sw@weilnetz.de>  Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil sw@weilnetz.de  Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil <sw@weilnetz.de> That's a different function which either gets called with `&recoder_` or with `NULL` as value for parameter `recoder`. It is unrelated to my modification. My point is that recoder may be NULL and you should use a pointer instead of a reference. I don't think so. The old code passed an `UnicharCompress` object. Passing a reference is the optimized equivalent. How would you assign a NULL pointer to a `UnicharCompress` object (not a pointer) as it is done in the function? I will recheck it after a good sleep :) Stefan,
I tried to examine the call hierarchy, but I didn't find a call to this variant of `InitCharSet` overloaded method. Your analysis is correct: one of the `InitCharSet` methods is unused and can be removed.

@theraysmith, are there plans to use that interface in the future, or can `void InitCharSet(const UNICHARSET& unicharset, const UnicharCompress recoder)` be removed?

@zdenop, I think this PR can be applied anyway – we can also remove a fixed method in a later PR.
 TIP: You can also close the PR and reopen it and the CI builds will rerun. You are right :)   See also the discussion for PR #177. I start with `opencl` because the risk of conflicts with other code changes is low.  Vcpkg is a tool to acquire and build C++ open source libraries on Windows:

For some reason the ` «` and `»` characters are unrecognized in French.  I'am trying to use text2image to create my  XXX.tif file and XXX.box file.
I found that only If all the characters can be rendered ,the text2image works fine.
It will broken when some characters can NOT be renderd with some fonts (the chinese fonts file usually  would NOT contain all the characters of chinese)

Is there a method to skip the character which could not be  rendered?(for example: use '  ' instead of the characters or just skip them)

thank you ! Text2image has the option to use only renderable characters. Please check
help for syntax

text2image --help

 @Shreeshrii 
YES it works! thank you  @Shreeshrii Sorry ,I met a anther error :
 cluster text.size() == start_byte_to_box.size():error
have you seen it before?  Hi, I'm trying to work with the newly updated LSTM tesseract.

Tesseract gives me this error when I try
```sh
$ tesseract image.jpg out -oem 4

Error: LSTM requested, but not present!! Loading tesseract.
```

It seems like I don't have the tessdata for LSTM.

Where can I get it? The LSTM traineddata files aren't available yet. Thanks for your replies! The LSTM traineddata files are available now.
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata Thank you! I'll try it out  I suggest to add spaces in the title of the wiki pages, e.g. the newly created page https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/NeuralNetsInTesseract4.00:

"NeuralNetsInTesseract4.00" --> "Neural Nets In Tesseract 4.00"

The spaces will be changed in the url by dashes i.e. https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Neural-Nets-In-Tesseract-4.00. This is more conform to the other pages, but there are more wiki pages missing some spaces.

Is this okay?
 Uff..., well, then I don't understand the sentence "Please do not change the title of any wiki page without a permission from Tesseract developers." at https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki CC @amitdo . I would expect that I can ask permission from developers in an issue at GitHub, if one has to use the user forum for that, then the sentence should be reformulated. Hi @zuphilip :-)

>**Please do not change the title of any wiki page without a permission from Tesseract developers**.

I added it a few hours ago.

Recently, a user change a lot of wiki pages titles. The issues I see with doing so are:
* There were many links to some of the wiki pages from Tesseract issues, threads in Tesseract mailing list, blogs posts, etc. The changes broke those links. 
* I contributed to some of those pages, especially to the `TrainingTesseract` page where I did ton of editing. With the change of the title the history of the page editing is gone from the wiki interface. It looks like I and others who contribute to those pages never did so. > With the change of the title the history of the page editing is gone from the wiki interface. 

That looks like something which could be simply improved by the GitHub people. I get the full history in a local clone of the wiki with `git log --follow Training-Tesseract.md`.
 @amitdo

My apologies for the unintended consequences of title changes. I was trying
to make all related pages in wiki come together, eg. Training methofs for
various versions, box files, tesstrain etc. I had no idea that it would
remove page history and previous authors. I also realize that it has led to
broken links.

Is there a way to display broken links in the wiki so that they can be
fixed?

 Shree @Shreeshrii,

I knew that you are the one that did those titles edits and I was sure you had good intentions. I don't blame you, so please don't feel bad about that :-) 

I blame Github devs.

Stefan @stweil, the fact that I can clone it and see my changes is not helping me. > Is it possible for you to undo the title changes?

I am not sure whether undoing your changes is the right way. Of course the wiki internal links must work, so maybe some links have to be fixed. I would not care for external links. They will still reach the wiki, and people who are interested will be able to find the page they are looking for.

@amitdo, I just contacted GitHub support and suggested to enhance the history, so maybe it will show all contributions (also those before a rename) in the future.

Personally I prefer nice looking titles (that implies spaces between words).

Technically anybody can rename titles, also back to the old ones. It's easier to revert changes in a local wiki clone, but only project owners can push such modifications. @amitdo : For the newly created pages, I will leave it up to you or any other of the core developer to change the page name. >@amitdo, I just contacted GitHub support and suggested to enhance the history, so maybe it will show all contributions (also those before a rename) in the future.

Thanks for that, although I'm sceptical about the chance they will do something about this issue. 

I was told that wikipedia's wiki does not have this issue.

With git itself and also with Github interface for **code** changes the history is preserved.

> I would not care for external links. They will still reach the wiki, and people who are interested will be able to find the page they are looking for.

This is called [breaking the web](https://www.google.co.il/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=%22breaking+the+web%22+%22broken+links%22) and it's not nice.

Some user re-added the 'deleted' pages with a link to the 'new' pages. In one hand it solves the broken links issue, but on the the other hand it creates a lot of ugly duplicates in the wiki TOC. 

>Personally I prefer nice looking titles (that implies spaces between words).

Personally, I think the fact that the wiki title does not have whitespace is a minor issue, and due to the implications I mentioned earlier, it should not be changed unless...
* It's a new wiki page (with no external links to it)
* The authors of the page agree with the change.


Some projects block the option to freely do any edits in the wiki content, but I don't suggest to so in this project. More fine-grained permissions control options in the wiki would be very helpful, e.g. options to block title editing and page deletion, an option to 'protected page' - block any editing for certain pages, etc.  

 Maybe not many people care about this issue as I do...

>@amitdo : For the newly created pages, I will leave it up to you or any other of the core developer to change the page name.

@zuphilip,
@theraysmith or @zdenop should decide about it.

Zdenko, if you don't like my new 'policy' you can remove it from the 'Home' wiki page. > Thanks for that, although I'm sceptical about the chance they will do something about this issue.

Well, at least they have sent an answer:

"This does sounds like it would be a useful addition to wiki revisions. I've passed your request onto the team to consider. I can't promise if or when we would implement but thanks for writing in."
 I now see that the previous edits were preserved in the interface of the global history.
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/_history?page=6
:-)

I now think it's OK to change the titles of **new** wiki pages...
@zdenop?

If you change the title of a page, don't do changes to the body text in the same edit. https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Improve-Quality/_compare/deccb78%5E...deccb78

This broke some links (Readme, Wiki).

What should we do now?
1) Revert this change?
2) Fix the links? CC: @andrewda My bad! Thought it was a typo, will revert for now. @amitdo Is there an issue with the revert button on the wiki `_compare` page? I clicked "Revert" assuming it would undo the title change and now both pages seem to be gone... Seems like a bug in GitHub.

https://github.com/contact The wiki interface considers a change of a wiki page title as creating a **new page**.
So the wiki reverted your last change - and deleted this page.
Unfortunately, the story ends here...

Or Not. The wiki can be cloned and the page should still be accessible in the history. It can be recovered. Ah, I understand now. Had no idea that's how GitHub renamed pages, very sorry for the trouble.  The source of the problem is git itself. The wiki is built on top of it.  The page was somehow restored.

what if the language was Arabic, which doesn't have capital case or small case, but the same problem was generated, what could be the issue? @blacklong617 @ibr123

```  unofficial installer for windows for Tesseract 3.05-dev is available from Tesseract at UB Mannheim.
http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-setup-3.05.00dev.exe
win10, x64, lastest update.

the installer will not just add path,it will EMPTY path. This is not an issue for https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues. Nevertheless I can try to answer here.

I got a similar report per e-mail recently, but could not reproduce it. Could you tell me the previous value of `PATH` which was emptied by the installation? Do you need the option which claims to set `PATH`? It is disabled by default, so I suggest to use the default setting (which avoids the issue).
 All values of PATH were emptied by the installation.
Maybe the installer alerted me ,or as you said it is disabled by default.
Maybe I click the "next" too fast cause I thought it's OK.
Fortunately,I opened the PowerShell before the installation,the change of PATH didn't refresh in the opened PowerShell,so that I can restore the values of PATH,or it will be a little trouble.
 How does your normal value of `PATH` look like? I need the value which you restored (or like it was before it was emptied) because the problem might be related to the length or the content of `PATH`.
 `C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath;C:\Program Files\Python27\;C:\Program Files\Python27\Scripts;C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Program Files (x86)\NVIDIA Corporation\PhysX\Common;C:\Program Files\nodejs\;C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\.dnx\bin;C:\Program Files\Microsoft DNX\Dnvm\;C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Windows Performance Toolkit\;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\120\Tools\Binn\;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Tools\Binn\;C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Fabric 1.5 & MySQL Utilities 1.5\;C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Fabric 1.5 & MySQL Utilities 1.5\Doctrine extensions for PHP\;C:\Program Files\IDM Computer Solutions\UltraEdit;C:\Program Files (x86)\IDM Computer Solutions\UltraCompare;C:\Shorts;C:\Program Files\Git\cmd;C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin;C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin;C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin;C:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.0.10;C:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.0.10\ext;C:\Users\CeBk\AppData\Roaming\npm;C:\Users\CeBk\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps;C:\Users\CeBk\AppData\Roaming\npm;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps;`

that's all the values of PATH before the installation 
 The NSIS installer (which is used for Tesseract) has a [limit of 1024 characters](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Path_Manipulation). Your PATH is clearly longer, so it hits that limit. I think the simplest solution will be removing the PATH setting from the installer, so users cannot activate it.

 @zdenop

There have been a number of questions re tesseract 4.0 or version with
LSTM. It will be helpful for the community to know the status.

I have added a wiki page with available info at
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/4.0-with-LSTM

Please change the language as you deem fit and update when there is info
available about the release.

Thanks.

 I should mention that I'm seeing this issue across multiple machines, and this is the only codebase I'm seeing this issue for (cmake works fine on other projects, example: opencv).
 I doubt I'll have time to chat synchronously or share my screen today.  At a glance, it looks like cppan.exe is running during the hang, so I suspect it's the culprit.  Also see 2 cmake-gui processes and about 7 cmake processes.  Other info:

D:\personal\tesseract>cmake --version
cmake version 3.6.2

Regarding files in that directory, are you looking for a recursive list?  It looks like it just contains random folder names that contain session data.  There are a lot of files in each directory, though - looking for something specific?
 Yep, the CPU is doing barely anything.

 No cl.exe, link.exe, MSBuild.exe, but there are a 6 conhost.exe's.  The two cmd.exe's open are my command windows.  Conhosts all look identical with the following command line:
\??\C:\WINDOWS\system32\conhost.exe 0x4 
 Killed all the conhosts.  Seems like one of them was driving the command window I executed cmake from, so that shut down.  Still see 4 cmake processes and a cppan process running.

 That seemed to unstick it.  So cmake is hanging on something.
 Seems fixed in 3.7.  I don't see the "running tests" step at all anymore.
 Yeah, this brings the problem back.  If the next step is to build a debug version of cmake and debug their code, it might be a while before I have the time to address it.
 I got exactly the same issue. After many trial & errors I was about to compile CMake in debug when I found the solution in [this](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/417#issuecomment-245073354) thread. Simply calling `cppan --self-upgrade` solved my issue. It seems like [this](https://cppan.org/client/cppan-master-Windows-client.zip) client is buggy and not up-to-date.
 it seems that the work can go on if you kill the two or three cmake tasks with least memories. If you have problems @hyogase [solution](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/464#issuecomment-264166445) works perfectly.  removing all cmake tasks except one (with the highest memory) worked for me, thanks @hyogase   It is only used locally in opencl/openclwrapper.cpp.

For all other files which include openclwrapper.h, the compiler
complained about an unused static variable:

opencl/openclwrapper.h:175:16: warning:
 ‘MORPH_BC’ defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil <sw@weilnetz.de> It is still not clear for me why that variable `MORPH_BC` is needed at all.
  There are small issues in the code that cause compilation errors under Windows unicode project.
The problem is that some of win32 api functions are called without a proper postfix "A" which forces compiler to use non-unicode version of these functions. Here are all of them:
baseapi.cpp
377 WIN32_FIND_DATA -> WIN32_FIND_DATAA
379 FindFirstFile-> FindFirstFileA
381 FindNextFile -> FindNextFileA

svutil.cpp
82 STARTUPINFO -> STARTUPINFOA
84 GetStartupInfo -> GetStartupInfoA
85 CreateProcess -> CreateProcessA

mainblk.cpp
69 GetModuleFileName -> GetModuleFileNameA

P.S.
The same problem exists in the latest Leptonica library but among the similar errors that can be located by the compiler there are some that it is not able to find e.g. when the code uses GetTempPath instead of GetTempPathA.

You are right on one condition - if you use "TCHAR" type vars as WinApi function parameters instead of "char" and likewise LPCTSTR instead of LPCSTR, LPTSTR instead of LPSTR and so on. > So, types should be fixed, not functions.

http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-use-nullptr.html  Hi,
I'm using the "Example of iterator over the classifier choices for a single symbol" to show the confidence for each of the characters in image but it just print the characters of one of the word in the middle of image. how would i have all of the candidate choices and it's confidence for each of character in image?
  As per @jbreiden's comment in #373, here's a problem I noticed with tesseract 3.04.01 (from the Ubuntu Yakkety package).

This is the original PDF without text as it is created by my scanner: [scanned.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/558983/scanned.pdf)

I've used pdfsandwich with the `-debug` flag to get the intermediate files. The image it uses to feed into tesseract is the tif in this [tif.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/558990/tif.zip). And this works just fine. Here's the identify information from that tif:

```
Image: extractedtif.tif
  Format: TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
  Mime type: image/tiff
  Class: DirectClass
  Geometry: 2479x3500+0+0
  Resolution: 300x300
  Print size: 8.26333x11.6667
  Units: Undefined
  Type: Grayscale
  Endianess: LSB
  Colorspace: Gray
  Depth: 8-bit
  Channel depth:
    gray: 8-bit
```

Running

```
tesseract extractedtif.tif outputtif -l deu pdf
```

gives me a perfectly fine PDF in format: A4, Portrait (210 x 296 mm).

[outputtif.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/559002/outputtif.pdf)

And now I converted that tif to png with simply:

```
convert extractedtif.tif pngfromtif.png
```

[png.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/559009/png.zip)

The new png file shows the same resolution information and print size:

```
Image: pngfromtif.png
  Format: PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
  Mime type: image/png
  Class: PseudoClass
  Geometry: 2479x3500+0+0
  Resolution: 300x300
  Print size: 8.26333x11.6667
  Units: Undefined
  Type: Grayscale
  Endianess: Undefined
  Colorspace: Gray
  Depth: 8-bit
  Channel depth:
    gray: 8-bit
```

However, running

```
tesseract pngfromtif.png outputpng -l deu pdf
```

gives me a PDF in format: 900 × 1270 mm paper size.

[outputpng.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/559004/outputpng.pdf)
 But then, why does tesseract behave inconsistently between tif and png when both have `Units: Undefined`?
 I think I know why the units are Undefined. pdfsandwich does a 2-step conversion from a PDF page to tif:

```
convert -colorspace Gray -colors 256 -depth 8 -background white -flatten +matte -density 300x300 scanned.pdf[0] tmpfile.ppm
```

Which gives:

```
Image: tmpfile.ppm
  Format: PPM (Portable pixmap format (color))
  Mime type: image/x-portable-pixmap
  Class: DirectClass
  Geometry: 2479x3500+0+0
  Units: Undefined
  Type: Grayscale
  Endianess: Undefined
  Colorspace: Gray
  Depth: 8-bit
  Channel depth:
    gray: 8-bit
```

And then:

```
convert -density 300x300 tmpfile.ppm tmpfile.tif
```

Which results in:

```
Image: tmpfile.tif
  Format: TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
  Mime type: image/tiff
  Class: DirectClass
  Geometry: 2479x3500+0+0
  Resolution: 300x300
  Print size: 8.26333x11.6667
  Units: Undefined
  Type: Grayscale
  Endianess: LSB
  Colorspace: Gray
  Depth: 8-bit
  Channel depth:
    gray: 8-bit
```

I'll open a ticket with pdfsandwich to add `-unit PixelsPerInch` to the `convert` command.

_EDIT:_ https://sourceforge.net/p/pdfsandwich/bugs/14/
 Yup, asked both in the ticket there.
 > 1) Why use two convert commands instead of just one?

Because there's a use of `unpaper` in between them. It's [info file](https://github.com/Flameeyes/unpaper/blob/master/doc/basic-concepts.md) says:

> The image-file formats accepted by unpaper are those that libav can handle. In particular it supports the whole PNM-family: PBM, PGM and PPM. This ensures interoperability with the SANE tools under Linux. Support for TIFF and other complex file formats is not guaranteed.

That said, [libav says](http://libav.org/documentation/general.html#File-Formats) that it handles png and tiff, if I read it correctly.
 @mbirth I'm the author of [ocrmypdf](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF), which is similar to pdfsandwich. \<plug\>ocrmypdf is extremely carefully in handling of DPI and handles a lot of edge cases that pdfsandwich does not.\</plug\> It handles your file without issue.

@jbreiden I think it would be helpful for tesseract to issue a warning when the DPI is nonsense. Lots of programs don't handle this metadata correctly so it's easy for a workflow to discard it. Wrong DPI isn't just a display/printing issue; in the case of say, scanned maps, losing scale information can change the interpretation. That is a very good idea. Hope I remember once the turkey coma wears off.
 This looks like a spot where we should emit the warning, but is not executed.

  I don't find how to use this API in android project.  is there an available wrapper for android? 
  ![leptonica](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17674215/18988851/44796cb8-8726-11e6-8854-9ff87c11ad96.png)
I followed the steps of installation of `tesseract-ocr`. After `autogen.sh` , I tried `./configure` but terminal is showing `leptonica library with pdf support (>= 1.71) is missing` and no further installation is happening.
I searched for this problem extensively. I installed `leptonica-17.3` from source. Then I tried `./configure` again. The problem persisted. I again searched. In one closed issue, there was suggestion for `./configure --with-extra-includes=/usr/local/include --with-extra-libaries=/usr/local/lib
` instead of `./configure`. I didn't work.
The problem is still the same. 
What to do? 
Any suggestion is welcome. 
 I have the same bug. Since it is telling you that you have the wrong version, but that is not the real issue.

 this is bug and not a "asking support".
 @canny07 i made it work by setting the library path diffierntly. It is probably a old version of leptonica that is "blocking the sight"  for the config script .
 @Neppord Yeah It seems so. For my case, I found that the older version was the reason of trouble. So, I removed it and downloaded and installed the latest version from the source. 
Thanks for answering :)
 First, it is recommended to uninstall an older Leptonica before you install new one.

Running `sudo ldconfig` after `sudo make install` in both Leptonica and Tesseract installation should prevent the issue you had.

Anyway, it's not a bug in Tesseract.
 > Anyway, it's not a bug in Tesseract.

In some way it is. I had to fix my Tesseract configuration to get PDF support for the Windows version. Maybe I should have sent a PR earlier – I'll do it now.
 Please test and review pull request #473 which should fix this issue.
 The cause of their issue is not related to libpng. 
  Hi,

The command line help output shows 11 PSM modes (0 through 10).

```
  pagesegmode values are:
  0 = Orientation and script detection (OSD) only.
  1 = Automatic page segmentation with OSD.
  2 = Automatic page segmentation, but no OSD, or OCR
  3 = Fully automatic page segmentation, but no OSD. (Default)
  4 = Assume a single column of text of variable sizes.
  5 = Assume a single uniform block of vertically aligned text.
  6 = Assume a single uniform block of text.
  7 = Treat the image as a single text line.
  8 = Treat the image as a single word.
  9 = Treat the image as a single word in a circle.
  10 = Treat the image as a single character.
```

I was trying each one and getting mixed results. However, I accidentally ran 'psm -11' and I suddenly got perfect accuracy - way way better than any other PSM mode, and much better than the default. The same for PSM 12 too, perfect accuracy - then PSM 13 gives nothing. 

The image is just about 10 words over 2 lines, spread about the page. All the other segmentation modes and default garble the text, but PSM 11/12 worked great, splitting text perfectly.

Is it correct that there's a PSM 11 and 12 mode? What do they do, why do they give such good accuracy?! And should they be in the help/[Wiki](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Command-Line-Usage)?

Thanks!
 With Tesseract 4.0 PSM 11, 12, and 13 appear in the help message. psm 13 is used with the new LSTM engine to OCR a single textline image.   Font detection works fine in PSM_SINGLE_WORD mode. In PSM_SINGLE_LINE mode it is not working well. For recognizing more text (column, full page) font detection does not work at all. For every word the reported font is the same (e.g. Georgia using the default eng.traineddata). I thought at first that this is a issue with traineddata but training my own data and trying different stuff it seems way more likely that this issue is with tesseract (see [issue in tessdata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/issues/25) ). I attached a small example to demonstrate the problem.
[broken_font_detection_sample.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/493838/broken_font_detection_sample.zip)
 All the fonts are from the liberation family. I could narrow down the cause of this problem to the adaptive classifier. With classify_enable_learning set to false detection of italic/sans/serif works and detection of bold works sometimes (which is to be expected). The adoptive classifier seems a bit overzealous if font features change (eg. from serif to sans). It seems if a word is sans all sans fonts in the training data get high ratings and the already adopted to sans font gets a even higher rating. If the next word is serif then the serif fonts in the training data get high ratings but the adopted to sans font gets a rating that is still higher. I suppose that because of this the already adopted to sans font is able to learn the serif features. In the end the whole document matches the font that the classifier was first adopting to (I tried this). I attached a part of the log obtained from setting tessedit_debug_fonts to true where font changes from sans to serif bold ("Exeter." -> "The").
[debug_log.txt](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/504412/debug_log.txt)
 This problem is triggered as soon as any previously adapted character is encountered and the codepath DoAdaptiveMatch->BaselineClassifier is used. My current insight into this issue is that matching baselinenormalized characters and matching characternormalized characters yield different kinds of ratings  that are not comparable. The ratings based on baselinenormalized characters are inflated when compared to the ratings based one characternormalized characters so the font first adapted to always gets the highest ratings (due to learning new words that are actually printed in a different font). There is probably also a (related?) bug that causes inflated ratings for bad matches using BaselineClassifier. For example doubling xheight still matches the same font in testing if BaselineClassifier is called. The only case where a different font is sometimes matched  is when the characters are damaged beyond recognition (that may be because different classifiers are tried in this case).
  I've traced the code several times looking for the class which the characters recognized, but I can't found it.
where does the characters recognize?
  Tesseract just spent seven hours trying to do OCR on the attached document. It's five pages long. 

I'm fairly certain that the reason this takes so long is because of the speckling in the document. Other times when I've seen this kind of performance, it's been for similarly speckled documents.

Not sure what you can or should do about it, but since it seems to be a worst case scenario for Tesseract, I thought I'd report it.

This is on the latest version of Tesseract.

 One minute per page is not extraordinary much (although improvements which make it faster are of course welcome). My worst cases are currently double pages from a historic newspaper which take around ten minutes.
 Thanks for looking at this! We converted using ghostscript to multi-page tiff:

```
gs -dQUIET -dSAFER -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE-sDEVICE=tiffgray -r300x300-o destination path
```

One minute/page is still pretty darned slow, but we'd welcome that at this point!
 You could use gs to split the pdf into images and then ocr each separately
and concatenate the result.

 Sure, but that's not the point...and anyway, it's not at all clear that the slowness is because it's a multipage tiff. I suspect if you ran this on each individual page of the tiff you'd have the same slowness.
 To get accurate results, you will need to preprocess the images too to get
rid of the background speckles.

You could try scantailor or imagemagick.

As a test, you can also try Vietocr GUI, and compare results with the
command line output.

 Yeah, we saw this in testing, but went with TIFFs because they support multi-page images, which makes our OCR pipeline easier. In testing, we saw that the OCR for PDFs was no slower using large TIFFs than it was using PNGs because the process seems to be CPU bound no matter what.

If you use 300dpi PNGs do you get the slow performance I experienced with the 300dpi TIFFs? That's probably a better test, right?
 Thanks for looking at this @amitdo.

> This command creates a 42 MB tiff file. The size in pixels of each page is the same as with my PNGs.

But these aren't 300x300, which is apparently what provides the best OCR quality.[1] The point of this issue is that at 300x300, this takes seven hours to do five pages.

> It 'thinks' the speckles are diacritics...

Yeah...that's an issue too. Running a despeckling filter first would help in this case, but we do OCR on millions of PDFs and we only need to despeckle the worst of them. For the rest, I imagine it would reduce quality (not to mention slow down the pipeline).

The point here is that Tesseract takes seven hours for a speckled document at the recommended DPI.

 @mlissner It would have been helpful, if you had shared the info about your previous tests for this type of document

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39110300/how-to-provide-image-to-tesseract-from-memory

https://github.com/mlissner/tesseract-performance-testing
 We have seen similar documents taking very long (but still not an hour per page!). Therefore, whether it really is a tesseract issue should be investigated further.

@mlissner in order to increase performance and quality, you have to pre-process the image(s) for tesseract. For your specific case, use `leptonica` (tesseract already depends on it). Count the connected components, if there are too many, apply your filters. In a real word application where your documents have specific characteristics, you will not be able to avoid heavy pre-processing for tesseract in order to achieve reasonable results.

Look how tesseract uses leptonica and CCs e.g., 
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=pixConnComp
 @mlissner
You could also look at the preprocessing workflow used by pdf sandwich 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfsandwich/
 Lots of responses here, so let me try to respond to as many as I can.

@amitdo and @jbreiden:

I considered using `-sDEVICE=tiffg4` over `-sDEVICE=tiffgray`, but it's not purely black and white, and like I said, the bigger files don't seem to affect performance. Here's a comparison of a gray part of the original PDF:

`tiffg4`:
![g4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/236970/18854007/4b98691c-83fd-11e6-9ef8-af26032e579c.png)

`tiffgray`:
![gray](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/236970/18854014/54c3f81c-83fd-11e6-9b79-b27dc815011b.png)

`tiffgray` is definitely better for this, and since we're doing millions of files, it seems safer to use this approach than to assume all docs are purely black and white (even though it makes big files).

But setting that aside, it seems like using `gs` is the wrong approach regardless. Seems like the right approach is to extract the images undisturbed. Seems doable, but I'll have to do some research on this. Is it documented anywhere which image formats Tesseract supports natively? There's [one question in StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10193001/whats-the-best-image-input-type-for-tesseract) that seems to address this, but otherwise I don't see a lot of guidance. I'm concerned that if we use the undisturbed images, we'll get weird image formats that Tesseract won't accept.

@jbreiden you also say:

> If necessary, adjust their header so that their resolution agrees with what the PDF was claiming.

This feels wrong to me. In my experience, PDFs are a terrible source of ground truth. I'd expect the header information in the images to be much more accurate than whatever a PDF was reporting. You've provided a lot of information here already, but can you explain why we'd prefer the PDF data over the image data? 

@vidiecan: I'll look into counting connected components. Seems like a great way to solve this, if it performs well enough. Thanks for this suggestion.

@Shreeshrii: I looked at PDF Sandwich, but didn't see anything useful. Do you know the code well enough to point me towards the image conversion part? 
 @jbreiden, do you know the image formats supported by Tesseract?
 > You might want to use -sCompression=lzw.

I just did some simple timings on this. 

The good:  
- Compressed Tiffs are about 1-2% the size of the uncompressed versions (in a test I just did, uncompressed was 137M while compressed was 1.8M!).
- Using compressed files used about 30% of the RAM (92MB instead of 301MB according to [`time -v`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/774556/peak-memory-usage-of-a-linux-unix-process)).
- LZW is a lossless format, so Tesseract generated identical results.
- It took Tesseract about the same amount of time to do either format.

The bad:  
- It takes about twice as long to generate compressed tiffs from PDFs (though this is only a fraction of the total time doing OCR).

The hmmm:  
- Making a compressed tiff moves the processing burden from disk (making a big file) to CPU (compressing a big file).

Our bottleneck on our OCR server is CPU, so it's actually preferable for us to generate big files that use less CPU than to make small files that don't. OTOH, RAM is expensive, so we'll probably be switching this out. Thanks for the suggestion!
 Jeff,

  Is it possible to find a roadmap/changelog for upcoming releases like 3.05 so the "public" can follow the development..

Personally I would really like some optimization.. The accuracy is quite good but the speed is really bad!
 Will 3.05 be based on LSTM?
 A roadmap would help planning development and inform users about future features which they can expect. I could not find one for 3.05, so I assume that there is no officially published roadmap. Maybe it would be a good idea to create one on the [Tesseract wiki](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki).
 LSTM release is going to be 4.0 as per zdenko since it is a major change.

I would request zdenko for a release/tag of repo before that for 3.05. A
change log for that could be created by summarizing the commit notes.

Some recent updates of interest to many users are...
Improvement for Windows versions
Availability of training tools on windows
Various bug fixes since 3.04.1
Etc

Ocropy (and clstm) does not use Tesseract. A VERY OLD version of Ocropus (0.4) did use Tesseract.
  A user reported to Homebrew in https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/4764 that the tesseract build was broken if built from the HEAD of master (currently a75ab450a8cc9a2b69cf05f5c4f7a39bc44cbacc) using the options

```
brew install tesseract --HEAD --with-opencl
```

which means that we pass `--enable-opencl` to `configure`.

I bisected the build failure and found that it's a regression caused by https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/b1c921b59e6af1e68fd026cbc30540929b818552

fixed the build. A "real" fix will be more involved of course, since I'm sure you don't want to break Cygwin again.

  The existing C API for `TessBaseAPIDetectOS` requires a C caller to successfully allocate `struct OSResults` which is actually a C++ class. If the C++ compiler decides to append anything to the structure, this will fail. The definition of this struct also depends on `kMaxNumberOfScripts` so is subject to change if (when) Tesseract adds more scripts.

The struct members that a caller is most likely to want are actually in `OSBestResult` whose position may shift.

I suggest deprecating this API and providing one that returns the member elements of `OSBestResult` instead. I think it would be useful to have a C API call to obtain this information rather than parsing the executable's output in `-psm 0`. Here's one possible API.

``` C
BOOL TessBaseAPIDetectOS2(
 TessBaseAPI* handle, 
 int* best_script_id, 
 int* best_orientation_id, 
 float* script_confidence, 
 float* orientation_confidence);
```

Returning `OSBestResults` is also an option, but sometimes it's nice to avoid structs entirely.

I can contribute changes if there's agreement on them.

  Are there any plans for creating ALTO support in tesseract? I was thinking about programming a module for it. I was searching some conversion tool but found nothing working. I need it to be working in linux terminal, I found just conversion tool from hOCR to ALTO but the output is wrong. It would be also better if tesseract would generate ALTO. 
 Did you try https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/ocr-fileformat?
 Yes I have and the generated ALTO isn't valid. It can't be imported to the software I use and also the validator ocr-validate says it's not valid.
 Could you please [create an issue for that project](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/ocr-fileformat/issues) then and add more details about the problems which you encountered?

  Hi,
I'm following the instruction for Windows from: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling
I have cloned the master branch today, copied cppan and installed cmake 3.6.1 for Windows.
cppan runs without issues.
Then I run cmake and it goes with multiple errors. Log attached.
VC 2015 solution file is not created.
Any clues?

[CMake_outputs.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/455681/CMake_outputs.zip)
 Thanks for comment, I'll check with cppan upgrade later today.
I assumed the successful output of cmake should generate VS solution. I couldn't find any .sln file in the build directory. Should it be there, or somewhere else?
 Ok, so let's clarify: yes, I follow these instructions. I clone the tesseract repo. Build directory doesn't exist and I create it as described in the instruction. Inside build dir, I run cmake, and it finishes with errors. Logs were attached. Solution (.sln) file is not created. I will double check it later today (don't have access to my dev machine now) but I'm really quite confident it hasn't been created.
 Double checked, the .sln file is not created in the build dir.
Note, the cmake run is full of this kind of errors:

Any clue? I have zero experience with cppan and cmake, so no idea how to attempt to resolve it.
 Tried that, didn't help.
 I was unable to get all log into a single file.
I've once again deleted whole content of C:/Users/jarek/.cppan and removed the build directory in tesseract folder.
run cppan again, log attached and then run cmake again, with redirect to cmake.log, also attached, but some errors got printed to the console anyway (they're not present in log or in CMakeError.log file. All console dump is in the cmd.log.

Well, thanks for trying. I'm now trying to use just binaries from here: 
https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/tree/master/src/lib/TesseractOcr/x64
not trivial either as there are no .lib files and need to match .h files to these binaries, but I'm still trying :)
 I think I'm quite close to make it run with binaries above, but if not lucky, I'll try the method above. Any hints on how to this sample from visual studio?
 Heh, as you wrote it, I've just made libtesseract load into my VS project.
Created lib from dll, completed api .h files with all the scattered dependencies and made it load, init and ... fail to recognize my bitmap :) But it works from command line with tesseract.exe, so just something wrong with params i'm passing. I'm not using leptonica. instead trying to ocr a screenshot that I have in memory in BMP format... but we're going off topic here.

Thanks much for all your help!!!

 I just sent pull request #415 which fixes this issue.
  Follow the latest compilation guide for windows platform faces VS compile error:

“allheaders.h”: No such file or directory

This error actually comes from CMakeLists.txt:

```
if (NOT USES_CPPAN)
    target_link_libraries       (tesseract ${Leptonica_LIBRARIES})
    export(TARGETS tesseract FILE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/TesseractTargets.cmake)
else()
    target_link_libraries       (tesseract cppan)
    file(WRITE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/TesseractTargets.cmake "include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/cppan.cmake)\n")
    export(TARGETS tesseract APPEND FILE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/TesseractTargets.cmake)
endif()
```

Here `USES_CPPAN` is undefined, and the if statement is always True. Since Leptonica is loaded from CPPAN, and `target_link_libraries(tesseract cppan)` is never excuted, error happens!

After modify the codes above into

```
target_link_libraries       (tesseract cppan)
file(WRITE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/TesseractTargets.cmake "include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/cppan.cmake)\n")
export(TARGETS tesseract APPEND FILE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/TesseractTargets.cmake)
```

VS builds tesseract305.dll successfully.

`USES_CPPAN` needs definition!

  Hi,

My Android app is still using an older version of tess two library, which was based on tesseract 3.02. Last time it used to work because it uses trained data for version 3.02, but since tesseract has moved to github seems like we could only download the latest version of trained data now. 

I tested with english and several european languages trained data and it works perfectly fine, however when I try Arabic, Japanese and Chinese the app crashes straightaway upon tesseract init.

My questions are, is the latest trained data in github only works with latest 3.05 version of tesseract? If so, is there a way to download the older versions of trained data? If not what could be the problem for the crash?

Thanks!
 Thanks for the quick response! Cheers
 i have the same question,i will try~~~
  Font names in Java and .NET platforms:

http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0261__2D-Graphics/Togetallavailablefontsinyoursystem.htm
http://www.java2s.com/Code/CSharp/GUI-Windows-Form/Getallsysteminstalledfont.htm
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0yf5t4e8.aspx
 I'm afraid that there will be user complains again and again as long as there is that trailing comma. So in the long run it will be worth fixing the issue. To help solving the issue, I started to look at other software using pango, e.g.
https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/595432
 Can anyone discern a pattern for these comma additions? I'm trying to compose the fontname after the user selected a font from a font dialog (part of an UI) and then pass it to text2image, but there's no consistent pattern that Pango would base on in adding the commas.

As a result of incorrectly composed fontnames, there were a lot of "Could not find font named..." errors. It would be much simpler if there were no commas at all.

Update: I came up with a simple workaround: If it failed with a san-comma fontname, I'd try again with the comma added.
  Hi, When I use VS to compile the following error

  A haystack which is shorter than the needle resulted in negative value
for length_haystack which was forced to a very large unsigned value.

The resulting buffer overflow while reading the haystack would crash
text2image when it was called with a short font name.

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil sw@weilnetz.de
 It's nearly identical to my implementation. Instead of

```
length_haystack = length_haystack - length_needle + 1;
for (i = 0; i < length_haystack; i++)
```

I used the shorter

```
length_haystack -= length_needle;
for (i = 0; i <= length_haystack; i++)
```

 @Shreeshrii it works! thanks bro! :+1:  taken from **autoreconf** man page
`By default, it only remakes those files that are older than their sources.`

@zdenop It's fine! :-)

Should this "autoreconf -ivf" add to wiki?
Thanks!
 Just add some notes. The problem still exist until we should also install the pango lib dev (apt-get install libcogl-pango-dev). I thought it confuses as described on Wiki (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling), while it's not necessary to install (lib pango dev) if we're not plan to install training tools.

Has anyone tried this? Does it work?
 I can tell you that in the Tesseract forum many users ask about these files. They are disappointed that there is no effect on accuracy when using them with their input.

The input is usually not a document but something like receipt, passport, car license plate, with a small set of known words/patterns. In addition to the cases mentioned by Amit, there are users who would like
to use the user_words dictionary in addition to Tesseract's wordlist,

1. Teseract firstly have to process whole image anyway. We can not do anything to this. 
2. Then they process pattern by their code (i assumed it is bad). We bypass this step

  The implementation for MS C did not pass the variable arguments to
tprintf.

The standard is supported since C99 / C++11, so one implementation
is sufficient.

 VS2010 should work with the new code, see the [Microsoft documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177415%28v=vs.100%29.aspx). Please note also that the old code already used C99 / C++11 standard for all Microsoft compilers and also for Windows gcc versions which set `_MSC_VER`, but that it was buggy for all those compilers because it did not pass the variable arguments. The patch fixes this bug for Microsoft compilers.
The patch changes the situation regarding compatibility for really old compilers (neither gcc, clang, msc which all support variadic macros since a long time). I think that is only a theoretical issue and that such compilers would fail compiling Tesseract anyway.
`opencl/oclkernels.h` already contains a variadic macro using `__VA_ARGS__`.
 gcc-3.1.1 already supported the variadic macro syntax used in my patch, see the [online documentation](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.1.1/cpp/Variadic-Macros.html#Variadic%20Macros). It was released in [2002](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.1/).

[Ref: Issue 396](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/396)
 I noticed that the crash is a "feature", caused by an assertion if `langdata/san.training_text` does not exist. Tesseract forces a SIGSEGV for assertions to improve debug information.

IMHO missing data is a typical user error which should be reported, but not throw an assertion. So replacing the assertion by a conditional `tprintf(...); exit(1);` in `training/fileio.cpp` might be the correct solution. If you agree, I'll send a pull request.
 FYI, in my testing on Windows 10, the crash was unrelated to 'langdata/san.training_text does not exist' since the file was very much there.

I will test further after new windows binary is made available with all these new patches.

Thanks for looking into this.
 @amitdo, thanks for the pointers. PR #402 now does something similar for `fileio`.
  See guys.. I badly need Text2image.exe but i cannot find it anywhere.
Is there any great soul in this world who will take the time to compile that 1 thing and upload it to mediafire or something?
This one thing has consumed 5 months of my life :'-(
I tried to compile it on windows 32 bit but it gave 100+ errors :'-(
Dear c/cpp experts.. Instead of telling everybody how to compile, isn't it a good idea to directly provide a compiled version?
I am not any intelligent software eng. I am just a normal human being.
Why didn't the developers take some time to upload the compiled binaries? :'-(
Somebody please help!
I now feel pain in my heart for wasting 5 months of my life for 1 program.
Somebody please compile 'Text2Image.cpp' for the needy who don't know how to do it.

P.S I have downloaded Tesseract 3.05 but there does not exist any 'text2image.EXE' :'-(
 - This is not the right place for asking questions. Did you read the [FAQ](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/FAQ)?
- You might try the installer from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki.
 I have tried this before. Even if you get a binary of text2image for
Windows say with cygwin or msys2 it will crash when u run it. There are
some incompatibilities with the code and windows. Just accept that it is
not available on Windows.

As Quan has suggested you can use jtessboxeditor for generating the box
tiff pairs and training.

Or get access to a linux machine.

 @Shreeshrii, there is a new installer on  https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki. It includes fixes for text2image.exe. If that binary still crashes, I need all information to reproduce the crash.

 @stweil Thank you for providing the updated binary for text2image - many problems have indeed been fixed since I last looked at it. Thanks to the developers. 

However, it crashed under two situations today.
1. when using font Arial, I tried with eng, ara and san - not sure what causes this, as when font is not found an error is displayed.

`text2image --fonts_dir= --text ./langdata/ara.training_text --font Arial --outputbase ara.Arial.exp0`
1. when trying to find fonts and create images for a particular text - 

`text2image --fonts_dir= --text ./langdata/san.training_text --outputbase san.exp-1 --ptsize=32 --strip_unrenderable_words --fontconfig_refresh_config_file=false --leading=32 --char_spacing=0.0 --exposure=-1 --find_fonts --min_coverage=.9 --degrade_image=1 --underline_start_prob=.05 --underline_continuation_prob=.01`

I will test further and post more feedback later.
 Here is a copy of the terminal log with all commands I tried and their output.
[testlog1.txt](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/441149/testlog1.txt)
 The following command is creating the box-tiff pairs with degradation as well as differnt exposure levels as indicated ..

`text2image --fonts_dir= --text ./langdata/san.training_text  --ptsize=32 --degrade_image=1 --leading=32 --char_spacing=0.0  --strip_unrenderable_words --underline_start_prob=.05 --underline_continuation_prob=.01 --font Kokila  --outputbase san.Kokila.exp-1 --exposure=-1`

I have done this testing on Windows 10.
 [san.Kokila.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/441153/san.Kokila.zip)
 I tried the latest version of the program uploaded today on Windows10 and found that it now works but is unstable. It would fail for Arial font and could not find Times New Roman (the two fonts are most commonly used). The boxes in the generated box file were not as tight as they could be.

The previous command does not work because CMD on Windows does not handle `'MS Serif Bold'` like a POSIX shell. It passes `'MS` as font. Using `"MS Serif Bold"` should fix that.

> Could not find font named Times New Roman.Please correct --font arg.

It looks like this error messages can be improved by a line break after the first sentence. I'll send a PR which fixes this small detail.

> text2image --fonts_dir= --text ./langdata/san.training_text --outputbase san.exp-1 --ptsize=32 --strip_unrenderable_words --fontconfig_refresh_config_file=false --leading=32 --char_spacing=0.0 --exposure=-1 --find_fonts --min_coverage=.9 --degrade_image=1 --underline_start_prob=.05 --underline_continuation_prob=.01

That command also crashes with SIGSEGV on Linux. This is a bug which needs a fix.
 If you want to compile text2image for windows using VS2015, you can have a look at a fully automated process at
https://github.com/mazoea/te-external-tesseract
using the windows CI environment (appveyor.yml).

It might take a you a while to get the grasp of it (hopefully, hours not months) but you will get your text2image version that you can debug (and send PRs to tesseract).

More details:
1. all the external dependencies are at https://github.com/mazoea/te-external
2. read the Readme to understand the structure used throughout the process
3. see https://github.com/mazoea/te-external/blob/master/appveyor.yml for the real commands and also check the logs by clicking on the build badge in the repository
4. the same goes for https://github.com/mazoea/te-external-leptonica
5. the same goes for https://github.com/mazoea/te-external-tesseract
6. binaries will be in tesseract\projects\output
7. look at #381 

_BUT_
Those repositories are not forks of others, in case they do not have the latest version, you have to update it.  In practice, this means you should checkout tesseract and merge it with latest if not present - for the moment, there should be only a few of them!

Finally, do not expect a bulletproof text2image even after patching - more needs to be done to address several corner cases but you have everything needed for this mission.
 @stweil The problem with font not found message was not just of misplaced period. These fonts are there on Windows but text2image is NOT finding them.

Ok, the above shows that Time New Roman also has a , at end of font name. So I tried with that, and results differ based on order in which the parameters are given etc . eg. --fonts_dir= should be given first .

`Unable to open '/tmp/fonts.conf' for writing`
seems to be related to the default directory being non-writable under windows.

Setting 'FC_CACHEDIR = c:/your/writable/directory' may help.

or

use "LOCAL_APPDATA_FONTCONFIG_CACHE"  location for the cachedir, 

ref: https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/1196373
 @zdenop OK

Please see my previous comment, in that I have used 
`--fonts_dir=C:\Windows\Fonts`
It still crashes when fontname Arial or "Arial" is used - on windows10.
 @zdenop 

On Windows10, I get the `FcInitiReinitialize failed!!` error when I use `--fonts_dir=C:\Windows\Fonts` which does not come when I use `--fonts_dir=`

 On further investigation, I see that https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/training/pango_font_info.cpp overrides system and fontconfig defaults ..

```
STRING_PARAM_FLAG(fonts_dir, "/auto/ocr-data/tesstraining/fonts",
                  "Overrides system default font location");
STRING_PARAM_FLAG(fontconfig_tmpdir, "/tmp",
                  "Overrides fontconfig default temporary dir");
```

The `FcInitiReinitialize failed!!` error when using `--fonts_dir=C:\Windows\Fonts` disappears when specifying `fontconfig_tmpdir` in commandline. 

When used the first time, it creates `fonts.conf` and a cache file in the specified directory which takes some time. After that, there is no delay in building cache.

```
C:\Users\User\Documents\shree>text2image --fonts_dir=C:\Windows\Fonts --fontconfig_tmpdir=C:\Users\User\Documents\shree --text ./langdata/san.training_text  --outputbase

```
 As of now, the two errors still unexplained with text2image under Windows are 
1. Use of Arial font
2. Use of --find_fonts

@zdenop I can test and report errors to Pango/FOntConfig, but tesseract does not provide any error info that I can refer to.
 I'm currently working on the problem with Arial. That font is found (otherwise there would be an error message), but results in SIGSEGV - maybe from an assertion. It looks like Windows buffers console messages and fails to print them before raising the SIGSEGV.
 Thanks, Stefan.

 The crash with Arial is caused by a bug in function strcasestr (locally implemented only for Windows, Linux uses the correct GLIBC implementation). Any short font name (5 characters or less) will result in a similar crash. I'll send a pull request which fixes this.
 PR #406 fixes the problem with Arial (and other fonts with short names) for text2image on Windows.
 Problem 2 (use of --find_fonts) is also caused by the buggy strcasestr function and fixed by PR #406:

 The latest version has fixed the issue with Arial font. Thank you.

@amitdo Almost all the generated boxes (created in Windows 10) are consistently a bit low and a bit wide. It was reported that having tightly fitted boxes would improve the quality of the generated traineddata file.

 @stweil 

Thank you for the changes to get text2image working on windows and for making the latest version available via installer at https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

I have added a link to the same from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki so that it is easily accessible.
  Hello, everyone.

I have been developing text detecting APP with tesseract.

I have found weird issue that tesseract could not detect large texts on image.

Here is the original image:
http://i67.tinypic.com/23ur420.jpg

When I apply tesseract to this image, I get some text like this:

```
GETUNTUPUF

BUBBLE.

BEFORE YOUR
COMPETITION
DUES
```

(NOTE: it does not matter to detect text correctly or not, I am just interested whether tesseract detects text or not.)

Here is the image I had detect text area from the original image.
http://i67.tinypic.com/qovfj9.png

Unfortunately when I apply tesseract to this image, I have got no text at all.

Any idea?
  I am using 3.04 tesseract ocr. Running command line like below gives me better result compared to programmatically calling the api.
"tesseract Page_00001_IP.tif Page_00001_IP -l eng -psm 4"

The api is called as follows.
                        var inputName = Path.GetFileName(imageFile).Replace(Path.GetExtension(imageFile), "");
                        using (var page = engine.Process(img, inputName, PageSegMode.SingleColumn))
                        {
                            text = page.GetText();
                        }
I have created the .uzn file same name as the image file. It contains regions specifying Left, Top, Width and Height. I appreciate any help to resolve this.

Thanks,
Ravi

 what is the cause  of this error?
 Lol, check out this link https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/tesseract-ocr/JZ9G3D5HHNM/A--DXmm2BgAJ  i am using https://github.com/tmbdev/clstm
and https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy to train some rnn based model ,is there any way  to load such models in Tesseract?
 @amido  thx any way, i notice you working on both projects then came this question 
 @amitdo my fault~
  I'm using the tess-two which is a fork of this repo made use in android projects. Since the latest version, the progress notifier for the word recognition no longer works (it stays at 0% then jumps to 100% when the OCR is done)
  I've managed to make Tesseract OCR work with plain text but i need to make this OCR work with seven segments led displays on an Android Studio project.

I've really tried to dug internet for it but couldn't find useful information about this one. If anyone worked on a similar project I'm desperate for your help. Please.

Thanks from now.

 i think as @ebogaard pointed out this issue and [sumatrapdf #544](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/544) are very closely related to tesseract #373, which is more than just a pdf renderer issue. a lot of the pdfs referenced in that issue open correctly in adobe but not in other pdf renderers.

would be great to have the pdfs generated by tesseract render correctly in pdf.js

1. At the moment, text2image expects `fc` backend e.g,:
   https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/ba2ea39caaa791b5e5f092953057cb8ffb094a82/training/pango_font_info.cpp#L356
   but if pango is compiled with win32 support, you get the win32 font map first

```
#if defined(HAVE_CAIRO_WIN32)
  if (!backend || 0 == strcmp (backend, "win32"))
    return g_object_new (PANGO_TYPE_CAIRO_WIN32_FONT_MAP, NULL);
#endif
#if defined(HAVE_CAIRO_FREETYPE)
  if (!backend || 0 == strcmp (backend, "fc")
           || 0 == strcmp (backend, "fontconfig"))
    return g_object_new (PANGO_TYPE_CAIRO_FC_FONT_MAP, NULL);
#endif 
```

and nasty crashes follow because of the wrong reinterpret cast.

Fast Solution: specify `fc` backend
Solution: a simple patch will follow that fixes the behaviour for, at least, the most important functionality.
1. If fontconfig is linked as dll, putenv does not get propagated to fontconfig
   https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/ba2ea39caaa791b5e5f092953057cb8ffb094a82/training/pango_font_info.cpp#L151

Solution: specify it as environmental variable
1. You cannot use disk paths (e.g., c:) in `FONTCONFIG_PATH` because fontconfig strips slashes from path (FcStrCanonAbsoluteFilename) and then uses 

```
GetFullPathNameW (dirname, 0, NULL, NULL)
```

without the slash and that function, interestingly, behaves like this

```
a file name begins with only a disk designator but not the backslash after the colon, it is interpreted as a relative path to the current directory on the drive with the specified letter.
```

Solution: specify a sane directory
 I think this issue should be reopened.
 He fixed number (1) in his list in one place in the code. That piece of code did cause a crash on Windows+VS, MinGW(64) and Mac.
There is another similar piece of code that will probably cause a crash in some situation on all these platforms.
I suggested a solution above, but it useless to test it on Linux.
 Here is the problematic line:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/182ca5bc1e/training/pango_font_info.cpp#L367

You need to use `text2image` with the flag `only_extract_font_properties` to trigger the function in which this code lives. 
 The dotted\_circle changes in #381 caused problems (in Linux at least).

  Hi,

I was able to successfully train tessdata today after many issues and i would like to suggest some changes that can be added to the training guide
1. the command : unicharset_extractor lang.fontname.exp0.box lang.fontname.exp1.box ... didn't work the first tim.Hence, i have to prefix training/ to make it work.
2. the command: mftraining -F font_properties -U unicharset -O lang.unicharset lang.fontname.exp0.tr lang.fontname.exp1.tr ...
   needs to be corrected to add suffix .txt to font_properties to make it work 
3. In the command: training/set_unicharset_properties -U input_unicharset -O output_unicharset --script_dir=training/langdata

The output is generated to output_unicharset.This output_unicharset should be given as input to the mftraining command. i.e instead of -U unicharset one should give -U output_unicharset

Thank you 
 yes in the unicharset extractor command, two files are generated: unicharset and output_unicharset. I tried with output_unicharset and generated eng.unicharset.I copied the all the files to the tessdata folder to recognize text. It is throwing an error stating unichar in normproto is not in unicharset. Then i used the file named  unicharset, it ran without error. So, i understand is output_unicharset and unicharset works with mftraining but the eng.unicharset generated from mftraining does not work with tesseract but unicharset works.
 Those are the first commands which have to be executed before i can use training. I did that and tried and it throwed me error.It is similar to other commands such training/text2image,training/set_unicharset_properties etc, this has to be prefixed with training/
  I try to use tesseract to directly generate pdfs with an ocr'ed text layer. This is one step of several how pdfsandwich creates searchable pdfs.

The result of the tesseract-subprocess, is a pdf with an image and a text layer and is perfectly searchable.
Probably due to the high resolution input the dimensions of the resulting pdf are very large, which pdfsandwich solves by resizing the pages to more reasonable dimensions.

After this resize, when I open this file in, for example, Acrobat Reader DC, all recognized text is separated by extra spaces. So when it used to read 'hello', now it reads 'h e l l o'. So when you search for hello, the text isn't found.
A more technical explanation about this problem is in this thread: http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=696116

I thought I had a work around for this, by specifying a smaller DW than the default 500:

```

                "endobj\n",
                5L,         // CIDToGIDMap
```

This solves the issue in Acrobat reader.
But when I put this file in Alfresco DMS, which uses [PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) 1.8.4, I get the same problem again: I can only find words when I put spaces between the characters.

Setting the DW to a number smaller than 250 compromizes the text in the ocr'ed layer, so that's no option.

Is there any way to change the font type to a proper width, so most pdf-tools can properly read the text?
 Funny thing: Alfresco uses pdf.js as pdf viewer, and the search in pdf,js is actually working. Meaning: pdf.js doesn't put extra spaces between the characters.

2.pdf doesn't show the problems in both pdf.js and when the text is extracted with pdfbox.

So to summarize:
1. By default, there are extra spaces when converting or extracting text from pdfs generated by tesseract.
2. I found a reasonable workaround by decreasing the '/DW' from 500 to 250. Because of this, the text isn't overlayed perfectly, but that is something I can live with for now.
3. After this change, searching and copying/extracting text works for Acrobat Reader DC, ghostscript and pdf.js, but not for pdbfox.

See attached pdf, which displays those problems: [test-out-git.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/373160/test-out-git.zip)
 Is there any roadmap for this rewritten (as I understand) pdf generation?
 Note to other people running into this problem with pdfsandwich and ending up here, suspecting Tesseract: **This is actually a problem with Ghostscript.** pdfsandwich converts the images to PPM, hands those to Tesseract and since those files are missing resolution/DPI information, Tesseract outputs a huge PDF (0,9 by 1,20 metres for A4) but with correct text (i.e. without spaces between letters). Then, pdfsandwich runs this PDF through Ghostscript to resize it back to A4 and this step is what actually messes up the words.

The author of pdfsandwich has a [pre-release version 0.1.5](https://sourceforge.net/p/pdfsandwich/bugs/10/#73bd/3894) which now uses TIF images instead of PPM. And those contain resolution information, so the PDF Tesseract spits out is already in the correct format.

(Side note: Tesseract seems to ignore resolution information from PNG files.)
 Back to the spaces thing, I'd appreciate a retest once Tesseract pdf.ttf font matches the 
following checksum. (It currently does not.)

$ md5sum pdf.ttf
e436074b54ed9cc5bf4789f79059b01b pdf.ttf Tried to re-test this, but got the following error when running pdfsandwich + tesseract.
This is with a just-checked out and compiled tesseract-3.05-branch:

Same problem. Same error, I'm afraid.

Might that have something to do with it? https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/tree/3.04.00 Okay, that was a bit silly on my end.

tesseract v3.05
ubuntu v15

I've created the .box and .tr files and i am in the step of mftraining. Since the number of  .tr files are large,i performed a ls command,stored the result to a variable and gave the variable to the mftraining command as shown in the screenshot.Then i executed the .sh file in the terminal and i got an error stating illegal malloc request size as shown in the screenshot.

As shown in the screenshot, the error seems to point to the program globalloc.cpp.

Is there a limit on the number of .tr files i can give as input?

search forum and google for the error and possible solutions
 The error in the link is different from mine. I've followed the guide and i've given -O eng.unicharset properly. The difference in my case is multiple .tr files
 No actually the problem was with the unicharset file.Because there were number of unicharset files such as unicharset,eng.unicharset,output_unicharset, it was unknown which one to use. Hence, i started again from the first and used the other file and it worked.I was able to create the eng.trainedata successfully.
 The total count of fonts i gave was 70
 I am not sure.This is what i am getting

 No this is from a c++ program. The output from command line is a file named output with a black blank page.So, your saying there is a implicit limit 64 in tesseract is it?
 oh ok thank you 
  I'm getting a segmentation fault nomatter what image I'm trying to read in. Unfortunatly I'm getting very little info on this.
I have tried with multiple images and sizes and is always getting segfaults, on the other hand reading the same image is not a problem.
It is definitely a problem that you are getting so little information on this matter.

I got the tesseract working, I manually compiled the 3.04.01 from git, I see its in the gentoo repo now that nice too.
In the end I found an old bug in our program that had created some bad file ending bytes that did not show up in gedit.
The reason for this is my system actually finds the text on its own first, but the algorithm is very slow, but very strong, and almost always finds the right letters since it's actually a modified robot pathfinder algorithm. So the system is writing the training files for tess and then we use tess for high speed ocr.

Anyways thanks for your help
  please， the digital accuracy rate is ok，about 90%， how to train can improve the digital accuracy rate（30%）？thank you！
  Hi,
I just found out it can not read from a file having transparent background!

See yourself!
When I use the png with transparent background, it fails.
Using the same JPG file, it runs beautifully.
  I am asking why there is not specific ./configure variable for the location of the language data (i.e. what can be also done with TESSDATA_PREFIX environment variable).

What I suggest is a possibility to hardcode the path the language data while compiling tesseract-
 @zdenop do you mean, TESSDATA_PREFIX follows the optional datadir option ?
 @jbreiden just as an proposal to add a comment in the `configure --help` that datarootdir must contain the /tessdata directory unless this is defined by the TESSDATA_PREFIX

Current --help shows:

```
  --datarootdir=DIR     read-only arch.-independent data root [PREFIX/share]
  --datadir=DIR         read-only architecture-independent data [DATAROOTDIR]
```
 @Wikinaut, Tesseract for Windows uses a different method to find `tessdata`. A fixed TESSDATA_PREFIX would not work on Windows, because there is no fixed installation path.
 @jbreiden wrote
> There is. Debian uses -DTESSDATA_PREFIX=/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/

just for the record:

On my debian 8 system, configured with `./configure --enable-debug` only, tesseract wants to have the language files in 
`/usr/local/share/tessdata`
  Showing them in a window (default) is not acceptable for a console
application like Tesseract which must be able to work in batch mode.

 All precompiled TIFF libraries for Windows which I know (e .g. the mingw64-i686-tiff which is part of cygwin) don't define TIF_PLATFORM_CONSOLE.

I don't think that it would be a good idea to require using a special TIFF library for Tesseract.

So yes, in theory your suggestion is an alternative solution, but it is not feasible in practice.
 Some additional notes on the problem which is addressed by this PR:

It looks like many TIFF files (nearly all?) include some vendor specific data which trigger warnings from libtiff, so it is a real and very common problem for Windows users who want to do batch processing. I see these alternatives to handle the problem:
1. Change libtiff. Instead of defaulting to a message window for all warnings, it could do so for GUI applications but use stderr for console applications.
2. Change leptonica. It could offer an interface for setting the handler for warnings, and tesseract could use that interface to set the handler.  Or leptonica could set a reasonable default for GUI / console applications.
3. Change tesseract. That's what I did in my PR.

IMHO in the long run the first alternative would be the best solution, but i see no chance to get it quickly.
 @egorpugin, I added a commit which handles the libtiff dependency, so the code will not break if tiffio.h is unavailable.
 HAVE_TIFFIO_H is set by the current tesseract code – both by configure and by cmake (I tested both variants before adding the last commit). 
 Alternative 1 (see my comments from yesterday) is addressed by this libtiff issue: http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2571.

I don't expect that a libtiff version with that modification will be available soon.
 This is the only place we use libtiff directly now.

Can we move it to Leptonica?

Dan recently added a [handler](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/commit/d42a51d29eb8bd086ddee83dd12bab95a9b68238) which suppresses TIFF warnings completely. So we have to wait for a new Leptonica release. 1.72.2 is here, so we may able to drop this code soon.

We need to wait to an update of Mingw-w64's Leptonica PKGBUILD.

Egor will probably update cppan very soon.
  tesseract 3.05.00dev

Hi,

I am following the training tesseract and i created font_properties text file with input as

BradleyHandBold 0 1 0 0 0

and tried to use it with mftraining and i got the error
no shape table file present
failed to load font_properties from font_properties

Since i am doing the training for english language,i skipped shapeclustering step but i thought i have to go back to that step since mftraining is asking for shape table,i executed that code and it throwed error
failed to load font_properties from font_properties

Can someone please help me with this issue?
Thank you 
 Ok thanks...but i am not getting replies in the google group.This is a simple work of creating a txt file with fontname and 5 spaced 1 or 0. I don't understand why this doesn't work.
  Hi,

I am getting the below error in the tesseract training process

unicharset_extractor:symbol lookup error:unicharset_extractor:undefined symbol: _ZNK10UNICHARSET12save_to_fileEP8_IO_FILE

Can someone please help me with this issue?
 ubuntu version 15
tesseract version 3.03
i just gave the command 

unicharset_extractor eng.Arial.exp0.box 

as mentioned in the guide
 I installed ubuntu only yesterday on my virtual machine just to work on tesseract.I downloaded tesseract from Github and built from source according to the instructions on Github.
 Ok i removed tesseract and rebuilt it from source.It's working now thanks
  When running tesseract as root like this:

`tesseract in.tiff out  -l nld+eng pdf`

The output is a proper and functioning pdf.
When I run the same command as an unprivileged user, like this:

`sudo -u userx tesseract in.tiff out  -l nld+eng pdf`

The output is as follows:

```
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v3.05.00dev with Leptonica
Page 1
Error in fopenWriteStream: stream not opened
Error in pixWrite: stream not opened
Error in fopenReadStream: file not found
Error in extractG4DataFromFile: stream not opened to file
Error in l_generateG4Data: datacomp not extracted
Error in pixGenerateCIData: g4 data not made
Error in l_generateCIDataForPdf: file in.tiff format is 4; unreadable
Error during processing.
```

The unprivileged user has access to both the input and the output file.
Tesseract is compiled with the following options:

```
sudo -u userx tesseract -v
tesseract 3.05.00dev
 leptonica-1.73
  libjpeg 6b (libjpeg-turbo 1.2.90) : libpng 1.5.13 : libtiff 4.0.3 : zlib 1.2.7
```

The mentioned libs are available on the system.
The user has a normal account with shell: userxx:1001:1001::/home/userx:/bin/bash

When I let tesseract output to txt (so I don't use the 'pdf'-option), there is no error and a txt-file with recognized text is output. This works both for privileged and unprivileged users.
 Yeah, I found that out later as well. But I'm not sure where Tesseract stops and Leptonica begins ;-)

Previously I tried tiff and pbm as sources. Both gave the same errors; the only thing that changed then, was the one-before-last error: tiff gives a 'format is 4'- error while pbm gives a 'format is 11'-error.

Just tried it again: when I create a new source and make the type png it actually does work!
After converting this png to tiff, that does work as well, but converting to pbm (which is used by pdfsandwich, which I want to use) still gives the errors. I can open and view the bpm file without problems, though.

What do you make of this? Is this a problem with Tesseract, Leptonica, with the source file(s) or libraries?
 I'm afraid compiling, installing and then executing as userx doesn't improve the situation.
png and tiff are working, pbm still gives the same error:

```
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v3.05.00dev with Leptonica
Error in fopenWriteStream: stream not opened
Error in pixWrite: stream not opened
Error in fopenReadStream: file not found

Error in l_generateG4Data: datacomp not extracted
Error in pixGenerateCIData: g4 data not made
Error in l_generateCIDataForPdf: file test-source.pbm format is 11; unreadable
Error during processing.
```

I tried to make sure the pbm was converted right, so I used convert with and without the options '-compress none -depth 2'. Both files give the same problem.

See attached the source files

[test-source.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/368750/test-source.zip)
 Converted the png with pngtopam, but this time got a pgm (P5, 8 bits) instead of a pbm (P4, 2 bits).
And that actually does work!
When I use convert instead of pngtopam, to create a pgm, this also works.

So it seems the problem wasn't really with using an unprivileged user, it's a problem with pbm as a source filetype.

Should we probably close this issue and open another about that?
 Okay, fair enough. Let's dig deeper.
This is on Centos 7. I try to use pdfsandwich to OCR existing PDFs, which uses a combination of ImageMagick + unpaper + tesseract + Ghostcript.

As Centos doesn't provide all packages or ones that are recent enough, I compiled unpaper 6.1, leptonica 1.73 and tesseract 3.05dev from source.

What does work:
- png to pdf
- tiff to pdf
- pbm to pdf => only when root, not as a regular, unprivileged user
- pgm to pdf (works from the command line, but unpaper has a problem with this type, but that's another problem)

See attached sourcefiles:

[sources.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/369888/sources.zip)
 I can confirm the permissions on /tmp/lept are indeed the problem.
When I do 'chmod 777 /tmp/lept/' and then try again: the tesseract-operation works where it previously didn't.

You probably run into this problem if you run tesseract + leptonica as root first, then as another user.
 Thanks for the temporary patch.
I think this bug can be closed as it's really a leptonica problem, which is handled there.
 yes, I made some changes last week on the leptonica github head:

```
https://github.com/danbloomberg/leptonica
```

which I believe, together with the use of the new function l_makeTempFilename(), will resolve the issue for tesseract.  This function was also implemented for windows; it compiles but has not been tested further.

I haven't yet made a new release of leptonica.  That awaits some testing on windows.
  Hello, would it be possible to know what makes tesseract failing to recognize any characters in those images _(I tried many filters but tesseract fails in every cases)_ ? Is‑it because the anti‑aliasing is huge or because there’s no space between letters ?

thanks,
 Heh…  those are Captcha images – where the text has been distorted so 
that it is cannot be recognized by software like OCR.

The distortions are designed so that only a real human can read the text.

Tesseract will never be able to recognize this correctly.

  [StackOverflow query here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38165741/long-running-python-2-7-popen-processes-choice-between-resource-unavailability). Just thought I'd bring it up here as well, in case this is a `tesseract` issue and not a `subprocess.Popen` one.
  Hi there,
As everybody knows by now that the Cube engine is being discontinued and a new OCR engine based on LSTM will be introduced, even-though neither the Cube training tools or it's documentation been published.

One can only see that there is purposely neglect and sabotage to the  "RTL" Right to Left language community.
Hindering the developer community of training the Tesseract on RTL languages.

Issues such as that Tesseract while training considers all the letters and words as a single word, and the training is conducted as training a single word, along with many other issues while training RTL languages have been neglected for years and years, Tesseract showing no interest in solving any of the RTL languages issues.

And yet we ask Ray to publish the documentation and tools to train Cube before it is fully removed from tesseract, or at least assure the community that the RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew...) will be considered in future version releases of Tesseract and future tools will be published helping the developer community in the training process of RTL languages.

List of some issues in the RTL training:
1) Tesseract consider all words as a single 1 Word while training.
"Generated training data for 1 words"

2) Tesseract fail to add some letters while training.
 "APPLY_BOXES: boxfile line \* : FAILURE! Couldn't find a matching blob"

List of some issues in the RTL recognition:
3) Tesseract combines all the letters together while recognition.
4) Tesseract reverse the direction of the words while recognition.

Suggested solution for some of these problems:
2) The "box file" must be created with a criteria inwhich the boxes for each letter must not conjoin or merge with any other box, meaning that each box is an entity for a single glyph and does not have any part of it enter another box of another glyph.

3) Adding "ara.config" file in the folder you wish to train while modifiying it by setting "tessedit_ocr_engine_mode 0" instead of "1", or removing the entire line.
 but what about solving the issues?
 @christophered No one is hindered or attempting to sabotage RTL languages. Get over yourself. You can use and develop a fork of Tesseract 3.0 until the cows come home if you so choose.

The Arabic trained data is available in the tessdata repo, and if you want to submit patches to improve the LTSM engine for Arabic, you can. If not, that's fine, maybe someone else familiar with both the language and Tesseract will come around. In an open source community, you are not entitled to anything...if you want things fixed, submit patches -- you're already pretty close having already identified some problems. @ctrlcctrlv,

You replied to a 9-months old post.

Since then, LSTM code landed in the repo, and the OP opinion had changed.
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/630#issuecomment-271392038  The attached input file in1.pdf was generated by Tesseract 3.05.00dev. I modified it to extract only the first page using pdftk to reduce the size; results are unaffected by this. 

[in1.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/332804/in1.pdf)
[out1.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/332805/out1.pdf)

(The user who forwarded the file to me confirmed that it can be released publicly.)

The OCR text of in1.pdf begins as follows – no problems here:

```
JP. Morgan (Suisse) SA

Account n“ 7973101
Geneva, 3rd June 2016
```

The problem manifests after passing the file through Ghostscript 9.18 to refry the PDF, with no other changes...

```
gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -o out1.pdf in1.pdf
```

The OCR text is mangled by the insertion of spaces after each recognized letter, and line breaks after certain words (from `pdftotext`), and loss of spaces so that the word boundaries are gone "3rdJune2016". Normally one would pass some other parameters to Ghostscript such as PDF/A conversion, but regardless of parameters the OCR text is mangled.

When viewed in Acrobat XI, every other letter is highlighted. This text is unusable for searching.

I'd be happy to bring up with the Ghostscript people, but I have feeling that there's something unusual about how Tesseract generates OCR text in PDFs that causes Ghostscript to mishandle them, rather than the converse.

I tried discarding the OCR information, rasterize the PDF as an image, and then running OCR on the image again using tesseract 3.04.01 and the updated pdf.ttf ("sharp2.ttf"). Specifically I used

```
ocrmypdf -f --pdf-renderer tesseract in1.pdf out1_3.04.01.pdf
```

Pinging @jbreiden since you worked with me on the pdf.ttf issues...
 Reported to Ghostscript.
http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=696874

I tried deskewing the PDF (`ocrmypdf --deskew`) and that fixed the problem. You were able to replicate on an unskewed PDF? That's interesting....
 I found that Acrobat can work with Tesseract-produced PDFs without introducing issues in the OCR text, so it looks like the problem is definitely with Ghostscript/pdfwrite. (I tried using Acrobat for both convert to PDF/A and optimize.)
  Contrary to the comment, the destructor of the base class `GenericVector` calls `GenericVector::clear()`, which actually deletes `data_`, rendering `~DawgPositionVector()` redundant.
 ~~This patch looks wrong to me. @stweil please check it too.~~ @amitdo Why do you think this patch is wrong? @pnordhus

I'm sorry, I thought you were wrong by saying:
>Contrary to the comment, the destructor of the base class GenericVector calls GenericVector::clear(), which actually deletes data_, rendering ~DawgPositionVector() redundant.

But I now realize that you are right :smile:   I just tried to build with Cygwin (64 bit, tesseract + training) and had not problems with the unpatched code.

  Hi guys,

after downloading and manually compiling leptonica and tesseract, I see the following output
when trying to list the version-information of tesseract:

> [con-tom@lapp01awdtst tess_test]$ tesseract -v
> tesseract 3.04.00
>  leptonica-1.72
> 
> [con-tom@lapp01awdtst tess_test]$

Could this be related the following errors which I see when trying to ocr' a given TIFF oder PDF file:

Test 1:

>  tesseract eurotext.pdf test.txt --tessdata-dir /opt/tesseract/tesseract-CuBeInst/tessdata/ -l deu

Can I provide additional information? If yes, please let me know which information is needed.

Thx and best regards,

  In my OCR situation, Tesseract can not identify rows properly. Please see the attach box image below. (Blue squares are boxes found by Tesseract and red areas are marked as problematic area by me)

![qq 20160615195248](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3959938/16078734/118747c2-3333-11e6-890a-5eeaac13f217.png)

It seems that Tesseract is not able to find the baseline correctly when the row spacing is small and the image is a little skew --- two chars in two rows are mistakenly vertically merged. Therefore, the OCR quality in "crowded" space is really poor.

How could I imporve the OCR quality in this situation? Are there any params can be used here?
  When I try to create a box file, from the attached, I get the empty page error blow and the box file is empty. (attached file is zipped since gh doesn't accept tif files.)

I'm guessing that the problem is: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/a3ba11b030345d32829b1e8355afea5419978d82/textord/colfind.cpp#L380

is nailed to `false` and if it were possible to pass a command line arg `single_column` that would fix the problem.

When I finally successfully train something I'll see if I can cook up a pr....

  Trying to familiarize with the source code I came across  some discrepancies between the file names in the file header comments and the actual file names. Maybe it's pedantic but I thought having the correct names might facilitate reading the code especially when using printouts.

Some files don't appear to have file header comments and boilerplate license statements as recommended by the [Style guide for Google-originated open-source projects](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/cppguide.html#L4537), but I don't feel that I were in a position to supply this information. This pertains to the following files:

```
ccutil\ccutil.cpp
neural_networks\runtime\*.cpp
opencl\openclwrapper.cpp
textord\gap_map.cpp
textord\tospace.cpp
training\commandlineflags.cpp
training\set_unicharset_properties.cpp
viewer\svpaint.cpp
```
 Fixing the wrong or out-dated names is good. I suggest to remove all modifications which are not related to such names and then apply this PR. Even if the PR were applied as it is, it would improve the current situation.
 I think @theraysmith should say if he is OK with these changes.

 @jbreiden said something, but for some reason deleted his comment.  recognition hollow word 
how to configure,like this image:

  I follow these installation steps:
`./autogen.sh`
`./configure`
`make`
`make install`
I run `tesseract -v`, it works.
 then I run `tesseract pic.gif result`, I got that undefine symbol error. How to fix it?
  For front-ends to tesseract, the deliberate segfault [1] created when tesseract encounters a critical error is rather inconvenient, resp. makes it hard to keep the application alive ([2] works first time but fails to recover a second time). I'd like to propose replacing this with something from which applications can recover more easily, such as `raise(SIGABRT)`.

[1] https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/ccutil/errcode.cpp#L86
[2] https://github.com/manisandro/gImageReader/blob/0628f8c653169cb6bf53d51c6eb8921fcd5f66cb/gtk/src/Recognizer.cc#L171
 IMHO removing the deliberate null pointer access is a good thing. I cannot see why the SEGV would give a stack trace which is more useful than with ABRT (as it is written in the code comment).
 Because it appears that `abort()` terminates the program even if the signal is caught, as soon as the signal handler exits. See also [1] and example program below.

```
#include <csignal>
#include <iostream>

void signal_handler(int signal) {
        std::cout << "Caught signal " << signal << std::endl;
}

int main() {
        std::signal(SIGABRT, signal_handler);
        std::raise(SIGABRT);
//      abort();
        std::cout << "Program survived" << std::endl;
        return 0;
}
```

(Actually IMO the proper solution would be to allow applications to register an error handler to also make it easier to catch the error messages thrown.)

[1] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20212927/difference-between-raisesigabrt-and-abort-methods
 Is returning to the program which called `ERRCODE::error` a good idea? Or would a typical signal handler use `longjmp`? In this 2nd case, `abort()` would not abort.

And yes, support for user registered error handlers would be the better solution.
 @theraysmith, what's your take on that?  Placed ambigs problem in the mailing list but got no reply.  This I hope you can help.

Having trained tesseract in the Sinhala language we find we cannot get the 0 option in ambigs to work - no correction occurs even though the word is in the dictionary.

Please advise solution. 
  The other binaries simply didn't create a PDF.
But this one in fact does.

So, there's something wrong with the other VC builds.
Am Sa., Jun. 4, 2016 16:07 schrieb Egor Pugin : Ok, and how should I understand what is incorrect? Where is tesseract output, error message, anything?
 Entered this command, did some preparations and pdf is generated.
 Works for me.

 @amitdo: I didn't build any of these myself. I just followed download links and tried the various latest versions I found. Only thing I can say is that the mingW version worked, that the VC version from your link didn't and that the one from the link above works.
  When creating a PDF from a scanned image, the latest dev build creates a space after each character - leaving out the real spaces completely: Tested on windows with the latest dev build.

So scanning this:
**products according to the attached customerlist No.**

becomes this:
**p r o d u c t s a c c o r d i n g t o t h e a t t a c h e d c u s t o m e r l i s t N o .**
 Yes it's the cygwin version. The current VS Version does'nt create PDF versions for me at all.
The problem exists with all samples - no matter what examples I'm using.

Here are some of them:

 SumatraPDF. The viewer hasn't had any problems at all so far. And we're using it on several computers for years now including all our customers.
 You're right. I tested it in other PDF readers and there does not seem to be an obvious problem in the PDF itself. I report the problem to the developers of SumatraPDF instead.
 This I'll do :) Thanks
  The option is visible in the 2nd step of the merge process: first you select "Merge pull request", then you can change the kind of merge during the confirmation.
 Yes, it is not so nice.

Squashing can also be done in your local copy of the repository (`git rebase -i`, then update your pull request with `git push -f`). I personally prefer that variant as it avoids the problem with the GitHub user interface.
  This is not strictly necessary, but recommended in the GNU autoconf manual.
No [] was added to arguments like true or false.

 This PR addresses issue #100.
 Thanks, I added that one now, too.
  So I just discovered this project, but I plan on implementing this on a very low powered ("performance") microcontroller. 

Is 2 x 300 MHz 32bit with 1 megabyte ROM & 512 kilobyte RAM enough?
Could I squeeze it down even further. I'd need it to be real time too.

Any benchmarking or related projects I could look in to, thank you.
  How to build tesseract and training tools  3.04 in windows with VS2015? I have check leptonica, but it's only libtesseract.lib, I need the training tools too like a setup of Tesseract 3.02
  Location: file `ccutil/strngs.cpp`, method `STRING::add_str_double`

Because of a wrong value for `kMaxDoubleSize`, some small values are truncated by one byte.
Example: `-4.0382147e-006` has 16 bytes including the terminating null byte. But `kMaxDoubleSize` has value 15 and the number is truncated to `-4.0382147e-00`. As result, the number becomes way too large by a factor of 10<sup>6</sup>! (I had found such wrong values in `.tr` files inside the parameters for feature `mf`.)

Also the description for `kMaxDoubleSize` is wrong. The largest length for a formatted number with `%.8g` is `-1.2345678e-999<nul>`. The precision of format specifier `g` specifies the maximum number of significant digits. The length including the terminating null byte is 16 (eight digits, two signs, decimal marker, `e`, three exponent digits, null byte).
  Yes, the code is not consistent – sometimes it exits with 0, sometimes it exits with 1.

IMHO, missing arguments are an error condition, so a program should not exit with 0 (which means no error) in that case. 
 I personally use command lines with several arguments and an added `--help` quite often. This pattern is usually supported well. Examples: `ls -l --help`, cp -R --help`. 
  Is there any - approximate - expectation, when will the new LSTM backend for tesseract (presented [here](http://www.primaresearch.org/das2016/assets/DAS2016_Tutorial_Tesseract.pdf) )  be merged into master ? (or at least pushed public)

 oops.
This is what i get:

Any idea why? I ran `sudo port install tesseract-ara` on my mac
 I installed english too.
now runing:`tesseract --list-langs` return arabic and english.
still same error when runing `tesseract photo.jpeg out -l ara`
Any help?
 Hey, its now running but not working :(
This is output:

and i get an empty out.txt file
 I guess,
thanks
  Tesseract works fine with the original eng.traineddata but when i use my own it segfaults when running the standard:

`Done!`

I am trying to understand why or how and now that I have researched it for 1 week I think its the unicharset_extractor.

I went into the code of Tesseract and place some _print_ just after and just before the **_if_** checking if wctype is in the system and then went ahead and compiled it. When I executed it, all the prints before were there, but all the ones after were not there... So I think my system does not support wctype, but I am working on Ubuntu 15.10 on virtualbox so I don't understand because it says on the wiki that wctype is not supported is not supported only on older systems..... I made someone else try on another machine, but he had the same error.

 @amitdo YES!! IT WORKED! MONTHS OF STUDYING AND WORKING HARD, AND NOW ITS WORKING! IF I COULD KISS YOU, I WOULD!!! THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH!!!
 @amitdo lol, sorry, it was not only this problem. But I'm a student in an internship and this was very hard because I had never done c++ or any knowledge of AI or deep learning. Now this was the last step before I can get the result of all the hard work I did to train Tesseract and get results.
  How should I select an image and convert it into text?
  Hi,

I get some strange result when I try to train Tesseract.

Some part are very improved comparing to the default eng.tessdata, when some part are strangely added or modified, while the image quality is very good (24 become eat ???; uppercase letter become lowercase; some words are cut in two words; etc)

I think it may be cause by unicharset.

Indeed, when I try to generate a unicharset file with the following command :
`unicharset_extractor eng.palladio-regular.exp8.box`
I get an incomplete file. Here the result :

 > script_dir in set_unicharset_properties should point to a directory that contains a *.unicharset file. 

This is the case, the file I get from `unicharset_extractor` is used as input file by `set_unicharset_properties`.

> For English and other Latin based scripts, the file is Latin.unicharset.
> You can find the *.unicharset files here: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata

I have some questions:
1. If I follow the documentation, I should use the unicharset file generate by `unicharset_extractor`, because it is adapted to the chosen font. Isn’t it?
2. What if I use the latin.unicharset that do not match the xheight of the chosen font?
3. Why `set_unicharset_properties` still complain when I use latin.unicharset? See below the output:

Is it normal?

    Writing unicharset to file output_unicharset
```
 To follow up with #316 , I added the line 

/home/ggdhines/github/tesseract/training/set_unicharset_properties -U unicharset -O new_unicharset --script_dir=/home/ggdhines/github/langdata/Latin.unicharset

then new_unicharset looks like:

1 8 0,255,0,255,0,0,0,0,0,0 Common 3 2 3 1      # 1 [31 ]0
2 8 0,255,0,255,0,0,0,0,0,0 Common 4 2 4 2      # 2 [32 ]0
9 8 0,255,0,255,0,0,0,0,0,0 Common 5 2 5 9      # 9 [39 ]0

(Only trying for 3 characters right now). This looks better than before (no null values) but I'm still getting the error:
Bad properties for index 3, char 1: 0,255 0,255 0,0 0,0 0,0
(Repeated for each character.)

@ne0zer0 's questions are good ones.
 Also just realized that the example unicharset file in the Compute the Character Set of the official documents:
; 10 Common 46
b 3 Latin 59
W 5 Latin 40
7 8 Common 66
= 0 Common 93

appears to be out of date (I think that's Tesseract version 2)

Yes, you should read unicharset(5) doc:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/a3ba11b030345d32829b1e8355afea5419978d82/doc/unicharset.5.asc

And for `set_unicharset_properties`, where I can find file listing font xheights for all my desired fonts? (Adobe Jenson too)

```
set_unicharset_properties --help
USAGE: set_unicharset_properties
  --debug_level  Level of Trainer debugging  (type:int default:0)
  --load_images  Load images with tr files  (type:int default:0)
  --clusterconfig_min_samples_fraction  Min number of samples per proto as % of total  (type:double default:0.625)
  --clusterconfig_max_illegal  Max percentage of samples in a cluster which have more than 1 feature in that cluster  (type:double default:0.05)
  --clusterconfig_independence  Desired independence between dimensions  (type:double default:1)

  --script_dir  Directory name for input script unicharsets/xheights  (type:string default:)
  --configfile  File to load more configs from  (type:string default:)
  --D  Directory to write output files to  (type:string default:)
  --F  File listing font properties  (type:string default:font_properties)

  --output_trainer  File to write trainer to  (type:string default:)
  --test_ch  UTF8 test character string  (type:string default:)
```

Or a way to compute these xheights for every kind of fonts?

Maybe, it is a problem with wctype functions on systems? As I read on the documentation:

> If your system supports the wctype functions, t**hese values will be set automatically by unicharset_extractor and there is no need to edit the unicharset file**. On some very old systems (eg Windows 95), the unicharset file must be edited by hand to add these property description codes.
 thanks @amitdo for the help. I'm a little confused though as to why we need to use Latin.unicharset and Common.unicharset. Shouldn't we be teaching Tesseract new fonts based on the actual examples (and box files). Using some preexisting unicharset file makes it seem as if we're not actually training Tesseract on the new font

It is exactly what I do.

> Download these files:

Already done.

Done after reading your post addressed to ggdhines

> set_unicharset_properties --F font_properties -U unicharset -O output_unicharset --script_dir=/home/ne0zer0/langdata

What did and I wrote in the first post (current directory):

> When I try to fix it with with set_unicharset_properties:
> set_unicharset_properties --F font_properties -U unicharset -O output_unicharset --script_dir=/

where Common.unicharset is now put.

But if I put Latin.unicharset, what I get is not what is adapted for my fonts, 
xheights can change per fonts:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/master/Latin.xheights
So how can I be sure that this default value is correct for my all fonts???

As says ggdhines, according to the documentation, we have to compute the actual size of our fonts:

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/a3ba11b030345d32829b1e8355afea5419978d82/doc/unicharset.5.asc

> CAVEATS
> 
> Although the unicharset reader maintains the ability to read unicharsets of older formats and will assign default values to missing fields, the accuracy will be degraded.

What you suggest is likely to produce such degraded result. (what I seem to experiment)

Always for the above link:

> Further, most other data files are indexed by the unicharset file, so changing it without re-generating the others is likely to have dire consequences

So, as it is stated that "assign default values to missing fields, the accuracy will be degraded", and "is likely to have dire consequences", your proposition can not be accepted, because it lead to what I experiment if I do like you say: strange results.

Unless I did not understand anything, in which case, as I am not the only one, you have to review the documentation.

What I understood is: incomplete  v3.02 unicharset format file (like what I get) will result, infine, to the old format (after all, some fields are zeroing). These 0 lead to default value.

As informations are missing, owing to the fact that 0 are put instead of actual value, the accuracy will be degraded.
 @amitdo - why is this necessary at all? Shouldn't Tesseract being learning based on the training examples we provide? Pre-existing data isn't going to be helpful with new fonts. 
 @ggdhines :+1: 
 Ok, I will wait.

Thanks for your patience.
 Hi,

Thank you for this clarification.

I am somewhat disappointed, and I have more questions than before:
1. Why using default values, when we want to train for specific fonts, and we could get specific values?
2. Are not specific values better than default values??? Why not using default values "only" when we need it? For example, when there are no matching font?
3. It will be certainly less accurate to use default values; so we cannot get the best result for specific fonts? Unless to waste a lot of time in training Tesseract? For an "uncertain" result?
4. Why `set_unicharset_properties` does not compute such values? It would not be too difficult to develop such a functionality. And I think it would be better in a lot of way (result and time).
5. I cannot understand how these default values can be better. For example, theses default values are likely not to match Adobe Jenson Pro glyph metrics and other fonts. So I have to train again, again, and again, to get better result due to lack of specific values, owing to "missing functionality"?
6. You write: 

> set_unicharset_properties -U unicharset -O new_unicharset -X xheights --script_dir=/home/myusername/tesseract-ocr/langdata

but the xheights file generated is always blank, and the file Latin.xheights seems to do nothing (I already tried this), and I always get the same output_unicharset file, with or without Latin.xheights (located in langdata folder, or in the current directory).

What can be done with a filled (with default values) xheights file?

Thank you
 > If you develop such a tool (or hire someone to do so) we can add a link in the wiki to your site...
1. Not enough time
2. Not enough money
3. The developers of Tesseract will do it faster, cleaner, and cheaper than me.

> My answer for your other questions:
> This is the current situation and you should accept it...

Indeed. In fact, I expected too much from Tesseract.

> Your last question - you probably did something wrong if you get an empty file. I will try to test it later.

I will wait for your test.

Sorry, but I did not want to hurt anybody.

No, just a mistake when I wrote.

Thanks for the link.

Anyway, thank you for everything.
 I finally resolved my problem with xheights. I did a spelling mistake :s

Anyway, thanks for all.
 More recently I made the addmetrics and xheights tools, which are in the tools directory of the git repo https://ancientgreekocr.org/grctraining.git

  I'm following the instructions for creating a new font with Tesseract at http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2012/02/11/adding-new-fonts-to-tesseract-3-ocr-engine/ and am getting a unicharest file that looks like:

  Hello:
    I use Tesseract 3.4 on CentOS 7, and I test it by some sample words.  In general environmental condition(not opencl), it work successfully, and output words is right.  In opencl condition(./configure --enable-opencl), it can work, but output words is garbled. 
    Why? 
  I have the following image of A's which I want to use to teach Tesseract a new font. (When I include the other characters, the page is mostly taken up and the errors are the same so doesn't seem to be an image with a mostly empty page.) (The original image is in tiff format.)

  Is there a way to install new languages with HomeBrew. I would like to install norwegian, the code is nor. I tried to do `brew install tessecract-nor` but that didn't work.
On the Wiki there is detail who to do it for MacPort
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki#homebrew
 I got reply on my question here https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/797.

I'm using tesseract and as part of the hOCRText I would like to retrieve information on the size, font-family and emphasis.

Following the answer on [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20016767/extracting-text-attributes-using-tesseract-hocr/35415375) This is also confirmed by a pull request documenting this feature #222

 @amitdo Thanks!
 Hi! I'm wondering if the tessdata for italics of Japanese fonts have finished?  Hi Team,

I am an android developer and i am integrating Tesseract for OCR scanning. for my application i have the requirement to detect the orientation of the Ocr and based and that process the OCR.
I have gone though various post to find the way to get the Orientation but was unable to succeed. As per one of the post it ismentioned to get the orientation using the following logic :

inputfile = "/usr/src/tesseract-3.02/eurotextUpsideDown.png";
    image = pixRead(inputfile);

```
api->Init("/usr/src/tesseract-3.02/", "eng");
api->SetPageSegMode(tesseract::PSM_AUTO_OSD);
api->SetImage(image);
api->Recognize(0);

tesseract::PageIterator* it =  api->AnalyseLayout();
tesseract::Orientation orientation;
tesseract::WritingDirection direction;
tesseract::TextlineOrder order;
float deskew_angle;

it->Orientation(&orientation, &direction, &order, &deskew_angle);
printf("Orientation: %d;\nWritingDirection: %d\nTextlineOrder: %d\n" \
       "Deskew angle: %.4f\n",
       orientation, direction, order, deskew_angle);
```

But in android I cannot find the supported method AnalyseLayout() in the TessBaseApi.java class. Can some one help me to find the solution for this or can some one tell me the
api or the logic to get this.

Will be a great help for me. 

Thanks,
Ankit
 Dear @ankitagg,

Did you resolve the issue ?

Please let me know if it is resolved and the method you used to solve ?

Thanks.  In Version v3.04.00 I get a strange behaviour if a non-dictionary word has a certain 
ratio of digits to numbers in it and if there is a non-leading capital "I" involved.
The attached bad.jpg file (same with tif files) should get ocr-ed to NCOR140123020064000000000 and not NCORI4012302006400000000.
If I cut off the last "0" ( good.jpg ) then all is fine.
I played with all kind of options like conflict_set_I_l_1 and rej_1Il_trust_rej_1Il_trust_permuter_type_type and more, but had no success.
I think that it is a bug if the length of the word affects the interpretation of "I".
Or which special setting of the parameters do I have to choose to get this working?

```

 Can you be more specific? 
The only "fix" I found was to add " -l deu " and then bad.jpg is read correctly. 
But how can I get this behaviour for " -l eng" ? Turning off dictionaries as suggested in the wiki has no effect.
 But isn't it clearly a bug? ocropus-rpred has no problem with bad.jpg.
 There may be a bug (or possibility for improvement) here, but the general statement

> I think that it is a bug if the length of the word affects the interpretation of "I".

doesn't hold because OCR programs are giant collections of probabilities, thresholds, ratios, and conditions. The code that tries to figure out 1Il and 0O confusion in words, in particular, is a big set of heuristics using counts of various character types and guesses about what the most likely output string is.

and +1 for using the mailing list, not the bug tracker, for asking questions
  I want to train my own eng.cube.nn for cube engine, but I cannot find any idea from the trainning directory. What can I do for it?
 But I need to train my cube for my research, have any other way, even not in tesseract, to train the .cube.nn file? I'm so curious about where's the original cube model from, could any one give me some advises about it?
 The code for training the neural network was never released, so nobody can help you with this. Sorry.
 What's the best way for one to insert their own single-character recognition algorithm into the overall Tessaract system?

How can I set the PSM_Model for tesseract?
  On Tesseract 3.04.00 I get a segmentation fault while trying to get the orientation information for the image with arabic text.

Sample Image: http://i.imgur.com/DdLr39z.jpg

Tesseract Version:

```
$ tesseract --version
tesseract 3.04.00
 leptonica-1.72
  libjpeg 8d : libpng 1.6.18 : libtiff 4.0.6 : zlib 1.2.5
```

Ara langs in TESSDATA:

```
$ ls ara*
ara.cube.bigrams   ara.cube.lm        ara.cube.params    ara.cube.word-freq 
ara.cube.fold      ara.cube.nn        ara.cube.size      ara.traineddata
```

Segmentation Fault:

```
$ tesseract arabic_4.jpg stdout -psm 0 -l ara
[1]    3721 segmentation fault  tesseract ~/Downloads/arabic_4.jpg stdout -psm 0 -l ara
```

This does not happen when I pass the language as `eng` instead of  `ara` but then ofcourse the results and confidence factor are extremely low. 

```
$ tesseract ~/Downloads/arabic_4.jpg stdout -psm 0 -l eng
Orientation: 0
Orientation in degrees: 0
Orientation confidence: 4.00
Script: 1
Script confidence: 8.08
```
  I'm trying the first example: `pts.image_to_string(PIL.Image.open('/home/shefuto/Pictures/jpgpytesseract.jpg'))`
and it gives me this error. `OSError(2, 'No such file or directory')`

At some point a subprocess is being invoked, and analyzing the `locals()`, i get these 

```

These are the locals when the exception occured here: `/pytesseract/pytesseract.py(94)`

The source file '/home/shefuto/Pictures/jpgpytesseract.jpg' exists, so it appears it tries to access those temporary files when they're not created yet.
  A related stackoverflow question is here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20599768/tesseract-ocr-recognize-complete-dictionary-words-only. 

Basically what I want to achieve is to ask Tesseract to recognize only complete words included in my custom dictionary (lang: chi_sim), or to find the best match. 

Following the instruction in https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/doc/tesseract.1.asc#languages, I applied a config file with the following content:

```
load_system_dawg     F
load_freq_dawg       F
user_words_file      /path/to/my/dictonary.user-words
```

But this doesn't seem to work: when I ask Tesseract to recognize word from this image

 ![x](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1710087/14453308/a897e3dc-00c6-11e6-9637-2419cddace49.jpg),

`$ tesseract /path/to/the/above/image.jpg stdout -l chi_sim /path/to/my/config_file`

 it gives me `硝酸嘛庸喹瓢膏` which is not in the dictionary at all. The best match is supposed to be `硝酸咪康唑乳膏` which is included in the dictionary.

I searched around and couldn't find a solution. Please help me out. Thank you.
 You could try playing with some of the dictionary related parameters to see if you can achieve the results that you want:

```
$ tesseract --print-parameters | grep dic
```

In particular, these two look like they might have promise:

```
language_model_penalty_non_freq_dict_word   0.1 Penalty for words not in the frequent word dictionary
language_model_penalty_non_dict_word    0.15    Penalty for non-dictionary words
```
 Thank you, @amitdo and @tfmorris. I tried both `language_model_penalty_non_freq_dict_word` and `language_model_penalty_non_dict_word` but had no luck.
  Version: tesseract **3.01**
Other version: the master branch contains updated code and has not been tested
Result: ASSERT failure
Input: specific image (cannot be shared) with table like structure
Keytext: `bb_it.data()->owner() == this:Error:Assert failed:in file colpartition.cpp, line 205`

(Mixing blobs/bboxes etc. for easier reading)

ColPartitions are created from bboxes that were placed on a grid (see `colpartition.cpp::void ColPartition::AddBox(BLOBNBOX* bbox)`). It is normal that one bbox is in multiple positions (that are subsequent) and there can be multiple bboxes in one position on the grid. It can happen, that more ColPartitions are created from the same bbox (the bbox iteration returns bbox1 from [x,y] and a new ColPartition is created, then a different bbox2 is returned from the same [x,y] and another ColPartition is created, afterwards we move to [x+1, y] and get bbox1 again and yet another new ColPartition is created (see `colfind.cpp::ColPartitionSet* ColumnFinder::PartitionsAtGridY(int grid_y)`).
So far so good, we have two ColPartitions with the same bbox and we move on to merging.

These two ColPartitions are correctly selected for merging to another one (see `colpartition.cpp::bool ColPartition::Unique(ColPartition* other, WidthCallback* cb)`) BUT it can happen that `void ColPartition::AddBox(BLOBNBOX* bbox)` does _add_ them twice under very specific conditions. The result is a crash/assert (whatever you call it) in `colpartition.cpp::void ColPartition::ClaimBoxes(WidthCallback* cb)` where the list is iterated and owner is chosen. Now, if there is an item after the second position of the specific bbox, the assert (`ASSERT_HOST(bb_it.data()->owner() == this);`) is triggered because the first time it encounters the bbox the owner is set to `null` and the second time the assert `expects ==this`).

How can the box be added twice?
The specific bbox is
`
{bot_left={xcoord=1201 ycoord=1158 } top_right={xcoord=1303 ycoord=1251 } }
`
The first merge calls
`void ColPartition::AddBox(BLOBNBOX* bbox)` -> `boxes_.add_sorted(SortByBoxBottom<BLOBNBOX>, true, bbox);` (it is a vertical box). 
and it will be added to the end by

```
  // Check for adding at the end.
  if (last == NULL || comparator(&last->data, &new_data) < 0) {
```

which _can_ still be correct (`{bot_left={xcoord=1306 ycoord=1157 } top_right={xcoord=1494 ycoord=1347 } }`). 

But the second call should discard adding because of the `unique` parameter. But because there are bboxes at the beginning and only bottom is checked 

```
int SortByBoxBottom(const void* void1, const void* void2) {
  // The void*s are actually doubly indirected, so get rid of one level.
  const BBC* p1 = *reinterpret_cast<const BBC* const *>(void1);
  const BBC* p2 = *reinterpret_cast<const BBC* const *>(void2);
  int result = p1->bounding_box().bottom() - p2->bounding_box().bottom();
```

it is added again before the other value is encountered (`box = {bot_left={xcoord=1405 ycoord=1209 } top_right={xcoord=1475 ycoord=1259 } }`).

The iteration compares it with the following:

```
{bot_left={xcoord=1408 ycoord=1293 } top_right={xcoord=1440 ycoord=1337 } }
{bot_left={xcoord=749 ycoord=1142 } top_right={xcoord=933 ycoord=1258 } }
-->>{bot_left={xcoord=1405 ycoord=1209 } top_right={xcoord=1475 ycoord=1259 } }
```

Solution:
One possible solution is to iterate the other bboxes as well if `unique` is set and discard adding if it finds the same data

 Unless someone wants to check the current master, feel free to close the issue.
 as mentioned above, the specific image cannot be made publicly available
 @vidiecan, if it is not possible to create a public demo image, maybe you can nevertheless provide a code patch which fixes the problem? Or is it possible to send the problematic image privately to one of the developers working an tesseract, so that he / she can fix the problem?
  First of all, thanks for adding support to tesseract finally. From quickly inspecting Persian related codes on tesseract I reached to https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/training/language-specific.sh#L520 which I can say speculatively is not a good set of fonts for training Persian printed text and can result in poor performance of OCR quality as most Persian fonts don't have the style these fonts have. On ["Font recognition using Variogram fractal dimension"](http://files.matlabsite.com/docs/papers/icee2012/2/icee2012-174.pdf), a good set of Persian fonts is introduced (second page, at the bottom) which as you can see there also, it is different from favorites Arabic language fonts (even the fact both are using Arabic script). So for training Persian OCR for tesseract I suggest adding or replacing current fonts with these free fonts, Nazli (i.e. Nazanin as indicated on that article) and Titr from Debian [fonts-farsiweb](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=fonts-farsiweb) package and also XB Zar and XB Yaghut from OFL licensed [xfonts](http://wiki.irmug.com/index.php/X_Series_2). I think also @roozbehp @behdad from Google can help you on this. Thank you.
  tesseract -v provides version info for the binary.

It would be helpful to have version info in all training tools also.

Thanks!
 It might be useful to have them write that version into their output as well, so one can tell the provenance of the trained data.
 Possible actions:
* Support command line options `-v`, `--version` for all executables.
* Write version information in file information for Windows executables.

Potential problems:
* Executable and shared library `libtesseract` might have different versions.

Open question:
* What exactly should be shown? Version number only for tagged release? Branch version? Git release? Compilation date? * Windows DLL files can include file information like executables (also the version info).
* Any shared library could include an exported function like `const char *tesseractLibraryVersion()` which returns a version string. [3.05.01](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/3.05.01) was released shortly after your question, so this is something for the next release. The current situation regarding version information is confusing:

- There is a Tesseract package version (not shown by `tesseract -v` as I would have expected).
- There is a Tesseract data version used for the traineddata (shown by `tesseract -v`).
- There are lots of places with version information (`configure.ac`, `ccutil/version.h`, `vs2010/port/vcsversion.h`, `vs2010/port/vcsversion.h`, `CMakeLists.txt`, maybe more).

And what about PR #593? The traineddata version is only partially different. It starts with `4.00.00alpha` for all newer data (best and fast) and continues with additional information which is different: `4.00.00alpha:Vietnamese:synth20170629:[1,36,0,1Ct3,3,16Mp3,3Lfys64Lfx96Lrx96Lfx512O1c1]`.

It looks like the current code only uses that version string to display it for users. There is still no compatibility check which requests compatible versions – that check must be done by the users.  ![test](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12631283/14032336/4c60fa96-f1cf-11e5-99a5-198b1445958a.png)

(I'm using head: 3.05.00dev)

When ocr'ing a small one or two line image (with the default settings), I'm getting the following error:
Error in pixGenHalftoneMask: pix too small: w = 610, h = 71

But the ocr is successful.

In textord/imagefind.cpp, FindImages is calling pixGenHalftoneMask (a leptonica function) which is throwing the error and returning null.

FindImages is then executing it's backup plan, which works fine (such a small image doesn't need multiple images regions). It's backup plan is to call pixCreate and then return the result.

The minimum size for pixGenHalftoneMask to work is 100x100 pixels. Perhaps FindImages should
just go with plan 'b' if the size of the image is too small. This would still work fine and avoid throwing the error. I don't know if there is a way for teseract to know what the minimum size is (in case it changes).
 The min size is defined like this at the top of src/pageseg.c in leptonica:

```
/* These functions are not intended to work on very low-res images */
```

static const l_int32  MinWidth = 100;
static const l_int32  MinHeight = 100;

It doesn't seem that they are likely to change.

Here's my patch:

 An alternative is for Leptonica to not spam stderr. I'm honestly not sure which approach is better.
 Good point. It's returning null, and the null is being handled properly. Automatically emitting the reason for the error should be directable/configurable.

I just dug into it and found NO_CONSOLE_IO referenced from environ.h.
Maybe I needed to turn that on when I built Leptonica. Still a questionable approach.
 Scott's patch seems reasonable to me.

Testing the size in advance prevents leptonica from returning null,
and from saying that an error occurred.

Slightly simpler just to 
  return pixCopy(pixr, pix);
which works whether or not pixr exists.

re: musings about whether or not leptonica should "spam stderr":

Just a reminder that leptonica provides a significant amount of control over messages to stderr, both at compile time and at run time, and broken down to the granularity of errors, warnings and information.  The question for the leptonica client (tesseract, here) is what level of messages they want to receive on stderr, and in this case it's up to the maintainers.  If the error messages (at least) are not on, a user will have no idea why something failed if it was due to bad input to a leptonica function, for example.  On the other hand, when failures occur but are caught and handled by the client, the user may be unnecessarily concerned, when things are actually going ok.

FWIW, when I am programming and testing, I always use the default MINIMUM_SEVERITY of L_SEVERITY_INFO, which turns all messages on.

  make fail on cygwin64 when I have changed the file 'opencl/openclwrapper.h'  on line 67 : #define PERF_COUNT_VERBOSE 3,   

Then I change the file 'opencl/openclwrapper.h' on line 13: defined( **CYGWIN** ),  more problems come. 
 Thanks.  But  in cygwin, The define of `__CYGWIN32__` is no longer used, replaced by `__CYGWIN__`
 Excuse me, I had met a problem when I used the cmake 
pkg_check_modules(Leptonica REQUIRED lept)       this package didn't found, How can I solved it? 
By the way, I have installed the lib leptonica already, and  I finished making the tesseract by ' configure && make '. 

PS: The src file of leptonica that I downloaded  don't have the CMakeLists.txt.

Thanks.
 Thanks, I have solved this problem.

 Zdenko, thanks for your suggestion. It is working now. line 88

  This enables all OpenType ligatures for a specific font, where
available. Specifically, it explicitly enables the OpenType
features liga (standard ligatures), hlig (historical ligatures),
clig (contextual ligatures), and dlig (discretionary ligatures).

This feature requires Pango 1.38 or newer.
 Hi Amit!

Yeah, I had considered doing that, but wasn't sure whether it was worth it. Thinking about it more though, I agree with you (and there's only one #ifdef needed, so it ain't too ugly).

Thanks for looking it over :)
  Check my previous summary here http://www.visionopen.com/forums/topic/bugs-in-current-tesseract/
Solutions are provided as follows:

1) LIST -> LIST_TESSERACT
in all files

2) remove_reference -> remove_reference_Tesseract
in all files

How can I become a developer of tesseract on github?

Cheers
Pei
 Oh, yes zdenop.
You are correct. I met this problem 2 years ago. At that time, I used to use a "global namespace", something like 
**using namespace std;** instead of **std::**

It looks like tesseract is using the SAME key words as in C++ compiler.

Thank you...

Chinese simplefied: see issue 296; download http://ubuntuone.com/p/3Yw/ 
    The goal is to run an AWS Amazon instance (Ubuntu 14.04) with GPU support to test the difference in OCR speed with a large GPU.   I have Nvidia drivers and OpenCL installed.
  Ive downloaded, compiled and installed leptonica 1.73 (latest version), downloaded the latest tesseract source.  I run autogen then ./configure --enable-opencl but get the following error.

checking for leptonica... yes
checking for l_generateCIDataForPdf in -llept... no
configure: error: leptonica library with pdf support (>= 1.71) is missing

Ive searched for at least 4 hours for the answer to this but have had no luck.  Im not a programmer so am not that familiar with the use or locations of lib files.    This is probably just a variable problem but I cant find any reference to it.  
 Hello @dthrock ,

I've got exactly the same proble, on Ubuntu 14.04.

I had to go to leptonica site, download the source and build it.

After that, I run ./configure --with-extra-includes=/usr/local/include and --with-extra-libaries=/usr/local/lib

Hope it would help you.
 I have the same problem, while leptonica-1.74.1, mac OS 10.12.3 (16D32)

 @vitamin thank u. your suggestion solved my issue too .  This builds a docker image based on the project .travis.yml
 @zdenop Not having to create a separate script to invoke the tesseract build.
  I'm having issues with getting Tesseract to read text out of an image.  Its seems to not read the text in the image in its original size.

![bowenpeak](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17915164/13863515/410b1a02-ecff-11e5-9c93-f63825576e21.png)

But when I increase the canvas size it then picks up the text.  Any Ideas on what maybe causing this?

![bowenpeak_lrg](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17915164/13863517/47b6f010-ecff-11e5-91a0-7b2c7548f493.png)
  Good catch. There seem to be more errors of this kind (e. g. #276).
 The trick is to compile with `-Wmissing-format-attribute`, fix all related warnings and iterate this until no format related warnings remain. Projects like Tesseract which never used gcc's format attribute typically have lots of format errors. I just started the search, and the current count is 6.

Fixing those format errors is one task, another one is adding the format attribute and the compiler options where needed, so future contributions won't introduce new errors.
 That flag would result in warnings for all functions with printf or scanf like arguments which don't use the format attribute. Then it is necessary to add a format function attribute to each of those function declarations. After this, gcc will know which functions work similar to printf or scanf and report all errors (if that warning is enabled, for example with `-Wall -Wextra`).

Example:

```
  ../../../../ccutil/errcode.cpp:64:45: warning: function might be possible candidate for ‘gnu_printf’ format attribute [-Wsuggest-attribute=format]
  ../../../../cutil/callcpp.cpp:47:29: warning: function might be possible candidate for ‘gnu_printf’ format attribute [-Wsuggest-attribute=format]
  ../../../../viewer/scrollview.cpp:402:47: warning: function might be possible candidate for ‘gnu_printf’ format attribute [-Wsuggest-attribute=format]
  ../../../../viewer/scrollview.cpp:573:47: warning: function might be possible candidate for ‘gnu_printf’ format attribute [-Wsuggest-attribute=format]
```

And yes, the missing `%` would be reported, too.
  Hello everyone
I'm new with tesseract and I was wondering if I could force Tesseract to use a small dictionnary and to return the word which is the most similaire from the dictionnary
Thx
  In version 3.03

In the man page for TESSERACT(1) under the title Languages the following items are misspelt.

"Croation" should be "Croatian" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_language)
"Slovakian" should be "Slovak" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_language)
  I git cloned the tesseract-ocr repositories on ubuntu 14.04 with the following structure

tesseract-ocr
tesseract-ocr/tesseract
tesseract-ocr/tessdata
tesseract-ocr/langdata

The build process (autogen, make, sudo make install, sudo ldconfig)  put the tessdata files with configs and tessconfigs subdirectories and pdf.ttf in  /usr/local/share/tessdata

This puts tessdata related files in two locations:
tesseract-ocr/tessdata
and
/usr/local/share/tessdata
(in addition to the source in tesseract-ocr/tesseract/tessdata)

As a regular user I cannot copy the tesddata files to  /usr/local/share/tessdata

$ cp ./tessdata/san.traineddata /usr/local/share/tessdata
cp: cannot create regular file ‘/usr/local/share/tessdata/san.traineddata’: Permission denied

---

$ export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/home/shree/tesseract-ocr
$ echo $TESSDATA_PREFIX
/home/shree/tesseract-ocr

If I use the above tessdata prefix, then tesseract does not find the config files ..

$ tesseract   testing/phototest.jpg testing/phototest-jpg  -l eng -psm 3
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v3.05.00dev with Leptonica

---

$ export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/usr/local/share/tessdata
$ echo $TESSDATA_PREFIX
/usr/local/share/tessdata

If I use the above then tesseract does not find the traineddata files even when tessdata-dir is pointing to the correct location

I can get around it by copying configs, tessconfigs and pdf.ttf to
/home/shree/tesseract-ocr/tessdata directory.

But this should not be required. What am I missing in the process?
 Thanks, @amitdo

  https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/ChangeLog
is updated only till 2014-02-04 v3.03

Should the changelog also reflect the changes in the current development (master branch) eg. TSV output as new features are added?
  I've worked with the library in the past when I was working with VS2008 and the precompiled binaries but now that I've been using VS2013 I cannot seem to get the library to work without some sort of memory leak detected at the end of my application's runtime.

Run the application with no calls to the library and no leaks detected.

Run the application with this code:

---

tesseract::TessBaseAPI *api = new tesseract::TessBaseAPI;
delete api;

---

And here is the output when the application wraps up:

---

The block sizes are consistent for this test each time it runs.  If I make calls to the library the number of leaks increases with varying block sizes.

Any help is greatly appreciated.  I would hate to have to go back to VS2008 just to be able to use the precompiled binaries.

Thanks a bunch!
 I followed the directions here: [http://vorba.ch/2014/tesseract-3.03-vs2013.html](http://vorba.ch/2014/tesseract-3.03-vs2013.html).  Everything compiled smoothly but same result.

I would love to help with the development but I've been working on this for a few weeks and I just really can't put any more time into it due to family obligations.  Sorry.

I think I'm going to have to end up using the tesseract-dll.exe cmd line application to do the dirty work (seems to not have the issues I am having with the windows app) and move on.

 Fixed in #449   I integrated Tesseract C/C++, version 3.x, to read English OCR on images.

It’s working pretty good, but very slow. It takes close to 1000ms (1 second) to read the attached image (00060.jpg) on my quad-core laptop.

I’m not using the Cube engine, and I’m feeding only binary images to the OCR reader.

Any way to make it faster. Any ideas on how to make Tesseract read faster?
thanks
![00060](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9968625/13674495/ac261db4-e6ab-11e5-9b4a-ad91d5b4ff87.jpg)
 You can already run 4 parallel instances of Tesseract on your quad core, then it will read 4  images in about the same time. Introducing multi threading would not help to reduce the time needed for an OCR of many images. I am working on a project where OCR with Tesseract would take nearly 7 years on a single core, but luckily I can try to get many computers and use their cores, so the time can be reduced to a few days.
Using compiler settings which are optimized for your CPU helps to gain a few percent, but I am afraid that for a larger gain different algorithms in Tesseract and its libraries would be needed.
 Besides the OCR, we have other things that need to run on the other cores.
I believe, the main issue that's slowing down Tesseract is the way memory is managed.
Too many memory allocations (new function) and releases (delete or delete [] functions) do slow down the reader.
In the past, I did use a different OCR engine, and it was allocating up-front large buffers to store all the needed data (large buffer of blobs, a large buffer of lines, a large buffer of words and their corresponding data), the buffers were just being indexed as we were reading the data from an image. The large buffers were allocated only once upon ocr engine initialization and release only once upon ocr engine shutdown. This memory management scheme was very efficient computational-time-wise.
Are there any settings for Tesseract that are known to be computationally intensive?
any tricks to speed up Tesseract?
 What evidence is your memory management speculation based on?
 I'm not speculating anything. The reality is that TesseRact takes more than 3 seconds to read the above image that I initially attached (I use VS2010). When I use the console test application that comes with the TesseRact, it takes about the same time (more than 3 seconds). 

Anyone would speculate a lot in 3 seconds

I have more than 20 years in machine vision. I used several OCR engines in the past. Actually I have one -in house- that reads the same image in less than 100ms, but our engine is designed more for reading a single line of text (i.e. it returns a single line of text).

TesseRact database is not that large. Most of the techniques used by TesseRact are quite standard in the OCR-area (page layout, line extraction, possible character extraction, word forming, and then several phases of classification). However, the TesseRact manages very badly memory usage. why? it takes more than 3 seconds to read a typical texted-image.

please if you're not bringing any meaningful ideas to my posting, just spare me your comment.
 @ychtioui, as you have spent many years in machine vision, you know quite well that there are lots of ways why programs can be slow. Memory management is just one of them. Even with a lot of experience, I'd start running performance analyzers to investigate performance issues. Of course I can guess what might be possible reasons and try to improve the software based on that guesses, but improvements based on evidence (like the result of a performance analysis) are more efficient. Don't you think so, too? Do you have a chance to run a performance analysis?
 I'm running version 3.02
I'm going through different sections of the reader, and checking which section is taking the most time.

is it typical to read images (such as mine attached above) in a few seconds? 

thanks for your comments.
 thanks amitdo.
I'm using 3.02 but the C/C++ version of Tesseract.
I couldn't find the setting -O3 in the source files. where is it?
 @ychtioui said in a post above "I use VS2010" so using Windows.
 I use vs2010 on a Windows 7 pc.
Project settings or building options won't change much the read speed.
Tesseract was designed in research labs. Most of the key sections of the reader are speed-don't-care.
I used some performance tools to analyze where most of the computation time is spent. 
In the page layout section, the blob analyzer does a lot of new/delete. This is very time consuming. The attached image above has more than 3600 blobs. Besides a number of processings are done on each blob (distance transform, finding the enclosing rectangle, measuring blob parameters, etc.). The allocations (new) and the release (delete) of all these blobs is very time consuming. 
If we use a global array (allocate upfront) of blobs (exactly object BLOBNBOX) and whenever we need a blob, just get one index from the array. The array will be released once when we shut down the engine. 
I used this concept in another single line ocr reader and it's super fast.
 Hi @ychtioui I am newbie and saw your first comment that you are able to get pretty accurate results from Tesseract. For your image itself i am no table to get any results its telling: Can't recognize image. Can you plz provide the code snippet on how you are processing the image. 
Thanks - Anant.
 @theraysmith 
What do you use in the internal Google build, `-O2` or `-O3`?
 I'm interested in the same answer, @amitdo . Can you answer the question, @theraysmith ? It really can help us :)  Don't expect much difference between `-O2` and `-O3`. I tried different optimizations, and they only have small effects on the time needed for OCR of a page. Higher optimization levels can even result in slower code because the code gets larger (because of unfolding of loops), so CPU caches become less effective. It is much more important to write good code. The improvement by using `-fopenmp` is useful when you want "realtime" OCR – running OCR for a single page and waiting for the result. Then it is fast because it uses more than one CPU core for some time consuming parts of the OCR process.

For mass OCR, it does not help. If many pages have to be processed, it is better to use single threaded Tesseract and run several Tesseract processes in parallel.
 Stefan, what about using OpenMP for training? Yes, for training a single new model OpenMP could perhaps speed up the training process. Up to now, OpenMP is only used in `ccmain/` and in `lstm/`. I don't know how much that part is used during training, and I never have run a performance evaluation for the training process (in fact I‌ have only run LSTM training once for Fraktur, and as I already said, it was not really successful). can I set more than 4 threads for Trainning LSTM? What about machines that have only 2 cores?
Shouldn't the 'num_threads' lowered to 2 in that case? @theraysmith I want to train tesseract 4 for arabic language. theraysmith you mean that there is no way to speed up the training process?  i follow this step,
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

but when i run make, i got error, then i run _autoreconf -i_ after ./autogen.sh , but i got same result

  I am trying to recognize a flawless image. I created the image from a pdf that is all vector, not image. It has no noise, no skew, flawless characters in any DPI that I want.

The recognition from Tesseract sucks. Generally the problem is dropped characters. It seems to randomly ignore perfectly good looking characters.

The screen shot shows the text results in the upper left and the image in the background (only the upper left of the image is visible). The bounding boxes of the results are shown in red on that image. Notice all the missing characters. On this particular image all the characters to the right of what you can see are found and recognized properly. The image consists of a table of information (rows of item #, size, description, and qty). The columns are not nicely aligned (although this example is pretty good). Some rows are separated by a line (this example has a line for each row, and notice that tesseract gives me a bounding box for some of the lines, but not all). I tried removing the lines, but that just changed the set of dropped characters with no rhyme or reason to it. Other images from this same set are very similar but tesseract will drop characters on the right, or whole lines will be missing. I have tried different DPI from 75 to 300, but the results were just as disappointing. 

Can anyone suggest how this might be solved?

  I am building tesseract on msys2 on windows. I am using the latest version of leptonica (1.73) which generates liblept-5.dll However, when I run tesseract 3.04.01 it gives the following error.

User@HP MINGW32 ~/tesseract-ocr
$ tesseract -v
C:/msys32/mingw32/bin/tesseract.exe: error while loading shared libraries: liblept-4.dll: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I copied liblept-5.dll as liblept4.dll and was able to run the program - see below.

Wiki states:
*\* 3.04 requires at least v1.71 of Leptonica.**

Is 3.04.01 compatible with leptonica 1.73?
 Yes, I had used a PKGBUILD similar to the following, without the prepare
section. After Zdenko's comment I have added autogen.sh to it also. Need to
build it again to test.

 I have built Leptonica 1.73 on msys2 locally. It is not yet reflected in
Msys2 repository.

 No liblept.dll.

I have liblept.a and liblept.dll.a in lib directory and liblept-5.dll in
bin directory.

 Amit & Zdenko.

Yes, the problem on msys2 maybe because I am trying to use the PKGBUILD
system for building the software (which is what was recommended by the
msys2 developers when I was trying to build the earlier release by hand).

I was able to build and run 1.73 leptonica and the latest source of
tesseract on ubuntu 14.04 without problems.

Thanks!

 I did not run
sudo ldconfig
after building leptonica, but did after building tesseract.

I used the following commands:

./autogen.sh
./configure
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" make training
sudo make training-install

  Hi,

I am currently working on license plate recognition and for that i am using tesseract3.03 on windows. For the same purpose I have trained the tesseract with 1500 images of alpha numeric characters.When I am testing tesseract for same images then GetUTF8Text returns NULL.Specially mostly for N,M, and W characters.I have attached 3 images as samples. 

As detail, I have set the vaiable PageSegMode="PSM_SINGLE_CHAR".Besides,I have already tried preprocessing and resolution techniques for input image to resolve the problem.

PLEASE HELP!!!

It would be helpful even if I can know the roll of GetUTF8Text in giving the NULL output for an images.

  It doesn't look to me like `classify_enable_adaptive_matcher=0` is really supported any more. A bunch of the new code that's been added isn't conditionalized to check it.

The reason that it doesn't crash when the config variable is set on the command line is because that's done after the recognizer is initialized, so the necessary data structure has been created.
 The config file is processed in the Init call here:

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/api/tesseractmain.cpp#L372

while the command line config variables are processed in the call
to SetVariablesFromCLArgs here:

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/api/tesseractmain.cpp#L379

after the adaptive matcher has already been set up.

Even though the command line case doesn't crash, it is still using the
adaptive matcher because the code that references it isn't guarded by the
necessary config variable.
 Good suggestions, but neither is relevant here because `classify_enable_adaptive_matcher` isn't an init only parameter.

The issue is that the code has evolved so that `classify_enable_adaptive_matcher=0` is no longer supported. There are sections of code which don't check this config variable and which assume that the adaptive matcher is correctly initialized.  We can either drop the config variable or fix the code so that the variable protects everything that needs to be protected. I don't know how much work that'll be, but it's more than just this one place, because I fixed it and it just died somewhere else. No idea how many places there are to fix or whether it makes sense from @theraysmith's point of view to continue supporting this case.

In my opinion, the current order of evaluation (config files, then command line) is correct because it allows the config file to be overridden by the command line.
  Hi,

if seems, that moving PageIterator\* AnalyseLayout() to api/baseapi.h[1] causes a silent ABI breakage. Could you please move it back to api/baseapi.cpp? Please see the corresponding Debian bugs for reference [2], [3].
I could prepare a PR if you prefer. 

Thanks,
Philip

 Here you go: PR #259
 Please make sure this reaches the 3.04 branch.
  I put together a simple test program that demonstrates the issue:
https://github.com/matthill/tesseract_z_issue/tree/master

Given an input image that is a "N", Tesseract seems to rotate this single character to produce high confidence for "Z" and "2" characters.  Only the "N" and "M" characters would be expected.
# tesseract_z_issue

![Z Character](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthill/tesseract_z_issue/master/z.png)

Input training data is here: [tif](https://github.com/openalpr/train-ocr/blob/master/eu/input/leu.netherlands.exp0.tif?raw=true) [box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openalpr/train-ocr/master/eu/input/leu.netherlands.exp0.box)

After running the program, the output is:

```
[mhill@mhill-linux z]$ ./tesseract_z_test 
Z : 95.4505
symbol Z, conf: 95.450462 font: netherlands (index 1) size 53px - Z conf: 95.450462
            - N conf: 91.517166
            - 2 conf: 86.062859
            - M conf: 81.259239
---------------------------------------------
```

Z and 2 characters are not expected, it makes me wonder if the character is rotated when analyzed.
 Are you sure that you're not closing a real issue here?  I assume that Tesseract is trying to rotate an individual character crop 90 degrees and getting better recognition.  I assume that changing the training data would not affect this.  Do you believe that changing the training input data would resolve this issue?

I did not use a font to train this language, these are actual binarized letter samples from real data (license plates).  I'm not sure I understand your comment "font seem to be common."  Can you help me understand what you mean?

My use case is individual character recognition, rather than words/lines of characters.  The recognition is only used for one character at a time (no segmentation) so I don't believe the order of the characters in the tif/box matters.  Am I mistaken?  Do you expect that changing the order of the characters could affect individual character recognition?  My experimentation with Tesseract leads me to believe that this is not true.

 I had problems earlier while opening pdf files that were created without pdf.ttx being present in tessdata. 

But that seems to have been fixed and looks like pdf.ttx is no longer required (I looked at the history ..https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commits/master/tessdata/Makefile.am 
 Problem report is incorrect. `pdf.ttx` has never been required for Tesseract PDF generation.  `pdf.ttx` is simply a human readable representation of the invisible font. I only use it when trying to figure out font related problems. And I typically generate it when needed; there is no need to distribute with Tesseract at all.
 You are right, `GlyphLessFont.h|cpp` should be removed. They were important at one time, but are no longer relevant or useful. (Back in the old days, two months ago, the software that converts ttx to ttf and back was not smart enough to handle our font. Now it is.)
  Hi,
There is a function **main()** at the end of [viewer/svpaint.cpp](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/d7b089fbcf8f1582e8e897f7c8572433b662f533/viewer/svpaint.cpp#L221), which is compiled and exported when building the library. I think it shouldn't be there, or it should be protected by some define so you only compile it when you need it 
 I saw it, but as graphics is enabled by default, and as it enables more functions (apart from main), I thought that disabling graphics would also disable more functions and disable some functionality (perhaps all those functions are only used by that main() so it doesn't matter, but I don't know)

So, by default the library is compiled with a main() function, I could --disable-graphics. However, I don't think it's a good idea to put main inside a library or, if needed (why?), to be the default behavior.

Could it be that main() is used by some the executable and it is also included in the library by mistake? 

Cheers.

  `unicharset_extractor *.box`  giving an error in version 3.05.00 so does `mftraining`and `shapetraining`. Works fine in version 3.02.
`
 @zdenop I have installed the tesseract training tool, but how can I install `unicharset_extractor *.box`, `mftraining` `shapetraining`. Can you provide with the necessary links? 
  I'm not sure this is the best fix for the issue, but it does provide a workaround while someone works out what the root cause is and where it should really be fixed.
 I've cleaned up the cosmetic issues. 

Any insight into what the root cause is? I'm not sure that this is more than a bandaid.

  Hi, 
I noticed different results when analyzing the same PNG image having 8 different colors when it is encoded with a colormap of 8 or 256 colors.

**Version:**

```
tesseract 3.05.00dev
 leptonica-1.73
  libjpeg 8d : libpng 1.2.49 : libtiff 4.0.3 : zlib 1.2.8
```

**Demo:**
french subtitle conversion from XFiles-S01E01 (DVB). The subtitle image extracted with ProjectX as a BMP has 8 distinct colors. It was converted to PNG with two different programs.
'ok.png', 256 entries colormap:
![ok](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17527508/13379299/52a4e02c-de22-11e5-9b68-47bb8a5b5180.png)
Tesseract result is correct:

```
$ tesseract -l fra ok.png stdout
La mort a eu lieu
il y a 8 à 12 heures.
```

'nak.png' 8 entries colormap:
![nak](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17527508/13379305/6e9dd8ec-de22-11e5-910c-1c89dd76594a.png)

Tesseract result is wrong:

```
$ tesseract -l fra nak.png stdout
La morte eu lieu
il y a 8 à 12 heures.
```

 The image type is either recognized as 4 or 8 bpp but the information content is identical:

```
$ pngtopnm ok.png|md5sum
cbe58b4e03ebbe279958287e8d53f719  -
$ pngtopnm nak.png|md5sum
cbe58b4e03ebbe279958287e8d53f719  -
```

I suspect that tesseract internal processing keeps the original image bit depth and that some steps don't work as well at 4bpp as at 8bpp.

External workaround: 

```
pngtopnm nak.png | tesseract -l fra stdin stdout
La mort a eu lieu
il y a 8 à 12 heures.
```

Quick patch to do this conversion internally in libtesseract:

I am not sure if this is the correct strategy to deal with this issue, nor if it is the right place to change the data type. 4-color DVB subtitles exist, so 2bpp images should probably also be considered.

Thanks for this soft, works great for me.
-- Bruno
 Mmm yes...

Well two approaches from my point of view:

1) the user has to deal with the image format, but it should be mentioned in the man page and a warning should be issued when a palette color image is detected. Maybe the image should just be rejected.

or

2) tesseract should do its best with the data it receives and convert them to the internal format it needs for optimal processing.

I really think something should be done, because people will just (wrongly) conclude that tesseract is bad at reading a really clear-looking picture...

( I was very close to that conclusion but I was saved by the fact that previous trials with much lower quality pictures (vobsub output of ProjectX) had given the correct result for that precise subtitle. But other errors in about 10% of subtitles.)
 The 0.25 R + 0.5 G + 0.25 B calculation designed to give fast results, not accurate ones. Sounds like someone may be calling pixConvertRGBToGrayFast() instead of pixConvertRGBToGray(). This seems like a bad idea if it is affecting results. And I also don't understand why we would ever threshold on R,G,B individually. The normal thing to do is calculate luminance, then threshold on luminance.

Leptonica is really, really good at image binarization. We should be making use of it.
 @bruvi where exactly is the 0.25 R + 0.5 G + 0.25 B conversion happening?
 If we use sRGB perceptual weightings then it works.

`graymap[i] = 0.2126  * rmap[i] + 0.7152 * gmap[i] + 0.0722 * bmap[i];`

```
tesseract -l fra /tmp/nak.png -
La mort a eu lieu
il y a 8 à 12 heures.
```

If we use "Leptonica" perceptual weightings, then it fails.

`graymap[i] = 0.3 * rmap[i] + 0.5 * gmap[i] + 0.2 * bmap[i];`

```
tesseract -l fra /tmp/nak.png -
La morte eu lieu
il y a 8 à 12 heures.
```

If I remove the colormap before anything else, then it works. I think this is the right solution because it guarantees consistency (e.g. colormap vs. non-colormap will not change results if image is otherwise identical). Leptonica should switch to some sort of perceptual weighting for the next release because that is a no-brainer, but will not have any effect on Tesseract if we remove the colormap first.

 Ray is going to write the official change. Best to coordinate with him. He is doing the same thing, but with a different way of writing the code.
  I've tried to compile the main vs2010 project and even with x32 it doesn't work. requires 
allheaders.h file. 
Error   2   error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'allheaders.h': No such file or directory    

If I'm not wrong this file is a leptonica file, but leptonica is not provided in the solution. Why is this dependency still needed to compile only tesseract libraries? 
 Hi, I will edit the issue so it only have the issue itself.
  I have an image with barely 20 lines of text (I have the image that I can provide), and it's taking seconds and seconds to read the text.
I'm using VS2010.
I provided the binary image (very clean) to Tesseract. Tesseract works fine but it's too too slow.

I'm impressed by the accuracy of Tesseract, but the speed is a disaster!
I used other commercial OCR engines: accuracy less but speed much faster.

how to improve the speed of tesseract? anyway to read an image in few 100s of milliseconds.

thanks
 I posted my message on the google groups,
  I have tested latest release 3.05 on windows platform to OCR Arabic document to PDF (searchable) and when choose text from output PDF file it seems stored in opposite (left to right) and letters should be stored from (Right to left)!!!

i.e. original text In Arabic is
مرحبا
Stored in PDF as text as
ابحرم
 ​please put your sample file and the command you used for ocr job​
 This is the command:

tesseract  c:\temp\test_ara.jpg  -l ara  -psm 3  c:\temp\test_ara pdf

Files are attached (source JPG and output PDF)

![test_ara](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17473681/13320324/bc160e22-dbd0-11e5-8090-6f3728fcc06d.jpg)
[test_ara.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/146534/test_ara.pdf)

please check original word
أنحاء
output inside PDF is
ءاحنا
 Command and Samples are attached now in the previous comment
 @amitdo 
is there any way to reach a better accuracy in Arabic language until to change to new engine?
now with tesseract i get about 100% accuracy  in English but for Arabic result is about 30-40%
but for example i checked google drive ocr for Arabic and i see it have 100 results for same image..

can we work on language data for a better results?
 I am using Adobe Reader.
But please note that words are not reversed while viewing the PDF because it contains the original image with text layer.
I mean when you copy text layer then paste it to any text editor it will be reversed, so now can't search for the text inside the PDF because it is stored revered inside the text layer!
 This is a serious issue with the PDF output feature using Arabic Language and similar languages that be written from right to left
 I try hard to make sure Arabic and other right-to-left languages work correctly in Tesseract PDF. As the problem is isolated further I'm happy to look, but I'm not aware of any reason things would have broken. 
 A quick check shows Chrome gives good results (as per amitdo) and Acroread gives bad results (as per tbadran). This is surprising, I thought we were good with Acroread. I wonder if this is a regression and if so when it occurred.
 Regarding recognition accuracy, that's a better topic for the forum. But in short: Don't compare against Google Drive. Don't expect major accuracy improvements unless/until Ray is successful with his ideas. And most importantly, don't trust any predictions about 'soon'. That last one is true for all software everywhere.
 Please note my testing using the binaries for Windows downloaded from:
http://domasofan.spdns.eu/tesseract/ 
and I am Using Windows 10 with Acrobat Pro 11 to view output PDF file
 I have tested multiple different sample files not only sample uploaded above and every time getting same issue in output PDF on windows 10 + Acrobat Pro 11
 On OS X, I'm seeing the opposite of earlier reports: 
- Acrobat Reader DC 15.10.20056.167417 appears correct when cutting & pasting
- Google Chrome Version 48.0.2564.116 (64-bit) appears backwards
 Adobe Acrobat:

امهمه مني اهادم

Google Chrome

 I find it a little easier to test with Hebrew because the letters do not connect. Tesseract version 3.03 behaves the same, so this is not a regression. Will need to think about this, because it is not obvious what exactly is going wrong. Lots of PDF files do a crazy 'write it backwards' strategy but that should not be required. Tesseract writes in reading order.
 There are two things I can think of doing. One is to give up and write Arabic 
backwards (which I really hate!). The other is  to put an entry in  the PDF
metadata, Catalog/ViewerPreferences/Direction. Will continue thinking about
this, slowly.
 @amitdo Hebrew has the exact same problem as Arabic.
 That's another possibility, thanks for the suggestion.
 There are a number of issues relating to RTL and Arabic. Can they all be labelled with 'Arabic' for ease of finding, so that duplicate issues are not created.

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues?q=Arabic+in%3Atitle%2Cbody
gives a list of the same.
 That's good news. I promise that we'll give it a try as soon as it is available.
 Thanks.

 The tesseract/langdata/ara repo has the 3.04 source files for Arabic
language data.

The Arabic traineddata is based on cube engine and is the 3.02version.

 >​is there any milestone to drop cube completely!?​

This issue is not caused by cube.

See https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/40#issuecomment-263039665 The Adobe folks suggested a few things to try, none of which worked so far. Still open and (relatively) active. Please tell us which pdf viewer you already tested if any. @jbreiden  Here is a more thorough examination of "ara.pdf" [that you posted in your comment](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/238#issuecomment-296256374)

1) Wrong sentence order: 
    some sentences are over-stepping their location in the paragraph, I discovered that this was caused by the software used to view the pdf, in my case Chrome, but after using Windows Reader the problem was solved.

![ara](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16248376/25373915/1eb574ba-29a4-11e7-8c5d-5bb4d0d1480d.jpg)


2) Repetitive mistakes:
    ( لا ) is wrongly represented as ( ال ) , which is actually opposite to the correct spelling. 
    ( ، ) is the Arabic Comma, is wrongly represented as ( ء ) or ( , ) or ( . ) or ( » )
    ( اً ) is represented by only ( ا ) , which is missing (  ً   ) 
    some rare cases of multiple combined words, there are 2 separate cases ( مرحامستبشرا ) and( منالناس ) ,    should be ( مرحاً مستبشرا ) and ( من الناس )


3) Rare Case:
    When I copied the text to Microsoft Word, most of the font was in Arial font except of a couple of ( . ) full-stops which were in Calibri font, a weird thing to see.

Conclusion:
Altogether, except for the mistakes that I stated earlier, the recognition rate was very good in this sample.

Note that in the Arabic language, the state of ( لا ) is frequently used, so-much that if this misrepresentation of it as ( ال ) is continued, it would degrade the recognition rate drastically.

 Hebrew report:

I highlighted the text in each pdf viewer, and pasted it to gedit.

With Chromium the straight version is mostly fine. There are problems when there is a combination of Hebrew and English/other ltr symbols in the same line.
The skewed version is not fine. The words appear in wrong order in each line.

The pasted text of the straight version does not look good when Evince and pdf.js are used.
pdf.js - there are line breaks after each word.
Evince - total mess. Wrong line breaks and wrong word order. Unusable. It will be helpful to compare the pasted text of these files to Tesseract's text renderer output, to see if each issue is really caused by the pdf renderer or by the ocr engine itself. I think we should also compare to the current (4.00 with lstm) pdf output, without your patch.
The original issue, reversed letters, was with the Adobe pdf viewer, not the other viewers.
  @christophered

The source of the 3 first mistakes in your 'Repetitive mistakes' section is the ocr engine itself, not the pdf renderer.

#648 is a more suitable place to report about them.
( لا ) vs ( ال ) is a known issue. See https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/648#issuecomment-285633162 and the comments below it.  >some rare cases of multiple combined words

It's not clear if the source for this issue is the pdf renderer or the ocr engine itself. I discovered that the Sentence disorder is caused by Chrome which I used to view the PDF.
Note that after using Windows Reader the PDF was viewed correctly without the disorder that I mentioned. @christophered,
We want that it will be displayed fine in all major pdf viewers, not just one. >Note that after using Windows Reader the PDF was viewed correctly

Which Windows version?

If you have Windows 10, try to open the pdf file with the Edge browser, and report how it is displayed there. I am using Windows 8 Amit, the PDF displays the original image only, so lookswise it will be the
same. It is the text layer, as copied or saved which is different.

I can test on windows10 and post the result. Someone else will have to tell
if it is ok or not.

Even with legacy Devanagari fonts that use Latin range, I have found that
copied text is different between Adobe reader and foxit reader.

@Shreeshrii :
>Amit, the PDF displays the original image only, so lookswise it will be the same. It is the text layer, as copied or saved which is different. 

Yes. Although I said 'displayed', I meant to refer to the "invisible text layer underneath the visible image, which can be copied and pasted to text editor".

I just made a shortcut, assuming people will understand what I really meant. 
Maybe I should add **excuse the brevity, sent from my PC** to my comments...
:rofl:  @amitdo funny joke :) I downloaded ara.pdf (EXPERIMENT) version and opened in Adobe Reader XI and Foxit Reader 8.1 under Windows 10 and copied and pasted the text in Notepad++ under Windows 10.

Both text files look different - with text order being opposite of each other. Please see attached.

 Additionally, on windows 10, in both Edge as well as the windows 10 pdf reader I am not able to copy text. 

Text copied in Chrome version is similar to Foxit, but with additional line breaks. @christophered can check whether the order is also changed.

[ara-chrome.txt](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/957672/ara-chrome.txt)
 Windows 10 - Internet Explorer - text matches output from Adobe Reader XI.

[ara-internet-explorer.txt](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/957692/ara-internet-explorer.txt)
 @Shreeshrii ARA-FOXIT-8.1.txt is the most adequate one in terms of sentence organization. 

It seems that Chrome splits the sentence into half, each at a new line. I only checked the straight version of the Hebrew document.

The control is much worst with Evince and pdf.js.
`Hello` ->  `olleH` (pdf.js) / `o l l e H`  (Evince)

Chromium: The two look the same, except the two last lines.
Both are not good, but the experiment is worst than the control.
The digits in the zip code and the phone numbers are in the wrong order.
`123-4567890` -> `0987654-321`
The date on top `21.07.2009` is OK.

I will check the skewed version later.  Skewed version, Chromium:

Both have wrong word order in each line (but not exactly the same).

Experiment:
The second word in the document is missing.
Two separate lines become one. Hebrew line + English line (site address).
Last lines - same issue as the straight version. @amitdo 
Using the latest Tesseract  4.0 alpha and the latest best Arabic model, I created a searchable pdf output:

- When using Chrome to view the pdf, the text can be selected/copied/pasted correctly (RTL).
- When using Adobe Acrobat Reader 17.012 (latest to date), though the text is displayed correctly, but when selected/pasted, is in reverse text (LTR). @amitdo 
Using the latest ABBYY FineReader 14 to create a searchable pdf:
- Both Chrome and Adobe Acrobat Reader can select/copy/paste correctly.

Conclusion:
It seems that Tesseract needs tweaking to solve this problem.

It could be worse if you were rapidly losing your sanity :-)

You are using a simple reverse here. That's not good enough for bidi text.  I wonder what is improved ver. 3.04. more detail especially these list.
- Improved font identification
- Fixed problems with shifted baselines so recognition can recover from layout analysis errors.
- Improved single column layout analysis
- Many bug fixes.

  I using tessract Android (tess-two) on nexus 7 and pc(core i5), with 1 image 1024x200
nexus 7:  10s and pc: 1s, what happen? Is there any way improve speed ocr when using in Android? Please help me! Thank.
 Some things that might make it faster are:
Select a smaller region from mGray where your text is, before createBitmap - so the more heavy methods that follow process a smaller image.
Changing Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888 to Bitmap.Config.RGB_565 - your image is grayscale, it will not need a ARGB bitmap.

  I've noticed a couple of mixed language items which cause Tessearct v3.04.01 (Leptonica 1.72) to crash:

Interestingly, this appears to depend on the order of the languages – using `-l ara` or `-l fra` alone avoids the crash but specifying both in either order will cause it to crash.
 I had the same question but the behaviour is identical either with that environmental variable or even using Tesseract which wasn't built with OpenCL at all:

```

 I updated the title. It wasn't clear that these were related since Arabic works fine on its own.

The commit which you referenced is shown as being included in the version (3.04.01) I'm using.
 I just ran into the exact same problem. Arabic alone is processed successfully, but when I try to get Arabic and English read at the same time, tesseract crashes. I'm using Windows version 3.05.00dev.

Another question (I'm totally new to tesseract): When I use arabic language recognition and I read a text with arabic letters, but latin numbers, the latin numbers are not recognized (that's why I wanted to add English as recognition language). In the file "ara.cube.lm" I found the line

`Digits=٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩0123456789`

Does this mean,latin numbers should be recognized when I only use arabic as recognition language?
 Here's the stack trace for the crash

but I think the problem is actually in either `classify_word_and_language` callees (`RetryWithLanguage` or the individual recognizers) which shouldn't be returning no words (like the double exclamation points imply) or in `ClassifyBlobAsWord` which shouldn't assume that there's always a raw choice available.

The latter is easier to do and I was too lazy to dig further into the recognizer, so I generated a patch for that which I'll post.
 Hi All,

Does Tesseract support script identification. I have bilingual pages and two different model for different scripts. I want to use a script identifier on each word and call my models accordingly for recognition.
Help will be appreciated.
 @anupamaray Please use the mailing list for questions (and don't hijack issues about unrelated topics). You'll get better answers if you include more details about the scripts, languages, etc.
 Is this issue still exist in 4.00 (code in master)?

Probably not, since cube was removed.

It never had tesseract model files in it...

 ```

Error in pixScanForForeground: invalid box

```
The original issue here should be tagged and tested against the 3.05 branch since it is related to cube. the ara.config file in ara.traineddata uses oem 1 (originally for cube and now for LSTM).

The current issue being seen with 4.0alpha, ara not working for --oem 0 and --oem 2 is to be expected since there is no Tesseract model for the Arabic language. So, instead of segfault, the message displayed should be something like the following ...

"Tesseract requested but not present, LSTM engine used instead".

Later, if non-LSTM recognizer is removed this will not apply. Yes Shree, you are right.  Hello,

I've been trying to use the C API of Tesseract for [PyOCR](https://github.com/jflesch/pyocr) (and so, indirectly, [Paperwork](https://github.com/jflesch/paperwork/)).

To do so, I've been looking for a way to pass an in-memory image to Tesseract (to avoid the use of temporary files). There is a function `TessBaseAPIProcessPage()`, but I've found no way to create the `struct Pix` it requires.

There is a C++ function `ProcessPagesFileList` that appears to do the job, but C functions are much  much easier to bind with Python than C++ ones.

Thanks in advance for your help,
 Sorry, my bad.
  The current multi-page TIFF handling is seriously sub-optimal. First, it unnecessarily reads the entire file into memory which can tie up many MB of memory unnecessarily when pages are being processed in a streaming fashion. Second, I'm pretty sure that accessing by page number causes the entire buffer to be parsed from the beginning every time incurring both processing cost and memory thrashing.
 Please be careful with changes. It is very important not to break streaming support. 

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/FAQ#how-to-do-streaming
 Whoever makes the changes will have to make sure that all the tests in the test suite pass, just like any other change to the code base.

Of course this wouldn't be necessary if, when streaming support was added, it was done with some recognition of the performance impact rather than just leaving comments like "To keep code simple we will also buffer data coming from a file." https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/api/baseapi.cpp#L1119
 I plead guilty on all counts. I wrote the streaming feature, I failed to write a test, I introduced the performance regression, I wrote the comment, and either I didn't notice the performance regression or failed to properly consider it. 

I will attempt to write a test for streaming, and will work with you on TIFF. TIFF is historically tricky for two reasons. One is the duplicated functionality on the OpenCL path. Hard to synchronize and hard to test. I personally can't seem to run the OpenCL path at all without a segfault. Second, under win32 is it hard or impossible to pass a file descriptor between different DLLs. Which is awkward because the libtiff API prefers to work with file descriptors instead of file pointers.
 @jbreiden I don't see any particular reason that your feature should be the first to have a test. As far as I can tell, there are no tests at all for the entire program. Can you point to a more complete description of the file descriptor issue? Does TIFFClientOpen help at all?

Some random, possibly relevant, tidbits:
- "TIFF is not a streamable format" - http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/faq.html#q7
- the "streaming" support doesn't stream - at least for anything other than a list of file names. All other formats are read entirely into memory before any processing starts. That's a pretty narrow definition of streaming.
- file format sniffing requires 12 bytes, no more
- multi-page tiff is on an entirely separate code path, which may make it easier to handle differently
 I was intimately familiar with the topic a decade ago. I have
tried my best to repress the memories.

http://www.asmail.be/msg0054669449.html

It's nice that the filename is already being passed around;
if we're lucky, maybe we can get what you need without any
API changes. Just out of curiosity, what are you using
multipage TIFF for? I usually think fax images, which are
relatively tiny.

You are right, the streaming feature is super narrow. But
it is important for book digitization.
 @tfmorris  How about something like this? If you are happy with it, I'll hand this change over to Ray for review and eventual inclusion. No API changes. I think functionally it is exactly the same, except that a multipage TIFF from a file does not get buffered.

 I didn't mean to complain about this without offering a solution. I took a crack at this here: https://github.com/tfmorris/tesseract/tree/tiff-streaming
but it turned into a bit of a yak shaving exercise, so I dropped it. The main roadblock was that the "right" solution is to implement more reasonable support in Leptonica which exposes more of libTIFFs underlying capabilities. libTIFF knows how to do efficient access, it just gets lost on the way up through the layers.

Some other notes (mostly from memory, so take with a grain of salt):
- file sniffing only needs/uses 12 bytes, so not very much needs to be buffered
- file sniffing only returns top level TIFF container format, so all the other TIFF_foo checks can be removed
- libTIFF is positioned on the next directory after an image is read an knows how to read it directly, but it's Leptonica's readImage(N+1), that forces a rewind, then read 0, read 1, read 2, ..., read N, read N+1.

I'll review your proposal in more detail tomorrow to see how it compares with what I started implementing.
 Hello TMorris,

Jeff just told me about this thread.  And thank you for pointing out the unsatisfactory condition of the multi-tiff read function.

The leptonica buck stops with me, and I made a small change that brings it down to linear (not quadratic).  I will have it up on github later today.

  -- Dan
 The patch from me above only buffers images coming from stdin. We could try to optimize this more and limit that buffer to 12 bytes, but it is not obvious how useful that is. I'm guessing it isn't worth even a little extra complexity.
 Looking at my "fix" again, I believe it does NOT succeed in making the read time for N pages linear in N.  The problem is that TIFFSetDirectory() always starts at directory 0 in the search.  The way to fix this is to use the lower-level functions that TIFFSetDirectory() uses to walk through the directories, grabbing the image at each directory.  I'll attempt to remedy this in the next day or so.  
 @DanBloomberg Thanks for looking at this. Your most recent comment matches my (slightly vague) memory of how I thought things worked.

@jbreiden I'm not really in a position to make value judgements about what's worthwhile and what's not since I'm not familiar with the user base. I think my general plan of attack to keep things clean was to refactor to use the Leptonica stream functions (e.g. pixReadStreamTiff rather than pixReadTiff and pixReadMemTiff), but that would depend on Leptonica being smart enough to handle the page N -> page N+1 case without seeking (or introducing a new pure streaming API).
 OK, it's all properly linearized.  No refactoring, no low level functions, no api change, no static vars required.

See github.com/danbloomberg/leptonica.
 @tfmorris 

To implement this properly in tesseract, where you only want one image in memory at the same time, use the same approach that I just did in pixReadMultipageTiff():
- get a FILE stream
- use the FILE stream to get a TIFF stream
- loop:
  - read the pix from the TIFF stream
  - do the OCR
  - call TIFFReadDirectory() to advance to the next image

The last function is a naked tiff library call.  Jeff says that currently all the tiff reading functions are leptonica calls.
 @DanBloomberg Thanks for the outline (and for the new functionality!) Do you seeing any risk in going around Leptonica to libTIFF or do you consider this to be stable enough to be a non-issue?

@jbreiden I'm happy to take another crack at this or leave you to it. Let me know.
 There are two separable things under discussion here. The first is the unnecessary buffering. By the way, I checked and file sniffing does indeed return things like IFF_TIFF_G4. I think it makes sense to use my patch. @theraysmith has reviewed it, taken ownership, and will submit it to github.

The other topic is TIFF performance. I don't think I want to tackle that one. It's not technically difficult to write a couple libtiff calls to fix the performance problem. However, this would give Tesseract a new, direct build dependency on libtiff. That seems significant enough to warrant discussion on the development mailing list. I don't know how much of an obstacle that would be for users who build from source; it seems that many already struggle with dependencies.

I'll talk with Dan about whether there are any other options that make sense.
 Jeff and I agree that you need a direct dependency on the TIFF data
structure in the tiff library to use the linear method.

As for stability, tiff lib has been extremely stable for 20 years or so --
I wouldn't worry about that.

 If Ray & Jeff have agreed the correct course of action, I'll defer.
 Tom, Ray hasn't weighed in yet.  I believe the question comes down to (1) a
comparison between the amount of time to seek to an image in a tiff file
with many images, vs. the time to OCR that image and (2) the "cost" of
having tesseract depend explicitly on the TIFF library (i.e., using TIFF
data structures and library calls directly).

I don't know either of these two things.  Do you have a timing for a seek
of hundreds of images in a large multipage tiff file?

 Ray is kind of busy so he may be slow to submit my buffering patch to github. It is okay for someone else to submit if time is of the essence.

Regarding the TIFF performance issue, I see it in two places. So far we've been discussing TessBaseAPI::ProcessPagesMultipageTiff but we have the exact some problem in MasterTrainer::LoadPageImages

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/dd8c12997385cf7f5961093bcd44f0396b08f96f/classify/mastertrainer.cpp#L219
 It's been a while since I looked at it (and don't have time to recheck now), but that looks about like what I remember thinking would be good.
 Yes, I hope to get it out in two weeks.  Do you want a not-yet-debian
'beta' to try?

 Right.  It's necessary to replace the last arg. in functions like
pixGetRegionsBinary(), which is an integer flag, with either NULL
(corresponding to 0) or a pixa struct (which corresponds to 1).  I'll try
to do this.

Isn't it possible to write code which supports both old and new (> 1.73) Leptonica (using conditional compilation)? I'd prefer such a solution, at least until Leptonica 1.73 or older is no longer used in current distributions. I will work with Dan next week to try to keep as much compatibility as
possible.

 Thanks, Jeff.

I believe this is an unusual situation where a leptonica interface that
tesseract uses has been changed.
And I want to apologize for the trouble it has caused.

There is a trivial change to textord/imagefind.cpp that fixes this: replace
the last arg in pixGenHalftoneMask() by NULL.
This will skip the debug output images in this function, but it should be
acceptable, and later if someone really wants the extra few debug images we
can add the code to save them.

 Let’s talk before Leptonica 1.74 ships. There is a distribution headache if the existing, unmodified Tesseract 3.0.4 can't compile and run with Leptonica 1.74. ​The alternative to updating the pixGenHalftoneMask() function in tesseract
is to make a wrapper in leptonica for the existing tesseract function. This
would simply call the new leptonica function with NULL for the last arg.

 Here is my unofficial take on the ABI shared object version numbers. Jeff
knows about these details and can correct if I'm wrong.

With the Debian releases, we will need to increase the *shared object
version number* (which is different from the leptonica release number) with
any change in the ABI.  The Debian leptonica *soversion* for 1.73 is 5.0.0,
and for 1.74 I believe that we'll increase it to 6.0.0.

The meaning of these three digits is, for the shared object name
*whatever.so.X.Y.Z*, we increment

    X if the ABI release is backwards incompatible
    Y if the ABI release is backwards compatible (with interface changes)
    Z if there are only internal changes (no change to the ABI)

So if I write the wrapper mentioned above, and that were the only change,
then the ABI would be backwards compatible and we'd only need to increment
to 5.1.0 for the next Debian release.  (However, there have been other
changes, including the removal of deprecated functions.)

 I've added the wrapper for pixGenHalftoneMask(), so the (not yet released
1.74) git master now should be compatible with tesseract 3.0.4.

With this, tesseract can be changed at your convenience to use the new
interface pixGenerateHalftoneMask() with NULL for the last arg, and both
will compile.  We'll keep the old version in leptonica until there is no
further need to use it with tesseract.

 Just released leptonica 1.74.0 on github  :-) I found this issue while searching for a bug I've been encountering: In a multi-page tiff file, the text is only being extracted from the last page when using Tesseract API [`TessBaseAPIProcessPages`] (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1138)

Leptonica has a method called `pixaReadMultipageTiff `, would that need to be used instead? 

  hi 
this project support persian language ?
if no
how can i help for support persian ?
 ​hi
no, there is a on dead project to add Persian to tesseract

you can find it at ​https://github.com/roozgar/PersianOcr
and send any support request here ...
 @amitdo is there any document about futures of new engine?!
  Hi,

I have test set that only has "uppercase English alphabets" and "numbers".
Is there a way to modify the existing traineddata file so that it only reads upper case alphabets and numbers?

thanks in advance
  Takes advantage of inheritance and default of `dir="ltr"` to:
- only generate paragraph `dir` attributes which are not `ltr`
- only generate word `dir` attributes which don't match enclosing paragraph

Tested against LTR, RTL, and mixed direction files. Files for the latter two cases are in a separate PR
 OK. I was hoping the scheme could be extended to pages or careas later, but I've made the suggested change and updated the branch.
 Rebased against current head and added fix for Microsoft build breakage introduced by #226. Apply this before #224.
 Closing in favor of a merged PR which incorporates both #223 and #224
  ```
# TESSDATA_PREFIX=/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/tessdata

# echo $TESSDATA_PREFIX

# tesseract test.jpg test.txt digits
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v3.04.00 with Leptonica
Error opening data file /usr/share/tessdata/eng.traineddata
Please make sure the TESSDATA_PREFIX environment variable is set to the parent directory of your "tessdata" directory.
Failed loading language 'eng'
Tesseract couldn't load any languages!
Could not initialize tesseract.
```

Note: there is indeed no `eng.traineddata` file in `/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/tessdata`  (there are a bunch of other `eng.xxx` files but no .traineddata), so it is expected to get an error, **_but**_ the error message says it failed to open **_/usr/share/tessdata/eng.traineddata**_ while `TESSDATA_PREFIX` is set to **_/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/tessdata**_.
So, either the file path in the error message is not the actual path of the file that is not found, or tesseract is ignoring the variable TESSDATA_PREFIX, in which case the error message is wrong when it says "make sure the TESSDATA_PREFIX environment variable....".

Whichever the case, something is buggy, regardless of the fact that I have no eng.traineddata file anywhere and I don't expect tesseract to work. I just expect a consistent error message.
 > So, if your tessdata dir is in the /usr/share/tesseract-ocr dir, 
> TESSDATA_PREFIX should be set to /usr/share/tesseract-ocr.

Oh, that's strange, because I later figured out the `export` thing, and I did `export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/tessdata`, and it did work. Actually, it works both with and without `/tessdata`

Now I get `read_params_file: Can't open digits`, but that's another story I guess.

Of course, but it obviously isn't in my case.
 > @teo1978: well it could be the same story, because config files has to be with expected directory 
> structure in TESSDATA_PREFIX...

No, because I fixed `export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/usr/share/tesseract-ocr`, and the _Can't open digits_ error persists
 It wasn't. Apparently the installation of the language package was a mess. Some files (including configs/digits) were in /usr/share/tessdata; others (eng.\* but not eng.traineddata) were in /usr/share/tesseract-ocr/tessdata; and eng.traineddata wasn't anywhere (I'm positive because I did a `find`), so I had downloaded it manually where the other eng.\* files were...
 This report appears to be from a Debian system or similar. If Tesseract was installed via the standard mechanism (apt-get) then the package maintainer has already made life easy. Because everything goes to a standard and known location, there is no need to set any environment variables such as TESSDATA_PREFIX. Or take any other manual installation action. The English language data (including eng.traineddata) is in the tesseract-ocr-eng package. I am the Tesseract package maintainer for Debian systems.

Here is the list of files of tesseract-ocr-eng
https://packages.debian.org/sid/all/tesseract-ocr-eng/filelist
 Yes this is on Debian 6.

>  If Tesseract was installed via the standard mechanism (apt-get) then the package maintainer has already made life easy.

Or he should have. We had installed tesseract-ocr and tesseract-ocr-eng via `apt-get`, and it was so broken (or so obsolete) that `tesseract -v` would issue an error message saying `-v` was an invalid option. That's why I went through the hell of compiling it from scratch.

> The English language data (including eng.traineddata) is in the tesseract-ocr-eng package.

Maybe the eng.traineddata file was not included, for whatever reason, in the Debian 6 version of the package. I have seen a lot of questions in forums about the same issue (eng.traineddata missing after installing the package).
 You can think of Debian as a curated software collection. Debian 6 was released on February 6th, 2011 and all its packages are from that era. It contained Tesseract 2.04 which is ancient history. Please note that Debian 6 is officially obsolete, and the current stable release is Debian 8.  See https://www.debian.org/releases/

Unlike some other operating systems, best practice for Debian is to update the entire distribution if you want more recent versions of programs. Trying to install a modern Tesseract on an older Linux distribution is really tricky, especially because there are a lot of dependencies involved. I strongly do not recommend it.
 Actually debian 6 is LTS until this 29 of February https://wiki.debian.org/LTS

So, I would have expected a packgage for Debian 6 to be maintained to not become "ancient history" until, well, just now.
 You missed several important points:
- Debian LTS only provides security maintenance.
- Debian LTS is not supported by the normal Debian maintainers, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies.

As @jbreiden already said, you have the option to upgrade to a newer version of Debian. Or you can also take any other current distribution.
  As discussed at length in issue #182, the existing pdf.ttf causes difficulties
for certain PDF viewers, in part because the old file had zero advance width.

With testing, sharp2.ttf seems to be the best available compromise, although
it's not perfect and causes some visual difficulties in Evince.  It does
seem to fix Kindle and OS X Preview.
 Test PDF is here:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/119875/simple-1.pdf
 I have checked: Acrobat XI, Google Chrome PDF Viewer, OS X Preview, Safari PDF viewer; all on El Capitan.
 See #182 for other tests people did with sharp2.ttf
 Chromium and Adobe Reader on Linux are fine. I have reports that Ghostscipt and friends are okay. I should probably double check Android right now.
 Latest stock Android (Marshmallow) is fine.
 Using `sample-1.pdf` from above in the latest pdf.js results in the 2nd word highlighting properly, while the 1st word's highlight is offset. I don't think this is a regression (and it might actually be an improvement) as there were highlighting-offset issues using the previous pdf.ttf with pdf.js. Related to https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/6863.

 I've been tracking the Firefox offset problem in https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/6509 and it looks like it has gotten a little worse with this change. (I take that back; your screenshot is worse but mine looks the same. Maybe you are using a different zoom level in Firefox or something)

  ```

But when I run:

```
$ tesseract -v

Either something is broken, or some informative error message is missing in the configure and/or make and/or install phase.

 Yep, but the message says "leptonica not found", it should say "libleptonica-dev not found".
How am I supposed to guess that "leptonica" means libleptonica-dev?

PEBCAK, but whose chair and keyboard?

Also,

> If you are not familiar with compiling software on your operation system it is not tesseract problem.

It is a documentation problem then. I am not familiar with compiling software indeed, but every time I have done it with other software, I usually follow the steps in the documentation and they work out of the box, and the requirements are specified clearly. 

Also, I wouldn't have to compile it at all if there was a decent Debian package not so riduculously obsolete that it doesn't even recognize the -v option.
 Not even with this:

```
$ export LIBLEPT_HEADERSDIR=/usr/include
$ ./configure --with-extra-libraries=/usr/lib
```

which are the paths where the headers and the library respectively are.
 I'd prefer a less inflammatory title for this bug report, please. Also, may I ask why you aren't installing Tesseract via apt-get? Debian Stable ships with version 3.03, see https://packages.qa.debian.org/t/tesseract.html

```
$ sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

$ tesseract -v
tesseract 3.03
 leptonica-1.70
  libgif 4.1.6(?) : libjpeg 8d : libpng 1.2.50 : libtiff 4.0.3 : zlib 1.2.8 : webp 0.4.0
```
 > Also, may I ask why you aren't installing Tesseract via apt-get?

Because that's how it had been installed in the first place, and `tesseract -v` gave an error not recognizing the `-v` option. **This is on Debian 6**
 > @teo1978: this is standard autotools error message. [...] Name of needed package could be different base on distribution.

That's no excuse. It should still specify that it needs the headers, i.e. _-dev_ package. There's no way the person installing should know whether the binary package or the headers package is required, regardless of the actual names.

Besides, I don't know what "autotools error message" means, but the error message is hard-coded in the `configure` file, so it could be easily edited.

Also note that the error message **_"leptonica library missing"**_ issued when the `pixCreate` check fails (whatever that means)  is very confusing too. "Leptonica library missing" seems to indicate that the leptonica library is missing. Instead, you get this message when the leptonica library is actually found and something, which is not clear what it is, is missing. That error message is clearly useful to those who wrote and/or maintain tesseract, but is completely obscure to anyone else.

**This issue should be reopened**
 This issue should not be re-opened, and let me explain why. Tesseract uses a venerable and very common build system called autotools. (And I'll admit, autotools has a well deserved reputation for being complicated.) This build system is designed to work with many different operating systems, not just Linux. Over the years it has supported operating systems like Solaris, Ultrix, AIX, Cygwin, OS X, and many, many others. Each of these operating systems can have wildly different ideas about organization and packaging of software. The autotools system created the `configure` file, and its error messages are therefore are not tailored to any particular operating system.  

You are running into issues and error messages that are really for developers or system integrators to deal with. As a user, the recommended procedure is to not worry about integrating Tesseract into your computer starting from source code, but rather take advantage of the packaging work done by others. Update your Linux distribution to the modern era, install tesseract with the standard tools, and it will work. The alternative is doing a ton of system administration work (not just with Tesseract, but with its entire chain of dependencies) that is not particularly fun or easy.

If you really want to learn about the nuances of autotools, there are entire books written about it such as https://www.sourceware.org/autobook/autobook/autobook_toc.html However, I respectfully suggest spending the time and brain cells on something else. I expect that most software will eventually move to simpler and better build systems in future decades. 
 > This issue should not be re-opened, and let me explain why.

You  have only explained the cause of the issue.

I think you misunderstood the point I made in comment https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/215#issuecomment-181944624
What I meant is not that the error message should give you the exact name of the package - I do understand that can change from OS to OS- but it could **easily** be more informative in telling you that it's missing the _headers_ and not the actual library.

>  The autotools system created the configure file

That doesn't mean you can't edit it.

> You are running into issues and error messages that are really for developers or system integrators to deal with. **As a user**, the recommended procedure is to **not** worry about integrating Tesseract into your computer starting **from source code**

That's the whole essence of this issue (and I guess many others): that is a **plain wrong approach**. 
Granted, the _recommended_ procedure is to take advantage of package, but you should take into account that the recommended procedure **is not always an option**. 

**A user may well have to compile the software** from source code, either because the distribution he needs to install it on is not "from the modern era" - by the way, Debian 6 is **just 5 years old**; let me ask a question: would you tell somebody trying to install tesseract on **Windows Vista** (released 2007) to upgrade their OS to the modern era? - or because it's a distribution for which there's no package at all.

I know compiling is not supposed to be particuarly easy for the end user, but there's no need to make it more painful than it could easily be. I have had to compile software from source quite a few times, though I am no developer (of the software I had to compile) or system integrator, and usually they come with an unambiguous list of requirements, a set of steps to follow (typically run a bash script that ships with the source code, then configure, then make and make install, like in this case) and they **usually work out of the box**. And **when they don't**, you definitely know right away what you're missing from a glance at an error message. If neither of these is the case, then I'm sorry but it's poorly maintained software.

In this issue I am reporting the fact that the error messages issued when the leptonica _headers_ are missing or when some stuff related to a `pixCreate` thing is missing (what is that? a function in the library whose inavailability means the version of the library doesn't meet the requirements?), are poor. This could easily, and hence should, be improved. You explained perfectly (it was already clear) why the situation is what it is, but that's no valid reason for not improving it. 

You confuse an explanation of why the problem exists with an argumentation that it is not a problem (which unfortunately is, I have to admit, a pretty common mistake).
 I'm having the same problem, and I can't figure out how to solve it. 
 Please use [Tesseract users forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/tesseract-ocr) and ask this question (and other questions you might have) there.
 > Please use Tesseract users forum and ask this question (and other questions you might have) there.

What about fixing the bug instead, so that the error message is clear enough and there's nothing to figure out?
 any solution to this issue? >any solution to this issue?

Yes.
* Most users should install the version that is available through the package manager of their distro.
 * **Advanced  users** can try to install a newer version from source. They should follow the instruction in the wiki.
* If a user still have problems installing the software, he/she should use the forum for support.

Like it or not, that's our solution. Try using "make install" after "make " inside your leptonica-1.xx folder  Can Tesseract be used for music sheet recognition? 
 No, but it is used by Audiveris (https://audiveris.kenai.com/) which can.
 Didn't know that Tesseract can be used for recognizing notations!. Just what I needed. So what is OCR used in Audiveris for?
Thanks 🙏🏿 
Ananth Got it! Many Thanks. So is OpenCV my best option? What about other deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow?
Cheers
Ananth  Hello,

Refer to issue #169, I spend long time trying to modified language files.
Do you have a plan to update Arabic Language files in the coming releases.

Many Thanks in Advance 
  Hi,
I recently started using tesseract to help unclutter my desk at home, so forgive me if this is a n00b question/request.

I use textcleaner from Fred's ImageMagick Scripts to cleanup my scanned images for better OCR accuracy. However, the images that are optimized for OCR do not necessarily look good from a human standpoint, and I would like the final OCR'd PDF to look visually identical to the original scan.

So here's my feature request: Add an optional argument to take a cleaned image. Example invocation: tesseract -l eng -psm 4 --cleaned-image ${SRC}_cleaned.pnm ${SRC}.pnm out pdf

It will use ${SRC}.pnm to generate the final PDF image but layout detection, character recognition, etc. will be done using the --cleaned-image argument for better accuracy. That way the user will be given a final PDF that looks like the original but searches as well as the cleaned-up image.

I'd be surprised if nobody has already thought of this, so maybe work is already underway or maybe it's not possible. Thoughts?
 zdenop: Yes, that is correct. I want to run OCR on image_b (improved for OCR), but include image_a (original) in the resulting PDF.

BTW - I just realized that there is a user forum (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tesseract-ocr). Maybe somebody has asked / answered my question there. My apologies for not looking at that forum earlier.
 Please post an example of a cleaned vs uncleaned image where accuracy improves significantly. Or even better, point to some documentation that has some examples. In the long term, one would hope that OCR could improve such that having a separate cleaned image is unnecessary.

Regarding this feature request, I think it is probably better to use an outside utility that can replace the images in a Tesseract produced PDF. The caller is already generating a separate set of clean images, so is therefore comfortable with pre/post processing. This approach lets us keep the design intent and implementation of PDF generation simple ('don't mess with the images'). I don't know if such a tool exists already, but based on my knowledge of the Tesseract PDF it shouldn't be too hard to write. Apologies, but I am not volunteering to write one unless I need it myself for something. The closest existing thing I know about is OverlayPDF from Apache PDFBox. Previously mentioned here. https://www.mail-archive.com/tesseract-ocr@googlegroups.com/msg11853.html

Also, if you really want to hack Tesseract to do what you are asking for, the code is in api/pdfrenderer.cc. You would have to replace both the pix and the filename. I'd just be reluctant to make this a general feature of Tesseract.

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/api/pdfrenderer.cpp#L894
 Hi jbreiden,
There are lots of tutorials on-line for how to clean-up images for improved accuracy OCR out there, just use your favorite search engine. Here's a good one from 2014 (not too old): http://www.christophermchurch.com/my-struggles-with-ocr-and-microfilm-scans/ . Yes, it would be nice if OCR engines were perfect and didn't need cleaned-up images. But that's currently not a realistic expectation when papers get crumpled, have background images, have shaded regions, are "scanned" using a cell phone camera with poor lighting conditions, etc.

I don't think it would be wise to try to add all that clean-up functionality into tesseract, which is why I'm proposing a solution to take an image that has already been processed externally. The exact intent is to "not mess with the images."

An external tool that could replace the image layer would certainly be good, but I haven't found any (suggestions welcome!). I tried to use hocr2pdf to use tesseract's .hocr data from my cleaned image and add it to a PDF with my original image but ran into a showstopper issue - When searching for a word in the document, the PDF viewers I tried would highlight the wrong part of the document. Maybe there is a bug with hocr2pdf or I am using it incorrectly. Tesseract already knows how to make a PDF so this reduces the possibility of an external program interpreting the PDF or hOCR specs differently and ruining the output.

Anyway, thanks for the pointer to api/pdfrenderer.cc! I might just add the feature locally to address my needs, or maybe try to start a new program based off of it as you suggest.

I don't mind closing this issue if others feel this feature is inappropriate or a better solution is made.
 Swapping images in Tesseract a PDF is pretty easy for a programmer if destination images are JPEG or JPEG 2000. It is really just a matter of cutting and pasting the data, then cleaning up the results with qpdf.  The hardest part is getting the courage to open up a PDF file and look inside it.

Regarding HOCR and bounding boxes, make sure you have image resolution metadata set correctly everywhere. The hocr-pdf program mentioned above works okay, but is limited to latin character sets and will also struggle with ligatures in English.
 Heh, yeah, I opened up a PDF and saw the stream content for the image and was thinking of how to replace it, but it seemed like there'd be a non-trivial amount of work to get right for a PDF n00b such as myself.

As far as I could tell the image resolution metadata was correct, or at least consistent. Couldn't get hocr-pdf working unfortunately due to some python module dependency that I couldn't find (I installed PyXML but no dice).

In the end I just went ahead and hacked my feature into Tesseract and it works pretty well :-) Here it is if you're interested, though be warned that it's a bit of a kludge in its current state: https://github.com/dhendrix/tesseract/commit/6cc206f5e4f734ba178c18e5a962563aace35018

Thanks for the helpful pointers! Feel free to close if this feature is not desired for upstream, it can live on in my github account.
 The python dependency is reportlab.
  Where can I download Tesseract for Windows?
All Links point to code.google.com, but since Tesseract has moved here all links are dead.

Also I would like to downoad different versions (2.x, 3.x) to see if any of them works.
The version I have right now (3.05 Setup) does not read any images but produces errors instead.
 That might be caused by missing permissions: all but the very latest version try to create temporary files in the root directory c:. You will need a Tesseract build with a very new version of Leptonica to fix this problem, see https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/commit/3038a7074d5b1dc6511af19085d980d1e0ae399c.
See also issue #171.
 OK, thanks for the replies. Can I download a version somewhere that
a) Does not have the bug mentioned by stweil
b) Includes the image loading functionality

On https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Downloads it says "Currently, there is no official Windows installer for newer versions." :-(
The 3.05 setup from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki does also not work (as mentioned above).
 Hi, I made a step by step guide how to compile Tesseract on Windows.. You can check my guide's here: http://gensanblog.com/2016/01/28/how-to-compile-tesseract-git-project-on-windows/

You can also download the compiled version.. 
 Hi Egor, thank you for correcting.. I am new to this and I made lots of edit's on the guide.. I will edit my post and focus on cygwin, I also added dll's so that it can run without cygwin.. I'll create a new guide for MSVC..
 @egorpugin : Could you also build the training program - text2image for windows
 @egorpugin: OK.

@zdenop : There are a number of older requests/issues for windows build. I'll add a comment to refer to this issue and you could close them. Thanks!
 @egorpugin - Are the windows binaries at

Thanks!
 Thanks for clarifying, @egorpugin .

I was confused after seeing the following on the releases page:

 This build does not create PDFs, but the cygwin from http://3.onj.me/tesseract/ build does.
So currently the VS build is not usable.
 The installers (made with MinGW-w64) are at https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki.
 https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract doesn't seem to provide binaries right now.
 @nickbe, just add `/wiki` to that URL...
 But these do not seem to be the VC binaries, or are they? There's only a problem with generating PDFs with the VC runtimes.
 That's right, the UB Mannheim executables are built with [Mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/).
 Latest VC binaries by @egorpugin with PDF generation are at following link, as per  [#338](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/338): https://www.dropbox.com/s/pxu2hp6mg1a64zj/tesseract-3.05.00dev-win32-vc19-2016-jun-03.zip?dl=1
 Great. Thanks !
 @egorpugin I follow the instructions. 

However CPPAN returns

Any other way to get best possible value for Orientation and script detection ?
 General questions are better asked on the mailing list where more people will see them.

  Can you provide a Windows installation for those that do not have the expertise to compile these sources as you did before moving the project to Github?

The last installer I know of was for version 3.02.02
 Does https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract help?
 Hi,

Thanks for your reply. I downloaded the zip and extracted it. I still could
not find any .exe files. Plus the whole download is only 2.4MB and the
original 3.02.02 installation was 30+ MB as an installer.

Regards,
Tony

 My fault, wrong link (the info is in the wiki): https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki should be better.
 Perfect :-)

Thank you!

Enjoy you day.

 @amitdo, thanks, pulled. :-)
 Hi Stefan,

I installed the version 3.05.00dev and it produces the following error.

Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v3.05.00dev with Leptonica
Warning in pixReadMemPng: work-around: writing to a temp file
libpng warning: Application built with libpng-1.4.3 but running with 1.5.14
Error in pixReadStreamPng: png_ptr not made
Error in pixReadMemPng: pix not read
Error in pixReadMem: png: no pix returned
Error during processing.

The installation replaced the previous version of 3.02.02

 This might be caused by the Leptonica code used for Tesseract: it tries to create a temp file in c:\ and fails because you don't have write permission there. So it should work if you run Tesseract as admin or if you change the permissions for c:.

I fixed this for JPEG-2000 files, but not for other image formats like PNG. See the discussion on https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/pull/116 for more information.
 Hi tonym1995,

I made a full instruction how to install and compile tesseract on windows http://gensanblog.com/2016/01/28/how-to-compile-tesseract-git-project-on-windows/

Hope this can help!

 Hi,
thank you!
i have to say for a Windows newcomer finding this project it is horrible to get started from the README.md 
@bantilan your blog entry should be in the project's wiki!
Best

 [See issue 209](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/209)
  disappointed w/ open-source stuff. allheaders.h seems to be missing. Trying to compile w/ Visual Studio 2010, using make file included in project. Not clear how to build this project otherwise. Why so much code? :-)
 `allheaders.h` is part of the Leptonica package. You will need that package, too. And even more code ... :-)
 Same for me. I don't want to sound arrogant but when I release a package, I make sure it is complete, it it ain't, then a readme file tells what's missing and where to find it.
 Same for me too. [https://tpgit.github.io/Leptonica/allheaders_8h_source.html ](url)

  After working around the bug in #195 I have now managed to generate some training data. However, when I try to use it, tesseract segfaults.

 My guess, and it's very uneducated, is that the pointer from `run->item->analysis.font` only points to a `PangoFont` and not a `PangoFcFont`. Since it's `reinterpret_cast`ed into the later `pango_fc_font_get_glyph` somewhere hits a null pointer.

I have checked that `run->item->analysis.font` isn't a null pointer, it isn't.
 My very crude workaround for now:

 Indeed, looks like the font is not a PangoFcFont.  Try using PANGO_FC_FONT(...) instead of the reinterpret_cast<...>, and you should get a warning.  You can use PANGO_IS_FC_FONT() to test at runtime.
 Sorry, I haven't had time to investigate this further. Hopefully I'll get some work done on this in the near future...
 @amitdo

I have same problem. I cannot use tesstrain.sh on Mac ( So, I use  Ubuntu on VirtualBox for training).

I tried bellow.

```
$ brew install  tesseract --with-training-tools --HEAD 
$ text2image --list_available_fonts --fonts_dir=/Library/Fonts
<skip>
```

There are total 1221 fonts installed. But 'Regular' style  is not included in text2image's output.
Even if some font has "Regular" style glyphs.

So, I can not try text2image with 'Regular' style font. What should I do for this issue? 

```
$ text2image --text=eng.training_text --outputbase=eng.MenloRegular.exp0 --font='Menlo Regular' --fonts_dir=/Library/Fonts
Could not find font named Menlo Regular. Pango suggested font Menlo Medium
Please correct --font arg.:Error:Assert failed:in file text2image.cpp, line 437
Abort trap: 6
```

ex. dejavu font (maybe not regular style,  [detail](https://gist.github.com/atuyosi/bc5387a4941e5d963365))

```
$ text2image --text=eng.training_text --outputbase=eng.MenloRegular.exp0 --font='DejaVu Sans Thin' --fonts_dir=~/Library/Fonts

 HI @amitdo , my font lis is here.

 Hi @amitdo,
I have the exact same issue with text2image (HEAD revision) running on OSX.

I tried the HEAD version (5610738) , and the exit status is 0. 
It looks  good in Times fonts.

Could you check the logs ?

 Hi guys,
i have a trouble with the text2image  im trying to make the fontlist that was described in the main article about tesseract ocr, i can create the box file and tif file normally for one font but the list i get a problem. im using tesseract OCR 3.03 and the OS is windows 10 and the language is english the command is:
**text2image --text=training_text.txt --outputbase=eng.fontlist.txt --fonts_dir=C:\Windows\Fonts  --find_fonts=true --min_coverage=1.0 --render_per_font=false --fontconfig_tmpdir=C:\Tesseract\Tesseract-OCR** 
and i get a warning
**WARNING: Could not find a font to render image title with!** 
and it gives a fail for every font such as: 
**Font Aldhabi failed with 62 hits = 21.60%**
**also give '%' (U+25) not covered by font** but i don't know what does that mean, anyways 
Any idea how to solve this error?

Thanks in advance 
 You are looking for 100% coverage of training text in the fonts with  --min_coverage=1.0

I use the following on bash on windows (mobaxterm).

```
text2image --find_fonts \
--fonts_dir /mnt/c/Windows/Fonts \
--text ./langdata/eng/eng.training_text \
--min_coverage .95  \
--outputbase ./langdata/eng/eng \
|& grep raw | sed -e 's/ :.*/" \\/g'  | sed -e 's/^/  "/' > ../langdata/eng/fontslist-windows.txt
```
 Thanks a lot for your response, but i didn't get the last part of the command that you are using  **\
|& grep raw | sed -e 's/ :.*/" \\/g'  | sed -e 's/^/  "/' > ../langdata/eng/fontslist-windows.txt** i don't remember that there is such arguments at text2image binary, also i tried in my command to change the coverage from 100 to 95 yet i still have the same problem  keep in mind I'm not familiar with terminal environment :)  The text2image --find_fonts command displays the output on the terminal.

the \ at end of each line is a continuation mark for the command.

| is for piping the output of earlier command to next command.

Grep selects all the lines which have 'raw' in them - to select all lines which have the font name.

first sed command deletes everything following the : sign with a quote mark.

second sed command adds a quote sign to the beginning of each line.

The resulting output is saved in the output file name given after >

So, basically it deletes all extraneous output and creates a text file with each font name with quotes around it, which can be used as part of fontslist or plugged into language-specific.sh. Example of output below:

```
  "WenQuanYi Zen Hei Medium" \
  "WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono Medium" \
  "WenQuanYi Zen Hei Sharp Medium" \
```

 I notice just now that you say 

```
using tesseract OCR 3.03
```

That could be the problem. text2image segfaults have been fixed in recent code.

 Please use the latest windows binaries eg. from 

https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki @ibr123 Please note that if you are using windows command prompt and not bash under windows, the commands such as grep, sed etc may not be available. "text2image --find_fonts command displays the output on the terminal" does that mean no file will be generated? only printing on the terminal? ```

I don't know how to get more error info to you? Please help. @amitdo Could it be that some required commit fixing text2image has not been backported for 3.05?

@Tjorriemorrie Did you build tesseract from source? Please also try with the 4.0 alpha version (latest source from github), if the same error is there?  Ray did some changes in 4.00 that made this problem reappear. These changes were also backported to 3.05.

Here is a (temporary) solution:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/736#issuecomment-282685898
  Hello!
I need to run tesseract without leptonica installed on the CentOS system. 
I have leptonica liblept.so available, and I am able to compile tesseract pointing to that directory.

Is it possible to run tesseract without setting up LD_LIBRARY_PATH? 
Maybe there is some way to add some parameter to let tesseract know where leptonica is located in execution phase?

Is it possible to compile tesseract to be independent from shared library liblept.so? Is there any "configure" script parameter available to compile liblept.so into tesseract executable? 
  Here is the excerpt:

“Any language that has different punctuation and numbers is going to be disadvantaged by some of the hard-coded algorithms that assume ASCII punctuation and digits. To be fixed in 3.02.”

from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract#background-and-limitations
 The nice thing about a wiki is that anyone can edit it.  I'm pretty sure none of this is hardcoded any more and, if you agree, you can update the wiki page to match the current reality.
 It depends, not all Wikis have open sign up or give access to anyone for that matter.

I see that in the case of Tesseract on github, I could edit it myself indeed, thanks for the information.

That being said, I haven't investigated the issue, so I don't know what the current status is. In my opinion, it is better to report the issue without fixing it rather than just not fix it. I'll try to look into this later.
  After cmake generation, `TesseractConfig.cmake` not contains `ccutil` include directory. And when i try use `TesseractConfig.cmake` in my build - receive error `platform.h not found`
  See also tesseract-ocr/langdata#23.

Re-do of #188 to re-run and (hopefully) fix tests.
 @amitdo Ah, sorry about that - wasn't sure how to re-trigger it and couldn't turn up anything searching.
  See also tesseract-ocr/langdata#23.
  There seems some communication problem between tesseract 3.04 (package on debian stretch) and hocr2pdf 0.91 (package on debian stretch as well): whereas the tesseract output (up to a stupid xml tag) is a readable html and quite nice to look at ; but hocr2pdf will make VERY messy pdf's.

It seems that I am not alone to experience these problems, see e.g.
http://w3foverflow.com/question/tesseract-and-hocr-on-ubuntu-14-04/

How to make an example? Step 1: scan a messy, double page, Step 2: nice it up using scantailor, then use the output tiffs (in the "out" directory) ; Step 3: these are passed to tesseract with hocr option.   Step 4: finally invoke 

hocr2pdf -n -i image.tif  -o test.pdf  < image.hocr

By virtue of the "-n" option, you only see the (malformed) ocr output which is not overlayed by the right image.

It is unclear to me if this is an tesseract issue or an hocr2pdf issue, of course.

Cheers, Eric
 It's best by far to produce PDF directly from Tesseract. If you really have to go via HOCR for some weird reason, use https://github.com/tmbdev/hocr-tools/blob/master/hocr-pdf instead of hocr2pdf.
  Hi all, 

I am trying to use Tesseract's HOCR output functionality to generate an html file that includes all of the word font attributes - most of important of which is font_id.  From first glance, it looks like I will have to write a custom HOCR script with the result_Iterator to make this work.  

Any tips on getting HOCR output with font ID info without having to rewrite the GetHocrText function?

Thanks !!!
 Your better off asking questions on one of the mailing lists where more people will see it.  I only happened to stumble across this because I was looking at the hOCR code.

The current hOCR renderer already has the capability to output font information, including name.  It just needs to be enabled with a config parameter.

@zdenop please close this
  box.train (and box.train.stderr) exit with no action since commits from 17-Dec-2015 (c2f5e9b8+a20156fc, updates in api/tesseractmain.cpp). No renderer is created for this configuration.
  While Acrobat XI can find text in a PDF, it appears that [poppler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdftotext)'s `pdftotext` program, OS X's Preview app, and the library [PyPDF2](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/tree/master/PyPDF2)'s extractText() function all fail to locate text. It seems that Tesseract is encoding text in a way that makes it inaccessible to many PDF viewers.

`pdftotext` produces empty output.
Preview app allows highlighting of text in the appropriate locations, but it cannot be copied to the clipboard or searched.
PyPDF2 extractText also produces an empty string as text.
 #170 might be related, but the files I checked did not have tilted or skewed text.

`
 Chrome's PDF reader works for me.

I have poppler 0.39.0 installed (homebrew/OS X/El Capitan).

I believe I found the reason. It appears that the readers that struggle with it do not support Tesseract's usage of hexadecimal code points rather than literal characters in the output stream.

The PostScript content stream for this page as generated by Tesseract for the first word, "The" appears as follows:

``` Postscript
 Tz [ <0054><0068><0065> ] TJ  
```

where <0054> = U+0054 = T, <0068> = U+0068 = h, etc. I have run into other situations where this hexadecimal notation causes parsing difficulties for some PDF readers.

Acrobat generates the equivalent segment with ASCII literals.

``` Postscript
[...omitted...] Tm
(The )Tj
```

Longer excerpts for comparison:

Tesseract

``` Postscript
BT    
3 Tr 1 0 0 1 211.68 744 Tm /f-0-0 21 Tf 117.334 Tz [ <0054><0068><0065> ] TJ  
```

Acrobat

``` Postscript
BT
0.196 0.184 0.188 rg
/T1_0 1 Tf
-0.035 Tc 3 Tr 23.4905 0 0 23.7001 211.43 744.24 Tm
(The )Tj
ET
```
 Yes. Preview and poppler are still incapable of reading your i182.pdf. I observed no difference.

My comparison didn't address how Acrobat handles Unicode and Unicode literals cannot appear in Postscript so I checked how this is done. When Acrobat encodes a Unicode string it uses UTF-16 big endian code points in hexadecimal, like this:

``` Postscript
... Tm
<4E8B5F97771F5BF9770B89C152A066F4591A5C11>Tj
```

That string encodes 10 characters all below U+7FFF, which are these:
事得真对看见加更多少

So it appears that Tesseract's method of encoding text strings is nonstandard. I checked the PDF 1.7 reference manual, and couldn't find an example matching Tesseract's output syntax.
 Okay, for some reason pdftotext will not output to stdout but will produce a valid text file for the files we've been working on. My quick guess is that pdftotext suppresses its stdout if high ASCII characters are present, which tesseract finds here (some n-dashes and smart quotes). Both poppler 0.24.5 and 0.34 behave as expected when asked to save to a file, so the text stream is accessible to pdftotext. In short, poppler is working fine for me.

That said, OS X Preview and parsers like PyPDF2 still struggle with how Tesseract encodes text, as far as I can tell. 

I checked that reportlab also encodes text strings in the manner of Acrobat, and Preview has no problems with PDFs produced by Tesseract -> hOCR -> reportlab PDF. This is an example of such a file:

[linn_hocr_unc.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/77885/linn_hocr_unc.pdf)
 Qpdf says it okay, but it doesn't check everything.

 I might not have time to take a look until Wednesday. Validators of various flavors  include jhove, jhove-pdf-a, pdfbox, ITextRUPS, and http://www.pdf-tools.com/pdf/validate-pdfa-online.aspx.  (Note that Tesseract PDF are not expected to be PDF/A compliant). I did compatibility testing with Apple's Preview at design time, but I don't test against it regularly. Never tried PyPDF2.  If I had to guess right now, I'd suspect it might be the invisible font improvement that was written for better ghostscript compatibility. Unlikely to be the hex encoding.

http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=695869
 Looking at issue 181, it's looking more and more like Preview is unhappy with the revised glyphless font, possible due to the zero advance width. Will try to borrow a Mac and play with it, hopefully on Wednesday.
 @jbreiden I agree that the glyphless font issue seems more probable.

Aside: I wouldn't trust JHOVE for PDF validation. For JHOVE to approve is better than not approving, but its analysis is rudimentary, and in my experience it produce more false positives and negatives than useful diagnostics.
 I produced this PDF using Tesseract, then borrowed a laptop running Mac OS X version 10.10.5 and was able to both search and copy-paste from Preview (Although the copy-paste highlighting was kind of weird). My testing copy of Tesseract is not completely synchronized with GitHub, so if needed we can investigate that. How does this PDF perform for you on Preview, @jbarlow83 ?

[2.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/79277/2.pdf)

There is also an alternative invisible font here, that contains an advanceWidth. I think it can be swapped in for tessdata/pdf.ttf. It has a side effect of making highlighting look even more bizarre in evince. I don't notice any compatibility differences at all, but mentioning in case someone wants to play with it. Have not checked compatibility with Ghostscript.

Finally, this was my test image (I was actually using TIFF but GitHub doesn't let me attach that)

 Doesn't work in Preview OS X 10.11.2 (highlights properly, but no copy-paste or search). I have access to two other OS X machines - will check those later day.

I check with my iPhone too. Both Chrome iOS (PDFium?) via Gmail app and Safari struggle to highlight text (they only allow highlighting a single character) and cannot copy.
 This one uses the alternate font that has an advance width.

[alternate.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/79359/alternate.pdf)
 alternate works on OS X Preview and my iPhone. 

I did notice that spaces are sometimes missing in OS X's copy and paste text, while pdftotext shows the spaces, so perhaps it's not 100% but clearly this was the main issue.

Hah.  My bad.  Thanks :)
 I got my hands on an iPad running iOS 9.2 and reproduced the problem. On iOS/Safari I cannot search 2.pdf (Ken Sharp's font) but can search with alternate.pdf (Behdad's font). Took me quite a while to figure out how how to make the search controls work.

So for your immediate problem, go ahead and substitute in Behdad's font into tessdata/pdf.ttf and you should be okay. We won't do that officially without a whole bunch more compatibility testing and reports, including the harder languages (Cherokee, vertical Japanese, Arabic) and additional renderers including Ghostscript and Firefox. Compatibility reports are appreciated.

https://github.com/behdad/tofudetector/blob/master/tofu.ttf?raw=true

Regarding the words running together on the Apple PDF renderer, that's not new. Apple PDF seems to do a worse job than everyone else at deciding word boundaries, and I've seen them screw up plenty of regular born-digital PDF files in the same way. Of course the root cause is the PDF spec itself, which does not explicitly define the concept of a word boundary. So I can't help you, but at least it isn't a regression. It's possible that Apple will get their act together a little better on this some day, but I have no reason to believe that it is on their radar.
 My font has a huge advance width, because it was designed for another purpose.  Someone should create one with an advance width of 1024 instead of my 20480.
 The PDF is keeping the advance width under control for Behdad's font. We're probably seeing something else. It's kind of cute zebra pattern. You get a black underline, and black boxes in all word gaps and in some letter gaps. (Obviously evince is doing a really bad  job, but this is much worse than with Ken Sharp's font, which highlights as a solid  black bar.) A little hard for me to investigate, since my copy of ttx is not cooperating.

P.S. The font advance width should probably be 512 to match what we specify in the PDF. But again, I don't expect that to change anything for evince.

 FWIW, 
    1) I can confirm the problem as stated. Also, I've been using the same tesseract build, and it stopped working due to OS X update (unfortunately, I'm not sure which, possibly 10.11.1)
    2) As suggested above, using tofu.ttf fixed the issue for me (OS X 10.11.3, Finnish OCR), no recompile of tesseract needed
 Partially blocked by https://github.com/behdad/fonttools/issues/497
 Two choices. 
- Add advance width to Ken Sharp's font.
- Reduce advance with in Behdad's font.

This PDF is the former, please test for compatibility.

 Nope, the PDF doen't seem to work for me (Mac OS X 10.11.3). The copied text is just equal number of spaces.

 behdad.pdf works better. The letters are now reproduced correctly. There's still something funny with how selection works. Selecting from left to right doesn't correctly select all the letters. Right-to-left selects the three last characters one by one and then all four of the rest at once. Might be unrelated issue, though.
 This is another attempt at the behdad font, with the contour data removed. It fixes the visual problem with evince. Please test for compatibility. If successful, we probably have a winner. (Don't worry about the left-to-right vs. right-to-left selection oddities; that's due to mixing Hebrew and English words in my test document)

[behdad2.pdf](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/112840/simple-1.pdf)
 Nope, this does not work any more (selected characters are spaces again).
 Utterly insane. I would really, really like to speak with the relevant software engineer at Apple. Putting this problem aside for a bit.
 Yes, utterly. I ran the tofu.ttf and the old pdf.ttf through Apples font validator. Both produced errors, but tofu.ttf only one, whereas the old pdf.ttf had additional "name table usability" errors. Please post the above font files (or diffs) and I'll run them through the validator as well. Perhaps this will give some insight to the issue.
 Fonts as per request. I do not know if my modification tool (ttx) corrupts anything along the way. So far the experiments suggest that Apple software requires a contour, and a contour cosmetically messes with evince.

 Thanks. Here's the verbose error report as given by Apples ftxvalidator (there's not really a version for 10.11, so some of this might be inaccurate). All report fatal errors and most errors are beyond my (admittedly limited) expertise on the subject. I hope they make more sense to you.

 Can you please edit that report and make it an attachment or something? The giant wall of text makes this bug harder to read.

Fixed now.
 For completeness, here is Ken Sharp's font with a contour added in.

At this point, sharp2.ttf and behdad.ttf are the only fonts compatible with Apple Preview. They both come at the cost highlight aesthetics with evince. I think Preview is incorrect to require a contour for the glyph, and I think evince is incorrect to consider a contour when highlighting an invisible font. I do not have any reason so far to prefer one over the other, and I do not yet have compatibility test results from ghostscript, firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.
 I have filed a bug with Apple. This is not publicly visible and I do not know what the response will be. Noting it here simply simply for future reference. radr://24533090
 In progress testing compatibility with candidates "sharp2" and "behdad" including getting some assistance with ghostscript. So far no user visible differences between them, and the former is the smaller change. Is there general consensus to work around the Apple compatibility problem, at the expense of Evince highlight aesthetics?
 @jbreiden I agree. OS X Preview is installed on ~10% of all desktop computers. Evince is just one of many PDF viewers for Linux users.
 @jbarlow83 and @jbreiden This bug also affects the Amazon Kindles. As an avid user of Amazon Kindle and Tesseract, I feel crippled now. And don't forget that all those pdfs generated with Tesseract won't work with Kindle either around the world.
 @bekirserifoglu - can you please confirm that both proposed workarounds found in previous comments (sharp2.pdf, behdad.pdf) solve the problem on Kindle?
 @jbreiden I can confirm that both sharp and tofu fonts work great with Kindle Voyage and Preview on Os X. Feel free to mention me if you need anymore testing.
 @bekirserifoglu - Is the failure case on Kindle broken search and broken copy-paste? Or is it even worse than that?
 @jbreiden Kindle just treats the pdf as a non-ocr'ed pdf. It is worse than OS X preview.
 @theraysmith 

Okay, I've decided. We're going to use the sharp2 font.

For various embarassing reasons, I'd appreciate some help. Could someone please download this zip file, extract sharp2.ttf, and use it to replace pdf.ttf in the repository. The resulting file should still be called pdf.ttf. I apologize for not doing this myself and promise to get my act together with respect to GitHub pull requests in the future.

 Thank you for fixing this. 
  Hi all,

I am working on the OCR based android application which loads the image from gallery or photo click from phone's camera. All went well using the tess-two lib. However, the accuracy of reading the text from the image is very poor. Quality of photos are good(8 megapixel camera) and whereas, other application on stores read them much better.

Could you please suggest me how can I improve the accuracy.

Thanks,

  POSIX provides portable data types for signed and unsigned integer values
of different size.

This patch maps those POSIX data types to the Tesseract specific types.
In a next step, the Tesseract data types can be eliminated by replacing
them with the POSIX data types.

~~Use also standard definitions for the printf format specifiers.
MS Visual Studio does not support that standard (at least not in older
versions), so local definitions are needed there.~~

~~NULL is standard, so a local definition should not be needed.~~

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil sw@weilnetz.de
 Updated patch: removed part for format specifiers, don't remove NULL definition (both issues should be done in separate patches).
 Maybe it would be even better to go thru the code and use, for example, `int8_t` instead of `inT8`...
 @LinusU, yes, that would be the next step as soon as this pull request was accepted.
 :+1: 
 Ping? Are there any more thoughts on my proposal?
 @theraysmith, ping. Do you support the idea of replacing Tesseract data types by POSIX data types (so I can prepare a follow-up pull request)?

Many other free software projects with similar compiler / host conditions have shown that using POSIX data types works. Especially for library interfaces, but also for the rest of the code, it would be good to get rid of project specific data types which don't provide any additional value compared with the standard.
 Ping? I suggest to apply this patch now, wait one more month and then replace all Tesseract integer types by the POSIX types.
 @theraysmith, @zdenop, do you have any comments to my last proposal? Can we proceed like that?
 Ping?
 I still think it would be a good idea to replace all proprietary data types by the POSIX ones. Is it really necessary to wait for @theraysmith (who is obviously very busy)? Lots of other free (and also commercial) software projects work pretty good with the  POSIX data types, using similar environments as Tesseract (Linux and other Unixes, Windows with Cygwin / MinGW-w64 / MS and other compilers).

So can we do the first step and apply this PR which is waiting for more than 7 months now?
 Another month passed. I'd still like to see Tesseract switching to POSIX data types.
 @zdenop said re: next release in https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/165#issuecomment-244039370

> I hear something like end of September 2016, but you never know ;-) It will big update (probably we will drop support of compilers nor support c++11)...

Will dropping support for compilers effect Tesseract switching to POSIX data types?
 > Will dropping support for compilers effect Tesseract switching to POSIX data types?

I don't think that POSIX data types are affected by the compiler decision. They exist for many years now, so any supported old or new compiler will work with POSIX data types.
 @theraysmith, may I kindly ask you to give your consent? Woohoo! 🎉 

Now if we could only replace all occurences of `inT8` with `int8_t`, `uinT8` with `uint8_t` and so forth 🙌  Yes, replacing those Tesseract data types by the POSIX data types will be the next step.

@zdenop, that means changes for nearly all source files which will give conflicts with pending pull requests. Should I nevertheless send one large PR which does the replacement, or would it be better to do it in smaller steps (starting for example with all files in `lstm`)? Are there more major changes pending after the integration of LSTM? >  I already put a few experimental uses of nullptr in 4.00 to see if anyone squeals.

@theraysmith, training/stringrenderer.cpp already uses `nullptr` for more than two years now. AFAIK nobody complained, so that seems to work. Replacing `NULL` by `nullptr` would be good, but also touches many files, so this could be done in the same action as the switch to POSIX data types.

Do you care for comments after modified code? Replacing data types or NULL is easy, but the replacements are a little bit longer, and moving the comments to the right column means much hand work without code formatter.  When I run "tesseract -c hocr_font_info=T hocr"  on attached file the segmentation fault is received. Output file is empty.
But when I run "tesseract hocr" on the same file without "-c hocr font_info=T", the recognition runs as expected, without any errors.

  The wiki page states "An installer is available for Windows from our download page." The statement is incorrect since there in no Windows installer available from the said page.
 See #101 which handles the same issue. Maybe you want to try the installer from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki.
 Yes, a clear Wiki message like "no Windows artifacts for current versions of Tesseract will be provided in the project" would clarify the situation.

The original text scan is not exactly horizontal (-0.5°). If this is fixed before doing OCR, Tesseract creates a PDF with the correct text.

![pdf-test](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6734573/11728560/df7dfa46-9f8a-11e5-949c-6ff549c62f1d.jpg)
 I suspect the problem is in pdftotext. To find out, open the PDF in another viewer such as Chrome or Adobe Reader and see what you get during search and copy-paste.
 Confirmed. Poppler (used by pdftotext) has a very hard time with titled text. If you want Tesseract to be more aggressive at producing flat text lines for tilted images, modify ClipBaseline(). But a better approach is to to use a different text extractor, for example one based on PDFium.

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/api/pdfrenderer.cpp#L275
 And finally, if you want to post-process Tesseract produced PDF to flatten out tilted textlines, that's also fairly easy. Just ask if you need details.
 `evince` (my standard PDF viewer on Linux) has the same problem and is not able to search such PDFs. The PDF viewer of `iceweasel` / `Firefox` gets the words right, so it is possible to search 'Infrarotkamera', but not the lines, so searching for word combinations does not work.

I don't want to post-process a PDF produced by Tesseract: the TXT file is perfect, so no need for me to extract text from the PDF.

I want to produce a PDF which I can give to others and which they can use with their normal PDF viewer.

Why is the text in the PDF file split into 2 character sequences? In the HOCR output, words remain words.
 Maybe Firefox also uses parts of the Poppler code. So there are a number of PDF viewers which are less robust in getting correct text lines from a Tesseract PDF. Wikipedia shows that the list of these viewers is quit impressive. This increases my wish to understand and fix what goes wrong in Tesseract's PDF generation process.
 I just tested with Chromium (Debian's variant of Chrome). It gets the text better, but not good: "astronomischen Infrarotkamera" is not found because it is split in separate lines. 
 ![tilt](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4961958/11765657/b19b4bf6-a115-11e5-97d3-d8ec63256afc.png)

There's nothing invalid with the PDF files produced; tilted symbolic text lines are legitimate in PDF. They are the accurate representation of OCR results. The words are inside there just fine, along with some geometry describing the angle of the baseline. That said, this does blow the mind of some PDF text extractors who assume that it is impossible for a line of text to have any deviation of y-position between characters. (As you might imagine, this gets particularly fun with vertical Japanese text.)

You have exactly three choices if you want to better compatibility these viewers. One is to deskew the image before calling OCR. Second is modifying the section of code I pointed to earlier in Tesseract, to eliminate tilt in the symbolic text lines. Third is to remove the tilt in the invisible symbolic text lines, after the PDF is produced. All three of these approaches are relatively easy for a programmer and I'm happy to provide guidance.

There are major problems of forcing heavily titled text lines to be flat, a big one being
word highlightling ends up in the wrong place visually. So I would be reluctant to do that by default.
 There must be some other aspect of the original scan, because Tesseract generates a PDF which works perfectly with all viewers and with pdftotext from this generated image with the same tilted text:
![generated-image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6734573/11766292/348dd4d2-a181-11e5-80a5-b12946a7ca44.jpg)
 Ok. Let me explain what I have understood. Obviously it is not possible to describe a rotated text line in PDF, so you have either to pretend that the line is horizontal (that's what ABBYY does with the original image and Tesseract does with the generated image), or you have to approximate the rotation by splitting the text line into smaller parts with different y values (which is causing trouble with most or even all free PDF viewers, at least those that are based on Poppler, Mozilla or PDFium).

I noticed a 2nd difference between ABBYY and Tesseract PDF: with Evince, selected text from the Tesseract PDF is shown as a simple blue rectangle, while in the ABBYY PDF it also shows the characters with some built-in font. But that's a different story. 
 @stweil: You are misunderstanding. It is possible to describe a rotated text line in PDF. Tesseract does exactly this for any text line whose tilt is large enough. The tilted screenshot in Hebrew above is Tesseract output, displayed in Adobe Reader. You can even see the tilted text lines being highlighted for copy-paste in all their tilted glory. I point everyone again at the critical piece of code that explains the situation. It effectively says, 'Does the vertical displacement between the beginning and end of the baseline exceed 2 pts? (2 pts = 1 / 36 inch) If so, pretend the line is horizontal. Otherwise, faithfully record it as tilted.

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/api/pdfrenderer.cpp#L275

P.S. While there is a prayer that Poppler will evolve, my best guess is it will instead be replaced with PDFium some time over the next 10 years. PDFium is by no means perfect, but it is much stronger than Poppler.
 I am going to close this issue soon, as working as intended. If people think the 
threshold should be increased, that's a reasonable thing to discuss. Right now if
a text line has 2pts or less vertical displacement, we draw it totally flat. Maybe
that number should be 3pts.
 I have similar problem while extracting data from pdf, it splits into one or two characters per line.  I tried using TESS4J which gets the text much better. So trying to find if there is any options in tesseract(java) i could use.

Thanks  Hi there,
I have created my own Arabic Language traindata, but the problem is that when used it gives the recognized text reversely (opposite direction), noting that the Arabic and Hebrew languages are written and read from Right to left handside (RTL).
People keep implying to use Cube for training Arabic, but I think no one really knows how to use Cube for training, and yes I have read the tesseract extra Cube documentation, and it seems that they purposely don't want anyone to use Cube.
How can I make a tesseract traineddata that recognize RTL languages as Arabic correctly?
Waiting for your reply
 Thank you for reply
I have just used the "wordlist2dawg -r 1" that you suggested and it's has solved my "reversed words" problem.
But now I have a new problem, the recognized text are combined together, meaning the words have no spacing between them. Tesseract seems to recognize all words as only 1 word.
I need help, waiting for reply 
 The problem has been solved! Thanks to the user (amitdo) The solution was:
To use "wordlist2dawg.exe -r 1" to create the "freaquent_words_list" + "words_list"
To use "ara.config" and removing this line from it "tessedit_ocr_engine_mode 1"

This solved my 2 problems of Arabic Language reversed words, and Arabic Language combined word.
Thank you
 @christophered 
did you get any good results by training? my best accuracy is about 40-50% on 300 dpi scanned document
 roozgar, I will conduct some tests and will reply back after couple of days
 @christophered 
i tried to find official Arabic resources to make up a better train file but not lucky 
so
if you need i can help you by providing Arabic words list or some scanned page 
just send me an email: roozgar@gmail.com
 Thank you roozgar, I appreciate you
I am currently conducting some tests on Arabic Tesseract and I am exhausting all resources available to me to make sure finding the best method for arabic recognition.
Don't worry I will conduct some tests and reply back to you ( by GOD)
By-the-way send me the scanned Arabic Document that you've been testing the accuracy on.
waiting for your reply
 @christophered 
sure
please tell me your email address 
 christopher.edward@outlook.com
 I have tested tesseract 3.02+3.04+3.05dev all have failed in arabic ocr.
Some-how I got the feeling that Arabic Language was purposely neglected and rejected.
 @christophered do you have any plan to work more on this subject?!
the official train data for arabic is working really good on 'times' font
so i think its possible to have a good accuracy other fonts too!
 @amitdo Oops! i found this

https://code.google.com/archive/p/tesseract-ocr-extradocs/wikis/Cube.wiki

its really undocumented!!
but how they build current Arabic file!!
 @amitdo who are they? i there any way to find who build each trained file?
 @christophered 
hey christopher, can you please tell me how you created your own .traineddata file for arabic or send me a link that contains a tutorial that i can use to follow.
I have been trying to implemented Tresseract ara.traineddata file but for some reason, the app that i have made using android studio gets stuck
 Hi @areebakamil  I have replyed by email also here is the Tutorial that you requested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vohgRChtRck

also here is one method to improve the recognition, just for testing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLJvHWhX_JA

Please remember this is for the Arabic Language, the recognition rate is low to moderate.
Training tesseract for English Language gains +90%, but not for Arabic sadly.

in jtessboxeditor:
Arabic use ara
Urdu use urd
English use eng
 @christophered 
How do you take into account the different forms - isolated, initial, medial and final forms of the same letter, during training?

10x Hi Uri !

There is a tessdata package for Hebrew.
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Data-Files

Try to use it before you start training Hebrew.

Also, read this page:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ImproveQuality

>should this work for hebrew as well?

By 'this' you mean

1) 'Tessseract' ?
Yes. Tessseract supports Hebrew.
The provided tessdata does not supports Hebrew diacritics (nikud).

2)
>From https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract#dictionary-data-optional
>For right-to-left languages (RTL) use option "-r 1".

Yes, it should be used for Hebrew too.

 Obviously VS does not support the POSIX function `dirname` and its header file `libgen.h`. I'll update the patch to use `_splitpath` (or is there a better alternative for Windows code?).
 VS does not know the `F_OK` needed for function `access`, so I need one more iteration which replaces that parameter by 0.

  The man page for the unicharambigs file format only includes documentation on the v1 format, not the v2 format (and is missing a description of the first line which is used for version identification).

No, I was just joking. I'm sure that there are more typos, but as I am not a native speaker,
I'm also sure that I won't find them all. :-)
 Ah, on a 2nd view I now see the typo.
  If https://github.com/loqu8/tesseract-vs2015 is placed parallel to the tesseract repo, you can use the vs2015 sln to compile tesseract in Visual Studio with giflib, libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, libwebp and zlib. Note that the solution will look for includes and lib in ../../../tesseract-vs2015/release rather than ../../../ like the VS2010 sln.

  It has been mentioned before that tesseract struggles with small fonts. I'm seeing this with standard sized Chinese in Chrome. If the image is magnified 2x (with no increase in information, just scale up the png), the recognition works great. Is there a way to do font size detection and just auto-scale up? Perhaps this is an English vs Chinese issue internally, so that when recognizing Chinese fonts, the image has to be increased in size before processing. I am not too familiar with tesseract internals, but could someone advise on (1) automatic font size detection, and (2) where to scale things up if it is for Chinese? 
 Here's an actual sample:

(1) 100% font size screen cap from Chrome (Google News)

  Hi,
I use tesseract (Tesseract 3.02 on Windows 7) to process sets of scanned invoices issued by the same company (very similar to each other).
I've noticed that **_some of them are recognized properly and some not_**.
The **original paper documents are of very good quality** and so are the TIFF files (at least to me) - so I thought there should be no problem for tesseract to recognize them properly, but...

I have played a bit with the scanning parameters and produced different images of the same paper document that originally caused problems. 

Now I have two TIF files of the same paper invoice:
1. one that gives incorrect results (ex_bad.tif)
2. one that gives correct results (ex_good.tif)

and the **ex_diff.tif** showing which part did not get recognized properly.
I attach also the hOCR files produced for both TIFF files and tesseract configuration.
All the above mentioned files are however packed in one docx file :smiley: 

[Incosistency.docx](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/48291/Incosistency.docx)

Don't know if it is the same issue but looking at the line 26 in ex_bad.html one can find empty strings (I know it's been reported already but do not know if it was fixed):

``` html
     <span class='ocr_line' id='line_5' title="bbox 176 379 2119 464"><span class='ocrx_word' id='word_13' title="bbox 176 403 269 439"></span> <span class='ocrx_word' id='word_14' title="bbox 286 404 546 448"></span> <span class='ocrx_word' id='word_15' title="bbox 562 404 648 439"></span> <span class='ocrx_word' id='word_16' title="bbox 1357 379 1759 464"></span> <span class='ocrx_word' id='word_17' title="bbox 1773 379 2119 458"></span> 
     </span>
```

**I have also noticed that removing the picture from the top left corner of the first page of the invoice helps recognizing text properly.**

Is this a bug or simply 'a user education error'?
:smiley:

Thanks in advance for any kind of help and/or guidance here

 I have tried at the time of postinig the original issue but I was not allowed to upload zip file....
Hope this time will work...
[Issues.zip](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/76707/Issues.zip)
 I havent used tesseract in two years or so, but I recall as part of preprocessing, we had to first remove all images and do some denoising. That greatly improved things. 
  Commit 99110df75781c6907c84a3d23695a6900b933a97 improved the help text
in several aspects, but also introduced new inconsistencies which this
patch tries to fix.
- Align columns (this needed replacing tabs by spaces).
- Start explaining text with uppercase.
- Replace "the stdout" by "stdout.
- Small changes in help text for page segmentation modes.
- Split options in OCR options and single options
  (partially revert commit 99110df75781c6907c84a3d23695a6900b933a97).

In addition, whitespace characters at end of lines were removed.

It didn't introduce these inconsistencies. They were there before.
 @amitdo, I'm sorry, my commit text was not precise. Some of the issues which my patch tries to address existed before your patch. Should I update the patch with a modified commit message?

There remain more issues to be discussed, for example whether stdout instead of stderr would be better for the help text. You also raised the question about more entries for page segmentation mode.
 Hi Stefan,

> Should I update the patch with a modified commit message?

Yes please.

> whether stdout instead of stderr would be better for the help text.

I've noticed that too. I don't know why it's stderr right now.

> You also raised the question about more entries for page segmentation mode.

We need to publish them, IMHO.

> Split options in OCR options and single options (partially revert commit 99110df).

'list-langs' can be followed by 'tessdata-dir'.
'print-parameters' can be followed by -c option(s) which will change the output.
So why call them 'single options'?

I'm not really sure what is the right usage for 'print-parameters'.

Testing:

```
$tesseract --print-parameters | grep pageseg_mode
tessedit_pageseg_mode   6

$ tesseract --print-parameters -psm 1 | grep pageseg_mode
tessedit_pageseg_mode   6

$ tesseract --print-parameters -c tessedit_pageseg_mode=1 | grep pageseg_mode
tessedit_pageseg_mode   1

$ tesseract --print-parameters pdf | grep pageseg_mode
tessedit_pageseg_mode   6

$ tesseract nosuchfile stdout --print-parameters pdf | grep pageseg_mode
tessedit_pageseg_mode   1
```
 @amitdo, I think it is reasonable to split the options in two groups: one group for those options which are used in production to make OCR, one group for options which show information like help texts, version or supported parameters. The old help text called the 2nd ones 'single options', that's why my patch reverted to that title. Maybe there exists a better naming.
 > --print-parameters is option that list all tesseract parameters with its default values. This is useful if you would like to change tesseract behavior.

@zdenop, I knew that, of course.

What I meant was: Should other options followed by 'print-parameters' change the output of the command?

With my commit, the CL help message includes:

> Usage:
>   ...
>   tesseract --print-parameters [options...] [configfile...]

The current behaviour of the command line only partly match the above usage pattern. Only the '-c var=value' option changes the output.

I think this

> $ tesseract --print-parameters pdf | grep pageseg_mode

should produce

> tessedit_pageseg_mode 1

Just like:

> $ tesseract --print-parameters -c tessedit_pageseg_mode=1 | grep pageseg_mode
> tessedit_pageseg_mode   1

Strangly, this works right now

> tesseract nosuchfile stdout --print-parameters pdf | grep pageseg_mode
> tessedit_pageseg_mode   1
 > in case of 'single options': it was not expected (tested) their usage in combination with other options.

So, maybe the usage part of the help message should be changed accordingly?

>  tesseract --print-parameters
 @stweil, feel free to change it as you like, no objection.
 @stweil,

On second thought - don't bother!
  I am trying to read serial number, bios version, dimm capacity and cpu type from a BIOS screen shot but cannot improve the results. I attached a zip file with the images.

These information are not words or sentences, and looks like tesseract is trying to give sense or forcing the info to all letters or to all numbers (if preceding a number force to a number). 

Below share my results to see if you know what settings or image pre processing I need to use to improve the results. 

I am using Tesseract 3.03 and ImageMagick 6.8.8-10 on a Fedora 21 OS.

Adding threshold still wrong, and looks like is better without threshold.
  The new pdf option to directly create a PDF with embedded text is awesome. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to figure out yet how to specify the page size (e.g. A4, letter, ...). Is that possible?
 Sorry, no. If the input image is A4 then the output PDF is A4. The design goal of Tesseract's PDF module is to not change anything about the image. If you want to modify page size, either change the input image or post process the output PDF. 
 This issue should be closed. (Working as intended)
 @jbreiden, how tesseract determines page size of the input image? The page size depends on DPI which tesseract has no information about. For example A5 (5.83 x 8.27 inch) with 300 dpi has resolution 1748 x 2480 pixels.
The problem is that when the input image to tesseract has 1748 x 2480 pixels, it outputs pdf file with page size 24.97 × 35.43 inch, not 5.83 x 8.27 inch.
Can you please reopen this issue or should I create a new issue?
  This is the failing test: (all locales, packages seem correctly installed).
For info, parsing english works fine.

 Try this:

> tesseract test.png test -l bul
 Ha, that's funny, I actually tried it like this the very first time but I had an error and thought that that caused it!

Works much better like this:
`tesseract test.png test -l bul`:
`Да извършва всякакви правни „щения пт на: им: и за мая см:-дка. пя „=`

Still not 100% accurate but I guess that's up to me/options to fix now?
 Suggestion: using `-lbul` should fail with an error
 The font in this image is quite small. You should try to rescale the image (x2).
Also try the option -psm 7
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ImproveQuality

In general, the right place to ask questions is here:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/tesseract-ocr
 I found out exactly what were the encountered issues. Here is a sum up:
- First I ran `tesseract test.png -l bul` which fails because it sees an option (`-l`) instead of `outputbase|stdout`; but it doesn't complain about a wrong argument so I thought it was because of the space between `-l` and `bul`
- Then I tried `tesseract test.png -lbul` which doesn't give errors because it wrongly thinks that the output file is `-lbul` and it uses the default `eng` data. Indeed `-lbul.txt` gets created
- And eventually: `tesseract test.png test -lbul` which creates `test.txt` and uses `eng` as default and simply discards `-lbul` which is nonsense to it
  The command tesseract seems to miss the decimal separator character if there is more than 7 digits in the decimal number : 
In the image below, tesseract detects 34056789 = not OK ! 
![bug_number1c](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14107462/10996075/0e90e966-8482-11e5-9e8c-0f1289f250d0.png)
In the image below, tesseract detects 440.5678 => OK
![bug_number1c2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14107462/10996076/126ef0fa-8482-11e5-956a-ea61e87f5b99.png)
 With the latest snapshot in the git repo i get:
340.56789
 Ok I have recompiled with the tesseract-master.
And now, i got good result with 340.56789. Thanks...

But the problem is still there when i use more digits:
Example below is ok

  This fixes clang compiler warnings like this one:

wordrec/gradechop.cpp:52:3: warning:
 'register' storage class specifier is deprecated [-Wdeprecated-register]

Signed-off-by: Stefan Weil sw@weilnetz.de
 @zdenop: Any good modern compiler should be able to assign CPU registers to local variables, and at least for gcc and clang I know that they do a very good job here. I assume that 'register' for local variables was deprecated because it no longer makes sense today. That's the reason why I suggest to use these modifications.

For function parameters, this is different. Therefore they are still supported.
 Extract from gcc documentation:

"Some developers use Local Register Variables in an attempt to improve gcc's allocation of registers, especially in large functions. In this case the register name is essentially a hint to the register allocator. While in some instances this can generate better code, improvements are subject to the whims of the allocator/optimizers. Since there are no guarantees that your improvements won't be lost, this usage of Local Register Variables is discouraged."

 I'm having a similar issue, running tesseract 3.04, and on Ubuntu 15.10. My unicharset after having trained on a long text file and using unicharset_extractor has the above mentioned "Joined" and "Broken" flags, followed by all bogus rows. In addition, whenever I then use another training tool, like shapeclustering, I get the bad properties warnings for just about every possible character present. 

Is there any idea as to what could be causing this? I'm using a custom font, but with english words. 
 Same problem here. Running tesseract 3.04 on fedora 23
 I have the same problem for Farsi language (It is right to left). Using 3.04 on Ubuntu 15

 @jmokoistinen I have tried every step in that file, and keep getting a buggy unicharset_extractor output. I'm also using english letters, and my file has 14000 words that cover all possible letter placement in the system I'm trying to train on. What should I try next?
 I suggest you to use the `set_unicharset_properties` script used to set some properties to your generated unicharset file or get unicharset file listed in [tesseract train repo](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata)
both worked for me
 Did anyone manage to resolve this issue? I'm trying to train a new font and I'm getting the bad properties error even when if use the eng,unicharset that came with the trained data. The error is for the tilda (~) character only.
Running on OS X.
 @wxlie see the post above or you can use the script listed in my repo

  Hello, I'm working on adding symbol level bounding box information in hOCR output, in order to be able to find the position of individual symbols inside words. Is this something that you would like to integrate? I've only had a cursory glance on the hOCR reference, but it doesn't seem to be violate anything. Output would look like:

```

```
 Speaking only for myself. It's soooooo expensive. That's why I don't bother in PDF output.
 If this were to be contemplated, it should be controlled by a config variable with defaults to false, similar to `hocr_font_info`.  I'd be curious about the use case though. If hOCR is being used as a format to connect two programs, it seems like a very bulky & low fidelity channel. Wouldn't just calling the Tess result iterator yourself give you better control at less cost?
  I have created java web controller with tesseract.
If I use windows libraries - no errors, but in linux sometimes I get a fatal error

 I'm not sure that an issue with java wrapper.
But ok. I'll take a look at java wrapper and how it works with pointers in HistogramRect.
Thanks
  I had the same problem, and discovered the cause by looking in the `config.log` file. I see a lot of people having this problem, so might be a good idea to add a check.
 I'm pretty sure it was this:

```
./configure:17287: g++ -o conftest -I/Usr/local/include/leptonica -L/usr/local/lib conftest.cpp -llept >&5
./configure: line 2040: g++ command not found
```
 Perhaps also update the wiki, installations instructions and the FAQ for this error.
   @zdenop, FYI

Travis failed in linux build only. It had problems downloading cmake.
The code does compile in my machine, which is ubuntu 14.04 64bit.
I also tested the code. Everything seems fine!

Any questions?
 If I'm right the build will run again when you close this PR and reopen it.
 Thanks @ArjanSchouten.
It failed twice to download cmake: yesterday (~18 hours ago) and today (~2 hours ago).
So it might fail again...
 @zdenop
I reorganised this PR. It has only one commit now.
 The Travis problem should be fixed now (see #143), so please start a new try. 
 @stweil, @zdenop
Done.
 @zdenop Please, commit or comment.
 @amitdo, I'm afraid that your patch needs to be rebased on latest git master. One of my patches fixed a bug in main and was committed. This fix is still missing in your code, so there will be a merge conflict.
 @zdenop, I've updated the code. Is it OK for you now?
 @amitdo, I'afraid that the new function SetVariablesFromCLArgs did revert the bug fix #154.
 @stweil, sorry. fixed.

This creates the txt file, but it's just junk, maybe a few random characters. For a long time I was also seeing the 'Error in boxClipToRectangle: box outside rectangle' sort of errors that axfelix was seeing.

If I run it with the CPU device like this:

TESSERACT_OPENCL_DEVICE=2 tesseract ESub.png ESubPng

...it works perfectly. Great OCR output.

I have done everything I can imagine, including rebuilding Tesseract several times, using jpg, png and tif input files and rebuilding Leptonica. The nvidia drivers are the latest and OpenCL is the latest.

Any ideas?
 Still working on the problem. Here's some information that will hopefully make it easier for someone to solve before I spend another day tracking it down. 

I have two test cases using the same source file. Doesn't matter if the source is png or tif, same bad results. Tesseract correctly identifies that I have a Tesla K40c as device 1. The CPU is device 2. The call I'm making is either:
TESSERACT_OPENCL_DEVICE=1 tesseract ESub.png Esub -l enm //GPU
or
TESSERACT_OPENCL_DEVICE=2 tesseract ESub.png Esub -l enm //CPU

In the file baseapi.cpp in function TessBaseAPI::ProcessPage() I put in code to save the image before and after the call to GetThresholdedImage() like so:

```
pixWrite("tessinputBEFORE.tif", pix, IFF_TIFF_G4);
Pix* page_pix = GetThresholdedImage();
pixWrite("tessinputAFTER.tif", page_pix, IFF_TIFF_G4);
```

In the CPU version both before and after images look correct, showing the same text and formatting.

In the GPU OpenCL version 'before' is fine, but the 'after' version is seriously sheared when the source image has non-binary dimensions.  It looks like the pitch is being miscalculated. The source image was 1721 x 1238 pixels. In this case the OCR failed completely of course.

On an educated hunch I resized the the same image to 2048 x 1024. Now the shearing is gone, The characters in the image are somewhat recognizable. There is still a problem, the letters are all munged, almost like letters are being overlaid on top of each other or something. I will send the two bad output images if you tell me where. 
 Here you go...

Original source image 1721 x 1238:

Result when source image resized to 2048 x 1024 results:

 Sheared OpenCL output with odd-sized source image.

 I swear I've seen this particular image corruption before, when I was working on the pdf output module. I wish I could remember what it was.
 Anything else that can be done to help debug? I have a vested interest in getting a working OpenCL build before the end of January...
 I speculate we had a Leptonica bug, fixed it, but the fix never got propagated to the OpenCL-ified mini-fork of Leptonica that sits inside Tesseract. I think the way to go is look inside the thresholding call and keep comparing the CPU vs GPU to help isolate where things go different. It's also helpful to look at all data in the pix struct before/after/cpu/gpu to understand better what went wrong.

``` c
struct Pix
{
    l_uint32             w;           /* width in pixels                   */
    l_uint32             h;           /* height in pixels                  */
    l_uint32             d;           /* depth in bits (bpp)               */
    l_uint32             spp;         /* number of samples per pixel       */
    l_uint32             wpl;         /* 32-bit words/line                 */
    l_uint32             refcount;    /* reference count (1 if no clones)  */
    l_int32              xres;        /* image res (ppi) in x direction    */
                                      /* (use 0 if unknown)                */
    l_int32              yres;        /* image res (ppi) in y direction    */
                                      /* (use 0 if unknown)                */
    l_int32              informat;    /* input file format, IFF_*          */
    l_int32              special;     /* special instructions for I/O, etc */
    char                *text;        /* text string associated with pix   */
    struct PixColormap  *colormap;    /* colormap (may be null)            */
    l_uint32            *data;        /* the image data                    */
};
```

I don't know/remember what this code path is trying to do. Seems odd that
we'd be writing an image to a file unless this was a pure debug path. What happens
if you comment out the thresholding call? (go ahead and comment out lines 1227 to 1232 inclusive)

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/c53add706e7853c8ea9986a87aebb465f29173bd/api/baseapi.cpp#L1230
 Yeah, that sure looks like a debug path. New theory is OpenCL turns on some some debugging, which activates faulty debugging code that messes everything up.
 Separate experiment, swap:

pixWrite("tessinputAFTER.tif", page_pix, IFF_TIFF_G4);

with 

pixWrite("tessinputAFTER.png", page_pix, IFF_PNG);

just to make sure we're not having trouble with writing out your debug image.
I can imagine weird problems if the depth is not 1 bit per pixel and we try
to write out g4 tiff.
 And finally, find the place where the image is first read into Tesseeract and turned into a Pix. See if we already have corruption at that point.
 I can't debug this myself. I still get a segfault on my computer when trying to use OpenCL as per issue #53 . Will be travelling for the rest of the month. Good luck and sorry.
 PR #475 fixes an error with OpenCL which results in these error message:

  I'm spawning `tesseract` subprocesses for a project I'm working on and it's a bit annoying to see its banner on every invocation in the error log.  Redirecting stderr to `/dev/null` isn't an option as that would hide actual errors.

While the sources tell me redirecting stdout to the target file would hide it, I believe it would be better to have something like OpenSSH's `-q`.  Would that be an option?

I'd alternatively support dropping the banner entirely as the essential information is already given in `tesseract --version`.
 Thanks, works here as well.
  I have downloaded the sources and written the samples codes, just change the language 'eng' to 'chi_sim'. The traindata 'chi_sim' has been copied to \tessdata directory same with eng.traindata.

When I complie and start the sample, a error 'read_params_file: parameter not found: allow_blob_division' happens. But it works well with language 'eng'. Does anyone know how to resove it ?

Thanks a lot.
  when i run tesseract with opencl enabled over a multipage tiff it does not uses the gpu at all, even if it says its doeing so. the gpu is an ati 7770 
git commit # is 0d61f0c05a93a4d5aa09a9ec74d7cf7a1e51a9fa , Sep 15 09:32:54 2015

stdout from tesseract : 

Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v3.05.00dev with Leptonica
[DS] Profile read from file (tesseract_opencl_profile_devices.dat).
[DS] Device[1] 1:Capeverde score is 0.157605
[DS] Device[2] 1:Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz score is 0.866140
[DS] Device[3] 0:(null) score is 0.820505
[DS] Selected Device[1]: "Capeverde" (OpenCL)
Page 1
.... etc

as you can see it does start working (Page 1) and eventually the output is correct, ( and even says he is using the gpu  .. "Selected Device[1]: "Capeverde" (OpenCL)" ) but radeontop shows no activity ( tested it with cl-demo from Andreas Klöckner , gpu can be used in this system ) 
if i use the cpu (run it as a normal user without privileges to access the gpu ) then it takes the same amount of time.

one strange issue is that the first time tesseract is run and benchmarks the available devices (creating  tesseract_opencl_profile_devices.dat ) , it segfault, the  tesseract_opencl_profile_devices.dat does gets done and the next time it runs fine. 
  while trying to autogen, i got the following errors.

How can I make it?
Cheers,
 i suspected that I had no tesseract.
Does the autogen have to use tesseract? If so, I will firstly install it.
 oh sorry about my heavy head due to a whole day of work :(

I did run autogen under directory of tesseract-ocr, but got the error message mentioned above.

## FYI

i downloaded the source from google code (of version 3.02.02).
unpack it under mac os 10.10, 
1. cd to tesserac-ocr
2. run autogen 
3. error for libtoolize, error for subdir-objects
4. change ibtoolize to glibtoolize
5. run autogen again
6. error for subdir-objects

Hope these will help.
 ok let me do it now/

but i thought the error was dependent of the configs of Makefile, not the project itself.
 new version from github worked now. 
thank you.
  At first test it compiled fine with this code:

```
TessBaseAPI tess;
tess.Init(NULL, "eng", tesseract::OEM_DEFAULT);
Pix* img = pixRead("C:\\Users\\Paul\\Pictures\\phototest.tif");
```

But then, I added this line

   tess.SetImage(img);

 And it won't compile with error:

error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "public: void __cdecl tesseract::TessBaseAPI::SetImage(struct Pix const *)" (?SetImage@TessBaseAPI@tesseract@@QEAAXPEBUPix@@@Z) referenced in function main

I have VS 2013, Windows 8.1 64 bit both. Compiled both tesseract and leptonica for x64 system, included everything, but still it doesn't want to work correctly.

Hope for your help. Paul.
 Looks like you forgot to link a library. Have you double checked all your depentencies?
 dependencies sorry 
 Hello, peirick.
I believe i did not, as far as i know.
I've included those 3 libs: 
libtesseract304d.lib
liblept171d.lib
tesseractd.lib
 zdenop,
Yes, i've tried. Unfortunatly it still gives the same error.
Tried to disable tesseractd.lib (have no idea what's this).
 Maybe have a look at the repository at https://github.com/peirick/leptonica you will find a build_tesseract.bat. 
  Link to wiki ReadMe points to the same markdown file.
  I have a project similar to recaptcha where I need humans to type words instead of computer ocr. Is there a way for tesseract to split an image into words and output the words as separate image files?
  On Windows I am getting the following error message for a JPG although the file can be opened with the viewer and shows correct:
Corrupt JPEG data: nnnn extraneous bytes before marker 0xnn
Image is attached
![ptdc0020](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1007103/9982736/5b09231a-5f9a-11e5-84d2-ed5e2488cd91.JPG)
 Yes, it seems it is producing. Just curious - what is the issue with the JPEG though?
  I would like to suggest to slightly redesign the layout and installation of the training data.

At the present, one can install a single language (or a set of languages) by downloading the prepacked trainingdata as described in https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling#Language%20Data _or_ by downloading the git repo https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata .

The process is difficult, in case that you always want to automatically use the latest version of (let's say) eng, deu, fra, spa, ita trainingdata.

Without presenting a concrete idea or a PR, I just wanted to start a discussion whether and how a redesign (which should be compatible to the current way of downloadlng/installing language data) could look like, if it is wanted and possible.

Perhaps a small json or text parameter file could indicate which languages are needed (or are currently installed), and only these files are then updated from git.

Or a method "git submodule" which automatically clones (or pulls) all languages from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata .
 I think it is a good idea specially for people like me a normal windows user that is just learning
  Written in the WIKI
"Windows
An installer is available for Windows from our download page."

But as far as I can see there are no Windows installers to download. May be I'm not right, so, please, tell me, where I can get a current Windows installer.
 There is a Windows installer for tesseract version 3.02 here:

https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/downloads/list
tesseract-ocr-setup-3.02.02.exe

I don't think there is a **official** Windows installer for newer versions.
 Ok, thank you. I took a further look for a newer version and I found:
http://domasofan.spdns.eu/tesseract/
with the newest development version. But the server is delivering the files really slow.
 Thank you for the latest Windows installer files :). 
 The NSIS installer configuration was added and removed twice, the last time with commit b8862b33dfa3bf42c87913911f62da7bc4ed2e45. Is there currently another method to build an installer for Windows? If not, I'd like to add the NSIS configuration files again. I just finished cross building Tesseract for Windows (including an installer) based on latest Git master and using the MinGW-w64 packages on Debian GNU Linux. 
 @amitdo, that's interesting, but it still does not include an installer as far as I see.
@zdenop, maybe those Windows developers who are interested in libraries can also compile Tesseract. But those who just want to do OCR on Windows need an installer. Will cmake provide one?

Regarding leptonica, you can start with https://github.com/stweil/leptonica until there is an official GitHub version.
 [See issue 209](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/209)
  I run into this error under debian7 (and 8)  with Tesseract 3.03 and also with 3.04.

The solution I found to avoid this is to set the locale LC_NUMERIC to C instead of my locale "fr_FR.UTF-8"

Is there a patch or a new version planned to solve this whitout the need to change my locale ?
Thank you
 It happened with custom training
 Hello, 
I found that tesseract had a patch for this problem (https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/issues/detail?id=910)
Why is this not in the new version of Tesseract 3.04 ?
Will it be in the next version ?
Thanks
 Btw the custom training I use is not mine so I cannot run it again with LC_NUMERIC=C
 Ok my bad.
But I just tried with the eng.traineddata from official google traineddata file and I've got the same error
"Error: Illegal min or max specification!
"Fatal error encountered!" == NULL:Error:Assert failed:in file globaloc.cpp, line 75"
 I'm having a hard time seeing how this is going wrong due to locale with the current code.  The actual error is signaled here: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/classify/clusttool.cpp#L89 which happens when it is unhappy with the results that tfscanf gets for the feature parameters. tfscanf is a private, locale-independent version of fscanf, which calls, in turn, the private tvfscanf which implements its own parsing of floats with a hard coded decimal separator of '.'

One thing that definitely could cause it though is a bad/corrupted feature parameter file.

I just tested with the stock tesseract 3.03 on a brand new Debian 8 installation with the locale set to fr_FR.UTF-8 and everything worked perfectly.

If you still can't get this to work, please post the output of the following commands:

```
uname -a
tesseract -v
locale
```
  I'm currently seeing a SIGBUS crash in ComputeGradient on an Android app I'm working on, I can reliably reproduce the crash on a specific phone (Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini, Snapdragon 400), on another device (OnePlus One, Snapdragon 801)

I added some debug output to ComputeGradient and it turns out it crashes when y = -2. , after adding a few more lines of debug logging in ComputeEdgeOffsets I see that start.y() is 2 larger than 'height'. If it crashes, it always does so on line 2 of ComputeGradient. SIGBUS would imply an unaligned memory access but as far as I can tell that function only deals with single byte access which shouldn't cause an issue. The -2 y coordinate also seems suspect but I don't know enough about Tesseract and Pix to know if that might be a problem or not.
  In one of our test-cases valgrind complained about a jump-condition based on an un-initialized value:

The reason is that sometimes word_char_quality() exits early without initializing its output parameters, however the callers expect the output-parameters to be written. Instead of initializing all the parameters for all callers, I chose to set output-parameters at early-exist directly.
 I initialized the values inside the early-exit branch, because they are otherwise overwritten anyway - which means a few unescessary stores. 
In case there are good arguments in initializing the out-values un-conditionally, I of course don't have anything against doing it.
 @egorpugin Why is a rebase needed? I don't see any conflict with the current sources. The build failure doesn't appear to be due to the code, but instead instability in the CI.
 Thanks for checking. Is there anything left for me to do to get this patch in?

Anybody having an idea of what I'm doing wrong? 
  I am using the master branch from github (3.05.00dev) and facing some problems when using the stdin option in conjunction with the -psm 0 and -psm 2 options

```
cat <image file> | tesseract stdin stdout -psm 0
```

gives me the error

```
Error in fopenReadStream: file not found
Error in pixRead: image file not found: stdin
Cannot open input file: stdin
```

However, the command 

```
cat <image file> | tesseract stdin stdout -psm 1
```

works as expected.

Do I miss something?

 Just so you know, if I'm not mistaken, it worked with Tesseract 3.03 and only broke with Tesseract 3.04. It is also very handy to script around Tesseract (avoid using temporary files) (see [Pyocr](https://github.com/jflesch/pyocr) for instance).
 When I started working on PyOCR, it was still Tesseract 2.x. At the time, if I remember correctly, there was only a C++ API and it seemed painfully hard to use (and binding on C++ API from Python is really annoying).
Also I did fork PyOCR from an already-existing python module (python-tesseract if I recall correctly).

Good to know there is a C API now. I'll have a look, see if I can bind on it easily. Thanks for the tip :)
  Hello,

I noticed the new "pdf" option in Tesseract, which creates a PDF file with the image and the background text. That's great ! 

But usually, the image given to Tesseract is not as nice as the starting image (because it is optimized for OCR, not for human visualization). Maybe it would be useful to provide the step before, i.e. the PDF of the generated text without the image, so that the user can paste it as a background text with pdftk for example.
 @olcc link is [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/fritz-hh/OCRmyPDF/tree/master)
 @olcc, the way to produce PDF has significantly changed in Tesseract 8.04. So I have a plan to change this in future commits. I'll take your idea into consideration. But as I remeber the new implementation does not produce the text anymore. It outputs directly to the file. But even with such effort you are able read the file manually and modify as you wish.
 @jbarlow83: Thanks for pointing to the "OCRmyPDF" wrapper.
@ws233: Tesseract 8.04? I'm quite late, I only have 3.04! ;-) (from Debian) 
@zdenop: Sorry, I didn't understand your message. Maybe my English is not good enough. My process is the following:
1) ORIGINAL.jpg -> OCR.tif  (remove colors, apply threshold, etc.)
2) tesseract OCR.tif result -l eng pdf
If you say that showing OCR.tif in the PDF is the right thing to do, I disagree in general. I agree this is a very nice feature. However, most people want to have ORIGINAL.jpg with the ocr text. 
 @olcc we here fully rely on these "mixed-mode" PDFs as generated by

`tesseract OCR.tif ORIGINAL pdf`

which works with very high quality, depending on the quality what you input to tesseract. I hope, that the present "pdf" option ( -c tessedit_create_pdf=1 ) will really never be dropped from the code.
 @zdenop, is this functionality documented anywhere?

Could you point me to the exact place in the code where it's implemented?
 > ORIGINAL.tif is included in ORIGINAL.pdf WITHOUT any modification

Whenever possible. The design intent is to copy the image bytes without using a 
decompress/compress whenever we can.  Sometimes that is impossible (TIFF
is an enormously flexible graphics format) and sometimes we haven't quite
gotten there. For example, TIFF CCITT Group 4 still goes through a lossless
decompress/compress. Simply because we haven't done the work to optimize
this code path in Tesseract / Leptonica. All relevant Tesseract code is in
ai/pdfrenderer.cc but we try to push the image heavy lifting into Leptonica.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Image_File_Format#TIFF_Compression_Tag
 I'd like to support the original wish. Having something like

tesseract OCR.tif ORIGINAL pdf-overlay

to produce only the text overlay in a pdf file would provide a lot of flexibility.  With this, you could write frontends to tesseract capable of overlaying the invisible text overlay on something different from OCR.tiff (e.g. a full color version of OCR.tif, etc.)
  Is there a way to train tesseract to recognize a limited amount of text from an image. I am making a small app that recognizes a printed list of topics and so far using the tess-two library, tesseract does not fully recognize any of the text in the image. I am quite new to OCR so I'm not sure how to make this work. So far all the training instructions I've seen require a font file which I don't have. All I have are different images of the printed text.

How do I train tesseract to recognize the text from that? Where do I start?
 Hi,
for me it helps often to upscale a image.
in ocrdesktop i resize the image by factor 3 (Bicubic). This brings quite good results.
Cheers
 In case that you use screenshots, please notice, that screenshots usually have 72dpi, which is not sufficient for Tesseract. I admit, that this is not so well known, however, it is mentioned since a long time here https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/FAQ#is-there-a-minimum-text-size-it-wont-read-screen-text

> Is there a Minimum Text Size? (It won't read screen text!)
> 
> There is a minimum text size for reasonable accuracy. You have to consider resolution as well as point size. Accuracy drops off below 10pt x 300dpi, rapidly below 8pt x 300dpi. A quick check is to count the pixels of the x-height of your characters. (X-height is the height of the lower case x.) At 10pt x 300dpi x-heights are typically about 20 pixels, although this can vary dramatically from font to font. Below an x-height of 10 pixels, you have very little chance of accurate results, and below about 8 pixels, most of the text will be "noise removed". 

Here's another useful page:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ImproveQuality

I recommend:
- remember never to use JPEG (because this is a lossy compresison format) when saving images with text (use: PNG, or use TIF, or GIF as the last choice)
- resize your screenshots or images to at least 300dpi, or 400dpi, or upscale by 400%:

```
convert -resize 400% ...
```
- when you start form a pdf then read http://bertanguven.com/faster-conversions-from-pdf-to-pngjpeg-imagemagick-vs-ghostscript/

```
density=400
gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=png16m -sOutputFile=$image -r$density -q $file -c quit
```

 change written, currently under review
 Change is in Ray's hands and will eventually migrate here. The person in critical need has a copy.
 @jbreiden, we didn't get the patch. 
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/2c837dffc3/api/renderer.cpp#L71

 cc: @theraysmith  Since you originally linked to `renderer.cpp`, I thought that the patch will be in that file.

I'm sorry for the mistake.   I have a working repo and installation of tesseract. When I pull the latest version from git, make and install, the git version information when printed via `tesseract --version` is not updated.

Reporting this as a bug, but not being sure, whether this is the correct term. Please close the issue if you think that my report is wrong, because one may not use the short sequence (pull - make - install).

I simply do not know, whether the following short sequence was ever designed to work.

How to reproduce the bug:

```
git pull
make
sudo make install
```

The following sequence however works, but recompiles everything:

```
make distclean
git pull
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
```
 @zdenop I thought that _updating_ (via git pull) does not require the compilation of all items.
Thanks.
  previously ProcessPages return char*, but now it return either true or false.
now text where is the place to find the text detected by ocr

I see there are result renderer but they write to text or pdf file, how to get text in return as char*
  In ccmain/par_control.cpp you can see this code:
# pragma omp parallel for num_threads(10)

for (int b = 0; b < blobs.size(); ++b) {
...
}

configure.ac should have an option to activate OpenMP in tesseract code (maybe with AC_OpenMP?).
 Hi, when I try to compile on a Mac with this commit in (for testing #71), I now get the following error:

```
configure: error: conditional "OPENMP" was never defined.
Usually this means the macro was only invoked conditionally.
```
 Here's a `config.log` for the current `master` branch after `./autogen.sh` && `./configure`: https://gist.github.com/c134a55446c99b9702fe

Same process succeeds if I revert bb19f2c.
 I think this _may_ be related to this problem/answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/32122781
As I believe the conftest should find `<omp.h>` when given `-fopenmp`. I'm currently letting the gcc reinstall run, and will report back after.

But also the configure process probably shouldn't fail by default if there's no OpenMP support detected/enabled.
 Confirmed that after `brew reinstall gcc --without-multilib`, I can use e.g. `brew install --HEAD --cc=gcc-5 tesseract` and the configure/make will succeed with bb19f2c in. Without `--cc=gcc-5` it fails due to [the lack of OpenMP support in the current Clang/LLVM compiler shipped with OS X](http://clang-omp.github.io/) (i.e. the default Mac "`gcc`").
 @ryanfb, @zdenop
FYI, Clang 3.7 now support OpenMP.

> OpenMP 3.1 is fully supported, but disabled by default. To enable it, please use the -fopenmp=libomp command line option.

  For those of us who know nothing of C, might someone be kind enough to use EMScripten/asm.js to compile to JavaScript on our behalf for use in the browser (without Node.js, etc.)?  Would no doubt be quite slow but would be handy for some web apps...  The other existing ports (Ocrad and GOCR) do not seem to hold a candle to the quality of Tesseract. Thanks!
 A particularly compelling use case beyond regular web apps would be as a browser add-on for running OCR against images encountered on the web and placing the OCR'd results in a dialog, in-place on the web page, etc..

In my Firefox add-on for [decoding QR codes](https://github.com/brettz9/qr-secret-decoder-ring/), I already have infrastructure in place which could largely be reused to allow OCR against images found while browsing the web, whether as a regular image, as a frame in a video, as a background image, SVG element, canvas, or, probably PDF too, given that ImageMagick has [already been ported](http://manuels.github.io/unix-toolbox.js/).
 Ok, thanks for the reply!
 @brettz9, It seems that someone is working on this: 
https://github.com/naptha
 Will look into it...Thanks!
  Look for these functions:
- ProcessPagesMultipageTiff(...)
- ProcessPagesInternal(...)
- ProcessPage(...)

I think NO_CUBE_BUILD in these functions should be changed to SOMETHING_ELSE, probably back to ANDROID_BUILD. 

Ray might not want these features on Android, but I see no reason to disable them in a desktop/server environment.
 Thanks Zdenko (@zdenop) for this one, and thanks in general for your work on tesseract.
  When scrollview is disabled in configure, linking fails (because it still uses scrollview)

```
libtool: link: g++ -std=c++11 -o .libs/tesseract tesseract-tesseractmain.o  ./.libs/libtesseract.so -lrt -llept -lpthread
./.libs/libtesseract.so: undefined reference to `ScrollView::Brush(ScrollView::Color)'

Makefile:577: recipe for target 'tesseract' failed
```
  Using Tesseract as a library, I get a ton of this information printed to the console:

Total count=0
Min=0.00 Really=0
Lower quartile=0.00
Median=0.00, ile(0.5)=0.00
Upper quartile=0.00
Max=0.00 Really=0
Range=1
Mean= 0.00
SD= 0.00
Bottom=0, top=38, base=0, x=0

Is there any option or way to disable this?
 I disagree.  The default behavior should not be to output debug information to the console.  That should be something that needs to be turned on rather than vice-versa.
 I can take a look at patching it.  Can you point me in the right direction as to where this may be emitted from in the code?  Any idea why it happens in my compile but not in the 14.04 Tesseract lib included with Ubuntu?

Pointing to /dev/null isn't ideal, since I need to run on Windows as well.
 @zdenop I've posted on the user forum as you've suggested.  I can leave this alone if you like.  I assumed this report is valuable for you and that you would want to get more information.  But if it's not important and/or interesting, I can definitely drop it and go away :)

I know other users (of my library) have run into this.  Here's a user forum post describing their issue: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/openalpr/quartile/openalpr/2x9r5_n6KvY/6ywYI8swTsMJ  I also know of one other that has run into it.  Perhaps other people just don't take the time to report it.  Or perhaps I'm using Tesseract in a strange way that only affects me.

Here's my usage of the Tesseract library
https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr/blob/master/src/openalpr/ocr.cpp

The only non-standard thing I do (I think) is turn on this option: tesseract.SetVariable("save_blob_choices", "T"); and read all the various possibilities.

I compiled the 3.04 library as follows:
export LIBLEPT_HEADERSDIR=/storage/projects/alpr/libraries/leptonica-1.72/src/
./configure --with-extra-libraries=/storage/projects/alpr/libraries/leptonica-1.72/src/.libs/
make
 We also see this information compiling 3.04 branch with default options, as of today.

I notice the original poster got no response on forums, so I'm copying here too.

We did run 'strip --strip-debug' on both tesseract304 and lept172 bins and libraries before release.   This is for an existing code base that is being ported from windows to linux.   All the unit tests are passing in both cases, it appears to be just cosmetic but it's quite a large amount of info to be reported if/when everything is working.

 Doing 'strip' won't help you here.

if you're saying 'strip' won't remove the message here, agree.

just included for thoroughness (it's about only thing we changed from
source w/default builds of aforementioned branches)

we're unfamiliar outside of tesseract beyond emgu and our examples... if
others reading this are the same, here is the instructions on changing
'debug_file' in tesseract

thx, will try and report

 also here is a cross-post to users thread (the response I got there is to
upgrade... which we definately plan on doing once we get existing stuff
working on both platforms ;)

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tesseract-ocr/-K5d2euBJ_I/rEm2eNgdAgAJ

sorry for cross post but more people were complaining than posting answers
so hopefully this bumps up this thread.

will lyk, gr8 work on tesseract... excited to try new version

  It seems that any OpenCL operation on my OS X Yosemite machine triggers attempts to allocate extremely large memory blocks and allocation failures.

The size of the attempted allocation is 1125865547108352 bytes or in hex, 0x3fff800001000, which looks special.

OpenCL otherwise works on my machine. I use the Python OpenCV library and a commercial application that uses OpenCL.

Aside from whatever is happening here, it also looks like a bug that the profile data gets written even if OpenCL fails. I highly doubt my graphics card and processor give identical performance so it looks some invalid calculation takes place and the results are then saved.
## Testing --list-langs

```

 OpenCL info:
  Found 1 platforms.
  Platform name: Apple.
  Version: OpenCL 1.2 (May 10 2015 19:38:45).
  Found 2 devices.
    Device 1 name: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4570 CPU @ 3.20GHz.
    Device 2 name: GeForce GT 755M.
```
 My stab in the dark at any answer is that, for some reason, the OpenCL API or ABI different from Tesseract is expecting as declared in header files.

The malloc error occurs because (openclwrapper.cpp:674) in

```
size_t numDevices;
clGetProgramInfo(... sizeof(numDevices), &numDevices, ...):
```

The call to `clGetProgramInfo` writes the correct value to the lower 32-bit of numDevices, but leaves uninit'ed garbage in the upper 32-bits. But even if this is correct, other OpenCL calls generated errors:

```
[DS] Device: "Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4570 CPU @ 3.20GHz" (OpenCL) evaluation...

OpenCL error code is -54 at   when clEnqueueNDRangeKernel kernel_HistogramRectAllChannelsReduction .
OpenCL error code is -54 at   when clEnqueueNDRangeKernel kernel_ThresholdRectToPix .
```

I'd be happy to investigate further if someone can point me in the right direction.
 I currently get `configure: error: Required OpenCL library not found!` ([associated config.log](https://gist.github.com/4b763df567fb8d2a7a2d)). With 3.04.00 I can compile (and seemingly use) Tesseract configured with `--enable-opencl` ([associated config.log for 3.04.00](https://gist.github.com/5b142efc198986c2e8dc)).
 I tried both master and 3.04.00 with `--enable-opencl` on Ubuntu with Catalyst 15.7 and for my two devices (FX8120 and R9 285) the OCR also outputs a .txt but the content is only empty lines and some wrong characters. Forcing to run without opencl achieves the correct output.

When running with OpenCL on FX8120 there are no warnings or errors during execution, but there are some warnings as `tiff page not found` and `box outside rectangle` on R9 285. In the end, the (wrong) output is the same for any of them.
 With OpenCL-enabled HEAD on OS X, I also get garbage for @jbarlow83's test image.

However if I convert PDFs to TIFF in the way I usually do for OCR with Tesseract, I can get text with OpenCL-enabled HEAD (the BW PDF for [this book](https://archive.org/details/aesopsfables00mclo) in this example):

```
convert -density 300 aesopsfables00mclo_bw.pdf -type Grayscale -compress lzw -background white +matte -depth 32 page_%05d.tif
```

Then OCR with e.g. `for i in page_*.tif; do tesseract $i $(basename $i .tif); done` works fine and produces text (in both text and PDF output modes). This also seems to work for multipage TIFFs (just convert without the `%05d` in the output filename), however, if I try to process a multipage TIFF during the initial OpenCL profiling run, Tesseract always crashes with a SIGABRT after the first page.

Another thing I notice though is that I also get a score of `inf` for my CPU on OpenCL, is this a bug that needs to be fixed in the `HistogramRect`/`ThresholdRectToPix` evaluations?
 Yep, I have the same problem. Try resizing your image to powers of 2. Actually, just resize the canvas, leave the text part unchanged.You could do it with ImageMagick convert, or any image editor like Photoshop. Probably you only need to size the width to power of 2, I didn't test that, but it looks like the pitch is being miscalculated with non-power of two sized images. 
 Oh...didn't mention it, but I get exactly the same output as you. Bring the distorted image up in PhotoShop, Select Filter->Distort->Shear and shear top left to bottom right with Wraparound selected. Do that 2-4 times and the text will magically appear.
 Look at Issue #124
 Hi folks,

i have a similar problems with the garbage output, when i enable opencl. I have checked out the current master revision (bd45b3a). also i get the mangled image with `tesseract -c tessedit_write_images=1 ...` command too.
The OS is Debian 64bit.

My Question is: do i have a malconfigurated system or is it a bug?  Hi,
I'm packaging tesseract for Gentoo Linux. What is the up-to-date download location for training data? We used to download from Google Code, but that looks like it is going to close eventually. Ideally we would like to have pre-packaged .tar.gz files for each language (like we used to have on Google code). Would that be possible also on github?

Should we still use the language files from [here](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/downloads/list) with 3.04.00 ?

Thanks!
 I'm not a user of tesseract user, I'm packaging it. Therefore I'm looking to quickly identify which files I need to provide to the users.  At the moment it seems to be the case that I have to get the source from github, and language files from an old version of google code.  So one issue is that it's not documented that the 3.02 language files and tesseract-3.04 belong together. From what I read in the forums this is indeed the case. The issue is NOT that I want you to tar individual files. The issue is that there is no single official location where to download everything needed to ship your software to your users (in Gentoo).
 OK, thanks. Tesseract-3.04.00 is in Gentoo with up to date traineddata now.
  The current link points to the README file in master branch, rather than the wiki that the intro text implies it should be pointing to.
 That's fair. I saw "wiki" and was confused that it pointed to the README. Thanks for the clarification.
  Hello

I just compiled tesseract 3.04 on CentOS and it works perfectly.

But I´m trying to run mftraining and I´m getting this error:

[~/tesseract-master]# mftraining
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Any suggestions?

Thanks
 ./configure --enable-debug
Then provide a backtrace with gdb (if you know how)
 I have never done that, but anyway I gave a try but got stucked:

 Can you double check the compilation environment?
the reserve function being in ccutil/genericvector.h on line 484 looks like version 3.02.02
Is older version of tesseract already installed?
 @koralatov, did you add this junk message, or was your account hacked? After looking at the activity list, I reported abuse to GitHub.
 Sorry. At some point overnight someone/thing hacked my email and sent these and quite a number of other obviously spammy emails.  I'm cleaning up now.

  Hi,
I'm running 3.05.00dev on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
When running:
`tesseract eng.Arial.exp0.tif eng.Arial.exp0 box.train`
I'm getting a simple one-line output:
`Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v3.05.00dev with Leptonica`

However, no `.tr` output file is created (anywhere in the filesystem).

My work dir listing is:

```

```

Running with gdb doesn't give anything additional.

Anything I can look for for extra info? Any ideas what might be causing this?

Thanks

 @aiwaz, could you try this command:

```
gdb --args tesseract ult.dejavu.exp0.tif ult.dejavu.exp0 box.train
```

(Enter `run` on the gdb command line, and when it reports an error `info stack`)

Warning: Auto orientation and script detection requested, but osd language failed to load
Warning in pixReadMemTiff: tiff page 1 not found
```

And one more question: when I configure tesseract with --prefix option, I expect tesseract to be smart enough to know where my data are. Why do I have to set TESSDATA_PREFIX variable explicitly?
 Setting TESSDATA_PREFIX is not needed as long as your `tessdata` directory is at the right place ($PREFIX/share/tessdata).

`osd.traineddata` will be used for auto orientation and script detection, no matter which language you have selected.
 I tested the fix and confirm that `tesseract ult.dejavu.exp0.tif ult.dejavu.exp0 box.train` now produces `.tr` file.
Thank you guys.

 Marco, the version I tested was 'v3.05.00dev' based on the master branch from git (built by Simon). 

Could it be that one of the newer commits has caused this issue?
 I doubt, more likely you are missing some additional library/program or
a missing configuration.

 Tesseract knows that PDF creation failed and returns an error code. So at least this is not silent data corruption. I'd like to know if the problem is present for PNG input or if it is restricted to TIFF.
 Jeff, it worked for png and jpg for pdf output. This is using the versions compiled by Simon.

 Hmmm.... interesting.  I suspect this is related to that classic Windows problem
where you can't pass file pointers between different DLLs, especially if they use
different runtimes. If so, we may be in trouble.
 Or... do we still have some ifdefs in the code to do Windows streaming I/O a little differently? I vaguely remember writing some back in the day. Maybe they are misbehaving under Cygwin? Can't seem to find them at the moment.
 Marco is able to get the pdf output from the 3.04.00 version he packaged
for cygwin.

I was testing based on the (3.05.dev version) files that were built by Simon. I do not have
cygwin installed but will try downloading the files from the mirrors Marco
suggested and see what happens.

FYI, I downloaded the MSYS2 tesseract-ocr package for 3.04.00 (packaged by
Alex at
https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages/tree/master/mingw-w64-tesseract-ocr)
and am able to get the pdf output from it.

 I went into pbrush and created a Hello World image and saved it as bmp, gif, jpg, png, and tif. When I process those files using tesseract.exe imagefile textfile -l eng, all the files process correctly except the GIF file. I included the GIF and the output below:

If I was a guessing man I would say maybe it is in the temporary file name /tmp/199506_720_mem.gif likely not conforming to MS windows.

A little more information, looking at the pixReadMemGif routine it makes a call to get a temporary file, in doing so that routine tries to ensure that the tmp directory exists, when I created a tmp directory at the root of the drive where I am running tesseract, the GIF file correctly extracted after creating that directory. That is in the Leptonica utils.c file in the genTempFilename routine.
 Maybe leptonic is not built with gif library

 After further research the issue is with the Leptonica utils.c genTempFilename method, it attempts to ensure that the tmp directory exists on the drive where the program is executing, but fails to create the directory so the resulting temp file returned cannot not be created or used. If the tmp directory is created then the GIF file is processed and extracted correctly.

I updated my post when I discovered this short coming.

  /tmp/199506_720_mem.gif is fine for cygwin. Are you using a cygwin build without a proper directory structure ?
 @jbreiden Starting from 1.73 is following the Unix tmp path.
 Might be that I am running on the e: drive instead of the c: drive and that there was no e:\tmp, it was just a matter of the routine not swapping out the /tmp for the windows temporary directory.

I have a number of tempfile patches already written for Leptonica to these calls more
secure and less brittle, and there is ongoing work on this topic. I actually don't know if
cygwin is using the Unix or Windows code path for temporary files, but just want to
mention that there is activity. Don't know why you are getting bad results compared to
other cygwin users.

  Hi,

I just tried to build the training tools using cygwin.
the normal tesseract program seems to work fine.

Thanks for helping.
you are doing all a good job and the recognizationrate is also very nice now in german texts.

that's what it was showing after typing make training:

  the solution is wrong. As strcasestr is not standard,  it is enough to

#define _GNU_SOURCE
before 
#include <string.h>
  https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/tesseract-dev/XllxjvK5HtU/C4mebS6lcJoJ

Jeff suggested that users create a myconfig file. I think it will be useful to actually provide the configuration as 'pdftxt' .
# 

tessedit_create_txt 1
tessedit_create_pdf 1
# 

Then make sure that you invoke the command line such that 
Tesseract writes to files instead of stdout, e.g. 

```
tesseract myimage.tif myoutput pdftxt
```

This will read myimage.tif and pdftxt (config file), and produce myoutput.pdf and myoutput.txt
 Zdenko also has same opinion. So you can close the issue.

I'll add to FAQ if that is ok.
- sent from my phone. excuse the brevity.

  i have success install tesseract , 
tesseract 3.02.02
 leptonica-1.71
  libjpeg 6b : libpng 1.2.49 : zlib 1.2.8

and my libtiff locate in /usr/lib64
locate libtiff
/usr/lib64/libtiff.so.3
/usr/lib64/libtiff.so.3.9.4
/usr/lib64/libtiffxx.so.3
/usr/lib64/libtiffxx.so.3.9.4

so i add  ~/.bash_profile  with
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib64 
and relogin.

but the error still there:  
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v3.02.02 with Leptonica
Error in findTiffCompression: function not present
Error in pixReadStreamTiff: function not present
Error in pixReadStream: tiff: no pix returned
Error in pixRead: pix not read
Unsupported image type.

how i solve it ? thx alot
 i have tried leptonica-1.71/1.72 ,  both have same error.
should i use early leptonica ,   which version of leptonica  is compatible ？
thx
  I have no idea what the box.train config is supposed to do, or what 
missing data it needs. I just don't like segfaults.

 Tesseract should return an error when there is insufficient input, not segfault.
 Pretty good! But even more robust is to locate the lower level function that is crashing
due to bad data. Then modify it to return an error instead of crashing. That protects us 
even if it gets called from a different code path.

 I'd suggest something like this. I didn't check to see if we leak memory
if we go down this error path, but no matter what it is better than a segfault.

 Ray says,

I think there is a bug in InitDSProfile.

I suspect if you change if (status == SUCCESS) to if (status == SUCCESS && profile->numDevices > 0)
at openclwrapper.cpp:3426
then it will work. (You have no devices, and unlike the code here: https://docs.libreoffice.org/opencl/html/opencl__device__selection_8h_source.html
it doesn't correctly always add the native CPU as a device, and therefore attempts to write a null buffer, even though it has no devices.)
 still trouble
 note that if we get through this, I will probably enable OpenCL by default for Debian/Ubuntu
 I'm in stuck. How this code (located at oclkernels.h:1086) can work:

```
pixels.v[i] = imageData[
    w*(BURSTS_PER_WORD*(PIXELS_PER_BURST*NUM_CHANNELS)/CHAR_VEC_WIDTH) + 
    b*((PIXELS_PER_BURST*NUM_CHANNELS)/CHAR_VEC_WIDTH)  + i];
```

where maximum value of index can be 4x higher that size of imageData array
Variables are:
w in range [0 .. count of DWORDS in image), 
b in range [0 .. BURSTS_PER_WORD),
i in range [0 .. (PIXELS_PER_BURST*NUM_CHANNELS)/CHAR_VEC_WIDTH )
Constants values:

```
#define NUM_CHANNELS 4
#define CHAR_VEC_WIDTH 8
#define PIXELS_PER_WORD 32
#define PIXELS_PER_BURST 8
#define BURSTS_PER_WORD (PIXELS_PER_WORD/PIXELS_PER_BURST)
```
 I get a similar looking segfault (but I didn't confirm with gdb) even on a computer that contains a discrete graphics card. Is OpenCL working for anyone at all?
 I can't get fully worked OpenCL configuration. But I have a much different environment (without any other dependencies except leptonica). I've got errors like:
`Access violation reading location 0x58B87000`
That's a position after imageData host's buffer. 
 Just made a bit changes to exclude libtiff dependency.
I have my own input and output streams.
I see, that I can't request any attention without prepare reproducible error in your environment.
 spSerg: you can request attention, but if we can't reproduce you need to supply more information, such as a backtrace from gdb or the output of valgrind (either works much better when ./configure is run with --enable-debug)
 I'm having an unexpectedly hard time with this.

anyone know what is the problem?

 It's another fix of https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/cdc84a5dd79b20beae9dd0a2400211630f361916
 Something like this:
<code>

or this:
<code>

</code>
 <code>UnicharRating</code> is a structure. But such forward declaration as a class will confuse MS compiler in parameter of template.
  I'm trying to reproduce results achieved at the ICDAR page segmentation competitions [1,2] with tesseract. I'm struggling to get the tool to output the hOCR tags that I'm expecting for tables and figures etc [3]. At the moment I'm calling tesseract with pagesegmode 1. Should I be adding other options via a config file to achieve the full extent of tesseracts segmentation and labelling ability (I'm not interested in the character recognition element as much).

 You can use the C-API to only retrieve the page segmentation without doing character recognition. Use TessBaseAPISetPageSegMode to set the segmentation mode, call TessBaseAPIProcessPages, and finally retrieve the page iterator using TessBaseAPIAnalyseLayout. Iterate using the TessPageIteratorNext function at the lowest level and check with TessPageIteratorIsAtBeginningOf if the current symbol is at the start of a new block. All in all it shouldn't be more than a few lines of C code and you're skipping the recognition part of tesseract completely.
 @zdenop thank's for clarifying. Here is the link to my forum post (which contains another answer): https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tesseract-ocr/1Frh-5ggNxg
 @jimregan Cheers! I'm reproducing your answer on the linked forum page (the preferred help location).
  The same issue is reported in https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/issues/detail?can=2&start=0&num=100&q=&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary&groupby=&sort=&id=1307

But the problem is still exists and the ticket is closed.

I got the error during compiling.

Please help. Thanks.
 Thanks for you quick response. My bad, I assume the lib will be ready after configure. Anyway, for the future reference, since we have to compile leptonica in ubuntu 14.04, we should use `LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" make` instead of make.

Then the problem will be resolved.

Thanks.
 Hi,
I am using tesseract-3.04.00 and for leptonica i tried both with 1.72 & 1.71.Still i get the below mentioned issue:-
./.libs/libtesseract.so: undefined reference to `l_generateCIDataForPdf'
./.libs/libtesseract.so: undefined reference to`l_CIDataDestroy'

Request help on this.
 Sorry for the inconvenience.Was able to resolve the issue.Thanks.
 How did you resolve it?
 Yes, how did you solve it @Sayanava ?
 I removed previous 3.03 and re-install 3.04 from scratch. It works.   What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Try to recognize the attached image with Cube mode. Whitelist is '0123456789'. The result is wrong. It's 1234669890 (6 instead of 5, 9 instead of 7).
2. Try to recognize the same image with Combined mode. There is a crach with the following error:
init_cube_objects(true, &tessdata_manager):Error:Assert failed:in file tessedit.cpp, line 203
[1]    5562 abort      tesseract image_sample.jpg stdout -l rus rus-test
It seems that it happens with eng locale as well as with the rus loc.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
In both cases the output should be 1234567890.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
I've tried tesseract 3.03 both on mac and iOS.

Please provide any additional information below.
There is a related thread in the Tesseract-OCR-iOS wrapper, where the issue was originally found: https://github.com/gali8/Tesseract-OCR-iOS/issues/140. You may ask for any additional info there.

 @zdenop Since Cube is going away, perhaps this can be closed?
 How Cube is being discontinued, it's training procedure has not been published to the public.
Somehow I got the feeling that Cube was purposely sabotaged and hindered from the public.  
 The new LSTM based engine is here.

@theraysmith, I see that the Cube engine is still present in the code. Are you going to drop it in the final 4.0 release? @theraysmith

Since the hardware requirements for 4.0 are going to be higher than for 3.xx versions, it will be good to keep Hindi cube+tesseract version also available. 

The accuracy results that you are mentioning for Hindi are for which version - 3.02, 3.03, 3.04 ?   And what about the language model used for the test? Is it already available so I can use it for my own tests? > I'm going to push the data files now.

Got the first ones. My first test with a simple screenshot gave significant better results with LSTM, but needed 16 minutes CPU time (instead of 9 seconds) with a debug build of Tesseract (-O0). A release build (-O2) needs 17 seconds with LSTM, 4 seconds without for the same image.

Are there also new data files planned for old German (deu_frak)? I was surprised that the default English model with LSTM could recognize some words.  1. Is there a 3.04 vs 4.0 branch in tessdata for the traineddata files?

2. Stefan, please share the binaries for 4.0 alpha for Windows. I am
interested in trying the hindi and other indian languages traineddata.
Thanks.

Fraktur was used for an important German newspaper ([Reichsanzeiger](http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/periodika/1/imperial-gazette/)) until 1945. I'd like to try some pages from that newspaper with Tesseract LSTM. Surprisingly even with the English data Tesseract was able to recognize at least some words written in Fraktur. Could you give me some hints how to create the data for `deu_frak`?

There is an Old High German (similar to Old English), but the German translation of the New Testament by Martin Luther (1521) was one of the first major printed books in German, and basically it started the modern German language (High German) which is used until today. > Stefan, please share the binaries for 4.0 alpha for Windows.

You can do it yourself... :) @theraysmith @stweil 

Thank you! I tested a few devanagari pages with the 4.0 alpha windows binaries and traineddata for Hindi, Sanskrit, Marathi and Nepali. This was on a Windows 10 netbook, intel atom 1.33 ghz cpu, x64 based processor, 32 bit os, 2 GB RAM. I tested only with single page images and there was no performance problem on this basic netbook. The accuracy is much improved in the LSTM version. This is by just eyeballing the output (not using any software for comparison). 

From a user point of view, better accuracy maybe preferred to speed. So LSTM based engine seems the way to go, at least for devanagari scripts. I will test some of the other Indian languages later.

I have noticed some differences in processing between Hindi and the other Devanagari based languages and will add issues to the tessdata repository.

Thanks to the developers at Google and the tesseract community!



 @theraysmith 
> I don't think I generated the original deu_frak. I have the fonts to do so with LSTM, but I don't know if I have a decent amount of corpus data to hand. 

I have a decent amount of corpus data for Fraktur from scanned books at hand, about 500k lines in hOCR files (~50GB with TIF images). I've yet to publish it, but if you have somewhere where I could send/upload it, I'd be glad to.

Or is there a way to create the neccessary training files myself? I've had a cursory look through the OCR code and it looked like it needed `lstmf` files, but I haven't yet found what these are supposed to look like. >  500k lines should make it work really well. I would be happy to take it and help you, but we would have to get into licenses, copyright and all that first.

The text is CC0 and the images are CC-BY-NC, so that shouldn't be an issue :-) They're going to be public anyway once I've prepped the dataset for publication.
But even better if there are instructions, looking forward to playing around with training! Ray,

Please see my recent comment and attached files in
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/issues/6

Adding config files to trained data for san, mar and nep will fix this
issue related to skipped text with default psm.

I made a copy of hin.config and changed the default engine to oem 4, LSTM.
I also removed the blacklisting of 1, since Indo-arabic numbers in Latin
scripts are used quite commonly with Devanagari script text.

There are various other Devanagari related options in the config file,
which can be removed, if not needed with LSTM.

Thanks.
 Sad news: Cube is no longer with us.

Cube, you will be missed...

 @jbaiter have you tried 4.0 training for Fraktur?

@theraysmith Is there a way to use the old box-tiff pairs at https://github.com/paalberti/tesseract-dan-fraktur for LSTM training?

 >Is there a way to use the old box-tiff pairs at https://github.com/paalberti/tesseract-dan-fraktur for LSTM training?

There will be a way to generate a box file from a tiff image. The box file will be written in the [textline format](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00#box-file-fornat---second-option)
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/659#issuecomment-272564420
I started working on this today. I wrote the needed code and It seems to output the desired format, but I need to do some tests before publishing it. 
 @amitdo Not sure if that will work for Devanagari, because of the length of unicode string.

Is it possible to just add a box with  the tab character at end of each line for existing box files? >Not sure if that will work for Devanagari, because of the length of unicode string.

We will wait and see...

>Is it possible to just add a box with the tab character at end of each line for existing box files?

You mean manually?
You should add box coordinates, not just tab.    cntraining clusterer's are deleted, the last one is saved and used during final write, it seems. However there are still leaks with the protolists.. we still store the old protolists in the NormProtoList. This needs to be fixed somehow. 

mftraining memory leaks are fixed.
  I have updated the pkgbuild for tesseract-ocr for msys2 - please see https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages/pull/673
and make any required changes.

Thanks!
  I get a format specifier warning when building for Android using clang and tess-two:

```
jni/com_googlecode_tesseract_android/src/api/pdfrenderer.cpp:537:28: warning: format specifies type 'long' but the argument has type 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned int') [-Wformat]
               "stream\n", len);
                           ^~~
```

I think it should be `%zd` or `%zu` instead of `%ld`, but I'm not sure if that works on Visual Studio too.
 I'm the author of this code. I'd prefer to keep using size_t for this number since PDF files can be really big (although, this code will break for other reasons once we get larger than 10 gigabytes). Not sure what to do here to make all platforms happy.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2524611/how-to-print-size-t-variable-portably
 OK--since this warning isn't indicative of a larger problem, and there's no clear solution for muting this warning across the board, let's close this issue.
 That's not a solution. It's a bug, not a compiler warning which must be muted.

You will get a wrong results on little endian platforms when sizeof(long) != sizeof(size_t).
On big endian platforms the result is wrong when sizeof(long) > sizeof(size_t).

Adding a type cast would help: (long)len

Even better would be replacing "%ld" by "%lu" and using  this: (unsigned long)len
  The original issue tracker is gone, but there's an archived version here:
https://web.archive.org/web/20150413012229/https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/issues/detail?id=1378

Basically the request is to output the information contained in a hOCR file in tabular TSV format.
 Can this be merged to provide support for tables?

Thanks!
 What is the use case for this? I can't find any earlier discussion. As far as I can tell, all the information is included already in the hOCR output (more actually since it host LTR/RTL, italic/bold, etc) -- and, of course, even more info is available programmatically through the API.

Here's some example output: http://teksty.klf.uw.edu.pl/12/1/alice_1.png.hocr.tsv
archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20160201190446/http://teksty.klf.uw.edu.pl/12/1/alice_1.png.hocr.tsv
 I've created a cleaned up version of this code in #245. I'm not really happy about adding even more crap to baseapi.cpp, but I've got a separate branch to refactor the hOCR renderer out of it, so I can add the TSV renderer to that, if it's decided to include it in Tess.
 Wouldn't it be easier to keep the `TSV` code out of the Tesseract code and to provide a standalone script which does a transformation from `hOCR` to `TSV`? Such a script could also be used with `hOCR` generated by other tools.

 The earlier issue mentioned is at: https://web.archive.org/web/20151128094905/http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/issues/detail?id=918

Basically it posits that TSV output as a (partial?) solution to table layout analysis.  I think it's a bit more involved that that, but I have no strong feelings one way or the other on adding this.

Pros:
- provides a simpler format for consumers than parsing HTML
- not really that big: 1 API call, 1 config variable, <200 lines code
- having it directly supports eliminates the need for external helper scripts

Cons:
- largely duplicates functionality available in hOCR output
- one more place to update if new information gets added to the output
- downstream consumers are going to be custom programs, so they could integrate HTML parsing instead of TSV parsing (with a small increase in complexity)

Like I said, I'm neutral. I'll let others argue yea or nay.
 Thanks Tom, for listing out the pros and cons for tsv.

As a user, I support having a simpler format of output without external
scripts :-)

Regarding the duplication of functionality, is it not possible to use a
common routine and then branch off based on required output format.

  Just glanced at the code and wondered why on Earth multiplication and division is being done in every iteration, especially on inner, nested loops. Look at this:

PIXELS_PER_BURST*NUM_CHANNELS)/CHAR_VEC_WIDTH

This is inside a loop nested 3 deep. How many wasted clock cycles is this? Are we assuming that the compiler will optimize this out? If you're benchmarking with debug builds, your numbers are going to be way off, as in meaningless.
  I don't think it is going to happen.
