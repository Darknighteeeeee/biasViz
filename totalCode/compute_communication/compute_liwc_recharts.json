The the values can also be part of consistent:\r\n\r\n* `overflow=\"discard\"` (default) \u2013 If the reference item falls partly outside the canvas, don't display it. This is the old default.\r\n* `overflow=\"extendDomain\"` \u2013 If the reference item falls partly outside the canvas, extend the domain so it fits. This is the old alwaysShow behavior.\r\n* `overflow=\"hidden\"` \u2013 If the reference item falls partly outside the canvas, clip it to the canvas.\r\n* `overflow=\"visible\"` \u2013 If the reference item falls partly outside the canvas, draw it anyway.\r\n @paulmelnikow OK! It's best to remain the `overflow` property in `PRESENTATION_ATTRIBUTES`. @paulmelnikow Any idea to update the value of `ifOverflow`:  `keep` to `visible` and `clip` to `hidden`?  Sorry for the bug, It has been fixed in `1.0.1`.  Please fix the failed test cases.  @vincentljn Thanks for your advice. The new props means to show the tooltip by default or not. So I think it's better to rename the  props to `defaultShowTooltip`!  We can't setState in a render function.  @jabsatz Thanks for you suggestion! I'll add a new className to the wrapper element of <Tooltip /> which can  allow you to know the relatively position of Tooltip. And It's recommended to use css to render the arrow or other icon.  @dbMundada  \r\n\r\nYou can set `interval` of `XAxis` to be `0` which has default value `preserveEnd`(Chech [doc of XAxis](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/XAxis) for detail) to force all the ticks to be shown.\r\n Meanwhile you may need to set the `angle` of <XAxis /> to rotate the ticks.\r\n  @xnog `ResponsiveContainer` will calculate the height of its parent node, so you just need to make sure its parent node has right height, otherwise  `ResponsiveContainer` can't calculate right height.  @tomorrowface Please show more code and result of you case.  @riwu We use `cloneElement` to pass some props calculation in `Legend`. So If you use `content` props of `Legend`, you should allow the passed props.  @markogresak  The test cases failed.  @markogresak The first test case is timeout.  I'll merge this pr, and try the tests again. Thank you !  @dadamssg Thanks! It's not quite safe to check the points. I'll add `try...catch...` in the code to fix the bug in IE.   @yaroslav-perec Thanks! But this can't fix the problem! I'll fix the bug of `componentWillReceiveProps` in `generateCategoricalChart`  which shouldn't update when all the props are not changed.  @Slngle Don't support gantt chart now.  @Eric24 The behavior of RadialBarChart is same to BarChart's behavior now.  @Eric24 If you don't want to show the `label` in `Tooltip`, you can hide it.  1. Only valueKey is deprecated, we have updated the props in [recharts.org](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Pie).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6111424/33984658-60dbdb3e-e0f3-11e7-8754-bc11a73e1bf4.png)\r\n\r\n2.  LabelList can be used in `<Area />`, `<Bar />` , `<Line />`, `<Scatter />` , `<Pie />`, `<Radar />`, `<RadialBar />`. This'll be displayed in [recharts.org](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Pie)\r\n3. When you add `label` props, a `<Label />` will be created internally.\r\n```jsx\r\n<XAxis dataKey=\"name\">\r\n    <Label value=\"Pages of my website\" offset={0} position=\"insideBottom\" />\r\n</XAxis>\r\n```\r\n\r\nequals to\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<XAxis dataKey=\"name\" label={{ value: 'Pages of my website', offset: 0, position: 'insidebottom' }} />\r\n```\r\n4. When you mouse enter the chart area, the grey rectangle which is called `cursor` of `Tooltip` will appear. You can change the style of \"the grey rectangle\" by setting [`cursor` of `Tooltip`](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Tooltip).\r\n\r\n5. We'll try to update the demos, but PR is also welcome in [recharts.org](https://github.com/recharts/recharts.org). We need more contribution to make recharts better and better.  @Eric24 \r\nBecause only one group of bar is supported in Recharts 0.x. We want to support multi groups of bar in 1.0+ just like BarChart, so we move the props startAngle, endAngle to RadialBarChart.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6111424/32935928-306bc4e2-cbad-11e7-9310-a00313d35bd3.png)\r\n\r\nAnd If you have specified the props `starAngle`, `endAngle`, `clockWise` is no longer needed, so this props is removed.\r\n\r\nThe props minAngle and maxAngle are used to specify the domain of PolarAngleAxis, so they are removed too. Try to set the range of PolarAngleAxis.\r\n\r\nAll the changes have been updated in [recharts.org](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/RadialBar).  @Eric24 Add `type = \"number\"` to `XAxis`  @hlehmann OK! So we should maintain `reduce-css-calc` temporarily.  @jshupptechnologies  Add `onMouseMove` to `LineChart`.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<LineChart onMouseMove={...}>\r\n  <Line />\r\n</LineChart>\r\n```  @no-mercy Maybe you can render this kind of line by customized shape of <Line />.  @pachuka You can check [the latest doc of LabelList](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/LabelList). You can render customized component by adding props `content` of LabelList.  @lerayne When you render Pie in SSR, you can set the props `id` of `<Pie />`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<Pie id=\"specifiedId\" />\r\n```\r\n  @KamiGim You can use `ResponsiveContainer` to render a chart which has dynamic height.\r\n\r\n[Docs of ResponsiveContainer](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/ResponsiveContainer)  @PJEstrada \r\n\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/oqg00j2j/21/\r\n\r\nYou should change the `type` of `XAxis`.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<BarChart layout=\"vertical\" data={rows}\r\n                              margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\r\n\r\n                        <YAxis axisLine={false} tickLine={false}  dataKey=\"name\" type=\"category\">\r\n                        </YAxis>\r\n                        <XAxis type=\"number\" />\r\n                        <Bar dataKey=\"valuePre\" fill=\"#00a0dc\" label={<Text scaleToFit={true} verticalAnchor=\"middle\" />}/>\r\n                        <Bar dataKey=\"valuePost\" fill=\"#c7c7c7\"  label={<Text verticalAnchor=\"middle\" />}/>\r\n\r\n                    </BarChart>\r\n```  @hlehmann PR is welcome, `reduce-css-calc` is not necessary.  @flyg101 Thanks! This has been fixed in latest 1.0.0-beta.6.\r\n\r\n[Brush.js#L25](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/cartesian/Brush.js#L25)  @richbai90 Thanks! I have a little doubt about the props name `gpuRender` which  is `gpuRendering` in your demo. Maybe `isTranslate3d` or `useTranslate3d` is better.   @adrienpoly Can you create a simple project to reproduce this problem. Everything works in my local project.  @eldyvoon The second dot just has empty stroke, and the default fill `#fff`. So The second dot is  invisible.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6111424/33469541-696f749a-d69e-11e7-8ef8-ce5e1dcc974f.png)\r\n  ## Do you want to request a feature or report a bug?\r\n\r\nbug\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nMultiple items on a single chart stack up on the same Y-Axis.. \r\n\r\n## If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: http://jsfiddle.net/ndLhnegs/).\r\n\r\n## What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nThey should be on different lines.. see screenshot: http://prntscr.com/hg09ug\r\n\r\nIn alpha.6 and later, the shapes only appear on one line (ie. the PROGRAM line in the screenshot)\r\n\r\n## Which versions of Recharts, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

I can't reproduce this case.  @guilhermedelucas All you need is the legend should keep visible when all the datas are 0. right ?  @ljwagerfield `verticalPoints` and `horizontalPoints` are the coordinates of vertical points and horizontal points. Only number type is supported now. @ljwagerfield I forget that svg support percentage coordinate. But the percentage means the percentage of the whole viewBox of <svg />, not the percentage of the main chart area now. @ljwagerfield Thanks! We'll consider about this kind of request.  See:\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/ad071owf/\r\nSame Fiddle with beta.2:\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/ad071owf/1/\r\n\r\nIf you hover over one of the bars, there is a gray rectangle shown at the left side.\r\nI tried a `git bisect` to find the commit that introduced the issue, but I cannot reproduce it in the demo. @jochenberger I can't reproduce it in my local project too. jsfiddle seems very strange now. I can't select texts correctly too. Seems to work again with beta.4: http://jsfiddle.net/ad071owf/2/ No, I must have missed something. It's still wrong in beta.4. Beta 5 too: http://jsfiddle.net/ad071owf/3/  Try 1.0.0-beta.4.  Sorry! My fault! I removed  **  in src/. But the lib/ were not updated. 1.0.0-beta.4 has been released to resolve this. Thanks!  @eldyvoon  You must return a svg element when `value != 0`.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you can use `formatter` to return a formatted value. \r\n\r\n[Try this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/1cu9amk9/)  @ZheyangSong Thanks! But we have defined `name` in `Line`, `Area`, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n[propType of name in Line](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/cartesian/Line.js#L36) @ZheyangSong Thanks, I'll add propType of name in `Scatter`. @ZheyangSong `name` is a configuration property of `Scatter`. So I think it's ok!  @JarLowrey Duplicated ticks of XAxis is allowed in LineChart, AreaChart...  In the case of ScatterChart, It seems more reasonable to remove duplicated ticks of category xAxis. I wonder,  is there any case that the ticks of XAxis can be duplicated too.\r\n\r\nIn such case, we may need a props allowDuplicated in XAxis when the type is `category`. \r\n  @huei-tan-sociomantic Thanks for your contribution. But I think the AnimationDecorator seems to be very strange now which has some inelegant codes like the following. \r\nWe need to find a best point between code duplication and readability. So I think such kind of `AnimationDecorator` is not so elegant now.\r\n```jsx\r\n+function componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\r\n +  const {\r\n +    isAnimationActive, animationId, points, data, baseLine, sectors,\r\n +  } = this.props;\r\n +\r\n +  if (nextProps.isAnimationActive !== isAnimationActive) {\r\n +    if (sectors) this.setState({ prevSectors: [] }); // Pie\r\n +  } else if (nextProps.animationId !== animationId) {\r\n +    if (points) this.setState({ prevPoints: points }); // Line Area Scatter Radar\r\n +    if (data) this.setState({ prevData: data }); // Bar RadialBar\r\n +    if (baseLine) this.setState({ prevBaseLine: baseLine }); // Area\r\n +    if (sectors) this.setState({ prevSectors: sectors }); // Pie\r\n +  }\r\n +}\r\n```\r\n\r\n   Thanks~ @ryanand26 \r\nBut I still can't reproduce this problem ...  @huei-tan-sociomantic Thank you for all your answers and PRS.

Can you create an online demo to reproduce this problem?  Try 1.0.0-beta.3.  @goodrichj Please show more information about your problem. @bibblebabl Just try the latest version 1.0.0-beta.5.  @huei-tan-sociomantic Yeah. The behavior of animation is really strange.   @huei-tan-sociomantic  The props `minPointSize` is used to set a visible angle when the value is very small and no bar is visible.  \r\n`minAngle` and `maxAngle` were used to set the `domain` of `angleAxis`. I plan to remove  `minAngle` and `maxAngle`, and developers can set these props by the `domain` of `PolarAngleAxis` which is  same to `XAxis`.  It has been updated.  @huei-tan-sociomantic Thanks for your enthusiasm!  But so far, there is  no other supporters of new file structure. So I close it!   Duplicated to #955   Any idea  to reproduce this issue?\r\n\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/u3nny58q/\r\n\r\nThe labels are re-rendered when you change `isAnimationActive`.  @eldyvoon You can get width and height from `this.props`. @eldyvoon Yeah, you can get the width and height of the corresponding bar from the props of `< CustomLabel  />`.  @gplatt It's a workaround to use `customized shape` of <RadialBar />.\r\n  Add the following props to `Tooltip`.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Tooltip cursor={false} />\r\n```  @milasevicius Don't support now.  @daphnesmit When you move to another page, how about the first page?

We want to support multi groups of bar in 1.0+ just like BarChart, so we move the props `startAngle`, `endAngle` to RadialBarChart.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6111424/32935928-306bc4e2-cbad-11e7-9310-a00313d35bd3.png)\r\n\r\nAnd If you have specified the props `starAngle`, `endAngle`, `clockWise` is no longer needed, so this props is removed.\r\n\r\nThe props `minAngle` and `maxAngle` are used to specify  the domain of `PolarAngleAxis`, so they are removed too. Try to set the `range` of `PolarAngleAxis` after I resolve some bug.\r\n Try to set the range of `PolarAngleAxis` in recharts 1.0.0-beta.3  @Kroderia Svg can't render too much points now. Maybe you can change the interaction of such huge number of points.  @Danielh21 It's recommended to use  type `monotone` which will generate almost-smooth curve \r\nand guarantee the monotonicity of all the points at the same time.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Line  type=\"monotone\" />\r\n```\r\n  @alishir You can specify the type of `<XAix />` to be `number` which has default value \"category\".\r\n  @alishir Yeah, It's supported now.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n        <ScatterChart width={400} height={400} margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 0, left: 20 }}>\r\n            <XAxis type=\"number\" dataKey=\"x\" name=\"stature\" unit=\"cm\" />\r\n            <YAxis type=\"number\" dataKey=\"y\" name=\"weight\" unit=\"kg\" />\r\n            <CartesianGrid />\r\n            <Tooltip />\r\n            <Legend/>\r\n            <Scatter name=\"A school\" data={data01} fill=\"#ff7300\">\r\n              {\r\n                data01.map((entry, index) => {\r\n                  return <Cell key={`cell-${index}`} fill={colors[index % colors.length]} />\r\n                })\r\n              }\r\n            </Scatter>\r\n          </ScatterChart>\r\n```  @alishir Try the latest version 1.0.0-beta.4.\r\n\r\n[Check this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/emjnymxy/)  Any idea to reproduce this case ? I can't reproduce this case in my local project. I've been trying, and as a result of trying I somehow got it working, although I don't know what I've done differently. But I'm happy now, so I'll go ahead and close this. Thanks for the help @ryanand26 and @xile611  I'm going to reopen because I was able to reproduce based on what @rafaelc0sta mentioned. If the initial render includes one `<Scatter/>` and a subsequent render adds another `<Scatter/>` it throws the error.\r\n\r\n@rafaelc0sta if you move the lines to constructor() then it won't update, so it doesn't really solve the problem for me. I doubt this is helpful, but I tried upgrading to React 16 and it may include better error details:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninvariant.js?7313:42 Uncaught Error: React.Children.only expected to receive a single

It seem that the length of data is too big which is bigger than the width of chart. @flamencoflsh Check the type of data loaded from server, maybe the type of 'points' is string not number.  @tuliglowicz You can add a `YAxis` which has props `hide={true}`.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<LineChart>\r\n  <YAxis  hide />\r\n</LineChart>\r\n```  @alyssaq  What about the version of lodash.

If you just want 10 ticks, then 10 ticked will be calculated internally by recharts.\r\n\r\nSo for the second problem, you can just spect `ticks={[100, 150, 200, 300, ....]}`  @apodaka \r\n\r\nWhen you update `predictions`, only two BarCharts are rendered in your code. If you want render 4 BarCharts when update `predictions`, you can add a copied attribute of `predictions` in the state. When you update the `predictions`, the copied  `predictions` are not updated, then you can achieve what you want.  @chin-idean When use `connectNulls` for `Line` or `Area`, If the second point is Null, we'll skip the second point, and  connect the first point and the third point now, just like the behavior of `Area`.\r\nThere's some bug of  `connectNulls` of `Line` now.\r\n\r\nIn you case, it's recommended to fill 0 for null entries before added to charts.\r\n   @mmcc  \r\nWhen you a same props `syncId`  to a `LineChart` and a `BarChart`, the tooltips of these two charts can be synced.\r\n\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<LineChart  syncId=\"someChart\" />\r\n<BarChart  syncId=\"someChart\" />\r\n```  @sh3nan1gans I think this has been fixed.

Duplicated width #797   @JonathanUsername Please resolve conflicts.  @Swarna-Jain  Can you create a jsfiddle example ?  OK~  @Hegoakerbeltz I think If you can bind events to the `dots` of `Line`, you can achieve what you want.  @Rinoy888 \r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n  <XAxis tick={{ fill: 'red' }} />\r\n```  @liubko  You can render customized ticks by specifying the `tick` to be a function or react element.\r\nIt's not a bug now.\r\n  @Ziker22 \r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst handleClick = (entry, index, e) => {\r\n  console.log(e.pageX, e.pageY);\r\n};\r\n\r\n<PieChart>\r\n  <Pie onClick={handleClick} />\r\n</PieChart>\r\n```  Fixed in version 1.0.0-alpha.1  @imtmh You can add `formatter` to `Tooltip`.  @flamencoflsh Check out [this demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/PieResponsiveContainer).  @alexliu-github Of course, just like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/fdznq2z4/).  @pedroabreu  If the ticks of `YAxis` is required to be integer, you can specify\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<YAxis allowDecimals={false} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe props `allowDecimals` has default value `true`. @pedroabreu Please create a demo to reproduce your problem.  @lolcookie You can add `ReferenceDot`.\r\n\r\n[Docs about ReferenceDot](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/ReferenceDot).  @IanVS You can set `height` of `Legend`, otherwise the chart will update when the height of `Legend` change.\r\n\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Legend height={60} wrapperStyle={{top: 0, right: 0, width: 'auto'}}/>\r\n```  Fixed in version 1.0.0 + .  @xiaosansiji You can read the source code of Recharts. \r\n\r\nIf you have used react, you can use react and d3.\r\nOtherwise, you can use d3 alone.\r\n  solved hence closing   @maurocolella Can you create a jsfiddle demo to reproduce this problem.  @Eric24 Use css or customized tick to omit the first tick.\r\n\r\nCss just like:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n\r\n.recharts-x-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick:first-child line {\r\n stroke: none;\r\n}\r\n.recharts-x-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick:first-child text {\r\n  font-size: 0;\r\n}\r\n```  http://jsfiddle.net/1509v3gc/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can set `barGap={0}`. http://jsfiddle.net/1509v3gc/1/\r\n\r\nThen you can set `barCategoryGap={0}`.\r\n\r\n@Eric24  Maybe you can help us to translate the api of `BarChart` more accurately. OK, thanks~  @durongzhang Please create an online demo to reproduce this problem.  @yokeyang Set the props `isAnimationActive` of `Line`, `Bar`, `Area`, `Scatter` to be `false`.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Line isAnimationActive={false} />\r\n```\r\n\r\n[docs](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Line)  @OlegE90 It should not be the bug of recharts. Everything works well in my local project. You can create a simple project to reproduce this problem, otherwise I have no idea what's your problem.  @cmaurer \r\n\r\nUse `Cell` to set different colors for each bars now, just like [this demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/PieChartWithCustomizedLabel)\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Bar>\r\n {\r\n   data.map((entry, index) => {\r\n      return <Cell fill={colors[index]} key={`cell-${index}`} />\r\n  })\r\n }\r\n</Bar>\r\n```\r\n\r\n   You can use `fill = \"red\"` to set the background-color of `CartesianGrid`.  You can use `ScatterChart` to render this.  @wy19900814 It's recommended to do this kind of messages yourself.   You can bind `onClick` to `Legend`.\r\n\r\n[Similar demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/LegendEffectOpacity) Similar to [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/Luk2xapk/). @NischithBopaiah You can just render anything you like when you customized legeng `content`. If you have ever used any react UI project like `ReactBootstrap`, you can use components like `Popover` to render what you want.\r\n\r\nI think [http://jsfiddle.net/Luk2xapk/1/](http://jsfiddle.net/Luk2xapk/1/) is what you want.   @Ziker22 Check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/f76d7q18/).  I have no idea now, if you want to hover the lines much more easier, you can only change the strokeWidth of `Line`.  @alexabruck Use customized label function to cover default behaviors.  recharts has used babel plugin `babel-plugin-lodash`. You can check the compiled file of recharts like [this](https://unpkg.com/recharts@0.22.3/lib/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js), the plugin will replace the import of lodash by needed files.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/25259488/fdcd3748-2678-11e7-8f69-b98356a2a575.png)\r\n  How about the version of react ? @nbolt Can you create a simple project to reproduce your problem ? It' works well in my project which use react 15.4.2. The jsfiddle is out of date.\r\n\r\n[Check this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/qbmg1567/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=qbmg1567)\r\n\r\nWe have import prop-types now. \r\n  How about the version of react ? any error message?   @MarkHarper Check the [examples of recharts](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleLineChart). You should import more external pkgs. @MarkHarper How about the version of your react ? OK~  I'm using 15.4 now. I think 15.4 works well.  You can use customized content of `Tooltip` like [this demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomContentOfTooltip).  Thanks! It's a feature in plan. @jzillmann Done in 1.0.0-alpha.0.  @jpmelnik You can specify the domain  of `YAxis`:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n  <YAxis domain={[130, 200]} allowDataOverflow>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbout the props allowDataOverflow, you can check the [api of `XAxis`](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/XAxis). @jpmelnik It seems the max value of height is `124.26`. Why do you want to set the domain to be `[130, 200]`? @jpmelnik You can add a `YAxis` which has a different `yAxisId` like `\"height\"`.\r\n\r\nThe default `yAxisId` of `YAxis` is `0`, and `Line` has default props `yAxisId` 0. So you need to create another `y-axis`.  \r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<LineChart width={750} height={550} data={this.data()}\r\n          margin={{ top: 15, right: 20, left: 20, bottom: 15 }}>\r\n          <XAxis {...xAxisProps} />\r\n          <YAxis {...yAxisProps} yAxisId=\"height\" />\r\n          <YAxis />\r\n          {/*<CartesianGrid />*/}\r\n          {/*<CartesianAxis />*/}\r\n          <Tooltip />\r\n          <Legend />\r\n          <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"d\" stroke=\"#FF0403\" />\r\n          <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"c\" stroke=\"#E8760F\" />\r\n          <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"b\" stroke=\"#AA29E8\" />\r\n          <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"a\" stroke=\"#5D7DFF\" />\r\n   </LineChart>\r\n``` @jpmelnik Ok~  @codeHatcher It's the event module of node.  @velociwabbit \r\n\r\nYou can specify the `height` of `XAxis` which has default value 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n  <XAxis height={40} />\r\n```  @netheril96 Check the [examples of Recharts](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples).  Thanks! I have updated all the demos.  Similar to [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/va9nnx5r/).  @martin-svk @evenchange4 Can anybody create a simple github repo to reproduce this problem ? Thanks! I have found the problem. \r\nIn 0.22.0,\r\n\r\n`LineChart.js`  depend on `generateCategoricalChart.js`\r\n`generateCategoricalChart.js` depend on `Brush.js`\r\nand `Brush.js`  depend on `LineChart.js`\r\n\r\n\r\nso cause this bug.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll this soon.\r\n  @lorenzo-pomili Please show me an online example. @lorenzo-pomili  Is the behavior of [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/xtrr8nhw/1/) what you want ?\r\n\r\nIf so, add props `stackOffset=\"sign\"` to `BarChart`.\r\n\r\nThe default value of `stackOffset` is `\"none\"` which'll sum the stacked values.\r\n\r\nYou can also check the [stackOffset of d3](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#stack-offsets) for more details.  @digorydoo It's a feature I have done in my local project. This feature'll be released in 1.0 version of recharts. In late April. @digorydoo   @jpmelnik \r\n\r\nYou can filter the input data first.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst inputData = _. uniqBy(dataset, entry => entry.height).\r\n\r\n\r\n<LineChart data={inputData}>\r\n</LineChart>\r\n```  @nikhilbhawsinka \r\nFind the className of the outermost div, and add some css to that div.\r\n\r\n```\r\n.recharts-wrapper {\r\n  margin : 0 auto;\r\n}\r\n```   @sughanpandita \r\n\r\nYou can hide line by css:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.recharts-line .recharts-curve {\r\n  stroke: none;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor you can done by specifying the stroke of line and dot\uff1a\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n  const dotStyle = { stroke: '#8884d8' };\r\n\r\n  <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"cpu\" stroke=\"none\" dot={dotStyle} activeDot={{r: 8}}/>\r\n``` \r\n\r\n  @skvale The `dataKey` can be a function now, so we can only use `child.key`.  @sortsen You can change the layout of `Legend`.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Legend layout=\"vetical\" verticalAlign=\"middle\" align=\"right\" />\r\n```  @peternoyes  You can render customized `Tooltip` content like [this demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomContentOfTooltip).  @sughanpandita Just as your demo, use a `dateFormat` to format the ticks.  @Omortis You can try this:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nhandleEnter = ({ isTooltipActive, activePayload, activeTooltipIndex, activeLabel}) => {\r\n  \r\n};\r\n\r\nhandleLeave = () => {\r\n  console.log(arguments);\r\n};\r\n\r\nhandleMove = (chartState, e) => {\r\n \r\n};\r\n\r\nrender() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <LineChart  onMouseEnter={this.handleEnter}  onMouseLeave={this.handleLeave} onMouseMove={this.handleMove}>\r\n    </LineChart>  \r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the `showTooltipData` should be a stateless function/ReactElement.  @jasonnathan I prefer [1]. I'm doing this too which is also a main part of 1.0 of recharts. I'll try to release 1.0 in this month. @jasonnathan This feature has been released in 1.0.0-apha.0  @SergeyShablenko Maybe the data of your chart changed.  Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? I have no idea when only have a image. @SergeyShablenko How about the domain of `XAxis`? Reopen this when more clues are provided.  @mehdivk @sonofjack  \r\n\r\nYou can set the props `scale` to be `point` to achieve this.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n            <ComposedChart width={800} height={400} data={data}\r\n              margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 5, left: 20 }}>\r\n              <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" scale=\"point\" />\r\n              <YAxis />\r\n              <Legend layout=\"vertical\" align=\"right\" verticalAlign=\"middle\"/>\r\n              <CartesianGrid stroke=\"#f5f5f5\" />\r\n              <Tooltip />\r\n              <Area type=\"monotone\" dataKey='amt' fill=\"#8884d8\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" />\r\n              <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#ff7300\" />\r\n              <Bar dataKey=\"pv\" barSize={20} fill=\"#413ea0\" />\r\n              <Brush>\r\n                <LineChart>\r\n                  <Line dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#ff7300\" dot={false} />\r\n                </LineChart>\r\n              </Brush>\r\n            </ComposedChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/24785483/cf0fa0d6-1b8c-11e7-9a68-843990a50378.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's also recommended to add some `padding` of `XAxis`:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst padding = { left: 20, right: 20 };\r\n\r\n<ComposedChart width={800} height={400} data={data}\r\n              margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 5, left: 20 }}>\r\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" scale=\"point\" padding={padding} />\r\n</ComposedChart>\r\n```   @neekey Use `<text>` or `<tspan>` of svg.   Similar to [the demo of tooltip](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomContentOfTooltip).\r\n\r\nPlease check [the document of Legend](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Legend) for detail.\r\n  @seleckis You can render an invisible sector inside the visible sector by customized shape and active shape.  @CalinaCristian You can use customized `tick` like this [demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomizedLabelLineChart).  @jshamley It's recommended to call `parseInt()` or `parseFloat` before passing to `recharts`.  Maybe you mean `ScatterChart` ? @nikolay-g Not support! You can use `ScatterChart` to render this kind of bubbles. But I think you can use `divs` to render bubbles too.  @Omortis Please check this [example](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomContentOfTooltip) for detail.\r\n Because the payload of `Tooltip` will change when you interact with the chart, so you need to judge whether the payload is existing.  It's a feature I have done in my local project. This feature'll be released in 1.0 version of recharts.  @iambalajive You can change the `height` of `XAxis` which has a default value 30.  @Billy- You can get warning when `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.  Fixed.  @nickpalmer You can check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/xht7qwbj/).\r\n\r\n`Treemap` is still very simple now.  Suggestion is welcome.   Duplicated with #365   1. Drop ticklines\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<XAxis tickLine={false}  />\r\n<YAxis tickLine={false}  />\r\n```\r\n2. Set default font, color\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<XAxis stroke=\"black\" fontFamily=\"sans-serif\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nor use css\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.recharts-wrapper .recharts-y-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick text {\r\n  font-fanmily: sans-serif;\r\n  fill: black;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease check [rechart.org](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/) for more demos.\r\n\r\n\r\n Just look for [svg styling attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html).  @maryxi Yeah, because we can't calculate the percentage of each items when the denominator is 0.\r\nWhen I such case, It's recommended to render some message in your project.  @Eric24 You can add two `XAxis` to render this kind of charts.\r\n\r\n[Similar issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/439)  @noahwatson Change the order of <YAxis /> and <Bar /> to resolve this.  See [example](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/BiaxialBarChart).  @Grumlen Try the latest version 1.0.0-beta.1  @tkohlman It's resolved in 1.0.0.

Change the order of <YAxis /> and <Tooltip /> can resolve this.\r\n\r\n[Check this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/bbuktzo8/).  @sisiguo I can't reproduce this problem. Please check your dependencies, maybe you have used some third-party PropTypes library.  @dadamssg Use component `ReferenceDot`.\r\n\r\n[API](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/ReferenceDot)  @Arrow7000   \r\n\r\nYou must use component `ReferenceLine` not a customized component.\r\nCheck the [code](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L1040) for detail.\r\n\r\nWhen we render `ScatterChart`, we'll check the `type` of children to find out the `ReferenceLine` instances and append some props to the instances. So If you add a customized component to the `ScatterChart`, we can't identify it as a `ReferenceLine` element.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n              <ResponsiveContainer width=\"100%\" height={400}>\r\n                <ScatterChart >\r\n                    <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" />\r\n                    <Scatter name=\"vector\" data={data} fill='#8884d8'\r\n                        line\r\n                        shape={shape} />\r\n                    <XAxis dataKey=\"time\" name=\"time\" unit=\"seconds\" label=\"seconds\" domain={[0, 1]} />\r\n                    <YAxis dataKey=\"vector\" unit=\"g\" name=\"acceleration\" />\r\n                    <ReferenceLine x={0.5} stroke=\"red\" strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" label=\"Crash\" />\r\n                    <ReferenceLine x={now} stroke=\"blue\" strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" label=\"Current\" />\r\n                </ScatterChart>\r\n            </ResponsiveContainer>\r\n``` @Arrow7000 \r\n\r\nThe chart will update every time the value of `ReferenceLine` change.\r\nI've no idea now... @Arrow7000 But even when recharts can receive a customized component, your problem can't be resolved.  Every time the props `now` update, the chart'll update.  @kadariyp Can you create an online demo ? @kadariyp You can reopen this issue if an online demo is created.  @loris \r\nBefore 0.20.6, when only one `Bar` has `stackId`, it'll be treated as not stacked bar.\r\nAfter 0.20.7, event if only one `Bar` has `stackId`, it'll be treated as a stacked bar to fix some bug. \r\nAnd stacked bars are stacked from  0, so make the difference.\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to remove `stackId` in your case.  @kasasi It's seems that `lineKey` has duplicated value.  @JunyuanZheng Can you create a demo to reproduce this problem ? @JunyuanZheng I can't reproduce your problem.\r\n\r\nHere is a [simple demo](http://jsfiddle.net/26fqkt0j/).\r\n\r\nCan you reproduce the problem in an online demo? Otherwise, I can't help you.  @bigearsenal Sorry. I'll fix this. @bigearsenal FIxed in 0.21.2  This feature has been released in 1.0.0-alpha.0.  @Eric24 I can't agree with your point. CartesianGrid is an auxiliary element in charts. It'll disturb the display of area or bars to put the CartesianGrid. Can you give an example of online chart which need to show CartesianGrid foreground? @Eric24 Props `isFront` is not a good idea. Maybe someday someone would want the CartesianGrid to be in the front of a `Line`, but to be in the back of an `Area`,\r\n\r\nBut I'm curious about the `100%` area chart. Is that just a background rectangle of chart ? @Eric24 OK! If so, I would close this issue temporarily.  @Eric24 You can specify the radius of label by an object `{ offsetRadius: 10 }`. About the `angle` props, I think the labels of `angle 0` is easier to read than `radial` labels.\r\nAnd for recharts, not all the features are  appropriate to implemented internally, so It's recommended to implement the radial label by customized labels. @Eric24 \r\nEh! It's recommended to use customized label for some special cases.\r\nAnd for the text alignment/baseline, I'll refactor `Pie` to calculate internally.\r\n\r\n   @Eric24 When you specify the `x` or `y` to be a function, what about the parameters received ? @Eric24 If so, I think It's almost same to specify the `x` or `y`  to be a calculated value or a calculating function. @Eric24 \r\n\r\nIn this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/dnstf91y/), we calculate the mean value of 'pv' outside.\r\nIf `y` can receive a function, the only difference is that you'll need to bind data outside, and this function will be called inside like the following:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction calculateMeanValue(list, key) {\r\n\tconst cnt = list.length;\r\n  \t\r\n  if (cnt <= 0) { return 0; }\r\n  \r\n  return list.reduce((sum, entry) => (sum + (entry[key] || 0) ), 0) / cnt;\r\n}\r\n\r\n<ReferenceLine y={calculateMeanValue.bind(null, data, 'pv')} label=\"Mean\" stroke=\"red\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think It's more flexible to calculate the value outside if  the calculation does not need any  dynamic parameter. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Mohendran In SSR, we can't get the width and height of parent node, so no chart is rendered.\r\n\r\n @Mohendran If the size of chart is fixed, you can remove `ResponsiveContainer `. @Mohendran \r\n\r\nI really can't get your point! \r\nBecause we need calculate all the related coordinates (in pixels) of points, rectangles, and so on, so we need the width and height ( in pixels) of chart. SSR only render chart into a html string, so we can't get the width and height of chart. So we can only render charts after the component is mount.\r\n\r\nI wonder why the charts must be rendered in the SSR ? \r\nIf so, you should give a initial width and height of the chart.( New feature)\r\n @Mohendran   When you specify the width or height of `ResponsiveContainer` to be a percentage, It only means that:\r\n\r\nthe width of chart = the width of parent node * the percentage\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nthe height of chart = the height of parent node * the percentage\r\n\r\n @Mohendran Sorry! We can't use percentages to calculate the coordinates of all the shapes.  @H3katonkheir You can render customized tooltip by specify the props `content` of `Tooltip` to be a customized react component element or a function.\r\n\r\n[Here](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomContentOfTooltip) is an example. @H3katonkheir The payload of Tooltip is calculated internally, not allowed to be set by develops.  Duplicated with #446  @GregPhyn  Not yet! @GregoryPotdevin So sorry! \ud83d\ude01  @windsome Any example ?  @davide-giardini Can you give an example why we need to set the `id` of `Pie` in SSR ? @davide-giardini  The PR hasn's been updated for a long time, you can reopen it if any updates is submitted.  @pherris  So many bars which have the width < 1px, so no bars are displayed.  This feature can be implemented by <LabelList /> in 1.0+.\r\n\r\n[Doc about LabelList](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/LabelList)\r\n\r\n[Demo of ScatterChart labels](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/ScatterChartWithLabels)  @hyunwoona \r\n\r\nYou can specify the `animationBegin` of `Bar` like the following:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<BarChart \r\n  width={600} \r\n  height={300} \r\n  data={data}\r\n  margin={{top: 20, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}\r\n>\r\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\"/>\r\n  <YAxis/>\r\n  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\r\n  <Tooltip/>\r\n  <Legend />\r\n  <Bar dataKey=\"pv\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#8884d8\" animationBegin={400} animationDuration={400} animationEasing=\"linear\" />\r\n  <Bar dataKey=\"uv\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#82ca9d\" animationBegin={0} animationDuration={400} animationEasing=\"linear\" />\r\n</BarChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\n[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/dhhqquke/)  Recharts has many issues about labels now:\r\n\r\n#160 Simpler custom labels\r\n#191 Label in center of PieChart\r\n#472  \"Total\" bar label for stacked bar chart\r\n#466  Rotated Axis labels\r\n\r\nand the labels of components diffs very much now. Meanwhile, some simple features like rotate, location,  can only be implemented by customized labels.\r\n\r\nSo I try to refactor labels and create two new components: `Label`, `LabelList` (create an array of labels), then we can create labels like the following:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n  <Line>\r\n    <LabelList position=\"bottom\" /> \r\n  </Line>\r\n\r\n  <XAxis>\r\n    <Label angle={45} position=\"right\">This is a label</Label>\r\n  </XAxis>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the props `label` of `Line\\Area|Bar...` will be removed.\r\nLet me know if you have some different thoughts.\r\n\r\n[Code of Label](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/feat/label/src/component/Label.js)\r\n[Code of LabelList](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/feat/label/src/component/LabelList.js) @Eric24 You can check out the branch `feat/label` to have  a test. This feature has been released in 1.0.0-alpha.0  @super-cache-money How about add a props `formatter` which can be called format the values ? @super-cache-money  It's a new feature. @super-cache-money Sorry! It's a new feature that ought to be added!  @Eric24 Thanks! It's not a bug, I forgot to update the example. @Eric24 Yeah! You can specify the `label` of `Line` to be a object:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst LABEL = { fill:\"#82ca9d\", stroke:false, fontSize:10, dy:-4 };\r\n\r\n...\r\n  <Line  label={LABEL} />\r\n...\r\n``` @Eric24 `Text` don't receive `dy` now. I'll fix it. Thanks!\r\n\r\nDo you have any thoughts about new components `Label` and `LabelList` ?\r\n\r\n[Discussion about Label and LabelList](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/522)  @Eric24 Both the `iconType` of `Legend` and `legendType` of `Area/Bar/Line` can specify corresponding `iconType` rendered by legend items.   @wkwiatek It's recommended to render labels inside the sectors.  @coreylenertz Thanks! It has been fixed.  @YangZhouChaoFan How about the version of recharts? Can you create a jsfiddle demo to reproduce your problem ? @YangZhouChaoFan OK! I'll send email to you.  @leggomymeggos I can't get what do you mean. `AreaChart` is only a normal react component. If `sd.shallowRender(<OurComponent />` return a fully rendered component, It should be the bug of `sd.shallowRender`, not the bug of `AreaChart`.  @gabrielfnogueira Recharts don't support this feature now.  @kennyx46 Please use the `label` props of `Bar` to render labels. [Here] is a demo.   @OlivierCo We have use `lodash-webpack-plugin` and `babel-plugin-lodash`. I think recharts only require the necessary files of `lodash`. You can check the `lib` of `recharts`.  @adearmas Yeah, customized components of some components, like label, shape, .etc, seems to be complex now. But it's a necessary part to implement complex charts, we'll try to simplify some simple styling. \r\n\r\nAbout your case, you can use an object to style the ticks:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<XAxis dataKey=\"name\" height={60} tick={{ angle: -35, textAnchor: 'end' }} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you can move the brush down by adjusting the `height` of `XAxis` which have default value 30.\r\n\r\n[api of XAxis](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/XAxis)\r\n[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/97oecp4k/2/)  @mvolkmann Please show more informations.  @sankalplakhina Thanks! I think we just need to use lodash.uniqueId to generate the unique id of `Pie`. @sankalplakhina How about add `uniqueId` in the utils of recharts ? I think the `id` is only a internal variable which should be unique in a single page, keep `clipPathId ` as prop is needless.  @sankalplakhina Thanks! I'll refactor this.  @ItsMrAkhil It seems that the imported `Bar` is `null`. Please check the `import` of `recharts`. @ItsMrAkhil Can you check the value of `Bar` ? Maybe you can use `console.log` to log the `Bar`. And how about the version of `recharts` ? @ItsMrAkhil Can you provide a simple github project to reproduce your problem ?  @ItsMrAkhil You can remove your private codes and create a very simple project.  I think this is not the problem of recharts. Please check the configuration of your project.  @oluckyman Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/6eawhfvr/)\r\n\r\nWhen you specify the `domain` and [`tickCount`](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/cartesian/YAxis.js#L75) of  `YAxis`, we can't calculate evenly distributed ticks, so no `end` tick here.\r\n\r\n@oluckyman You can check the [documentation of d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_ticks). @oluckyman You can change the `tickCount` of `YAxis`.  @alexanderwhatley You can create two `XAxis`.   @alexggordon I can't quite understand your demands now. Can you provide an example? @alexggordon \r\n\r\nIf you want to group the ticks, you can use customized tick of `XAxis` like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/o0ag2nz3/);\r\n\r\nAnd in your case, I think you can format the data and render the charts like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/zh3z3znq/).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"591\" alt=\"2017-02-28 2 28 20\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/23394108/33ed552c-fdc2-11e6-8670-9e88cb7ef8d2.png\">  @matheusml You can change the `stroke`  of `Brush` like [this example](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/BrushBarChart). Or you can change the style of `Brush` by css.  @sonofjack  Maybe you can use customized shape of `Bar`.  @jlarso11  Can you submit a jsfiddle demo ? @jlarso11 You can specify `ticks` of `XAxis` to set the ticks. Or you can change `interval` of `XAxis`.  Maybe when the props `fill` of `Pie` is an array, we can use the fill the slices in order. But how about other props, like `stroke`, `strokeWidth`, .etc ? \r\n\r\n @Eric24 Yeah, these components will pick up all the [presentation attributes](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/util/ReactUtils.js#L6). @Eric24 It seems a good idea!  @akonwi The `Line` was just too thin to be clicked. Please check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/wzpf21f1/).  @JoeRandom Don't support now.  Done in version 0.21.0  @gusdaud You can use `tick` of `XAxis` or `YAxis`  to render customized axis texts.   @Eric24 Yeah, you can use `ticks` to add customized ticks of an axis.   @liubko \r\n\r\nYou can set the background color by specify `fill` of `CartesianGrid`:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<CartesianGrid \r\n  strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" \r\n  fill=\"green\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/mbd91kf8/)\r\n  @FrantisekGazo Thanks! Recharts won't support 3D charts.  @ZephD Title of charts diff very much, so no plan to implement this feature now.  @chipit24 It's welcome to submit PR in [recharts.org](https://github.com/recharts/recharts.org)  @cemremengu You should format the data. Or you can create 7 ScatterChart to create such charts. @cemremengu Check [this demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/BubbleChart).  @squll1 Yeah, of course.    Try the component [<LabelList />](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/LabelList).  You can modify icon by pass payload to Legend. Like the code below,\r\n```\r\n<Legend\r\n  payload={\r\n    [\r\n      { id: 'pv', value: 'pppv', type: 'diamond', color: '#8884d8'},\r\n      { id: 'uv', value: 'uuuv', type: 'diamond', color: '#82ca9d'},\r\n    ]\r\n   }\r\n/>\r\n```\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/n8cysgrj/\r\n We offer some icons which you can use it by change `type` in payload.\r\n\r\n`['line', 'square', 'rect', 'circle', 'cross', 'diamond','star', 'triangle', 'wye']` If you want to highly customized, I guess the best way is still to write your own icon by passing content.  Can you provide any code or case? Usually, you can just set props to Recharts components as svg component. ex. `<Line strokeWidth={2} />` It should works fine in AreaChart.\r\nMaybe you can try to pass a prop `strokeWidth` to Area component like `<Area strokeWidth={10} />`.  If still not work, would you like to show me your code? I'll help you figure out it.\r\n  @vaeum Which bug ?  Aha, nothing special :-)\r\n\r\n 'amt' is abbr. of word 'amount'. You can definite any property name you like.  @Eric24 It's recommended to use `<Text />` to render label. ```jsx\r\n<XAxis dataKey=\"name\" angle={-45} textAnchor=\"end\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n@Eric24  Use the props angle and textAnchor in XAxis. The feature has been done in 1.0.0+.  recommend use npm and webpack to import or export charts.  @pioneer32 \r\n\r\nWhen the bars are stacked, the minimum value of domain is 0 by default. But log(0)  is invalidate, so the bars disappear.\r\n\r\nYou should set the `domain` of `YAxis` like the following:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<YAxis scale=\"log\" domain={[0.01, 'auto']} allowDataOverflow />\r\n```\r\n\r\n[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/kca9npkg/117/)  @patryk0605 I found the problem in 0.20.3, so I try to fix it in 0.20.4. I can't reproduce the problem now. The problem seems to be caused when the [width and height of tooltip change](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/v0.20.4/src/component/Tooltip.js#L111) alternately very small in some cases.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"971\" alt=\"2017-01-17 11 38 58\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/22027928/63fc0bf0-dd10-11e6-8bab-1900fa6544fb.png\">\r\n\r\nSo I [add a tolerance value](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/component/Tooltip.js#L113) to decide whether update the state of tooltip.\r\n\r\nPlease check again.\r\n@patryk0605 @loris  Fixed in recharts@0.20.5.  Thanks! It's my fault. I forgot to check the compiled files in `lib` of `react-smooth`. I have fixed it. Please check.  Fixed in version 0.1.19 of react-smooth.  @xuerion You can bind event on `Bar` instead of `BarChart`.  `onMouseLeave` bound to `BarChart` is trigged when mouse leave the box of BarChart.  Fixed in 0.20.3.  @AyushSharma91190 IE11 don't support the transform of svg elements. So no animation in IE11.  @cambwang You can use a [`ResponsiveContainer`](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/ResponsiveContainer) to wrapper the chart component.   @OracPrime Thanks! How about the eslint errors?  @chin-idean \r\n\r\nYou can use [`transform` of tick](http://jsfiddle.net/e6r4bxf5/) or [customized tick](http://jsfiddle.net/yhp9esbs/).  @GregPhyn When we have just one value, only one point can be displayed.  @GregoryPotdevin Not yet.  Fixed in version 0.22.0  @OracPrime Can you submit a PR ? We have no windows computer... Fixed in 0.20.3.  The events of AreaChart and LinChart are implemented in the [generateCategoricalChart](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L997). @GregPhyn I mean, If touch events can work in LineChart, then touch events must work in AreaChart too, because both `LineChart` and `AreaChart` are generated by a high order component. As you can see in the [code of generateCategoricalChart](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L997), we have bound `touchmove` event in the charts.  [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/j6n54k0r/)\r\n\r\n@patryk0605 You can specify the color of text by `label={{ fill: '#fff' }}`.  @kenchengch Can you submit a pr ? Duplicated with #290   @peterhadlaw Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? @loris @peterhadlaw Add props `allowDataOverflow` in `YAxis`, and update to version 0.20.3.\r\n\r\n[api](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/YAxis)\r\n[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/ze8c333g/21/)\r\n  @mmmdreg Thanks! Great suggestion!  @mmmdreg  How about this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/k971to6h/) ?   @OracPrime Which chart ?  @with0out You can use customized `tick` like this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/dpvqmgf2/).  @billcreative @ZephD Some bug happens in `Tooltip`, so that `sAnimationActive={false}` didn't work before. And I remove `<Animate>` in `Tooltip`, just [update style to animate the tooltip](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/component/Tooltip.js#L167). \r\n\r\n[demo](https://jsfiddle.net/un16cwkd/4/)  @raviteja83 You can update margin of chart and adjust the width of `YAxis`, height of `XAxis`.  I'll try to optimize problem 1.\r\nBut problem 2 seems very strange. what's the purple block?\r\n\r\nAnd If problem 2 only happens in development environment, you can try to remove hot-loader and check whether this problem can be reproduced. @radarhere Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? @radarhere Yeah! sorry... I think problem 1 has been fixed. About problem 2, let me know if you can reproduce it in an online demo.   @francescabassi I think it has been fixed in version 0.20.2.  @giuseppepaul  \r\n\r\nYou can use `interval={0}` to force all the ticks to be shown. By default, we'll calculate the width of tick and hide some ticks when no enough space. But the calculation may be inaccurate in some cases. We'll try to fix it.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<XAxis interval={0} />\r\n```  @atompie It works in this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/r8tr87zh/).  Maybe strokeWidth={2} is still too thin to be clicked ?   @raviteja83 I think it was covered by [parent component](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L925).\r\n\r\nHow about your use case ?  @guybensh By default, we use width and height to create viewbox ([related code](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/container/Surface.js)).  @geoffreyvd \r\nOf course.  But you should format the data first, and get the formatted data like the following :\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst formattedData = [\r\n  { \"data_time\": '2016-08-12 10:22:04', 'timestamp': +(new Date('2016-08-12 10:22:04')),  '1_value': 43,}\r\n  { \"data_time\": '2016-08-12 08:49:04', 'timestamp': +(new Date('2016-08-12 08:49:04')),  '2_value': 14,}\r\n  { \"data_time\": '2016-08-12 07:44:04', 'timestamp': +(new Date('2016-08-12 07:44:04')),  '2_value': 14,}\r\n];\r\n```\r\nAnd meanwhile you should get an array of channel_ids like `const channelIds = ['1', '2']`. Then you can create the chart:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<LineChart data={formattedData} layout=\"vertical\">\r\n  <XAxis type=\"number\"  />\r\n  <YAxis dataKey=\"timestamp\" type=\"number\" />\r\n  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\r\n  <Tooltip/>\r\n  <Legend />\r\n  {\r\n    channelIds.map((id) => {\r\n      return (<Line key={`line_${id}`} dataKey={`${id}_value`} />)\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n</LineChart>\r\n```\r\n @FJunior225 Yeah. Of course.  [API for LineChart](http://recharts.org/api#LineChart)\r\n[API for ResponsiveContainer](http://recharts.org/api#ResponsiveContainer)\r\n\r\nPlease check the api of `LineChart`, `LineChart` can't parse percentage `width`.\r\nIf you want to use a percentage `width`, please wrapper `LineChart` with `ResponsiveContainer`.\r\n\r\nI'll try to enhance the getting started guide. Meanwhile, PR is welcome. You can submit PR in [recharts/recharts.org](https://github.com/recharts/recharts.org). @geoffdavis92 Please check your configuration.

Thanks for your demo! I'll add it to recharts.org.  @konstantin24121 It's a good suggestion to add throttle delay.  Maybe you can submit a pr ?\r\n\r\nAnd I have a  thought now. The events to show and update tooltip change the state frequently which will also update other unchanged components, like `Legend`, `XAxis`, etc.  If the state about tooltip events could be managed in `eventCenter` of recharts not in `state`, only tooltip will update when mousemove event is triggered. <img width=\"850\" alt=\"2016-12-21 11 04 20\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/21376365/4cccda56-c76f-11e6-8da9-1b83326ec53a.png\">\r\n<img width=\"889\" alt=\"2016-12-21 11 04 09\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/21376366/4ee1d8e6-c76f-11e6-8394-f07c05714914.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1432\" alt=\"2016-12-21 11 03 41\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/21376371/5b9330b2-c76f-11e6-9dfd-9ff703e1cd32.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI try to add `throttleDelay`, but I can't get `event.pageX` every time even I have used `event. persist()`.\r\n\r\n[Related issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7778)   @matthewberkompas It's a workaround to set the `domain` of `YAxis` like the following:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n  <YAxis domain={[0, 'dataMax + 600']} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also check the api of [`domain`](http://recharts.org/api#YAxis) and [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/3gdz149g/).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I'll try to optimize this case. Thoughts and suggestions are welcome.\r\n  @ZephD Yeah, the brush will be updated to default props when chart receives a new props. Can you create a demo about your case ?  @squll1  \r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n  <Pie stroke=\"none\" fill=\"red\" />\r\n   \r\n   <Pie stroke=\"none\" fill=\"red\">\r\n      <Cell fill=\"red\" />\r\n      <Cell fill=\"green\" />\r\n      <Cell fill=\"blue\" /> \r\n   </Pie>\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust like svg elements. You can change the color of `Pie` by changing the `fill` of `Pie` or `Cell`.\r\n\r\n[demo](http://recharts.org/examples#PieChartWithCustomizedLabel)  @McMenemy  Thanks!\r\n\r\nI have two kinds of thoughts about ErrorBar and candlestick chart now.\r\n\r\n1. Add a new component `ErrorBar`, and it should be the child of `Line`, `Area`, `Scatter`, `Bar`, etc.So we can add error bars like the following:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n  <Line dataKey=\"pv\">\r\n    <ErrorBar dataKey=\"pvError\"  />\r\n  </Line>\r\n\r\n  <Scatter data={[...]}>\r\n    <ErrorBar dataKey=\"pvError\"  />\r\n  </Scatter>\r\n```\r\n2.The new component `ErrorBar` should be the child of `LineChart`, `AreaChart`, etc. Something link the error bar of [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/error-bar). So we just need add ErrorBar like the following:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n  <LineChart >\r\n    <Line dataKey=\"a\" />\r\n    <ErrorBar dataKey=\"aError\" />\r\n  </LineChart>\r\n\r\n  <ScatterChart>\r\n    <ErrorBar dataKey=\"pvError\"  />\r\n  </ScatterChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I also want to know whether the value of an error bar will  be an interval like the demo of highcharts?\r\n  @RoarkeRandall Thanks! It should be fixed.  @matheusml By default, we'll hide some ticks of `XAxis` when no enough space. \r\n\r\n[related code](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/cartesian/CartesianAxis.js#L74)\r\n\r\nIf you want to show all the ticks, you can set the props `interval` of `XAxis` to be `0`.  @batjko You can change the value of  `XAxis`'s props `height` which have default value 30.  @southnan0 How about the version of recharts ? And do you use `babel-plugin-recharts` ? @southnan0 I think the version of `babel-plugin-recharts` is out of date.  You should update the version of `babel-plugin-recharts` to `1.1.0`. @vaeum Recharts have imported polyfills too.  [polyfill](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/index.js#L1)  @southnan0  No. Because recharts works well in IE10, IE11, and we have imported necessary polyfills. @southnan0 OK! You can use `babel-plugin-recharts` too.  @matthewberkompas You can return null when the width of bar is smaller than a specified number. @matthewberkompas Yeah! Just like your demo.  @ZephD It's recommended to add a `ReferenceLine` like this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/b1Lb3kuk/). @ZephD It works well in my broswer.\r\n\r\n![refline](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/21211210/9ac465ec-c2bc-11e6-91f5-5e39f1d44a42.gif)\r\n @ZephD Every time you update the wrapper component of `LineChart`, the children instances of `LineChart` will change. Maybe this's the reason for your case. But in your first description, you mean to click another `table` to interact width `LineChart`, so I don't know why the `tooltip` will hide and show. \r\n\r\nMaybe you can create another jsfiddle demo to show your problem. I'm not sure I have got your problem correctly.\r\n  @ZephD Why set `curSelected` to be `null` ?\r\n\r\nIt seems `setState` in `onMouseOver` trigger  update of component, so  `componentWillReceiveProps` is  called to update state to be default state. Then no tooltip will display. @ZephD Every time we update the state, the reference of children changes. So I'll refactor the comparison of children in [generateCategoricalChart.js#L93](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L93). This's also the reason of #401 . \r\n\r\nIt's recommended to not bind `onMouseMove` in `LineChart` to update `ReferenceLine`, this action is conflict with tooltip. @ZephD I understand your demands now. You can wait for updating of recharts, I have done some optimization.  And a workaround is to add two state, one state to show `ReferenceLine` when hover the map and another state to show `marker` when hover the chart. @ZephD Can you check the latest version ?\r\n @ZephD Check the latest [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/b1Lb3kuk/12/). I just use a variable `margin` and `activeDot` to keep the static value of margin and activeDot. you know, every time you change the state, a new margin and a activeDot will be parsed to `LineChart`, then the `shallowEqual` of two children will return `false`.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can check this [article](https://medium.com/@esamatti/react-js-pure-render-performance-anti-pattern-fb88c101332f#.p7fc9cflz) for detail.  @briice It seems strange to add `className` in  `data`.  @vaeum You can bind `onMouseEnter` to `Bar` like this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/5dtmswmc/). @vaeum If you have two or more `Bar`, It's recommended to use customized `Tooltip`. If You just have one `Bar`, customized `label` can meet your needs.  @VanDavv How about the version of recharts ? Live example or a simple project is required to reproduce your problem.  @ilanus Can you create a simple online example ? It seems you have added two `Bar`, so two groups of labels are rendered.  I'll reopen it if demo is submited.  @matthewberkompas  Now you can center the labels of `Bar` like this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/wa87o60f/3/).\r\nBut the callback parameters of `label` seems strange now,  the `width` and `height` are width and height of `rectangle` in `Bar`, the `x` and `y` is the coordinate of `label` .  @McMenemy Thanks! I'll close this pr temporarily.  @tarrencev Thanks! We'll think about this feature. I think it's easy to allow the `dataKey` to receive nested key like `'a.b.c'` now. @tarrencev Nested keys means that we can get data in such case:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  [{ today: { a: 1, b: 2 }, yesterday: { c: 1, d: 2 }, }]\r\n```\r\n\r\nby dataKey `'today.a'` or `'yeterday.d'`.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll refactor recharts to allow the `dataKey` be a simple string, a nested string  or a map function.\r\n\r\n @tarrencev I think the developers should make sure that the `dataKey` can be used to map the correct values. We just provide three options to make it's more flexible to specify the values.  Do you agree?  @bali182 Yeah, I know it's not semantical to call a function as `dataKey`. But I want to use unified props for such case( add data in `LineChart` and specify a attribute in `Line`). Something just like [d3-shape stack](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#stack_keys),  we can specify strings as keys or accessor functions as keys too.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I want to support series-like data too which will bring another props too... \r\n  @jlubeck This kind of pie animation can be done by customized `shape` of `Pie`. Here is a [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/fvcc6m14/).   @ashutoshjha1409   Do you mean different event for each `Rectangle` in the `Bar` ? @ashutoshjha1409 When you bind click event on `Bar`, you can get the payload of each `Rectangle` when you click it. It means that the event of `Bar` is  actually binded in each `Rectangle` of `Bar`. \r\n\r\nPlease check [this demo](http://recharts.org/examples#BarChartWithCustomizedEvent). Ok!  @vyachekg Thanks! I'll fix it.  @patryk0605 Events  are not supported in `XAxis` and `YAxis`. It'll be done in next version.  @bmamouri Are you using recharts in server-side-render ? @bmamouri How about the version of recharts ? @bmamouri  It seems `isSSR` return `false` in SSR.  @matthewberkompas For simple style change, you can use css. But for transform, you can use customized events like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/fwh9Lmg3/).  @matthewberkompas  You only need to add some css like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.recharts-bar .recharts-bar-rectangle .recharts-rectangle:hover {\r\n  fill: red;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/fwh9Lmg3/16/) @matthewberkompas In such case, you should use customized events, It can't be done only by css.\r\nIn your demo, you only need to add `fill` in `Rectangle`.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Rectangle {...others} x={x - 2} width={width + 4} y={y - sign * 2} height={height + sign * 2} fill=\"red\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n[demo](http://jsfiddle.net/wa87o60f/2/)  @Eric24 Yeah, we're refactoring animation.   @peterwillis Thanks! We'll add more information in README.  OK  Yeah, some bug happens when calculate the height of `Legend`.  @gartz `isSsr` is called at many places. It's strange to initialize this function. Any suggestion for safe `isSsr` ?  How about\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const isSsr = () => !(window && window.document && window.document.getElementById);\r\n```  @nilyang Recharts don't support box-plot now.  @Eric24 Can you give a detail example about how to control the content in payload?  Whatever, It's hard for *recharts* to meets all the needs, so customized `content` is needed. @Eric24 Maybe we can export `DefaultTooltipContent` and `DefaultLegendContent`, then you can do the filter yourself, and use `DefaultTooltipContent` and `DefaultLegendContent` to render tooltip and legend. @Eric24 Any suggestion for the props name ?  @Eric24 \r\n\r\nYou can specify the `scale` of `XAxis` to be `point`( the default scale is `band` )  which'll use scalePoint of [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale).  \r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<ComposedChart \r\n  width={600} \r\n  height={400} \r\n  data={data}\r\n  margin={{top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20}}\r\n>\r\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" scale=\"point\" />\r\n  <YAxis />\r\n  <Tooltip/>\r\n  <Legend/>\r\n  <CartesianGrid stroke='#f5f5f5'/>\r\n  <Area type='monotone' dataKey='amt' fill='#8884d8' stroke='#8884d8'/>\r\n   <Line type='monotone' dataKey='uv' stroke='#ff7300'/>\r\n</ComposedChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the margin will be eliminated. @Eric24 \r\n\r\nAbout question a:\r\n  When the `XAxis` of `ComposedChart` is numerical axis, the scale of `XAxis` is linear scale, no extra space for *bars* will produce. \r\n\r\nAbout question b:\r\n What kind of `bars` are not rendered? I create a [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/z3wx6zm3/), it works fine even when I have `Bar` in the composed chart.\r\n\r\nSo would you please create an online demo?   @supersteves We need more performance data. `className` is absolutely no problem for normal data. For huge size data, we'll do more optimization to omit some nodes,  not just remove `className`.  @krispyp You can add `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`, `onMouseMove`, `onClick` in `LineChart` (or `BarChart`, `AreaChart`, `ComposedChart`), and you'll get `chartX`, `chartY` in callback.  @akvanhar I think this has been fixed in version 0.20.0. Please check it!  @earthinferno Yeah, of course. But no good solution now. Yeah! It should be removed.  @AshworthHub The  `payload` in some charts diffs, so I unify the `payload` to be the original `data` or `entry`. Can you support your case more detail ?  Yeah, the `activePayload` is the `entry` that your mouse in. So I can't get what's the problem ?  @MythlinMasterdo Can you create a simple demo in jsfiddle?  @huozhi In  CSR, we'll calculate the width / height of ticks, and adjust the position of tick If no enough space to display the whole tick. But this calculation can't be done in SSR. @huozhi Temporarily no better way, unless all the components can be implemented by svg elements. Now `Tooltip` and  `Legend` are implemented by html. We'll discuss this question. Thanks.  @truenorthcreative You can fork recharts in github, add create a PR. PR is welcome.  @jlubeck You can specify `formatter` for each `Line`, and the formatter will be used to format value in `Tooltip` like this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/s0kne60e/).  @komplexb Thanks for great advice. It's a workaround to add a `ZAxis` to parse additional information. And I intend to add more information in [payload of Tooltip](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/ScatterChart.js#L231). @komplexb You can get more `props` in `CustomTooltip` without `ZAxis`. Maybe you can console `props` to see detail.  @supersteves  \r\nI arrange your issues:\r\n\r\n## A rectangle is rendered for each value of a stacked bar\r\n\r\n Each stacked bar may have different attributes, so we need a node for each value.  I wonder how to colour the rectangle when only draw a single rectangle for all the stacked value ?\r\n\r\n##  Render `<Animate>` for empty value\r\n\r\nIt'll be fixed.\r\n\r\n##  Duplicated `Animate` in  `Rectangle`\r\n\r\nIt's a customized animation of Rectangle, the two `Animation` have different animation attribute.\r\nCheck the [code](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/shape/Rectangle.js#L130) for detail.\r\n\r\n##  Render `<Animate>` even when `isAnimationActive` is `false`\r\n\r\nWhen `isAnimationActive` is false, `Animate` just return the children ([related code](https://github.com/recharts/react-smooth/blob/master/src/Animate.js#L305)). \r\nThough I think the performance is ok,  It'll be fixed in the next version. @supersteves Do you mean that the calculation (done by [`getStackGroupsByAxisId`](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/util/CartesianUtils.js#L98)) is inefficient when each `Bar` has unique `stackId`?\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to remove `stackId` in such case, because no bars need to be stacked.\r\n\r\nAnd the stack will effect the domain of `YAxis`, so *stack* must done before *bars*.  @supersteves \r\nThanks.  It seems strange in your demo, I'll think about your case.\r\n\r\nAnd I'll try to remove some needless nodes (like g), still more optimization need to done for large amount of data.  @amnsss Tooltip does have a props `itemSorter` to support sorting payload. But It was missed in document, \ud83d\ude2d. I'll update the document. Thanks!\n @amnsss  Done!\n  @mwolson Thanks! It'll be fixed in the next version.\n  @clementdevos  You can set the `domain` of `YAxis` to be `[0, 3800]`.  \n[document of YAxis](http://recharts.org/api#YAxis)\n @clementdevos Maybe there is some bug about `undefined`, I'll check it.\n  Duplicated with #267 .\n  @godmar Thanks! We're trying to refactor animation.\n The feature has been done in 1.0.0+  @Moeface You should use svg React components, and svg elements can support link too. \n\n[svg link](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/linking.html)\n\nAnd dataKey should be a string or a number. I don't know why you want to pass an object to the `dataKey`.\nI create a simple [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/vLspjuo2/) of svg linking. You can check whether your demand can be filled.\n @Moeface As you know,html elements can't be rendered in the svg elements, so we can't support non-SVG component.  \n @Moeface In your case, you can pass `href` of button and `url` of image in the `data`, and add a customized `tick` of `XAxis` which can get the original data to display what you need.  @PeteAshworth The label of `RadialBar` was missed.\n @AshworthHub Thanks!  `Text` only show when `x` and `y` are number in 19.0. I should fix it.  @FabioFleitas When the data is empty, we have no information to show in the chart. When the data is not empty, we can show a empty chart like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/qh81naqm/).\n @FabioFleitas Only when you specify the `dataKey` of `YAxis` like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/qh81naqm/1/).\nOtherwise `YAxis` doesn't know what to show, or just some fixed numbers.\n  @RoarkeRandall `Line`, `Area`, `Bar`, `Scatter` , etc, have a props `name`, If you have specified props `name`, the `name` will be used to display in `Legend` and `Tooltip`.\n\n[Document of Area](http://recharts.org/api#Area)\n[Document of Line](http://recharts.org/api#Line)\n\n...\n  @elnygren \n\nI try to create a jsfiddle [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/32ekyL48/) similar to your demo. And switch different datas quickly, it never crash in chrome. Can you try ?\n Yeah, jsfiddle is the simplest environment. I use it to confirm whether the crash  happens online.\n\nAnd I found it's really strange. I clone your project and run it, chrome crash every time when I click _Daily_. But after I restart my mac, the crash never happen. \n @elnygren It's hard to find the real reason. \n @elnygren I find that my chrome was updated to the version 54.0.2840.98 (64-bit) after restart my mac. Maybe some bug of old chrome cause the crash.\n  @sdoomz It needs to be discussed whether to update state when data is updated.  @matthewberkompas You do it right.\n  @git-toni Check the jsfiddle [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/x1yoboc7/48/) for detail. You should reference \n some others js files.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/20218065/c3815a2c-a85d-11e6-98af-0ab4532d402f.png)\n  @ottos13 How about your version of recharts ?\n @ottos13 version 0.17.1  has fixed this problem.\n  thank you for @nwhitmont . It's true that the website will down 48h.\nyou could pull down the code from recharts/recharts.org, and `npm install`, the `npm run start`. That will start the local host.\n Fixed.\n  @vaeum \n\nYou can check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/tbs7f59s/) for detail.\n  @FabioFleitas Such empty message could be very different.

I don't know how to reproduce this problem now.\n I think this issue has been fixed. Please check the latest version.  @patryk0605  Legend support onClick, onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave in version 0.18.0 now.\n  Fixed in version 0.17.1.\n  @patryk0605 Thanks! It'll be fixed soon.\n Fixed in version 0.17.1.\n @nick-barth Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? I can't reproduce this warning.\n  @Mannaio The coordinate of dots are calculated in [LineChart](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/LineChart.js#L35).

But some middle ticks may be hidden. Do you have any suggestion about this behavior ?\n  @alelepd  \nMaybe we can add a new chart to display a single percentage. \n  I'm sorry.\nI already publish 0.15.3. Our work is very busy recently.\n  @sighrobot  Brush can only work with `LineChart`, `AreaChart`, `BarChart` and `ComposedChart`.

It'll be a feature in the next version.\n  @raspo It's strange to add `onClick` event in `Tooltip`, but  bind event handler in Chart.\n @raspo How about add a props `triggerEvent` in `Tooltip` ?\n @raspo I mean add a props `triggerEventType` which can be 'hover', 'click', and the default value is 'hover'.\n  @abpai  The `onChange` of Brush is overwrote by internal event handler in [generateCategoricalChart](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L726). Maybe we should refactor  generateCategoricalChart to not simply overwrite.\n  @sdoomz \n\nFor your questions:\n1. Tooltip is triggered by mouse event now, may be you can use other method to display the new data, for example an `position: absolute;` div or a customized label of `Area`.\n2. Temporarily no idea.\n\n3.D3 use path animation to switch path, I have no idea how to add path transition animation when path update now.\n @sdoomz Thanks for great suggestions! We'll try to implement this functionality, maybe through a wrapper component.   \n @akvanhar Yeah, We're trying to refactor the animation part. But it may take some time.\n OK! Both PR and suggestions are welcome. @akvanhar  \n  @digorydoo Recharts has added component `ReferenceArea` in version 0.13.4. But the documentation  is backward. I'll update the documentation of  `ReferenceArea`.\n\nYou can use `ReferenceArea` like the following:\n\n``` jsx\n<ScatterChart width={400} height={400} margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 0, left: 20 }}>\n   ....         \n   <ReferenceArea x1={250} x2={300} alwaysShow />\n </ScatterChart>\n```\n\n``` jsx\n<ScatterChart width={400} height={400} margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 0, left: 20 }}>\n   ....         \n   <ReferenceArea y1={250} y2={300} alwaysShow />\n </ScatterChart>\n```\n\n``` jsx\n<ScatterChart width={400} height={400} margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 0, left: 20 }}>\n   ....         \n   <ReferenceArea x1={0} x2={100} y1={250} y2={300} alwaysShow />\n </ScatterChart>\n```\n [Here](http://recharts.org/api#ReferenceArea) is the api of `ReferenceArea`.\n  Thanks to @billneff79. This has been fixed in version 0.16.0.\n  @tomsue This is duplicated with [#249](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/249). \n  @billneff79 Thanks for your contribution. It's really awesome. I'll review all the commits an soon as possible. \n @billneff79 Thank you for your contribution. It's really awesome.\ud83d\udc4d  We'll consider about your commits in your master.\n  I think we should support different scale functions of axis, like timeScale, logScale, etc, just similarly to [issue#305](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/305).\n\nSo I'll close this issue temporarily. \n  When the `label` is a react element, we have no idea to check whether the element is a svg node or a dom node. Do you have any idea? \n  @10n6 You can set the domain of `YAxis`  to be `['dataMin', 'dataMax']` which have default value `[0,`auto`]`.\n\n[Here](http://recharts.org/api#YAxis) is the document of YAxis.\n  @McMenemy What kind of error bars ? How about [ReferenceLine](http://recharts.org/api#ReferenceLine) ?\n @Eric24 Yeah, error bars and Candlestick chart are very similar. I have two kinds of thoughts about ErrorBar and candlestick chart now.\r\n\r\nAdd a new component ErrorBar, and it should be the child of Line, Area, Scatter, Bar, etc.So we can add error bars like the following:\r\n```jsx\r\n  <Line dataKey=\"pv\">\r\n    <ErrorBar dataKey=\"pvError\"  />\r\n  </Line>\r\n\r\n  <Scatter data={[...]}>\r\n    <ErrorBar dataKey=\"pvError\"  />\r\n  </Scatter>\r\n```\r\n2.The new component ErrorBar should be the child of LineChart, AreaChart, etc. Something link the error bar of highcharts. So we just need add ErrorBar like the following:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n  <LineChart >\r\n    <Line dataKey=\"a\" />\r\n    <ErrorBar dataKey=\"aError\" />\r\n  </LineChart>\r\n\r\n  <ScatterChart>\r\n    <ErrorBar dataKey=\"pvError\"  />\r\n  </ScatterChart>\r\n```\r\nAnd I also want to know whether the value of an error bar will be an interval like the demo of highcharts?\r\n\r\n\r\n@McMenemy @Eric24 @jzillmann Any thoughts?  @patryk0605 `unit` is only used to render `Tooltip` now.\n `label` of `XAxis` just display the content you passed to. \n @patryk0605 Can you create a jsfiddle demo ? \n @patryk0605  Maybe you can change the position of label to insure the label to be showed.\n  @RobiFerentz How about the version of chrome ?\n Ok! \n @rogeliog I can't reproduce the crash in both local examples and online examples. My chrome is 54.0.2840.71 (64-bit) (OSX). Do you have any idea to reproduce the crash ? \n @elnygren I want to confirm if the crash only happens in your local development mode ? I create a [jsfiddle demo](http://jsfiddle.net/jnz2pvze/)  which render a large number of points. But it never crash.\n @elnygren My chrome crashed sometimes in my local development mode yesterday. So I deleted `--hot` of webpack, chrome never crashed then.  I doubt the crash may cause by the hot updating of webpack.\n @konstantin24121 @magalhini I found several [memery leak](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/1724) issues of webpack. For the crash problem, we can remove hot component of webpack temporarily, and wait for webpack developers to fix it.\n @konstantin24121 Yeah, looking forward to stable webpack 2.x.\n  @jozsi It's a good idea to dynamically set the maxListeners. And I wonder how many synchronized charts you created in a page ?\n @jozsi So, many charts in a single page?\n \ud83d\ude00 OK! I'll fix this. And only add listener when the chart has props `syncId` which means to be synchronized with some other charts.\n  @morajabi Can you support a jsfiddle demo ?\n @morajabi The demo you created seems no problem.\n  @email2vimalraj You can check this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/ez3x3z4k/). It just show the actual y axis value by default. What's the problem?\n  @weita0  Can you describe detail what kind of event do you want to bind to LineChart? \n @Hectorhammett Could you submit a PR? Then I can check the changes of your code much clearer.  \n  @cephirothdy2j As mentioned in [#223](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/223). In your case, do you want to cut the lines inner the coordinate system?\n  Done in version 0.15.0\n  @tobia  If just so, the height of chart may exceed the boundary of container node.\n @nickpalmer Any thoughts?\n Yeah, In most case, we just want the height to fit the width.\n  @kujon \n\n<img width=\"459\" alt=\"2016-09-23 8 09 09\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/18785279/f2ae7c86-81c9-11e6-8af4-b7ddc24089e9.png\">\n\nSome bug happens for active dot of LineChart.\n @kujon Thanks for your advice. \nIn the beginning, we want users to pass data in `LineChart` not `Line`, because we often get a table like data from server side. we would use one column to display `XAxis`, some other column to display a line or a bar.  \nBut in your case, LineChart seems very hard to use. So I check HightChart for some ideas. I found HightChart support two kind of  data([series data](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/line-basic),  [table data](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/line-ajax)). Maybe recharts should support two kind of data too, but the implementation is to be determined.\n And on this issue, It seems to be gimmicky. May be we can support both XAxis and YAxis to be numerical axis in LineChart, BarChart, and AreaChart.\n  @tobia The `onClick` event of `Pie` works. But It will be overwrote by `onClick` of `PieChart`. So It seems strange now. \n  @10n6 It's a bug of react-container-dimensions. I have create an [issue](https://github.com/okonet/react-container-dimensions/issues/7) in react-container-dimensions.\n We use `react-resize-detector` to refactor ResponsiveContainer. I think this has been fixed.\n  @squll1 Can you support a  jsfiddle example ?\n @squll1 It turn out  to be the grammar of ES6.\n\nIn your example, you return a object by `{}`.\n\n``` jsx\nbarData.map((entry, index) => {\n    <Cell cursor=\"pointer\" fill=\"#5672ca\" stroke=\"#ff0000\" strokeWidth={4} key={`cell-${index}`}/>\n})\n```\n\nIt can be fixed by replace `{}` by `()`;\n\n``` jsx\nbarData.map((entry, index) => (\n    <Cell cursor=\"pointer\" fill=\"#5672ca\" stroke=\"#ff0000\" strokeWidth={4} key={`cell-${index}`} label/>\n))\n```\n OK!\n  @HashDot How about the data you received from server? And can you support your code about Recharts ?\n @HashDot \n\nI copy your code and create a [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/10gthLf1/), it works.\nMaybe you can check the following points:\n1. The data received by LineChart is empty ?\n2. The entry of data has attributes \"max\" and \"usage\" ?\n3. What are the values of `text`, `green`, `red` ?\n @HashDot Sorry! I have no idea. I have used Recharts to render live data, It works. \nDo you get some logs in console ?\nOr can you create a repo with your problem easily reproducible?\n @HashDot OK! it'll be helpful.\n  @neagle Do you mean to remove the 'line' of bar?\n  @UnsungHero97 [Here](http://jsfiddle.net/quaph8w8/) is a demo of PercentBarChart. When you set the props `stackOffset=\"expand\"`, `YAxis` will receive a percentage value.\n  @techniq Sorry! Too busy these days! I should take more time to review your code!\n\nYou can check [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html) for all the styling properties of svg elements.  svg elements don't support `verticalAnchor` and `lineHeight`. \n @techniq It should be implemented by calculating `x` and `y` attributes of `text`.\n\nAnd I think `Text` should not replace all the `text` in recharts now, because the computation of text width and height would cost much.\n @techniq  \nSorry. I just have a quick look at your code. I need more time to review every lines of your code.\nI feel very tangled about the CSS2 styling  props of Texts, `verticalAnchor`, `lineHeight`. All the props of recharts' components are svg styling props, and the CSS2 styling props can only be added  by the props `style`. I worry that other developers of recharts will be confused.\n\nSo I prefer `Text` is a optional component to render labels, not a internal used component.\nHow about your opinion ?\n @techniq Thanks! \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/18668718/97863bb2-7f69-11e6-95f9-9cf7617d3516.png)\n\nThe test \n\n``` jsx\n  it('Wraps long text if styled and not enough room', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(\n      <Text width={200} style={{ fontSize: '32px' }}>This is really long text</Text>\n    );\n\n    expect(wrapper.instance().state.wordsByLines.length).to.equal(2);\n  });\n```\n\nresult in 3 lines when the font-family is set to be \"Courier\". May be you can set the fontFamily of `Text` in the test case to be a very widely used one.\n @techniq Thanks! I'll try to finish today!\n  @digorydoo The default margin of ScatterChart is 5.\n\n[ScatterChart.js#L56](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/ScatterChart.js#L56)\n\n``` js\n  static defaultProps = {\n    style: {},\n    margin: { top: 5, right: 5, bottom: 5, left: 5 },\n  };\n```\n\nAny suggestion?\n  @Moeface Can you support a jsfiddle demo ?\n The image doesn't display because the we calculate the width of each tick to decide whether the tick will displayed.  Because the width of the first companyUrl is too large, so this tick is hidden. So you can set the props `interval` to be 0 to force all the ticks showed.\n\n``` jsx\n <XAxis dataKey=\"companyUrl\" interval={0} tick={<CustomXAxisLabel/>} />\n```\n  Duplicated with [#198](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/198).\n  @kaiser-naren \nRecharts doesn't have any plan to support heatmap, maybe you can find some other libraries like [heatmap.js](https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/).\n  @digorydoo \n\n You can set the props `isAnimationActive` of  [Area](http://recharts.org/api#Area), [Bar](http://recharts.org/api#Bar), [Line](http://recharts.org/api#Line), [Scatter](http://recharts.org/api#Scatter), [Pie](http://recharts.org/api#Pie), [Radar](http://recharts.org/api#Radar), [RadialBar](http://recharts.org/api#RadialBar) to be `false`.\n @digorydoo In some case, there are two lines in a LineChart, maybe we want one of the lines can animate, and disable the animation of another line. So we think the animation is related the the graphical element. \n  @susanafcosta Can you give an example ?\n @susanafcosta Because we set some default  values of`fill` and `stroke` in `Scatter`, `Symbol` and some other components, so the style you set in css can't be applied to the dots. It's recommended to set such props, like `fill`, `stroke` and so on, in attributes just like svg element.\n\n``` jsx\n<Scatter stroke=\"rgb(0, 157, 249)\" strokeWidth={1} fillOpacity={0.25} fill=\"rgb(0, 157, 249)\" />\n```\n\nMeanwhile I should remove some needless default props to make overwriting style much easier.\nSee #210 for more discussion.\n @Rainethief `tickSize` and `tick` work fine. Do you have any demos ?\n  @SachaG You can set the `barSize` of `Bar` to be a fixed value.\n Yeah. ResponsiveContainer can't do this now, because ResponsiveContainer don't know anything about the data. Do you have any idea about how to adapt to the length of data ? A workaround is to update the value of height by the length of data in your code.\n  Yeah, the default width of `YAxis` is 60, you can change this value. \n  @harshjv Can your problem fixed by setting a aspect (mentioned in [#135](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/135)) or minHeight, minWidth of container?\n OK! \n  @squll1 Sorry! `gridCount` is deprecated. I'll update the documentation.\n  @amay \ud83d\ude2d I can't reproduce this bug.\n OK! Thank you!\n @amay Thank you! Maybe we should remove span cache.\n  @cephirothdy2j Maybe we can add a props like `domainAccommodate` to decide whether to tweak the domain or not. Do you have some suggestion about the name of this props?\n @cephirothdy2j I want to know which kind of display do you want when some points is beyond the min or the max value of domain.\n1. May display part of the outside point\n   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/18427561/9694d7f0-78fb-11e6-9f02-1d37f201e3d8.png)\n2. cut the outside point directly\n   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/18427752/a786cdd8-78fc-11e6-99a6-934100a672d0.png)\n Fixed in version 0.14.1.\n  @jochenberger In such case, you can add some click or hover event on the Pie, and display the content in customized divs or svgs.\n[Here](http://recharts.org/examples/#BarChartWithCustomizedEvent) is an example of BarChart. \n @jochenberger Yeah, Thank you!\n  @avenger-teamave Can you give an online example ?\n Fixed in version 0.17.1.\n  @jochenberger You should format the value yourself, because the format of percent can be very different.\n @jochenberger I thought the percentage `50%` equals to the decimal `0.5`, and decimal is much simpler to format. So I return the decimal.\n  @oande Only when the areas have the same stackId and yAxisId, these areas can be stacked.  Because different yAxisIds  indicate that these areas have different dimensions, there is no any sense to the sum the values of these areas.\n @oande Sorry! It's a bug of stacked chart. \n  @supersteves  You can create 2 tier ticks by customized `tick`  in `XAxis`.\n\n[Here](http://recharts.org/examples/#CustomizedLabelLineChart) is a demo of customized tick.\n  @reggie3 Can you give an jsfiddle example? You can check [#135](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/135) for some discussion of ResponsiveContainer.\n  @SachaG Temporarily no simpler solution.\n  @SachaG  You can set the style of Legend by overwriting the default style. \n @SachaG We use inline style to style the legend, and the style is most general supported. I don't know the problem of inline style we used now. Can you give a more clear example ?\n CSS-Modules will bring a lot of webpack configurations, It seems messy.   @SachaG I think this's reasonable. The bars are stacked from the first group to the second group\n ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/18409771/a871228c-7782-11e6-80d2-01c53975e7cb.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/18409775/b2002dca-7782-11e6-962f-ecadb05ee30e.png)\n\nFor vertical chart, the bars stacked from the left (the orientation of YAxis) to right.\nFor horizontal chart, the bars stacked form the bottom (the orientation of XAxis)  to top.\n @SachaG The order of Legend is consistent with the order of stacked bars. So I'm considering whether to adjust the order of stacked bars.\n Fixed in version 0.17.1.\n  @SachaG  I don't what's the problem?\n @SachaG Got it! Thank you!\n  @derrickpelletier We use dom nodes to render legend because the layout of dom nodes is much simpler than svg nodes. For svg nodes, we must calculate the width of each text.\nI will try to support Legend by svg nodes.\n  @sebastianekstrom Yeah, Recharts don't support touch events now.\n @thoqbk Do you want to submit a PR ?  @madshargreave \n\n You can add an online jsfiddle example, then maybe I can find the problem.\n\nThe first question, you have two methods:\n1.Find the css sectors of the tick you want to hide, and set the style of tick by css like the following:\n\n``` css\n.recharts-wrapper .recharts-y-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-ticks .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick:first-child {\n  display: none;\n}\n```\n\n2.You can hide the tick by customized function or react element.\n\nThe Second question, you have three methods:\n1.Set the style of ticks like the following:\n\n``` css\n.recharts-wrapper .recharts-y-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-ticks .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick {\n  dy: -10;\n}\n```\n\n2.Set the props `tick` of `YAxis` to be an object like this: `{dx: -10}`.\n\n3.Also by customized function or react element.\n @madshargreave  OK!\n  @Nilegfx \n\nYou can set the style cursor by customized object like this:\n\n``` jsx\n<Tooltip cursor={{fill: 'red', fillOpacity: 0.05}} />\n```\n\n[Here](http://jsfiddle.net/Lpmwoj9o/) is an example.\n\nAnd [here](http://recharts.org/api#Tooltip) is the document.  But we think the cursor works together with `Tooltip`, so the configuration of `cursor` is a props of `Tooltip`.\n @Nilegfx I would close this issue and pr temporarily.\n  @techniq It's a good idea. Do you have any interest to implement this component and submit a PR ? We are very busy now, \ud83d\ude2d.\n @techniq \nI prefer to name this component generic `Text` than `Label`.  And maybe a workaround for you is to set the `tick` of `XAxis` to be a customized function.\n  @huliyou You can submit PRs to add some components. Our team will discuss whether to merge the pr.\n  @gischina You can use [ResponsiveContainer](http://recharts.org/api#ResponsiveContainer) to set the width of LineChart to be `100%`.\n @godmar When you use `ResponsiveContianer`, we'll try to calculate the width and height of ResponsiveContainer's parent node. But If the height of parent node is 0, we don't know how to calculate the height of `ResponsiveContainer`.  We have many discussion in #135 .  Maybe you can set a `minHeight` to `ResponsiveContainer`.\n  @jakeorr We'll support it in the next version.\n  @nickpalmer Thank you for your enthusiasm.\n  @bduff9  If the width and height is fixed number,  you can place some text in the center of donut pie chart by adding svg elements in `PieChart`.\n\n``` jsx\n<PieChart width={800} height={400}\n   <text x={400} y={200} textAnchor=\"middle\" dominantBaseline=\"middle\">\n    Donut\n   </text>\n   ...\n</PieChart>\n```\n\n[Here](http://jsfiddle.net/gzzq6jn3/) is a demo.\n @bduff9 We'll try to support centered label. But it may take some time. You can try to fix it. Or a workaround is to use a position absolute text.\n New components `Label` and `LabelList` are arrived in version 1.0.0-alpha.0. Centric label can be rendered by the following demo.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Pie>\r\n  <Label value=\"any text\" position=\"center\" />\r\n</Pie>\r\n```  @eXtremeX OK! We'll try to add a props to support customized base value.\n  @eXtremeX  Can you try to update the latest version of Recharts. We used transform of svg element  to animate Area before, but it seems not work some time in safari of ios8.3. So we have refactored the animation area.  \n  Recharts will not support react native in a short period of time. Because we think the differences between the charts in pc and in mobile is apparent, we don't have enough experience of mobile development.  And our team have chose to use native ios or android to develop wireless apps after some gays have tried to develop h5 apps hardly. \n  @amitava82 You can check [this issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/171) for two workarounds.\n @amitava82 You can set the `startAngle` and `endAngle` of `Pie` like this:\n\n``` jsx\n<PieChart width={300} height={244}>\n  <Pie\n     data={chartData} \n     cx=\"50%\" \n     cy=\"50%\" \n     startAngle={90}\n     endAngle={-270}\n     innerRadius=\"60%\"\n     outerRadius=\"80%\"\n     stroke=\"none\"\n  />\n</PieChart>\n```\n\n[Here](http://jsfiddle.net/vfeoLdp6/2/) is a demo.\nPlease check [document](http://recharts.org/api#Pie) for detail.\n  @bluespore We have looked at a lot of chart libraries before, like echarts, highcharts, c3, nvd3, chartist, dc.js, and so on. Morris.js is also one of them. Most of these chart libraries can't meet our  various requirements.  That's why we develop recharts.\nAnd we'll try to find the performance problem of recharts. Thank you !\n  Yeah! It's true. Without XAxis, the tooltip just display the serial number.\n @areski Can you support an online example?\n I have checked LineChart in a table, seems no problem.\n  @jacktasia Currently, you can get this only by a customized label which can be a function or a react element. And we'll trying to simplify the labels of recharts components.  Thank you!\n\nAnd this issue is duplicated with [#160](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/160).\n  @pcmaffey Thank you! I'll try to support Area in ScatterChart. And you can check [this issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/154) for the discussion of two numeric axes.\n  Thank you ! You can try to fix some it when you find a bug. And discuss some issues width us, or try to fix some. PR is welcome! \n  @patryk0605 Sorry! There isn't any way to force the text to be visible, because the canvas of svg is too smaller to show all the texts. It's recommended to  position the texts inner the PieChart.\nYou can also check [this issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/160) for discussion before.  \n  @malrase  Thank you for your advice! We are just planning to implement the linkage between legend and chart.  \n  @ganapativs Thank you! I'll tweak the position of bars for multiple y-axes!\n  @kazup0n Sorry I  didn't see your pr earlier until I released version 0.13.3. And this bug has been fixed in 0.13.3. Thank you for your contribution.\n  @kazup0n Thank you. It's the bug of stackOff.\n Fixed in version 0.13.3.\n  @chocolateboy Thank you! \n\nIt works fine in my firefox browser.\nOS: OS 10.11.5\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17723219/07f4df4e-646b-11e6-8317-68dc2bbf6f3f.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17723229/1a11fc70-646b-11e6-8ac1-dc81b3a86394.png)\n Ps, the issue of recharts.org is recommended to be submitted in https://github.com/recharts/recharts.org. \n  @patryk0605 \n\nIs [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/sheubr4L/) what you want ?\n\nThe example for label is http://recharts.org/examples/#PieChartWithCustomizedLabel. I can access to this page in the most times, but not all the times. It's strange.\n\nAnd your issue is similar to [#160](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/160).  I'll temporarily close this issue. If you have more questions about label of Pie, you can discuss with us.\n  @marchaos [Here](http://recharts.org/examples#BiaxialLineChart) is a demo of LineChart which has two y-axes. \n\n``` jsx\n<ComposedChart data={data} margin={{top: 20, right: 0, bottom: 0, left: 0}}> \n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" tickLine={false} axisLine={false} /> \n  <YAxis yAxisId=\"left\" tickCount={10} tickLine={false} axisLine={false} minTickGap={600} /> \n  <YAxis yAxisId=\"right\" orientation='right' tickCount={10} tickLine={false} axisLine={false} minTickGap={600}/>\n  <Tooltip formatter={this.props.drawTooltip} wrapperStyle={{display: 'none'}} /> \n  <Legend /> \n  <CartesianGrid stroke='#f5f5f5' vertical={false} /> \n  <Bar yAxisId=\"left\" dataKey='pv' barSize={40} fill='#F7B7B4'/> \n  <Line yAxisId=\"left\" type='linear' dataKey='uv' stroke='#41527D' strokeWidth={3} /> \n  <Line yAxisId=\"right\" type='linear' dataKey='amt' stroke='#F70D1C' strokeWidth={3} /> \n</ComposedChart>\n```\n\n You just need to specify the `yAxisId` of two y-axes, and graphical Component, like `Line`, `Area`, `Bar`.\n @marchaos A workaround is setting the `domain` and `ticks` of two y-axes like [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/w7qdap9f/1/). But it may be very complex to calculate the domain and ticks.\nHow about the data you want to display? \n @marchaos  If the domains are fixed, you can specify the domain and ticks of YAxis like the following:\n\n``` jsx\n<YAxis yAxisId=\"left\" orientation=\"left\" domain={[-4, 4]} ticks={[-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]} stroke=\"#8884d8\"/>\n<YAxis yAxisId=\"right\" orientation=\"right\"  domain={[-1, 1]} ticks={[-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1]} stroke=\"#82ca9d\"/>\n```\n  @RichardJECooke  \nThe type of XAxis in a vertical BarChart should be `category`, and the type of YAxis should be `number`.\nSo the code should be tweaked like the following:\n\n``` jsx\n<BarChart layout=\"vertical\" width={600} height={300} data={data}\n            margin={{top: 20, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\n  <XAxis type=\"number\"/>\n  <YAxis dataKey=\"name\" type=\"category\"/>\n  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n  <Tooltip/>\n  <Legend />\n  <Bar dataKey=\"pv\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#8884d8\" />\n  <Bar dataKey=\"uv\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#82ca9d\" />\n </BarChart>\n```\n\nWhen you code in local development environment, error logs will be printed in the console.\n @RichardJECooke Documentation is weak now. I'll add the detail explanation in the documentation. Here are some examples for vertical chart:\n\n[Vertical LineChart](http://recharts.org/examples#VerticalLineChart)\n[Vertical ComposedChart](http://recharts.org/examples#VerticalComposedChart)\n[Vertical LineChart which specify the domain of numerical axis](http://recharts.org/examples#VerticalLineChartWithSpecifiedDomain)\n  @marchaos It works fine in [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/znqLLdev/1/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=znqLLdev). Can you show your question in an online jsfiddle demo ?\n @marchaos Recharts listens to the resize event of the container node. As long as you add a  `ResponsiveContainer` in to a container node,  and the container node can change size when the browser becomes larger or smaller, then the chart will change responsively. So I think it may be the bug of the layout which wrapper the ResponsiveContainer. It will be helpful to show your case in a jsfiddle demo. \n @marchaos It seems to be the problem of calculation strategy for flex box. You can check this [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7985021/css-flexbox-issue-why-is-the-width-of-my-flexchildren-affected-by-their-content) for detail.\n  @RichardJECooke  [uv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_user#Unique_visitor) and [pv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_view) are just two indicators commonly used in web analysis. You can search `uv` and `pv` in google.\n @RichardJECooke  \nThere are two workarounds: \n[One](http://jsfiddle.net/vfeoLdp6/1/) is done by PieChart, and [another](http://jsfiddle.net/exjbso5f/) is through RadialBarChart.\n Yeah, the range and domain of RadialBarChart is auto-calculated now. But other charts like LineChart, ScatterChart, RadarChart can set the range and domain.\n\nThank you for your advice, chartist is a great library.\n  @nrkin Can you provide an online fiddle demo ?  You can fork [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/xyw5e9yb/3/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=xyw5e9yb) and update it.\n @nrkin When the props `dot` is set to be `false`, no dots will show. [Here](http://recharts.org/api#Line) is the api of `Line`. And you can check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/16h2935k/3/) for detail. \n @nrkin  You can set the props `cursor` of `Tooltip`  to be `false`.\n\n``` jsx\n  <Tooltip cursor={false} />\n```\n  @eXtremeX In such case, you can set the style of the parent node of responsive container.\n  @mberhorst It will be confused to bind the bar event on the background, especially for stacked bar. Maybe you can set the min height or min width of bar by the props `minPointSize`.\n  @LalithKumarN Scatter can't be composed with Area and Line. Because  both the `XAxis` and `YAxis` are numeric axis for scatter. But for Line and Scatter, one of the XAxis or YAxis should be a categorical axis.\n\n> It is similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments. - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart)\n\nYou can check [this issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/154) for detail.\n  @atyndall You can't use stacked bar chart in such case. Because the stacked chart will display the sum values.\n[Here](http://jsfiddle.net/vxnhLa14/) is a workaround.\n @atyndall  \ud83d\ude02 I don't consider it as a bug. Stacked chart need to display the sum values, and it works in your demo. Meanwhile stacked chart will vary according to the order of stacked elements.\nYou can check [this demo](http://jsfiddle.net/u7949z3f/) for detail.\n @atyndall It's a good idea. We'll add an option `'sign'` to the props `stackOffset` in BarChart and AreaChart which allows the bars and areas to be stacked according to the sign of value.\n  @Algiras   `Area` does not support this function now.\n @Algiras We'll refactor the events of some components in a few time.\n  @techniq The display of labels in PieChart can be multifarious. That's why we allow develops to customize the labels by a function. Maybe we can export some utils, and refactor `label` in Pie. But we won't add more and more props to meet all the requirements, It's would be very difficult to find the needed props.\n @techniq Thank you!  Looking forward to hear more of your advices.\n @techniq \nWe used this kind of PieChart in our products too.  In our case, the height of container is fixed, and the width is responsive which have a minimum width. Then we set the innerRadius and outerRadius  to be a percent value,  and limit the angle of label line.\nHere is [a example](http://jsfiddle.net/o39d7va5/).\n\nBut when not enough space, this kind of labels can't be guaranteed to render inside the bounds of svg. \n The label can be must simpler in 1.0.0+.  @BenjaminRCooper  How about your webpack configuration ?\n It's seems that you have imported the components of Recharts by file path like: \n\n```\nimport  { LineCharts } from 'recharts/src/index';\n```\n @BenjaminRCooper It looks very normal now. I can't find the problem. \nCan you add your project in github?  \nIt's very strange about your bundle file. \nBecause the `main` in the `package.json` of recharts is specified to be `lib/index` which has been compiled. And the `main` in the `package.json` of `d3-scale` is specified to be `build/d3-scale.js` which has been compiled too.\n\nNormally, you should not import the file in src.\n  For example, if you want to set the color of `XAxis`, you can set the props `stroke` of `XAxis` just like a svg element:\n\n``` jsx\n<XAxis dataKey=\"name\" stroke=\"red\" />\n```\n\nThen the stroke color of axis line, tick line and the fill color of ticks are set to `red`. If you want to set the fill color of ticks to be another color, you can set `tick` of `XAxis`:\n\n``` jsx\n <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" stroke=\"red\" tick={{fill: 'orange'}} />\n```\n\nSo just like `XAxis`, most other Components of Recharts except `Legend` and `Tooltip` can receive props `fill` and `stroke`.\n  @GregoryPotdevin \n\nThanks! Maybe the max radius of clipPath should be tweaked.\n Yeah! `maxRadius = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(width * width + height * height)` is a good idea.\n  @manuviswam If both XAxis and YAxis are numeric axis, you should use ScatterChart. In your case, you should set the type of XAxis to be `category` just like this [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/3w1b41yd/).\n\nBut I wonder why your data isn't continuous in `date`.\n @manuviswam  Which of the following curves do you want to get ?\n1. Remove unavailable dates\n   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17315914/4d43bdf6-58a2-11e6-8d11-733feafc5ce5.png)\n2. Filled with unavailable dates\n   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17315937/80423d18-58a2-11e6-9bcd-fd2d5ae10c1d.png)\n3. Skip unavailable dates\n   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17316037/49647f62-58a3-11e6-97fb-509f586ca5ea.png)\n\nThe first and the second curve can be plotted by LineChart, and the third curve can be plotted by ScatterChart. For simple LineChart, one of the XAxis or YAxis should be a categorical axis. \n\n>  It is similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments.   - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart)\n @manuviswam As you said, you should use ScatterChart to draw the curve. When you use  \nLineChart to draw the second, you should fill the data with unavailable dates:\n\n``` js\nconst data = [\n    {date:10, price:50 },\n    {date:11, price:60 },\n    {date:12, price:54 },\n    {date:13},\n    {date:14},\n    {date:15, price:55 },\n    {date:16},\n    {date:17},\n    {date:18, price:58 },\n    {date:19},\n    {date:20, price:53 }\n];\n```\n\nBecause the price of date 13, and date 14 is unavailable, so the line between date 12 and date 15 is disconnected. So a workaround is to use ScatterChart instead.\n @manuviswam  \nOK! We will discuss how to implement your case. In my opinion a time series chart is also a line chart, the only difference is that the ticks of x-axis in a time series chart are time strings. So I'd like to implement your case in two ways:\n1. Support smooth curve in ScatterChart\n2. Support two options of breakpoints display method:  one is `disconnected`, another is `skip and connected`\n @Eric24 Both `XAxis` and `YAxis` can be \"number-axis\" now. @Eric24 Since version 0.16.0. So can you raise an online demo ?  @kujon I will consider about it.\n Fixed in version 0.13.1.\n  @raymondsze  You can set the [domain](http://recharts.org/api#YAxis) of `YAxis`.  \n  Fixed in version 0.12.7.\n  @adrianmc When a Line has a single point, the length of this Line is 0. Then no animation will be triggered, so the state `isAnimationFinished` is always false. \nIt's a bug of Line, I'll fix it.\n Fixed in version 0.12.6.\n  @adrianmc The default value of `tickCount` in `YAxis` is 5 which means that five ticks will be generated in a y-axis. If the `interval` is set to 1, then the first tick, the third tick and the fifth tick will be showed, other ticks will be hidden.\n\nIt's just like the `tickInterval` in [HighCharts](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#xAxis.tickInterval). Maybe `tickInterval` is a better choice.\n @adrianmc \nThere are two ways to solve such kind of accuracy problem.\n\nOne way is to add `allowDecimals` option like HighCharts.\nAnother way is to tweak calculative strategy of step between ticks which should be integer when the minimum and maximum value of `YAxis` are integers.\n\nI'm more inclined to the second way for the convenience of developers.\n Fixed in version 0.12.6.\n @adrianmc \nI optimize the step calculation in [recharts-scale](https://github.com/recharts/recharts-scale/blob/master/src/getNiceTickValues.js#L44). Integers can't be guaranteed for all the input, but the ticks would be more reasonable.\n @adrianmc  OK! recharts-scale can generate readable ticks in the most time. We would add a props `allowDecimals` to `XAxis` and `YAxis`, which will have a default value `true`. \n  @squll1  Of course, you can modify the starting point by [domain](http://recharts.org/api#YAxis) in `YAxis`.\n  @squll1 RadarChart don't support tooltip now.\n Fixed in version 0.12.6.\n  @adrianmc You have two methods to solve your problem.\n\nOne is that you need to add `color` in your payload of Legend. Otherwise icon will not be filled, so you can't see the icon.\n\n```\n<Legend payload={[{ value: 'Registered Users', type: 'line', id: 'pv', color: '#8884d8' }]} />\n```\n\nAnother is using the default `Legend` which only need to remove `payload` in `Legend` and add `name` in `Line`.\n\n```\n<LineChart\n    width={600}\n    height={240}\n    data={data}\n    margin={{ top: 20, right: 120, left: 20, bottom: 5 }}\n  >\n    <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" />\n    <YAxis />\n    <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" />\n    <Tooltip />\n    <Legend />\n    <Line name=\"Registered Users'\" type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" />\n  </LineChart>\n```\n @adrianmc Yeah, it's a good idea. I'll update the examples.\n  Hi, @NoWay1201 \n\nIt works fine in this [example](http://jsfiddle.net/4sqe4625/).\nNo tooltip content will be rendered when your mouse is outside the chart. You can mouse enter the chart, and the log will work. \n  @adrianmc [Here](http://jsfiddle.net/0mgjy8nf/) is a workaround, though I don't quite understand this chart.\n\nYou can color the bars differently by customized `shape` in `Bar`.\nI wonder why \"Fossil fuels\" have a different fill color?\n  @isilweo You mean `paddingAngle` of `Pie`. We will support this feature in the next version. Thank you for your advice.\n    It seems the bug of latest [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7187);\n @dorsha You can keep this issue open until React fix this bug.\n  It's the bug of [React 15.2.0](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6532).\n @dorsha We will check these props. React will check all the props now, you can see [this document](https://gist.github.com/jimfb/d99e0678e9da715ccf6454961ef04d1b) for detail.\n  @GregoryPotdevin PR is welcome. And It's compatible to allow both an array of numbers and a number for `activeIndex`.\n Closed in version 0.12.4.\n  @isilweo We don't implement `formatter` in Bar. It may be a error caused by copying code from some other file.  And you can implement labels on the top of `Bar` by customized `label`.\n  @nickstanish Can you provide any logs?\n @nickstanish  Can you show more about the browser you used ? And how about the version of browser?\n @nickstanish  Do you know the version of safari in ios8.3?\n ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/16608715/adea4418-4380-11e6-93fb-4a754bf1c463.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/16608734/ef42c61a-4380-11e6-9b1b-291fd5663901.png)\n\n@nickstanish It works fine in my ios8.3 simulator. You can add `alert(navigator.userAgent);` in jsfiddle to check the version of safari.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/16608789/601b9916-4381-11e6-9da6-93cf0a4fc724.png)\n\nAnd it seems no ios6 simulator in xcode now.\n @nickstanish How about the version of Recharts? The problem of AreaChart in ios8.3 seems to be the bug of Animation. And your case seems to the the bug of react-container-dimensions or the style of parent node. Please check the size of parent node. And If possible, you can create an example of your case in jsfiddle. Then we can find the bug easier.\n @joshburgess  Can you describe your question in a simple project that we can have access to ? \n @joshburgess OK! It's helpful for us to find the problem.\n @nickpalmer  \nWe have discussed these two kinds of responsive strategies. Take the display of texts as an example.\n\nThe original size:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17723347/fb5ddab4-646b-11e6-82ae-1fe10aaecb56.png)\n\nLarger size and more space to display texts (The responsive strategy we adopted now) :\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17723356/12fc9ac0-646c-11e6-9619-7225919f2920.png)\n\nLarger size and larger texts (scalable SVGs):\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/17723418/931bdcb6-646c-11e6-8512-223d1e53f125.png)\n\nAnd we think this first responsive strategy is now more widely used.\n @nickstanish  \nAlthough I don't exactly know what is your demand. But your problem can be solved by setting the height of \"content\" node to be `100%`;\n\n``` css\n.content {\n  height: 100%;\n  min-height: 500px;\n}\n```\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/d0k0rk0m/2/ \n @nickstanish @joshburgess It seems to be the problem of calculating width and height for hidden parent! Thank you! I'll try to find the reason.\n @nickpalmer \nI don't mean to force users of the library to set heights on all elements of the tree. But if someone want to set the height of a node to be a relative value (a percent value), then one of its ancestor node should have  a absolute height.\n\nAnd it's a good idea to an option of  aspect ration. And the aspect and minHeight, minWidth should be optional, meanwhile `width` and `height` need to be retained. what @nickstanish has said is a good advice.  \n @nickpalmer PR is welcome.\n\nI have submitted some comments. Hope useful to you.\n @nickpalmer \nI think this issue has been fixed. Thank you very much!\n\n@nickstanish @jasonslyvia \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/k14xykqv/1/ and http://jsfiddle.net/k14xykqv/ are two examples of ResponsiveContainer used with react-bootstrap which specify the aspect of ResponsiveContainer or specify the height of `.tab-pane`.\n @SachaG Yeah, it's the expected behavior. We'll add this in the document.\n  @southnan0 You can see [this issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/43) or  [recharts.org](http://recharts.org/api#Cell) for detail.\n\nAnd [here](http://jsfiddle.net/xcjLLuej/) is an online example.\n  @Cloudo  Merged! Thank you!\n  @ycpatel813  You can use customized label to get what you want.\n\n[example](http://jsfiddle.net/xcjLLuej/)\n    @shakalakatechie \nRecharts only support simple line in ScatterChart now. [Here](http://recharts.org/examples#JointLineScatterChart) is an example.\n\nCan you share what's kind of Line you want to add in Scatter?\n How about [this example](http://jsfiddle.net/ctu7hbjj/)?\n @jcarian you can connect to us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/recharts/recharts?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\n  @zhaoyihong  \nThank your.\n There's some bug when calculate the width, height of Legend and Tooltip. Because we insert a hidden DOM to body when calculate the size of Legend, and Tooltip. So your global css will affect the result of the calculation. It's a bug.\n\nAnd it's normal that global css will affect svg elements, css even have higher priority than presentation attributes of svg elements.  You can look [Here](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html#AlternativesForStyling) for detail.\n I found that it's very troublesome to solve the problem. Because we want to get the width and height before `componentDidMount`.\n\nSo I temporarily solve this problem by a hack method in v0.12.1.\n  @sankho  \nThis approach can lead to presentation attributes of svg elements  is more and more complex, difficult to maintain. Because each components has many presentation attributes, all these attributes have the same problem.\n @sankho I think it's better to add `style`  which can set all the presentation attributes by a function. But we are still very cautious to add **props**. Because this feature can be implemented in two ways now.\nOne is add `fill` to the `data` passed to `BarChart`. Another is set the `shape` of `Bar`.\n @sankho  Thank you very much for your contribution. I really hope that Recharts will become more and more friendly to developers.\n\nBut I worry that your implementation will bring more and more props like `strokeFormatter`, `strokeWidthFormatter`, `fillOpactityFormatter`, `strokeOpacityFormatter`, and so on. Too may props is also not developer friendly. Meanwhile our code may become something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nif (this.props.fillFormatter) {\n  const fill = this.props.fillFormatter(entry.value)\n}\nif (this.props.strokeFormatter) {\n  const stroke = this.props.strokeFormatter(entry.value)\n}\n....\n```\n\nSo I think what we need is something like `attrFormatter`, which can be a function and can format all the attributes by values. And we may get final  presentation attributes like this:\n\n``` javascript\nlet attrs = getPresentationAttributes(props);\n\nif (_.isFunciton(this.props.attrFormatter)) {\n  attrs = { ...attrs, ...this.props.attrFormatter(props.value) };\n}\n```\n\nThan It seems `attrFormatter` do the similar thing to `shape`.  `attrFormatter` is only simpler than `shape`.\nSo I advise you can use `shape` to implement your chart.\n\n[Implemented by shape](http://jsfiddle.net/8s13xjth/)\n[Implemented by formatting data](http://jsfiddle.net/wg72e1jt/)\n @sankho I prefer developers can use the `shape` or  `data` to approach this feature.  \n  @iuriikozuliak  I don't quite understand what's the problem. \n @iuriikozuliak Thank you! I have found the reason.\n The [L256](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/c326127737687e0e89d75935c799f3b1e70b8e56/src/chart/BarChart.js#L256) should fixed to the following:\n\n```\nconst axisId = layout === 'horizontal' ? yAxisId : xAxisId;\n```\n  @george-cz \nThe cause of this bug is that the value of `tick` in `Bar` locate in the left of each band, but the value of `tick` in `Line` locate in the middle of each band.\n\nYour change may cause the bug of LineChart.\n Maybe it's better to fix `getTicksOfAxis`, I change this function in the latest version.\n But, I find `getTicksOfAxis` is in a mess.\n @george-cz We think it's better to fix `getTicksOfAxis`, and we have fix it in V0.12.0. Thank you !\n  @george-cz thank you, i'll fix this bug today.\n Fixed in V0.12.0.\n  @ochervak `Bar` don't support min-height now.\n Fixed in V0.12.0. You can set `minPointSize` of `Bar`.\n\n```\n <Bar dataKey=\"pv\" minPointSize={10} />\n```\n  @troyblank  It's a workaround to set the `domain` of `YAxis`yourself.\nHere is a [example](http://jsfiddle.net/hqe9c1uk/1/).\nAnd you can see the [api](http://recharts.org/api#YAxis) for detail.\n\nAnd we'll discuss this feature. \n\nDo you think this feature is necessary after you know more about `domain`?\n @troyblank  \nThank you for your sharing! I misunderstood the `padding` of C3. It's really necessary for `XAxis` and `YAxis`.\n Fixed in V0.12.0.\n\n`XAxis` and `YAxis` can support domain like `['dataMin - 100', 'dataMax + 50']`.\n  @suelspahiu It works fine in [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/sn2j92kq/).  It seems that you may have some css like:\n\n```\nli {\n   float: left;\n}\n```\n\nBecause we use `li` to write the texts in tooltip.\n Yeah, you can set the value of `type` to 'linear' or remove `type`, because the default value of `type` is `linear`.\n\n```\n<Line type=\"linear\" dataKey=\"any\"/>\n```\n\nor \n\n```\n<Line dataKey=\"any\"/>\n```\n\nYou can look at [api](http://recharts.org/api#Line) for more infromation.\n @suelspahiu \n\nYou can see [this example](http://jsfiddle.net/ffh6nobj/) to determine whether Recharts meet your requirement.\n Hello again @xile611 ,\nWould you please let me know if there's a way to change the font used throughout the graphs? I've looked for a while and cant seem to find anything. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: Also I've got an issue with ResponsiveContainer, where it adds some space in the bottom of the graph, how can I get rid of that (running recharts@0.12.8):\nHere's my code:\n\n```\n<ResponsiveContainer width={\"100%\"} height={\"50%\"}>\n          <ComposedChart data={this.state.data}\n          margin={{top: 50, right: 20, bottom: 0, left: 20}} barCategoryGap={40}>\n          <XAxis hide={true} dataKey=\"Date\" label=\"Days\" />\n          <YAxis yAxisId=\"left\" orientation=\"left\" dataKey={this.state.Value} />\n          <YAxis yAxisId=\"right\" orientation=\"right\" dataKey={this.state.Value1} />\n          <Tooltip cursor={false}/>\n\n          <Legend legendType=\"line\" layout=\"horizontal\" align=\"center\" verticalAlign=\"bottom\" height={10} wrapperStyle={{ lineHeight: '75px'}}/>\n\n          <Bar yAxisId=\"left\" dataKey={this.state.Value} fill='#00AEEF'/>\n          <Line yAxisId=\"right\" dot={false} type=\"linear\" dataKey={this.state.Value1} stroke=\"red\" strokeWidth={3}/>\n          </ComposedChart>\n        </ResponsiveContainer>\n```\n\nHere's what it looks like (I cropped out the top part so I can fit it in 1 screenshot):  \n![screen shot 2016-08-18 at 12 07 22 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9028592/17781201/6188e844-653c-11e6-8dbf-ff2143567691.png)\n\nEDIT2: I know the space there happens because of the <ResponsiveContainer height={\"50%\"] option but if it's 100% the empty space is filled by the graph but the graph takes the whole page.\n-Can it be possible to use a ResponsiveContainer that wraps around a Chart while only controlling the width responsively, while the height stays fixed?\n @suelspahiu \nThere are two ways to change the font of texts in the chart.\nOne is through css like the following:\n\n``` css\n// set the font of all the texts in the chart\n.recharts-wrapper { \n  font-size: 16px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n// set the style of the ticks of y-axis\n.recharts-wrapper .recharts-y-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick text {\n  fill: red;\n  font-size: 16px;\n}\n```\n\nAnother is through attributes of  components:\n\n``` jsx\n<LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data} style={{fontSize: 18}}\n            margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" fontSize={16} fontFamily=\"sans-serif\" />\n  <YAxis/>\n  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n  <Tooltip/>\n  <Legend />\n  <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" activeDot={{r: 8}}/>\n  <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" />\n</LineChart>\n```\n\nThe styling of svg elements is just similar to the styling of dom nodes. You can check [this document](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html) for detail.\n\nAnd for the problem of ResponsiveContainer, I'll fix this bug soon. Thank you!\n @xile611 Thank you ! Please let me know when it's fixed!\nTake care.\n @suelspahiu  Fixed in version 0.13.4\n @xile611 Thank you.\n\nEDIT: @xile611 hmm should you be able to target Legend such as `<Legend fontSize={16} fontFamily=\"sans-serif\" />`    ?\nFor some reason it doesn't work for me.\n  @troyblank \n\nThe interpolation that C3 use to generate smooth curve is _Cardinal_. And  you can use _Cardinal_ in Recharts too, just like the example: http://jsfiddle.net/hqe9c1uk/.\n\nBut I recommend to use _Monotone_ interpolation. Because curve may across the boundary when you use _Cardinal_  interpolation.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6111424/16217403/bff1f728-37a5-11e6-9c94-1e6483653f88.png)\n\n Ps: You can see more about interpolation [here](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#curves).\n @troyblank Our document is not perfect yet.

You can see: http://jsfiddle.net/ggg0trdh/3/.\nAnd because the default `type` of `YAxis` is `\"number\"`,  if you want to set the `type` of both x-axis and y-axis to `\"number\"`, you should change to `ScatterChart`.\n  @rainandwind0 \n\nYou can set the props `tickCount` in `PolarRadiusAxis`. The default value of `tickCount` is _5_, that's why you always get five circles.\n\n```\n<PolarRadiusAxis angle={30} domain={[0, 3]} tickCount={4}/>\n```\n My fault! I forgot to add `tickCount` in the API of `PolarRadiusAxis`. \n Yeah, I'll update the document. Welcome to point our mistakes.\n  @joshburgess \n\nWe consider your issue for a long time, found that it's a very different to sync brush and hover events across more than one chart. Because we change the state of a LineChart to track and show the Tooltip now. If a LineChart want to keep synchronous with another chart, the LineChart must receive some props from the external. \nThese two kinds of behaviour is contradictory.\n Fixed in version 0.13.3.\n  It's a bug. We'll fix it in soon.\n Fixed in version 0.10.7.\n  @zvictor How about the problem of initial width and height you have mentioned in [react-container-dimensions#1](https://github.com/okonet/react-container-dimensions/issues/1)\n Great! Thanks! \n @sbehrends  Can you show your complete code in JSFiddle?\n @zvictor I apologize for my reckless behaviour, I should communicate with you if you are still willing to update the commits.\n  The problem is due to we use `cloneElement` to pass props into the label component.\n\n``` js\n  React.cloneElement(label, this.props);\n```\n\nSee [facebook/react#6268](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6268) for detail.\n See [facebook/react#6880](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6880)\n  You can set the prop `isAnimationActive` to be false to disable all animation in the Bar/Line/Area... \n\nNow, the data updating animation is equal to initial animation, later we will support updating animation too. \n\nNow, we use `isAnimationActive` to control if the animation is valid, later we will add a prop to control data updating animation.\n\nAnd I'm not clear what do you mean when you say rerender the whole chart.\n  Now you can set tick to be a function or a react element to achieve your goal temporarily. In the feture, I think we should let shape attributes, just like cx, cy, dx, dy, can override defult settings.\n  Please update the latest code, and fix the build fail problem.\n @ciAnd7 This bug of Brush has been fixed in version 0.10.7\n  It's a good idea to customize animation , I'm sorry for Recharts not support it yet.  We will add this feature soon.\n react-smooth will still get bundled If animation is disabled.\n @adrianmc You can set the props `isAnimationActive` to `false` in `Bar`, `Line`, `Pie`, etc.\n[Here](http://recharts.org/api) is the document.\n Duplicated with issue #293 .\n  This feature is being planned. Maybe you can put your usage scenario described in more detail. It's helpful to our implement.\n @hrbustor \nBarChart support customized event handlers in v0.10.6. You can bind click event like:\n\n``` jsx\n<BarChart width={400} height={400} data={data} onClick={this.handleBarClick}>\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" />\n  <YAxis />\n  <Legend />\n  <Tooltip />\n  <CartesianGrid vertical={false}/>\n  <Bar dataKey=\"uv\" />\n  <Bar dataKey=\"pv\" />\n</BarChart>\n```\n\nOr\n\n``` jsx\n<BarChart width={400} height={400} data={data}>\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" />\n  <YAxis />\n  <Legend />\n  <Tooltip />\n  <CartesianGrid vertical={false}/>\n  <Bar dataKey=\"uv\" onClick={this.handleUvBarClick}/>\n  <Bar dataKey=\"pv\" onClick={this.handlePvBarClick}/>\n</BarChart>\n```\n  Yes, we think the ReferenceLine and the ReferenceDot are auxiliary so we render them before chart.\n\nIn AreaChart or BarChart, the ref lines/dots may be sheltered from the chart, you may set a fillOpacity to Bar or Area.\n\nWhat do you think\uff1f\n of course, you can see what I mean in jsfiddle:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/hzongquan/435Lf8sa/4/\n We have modified the render order. Chart render before the refs now , so the refs will above the chart . \n\nAnd if you want let refs render below chart, you can add a prop `isAbove` which means chart render above the refs. The sample code is as below: \n\n```\n<BarChart width={400} height={400} data={data} isAbove >\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" />\n  <YAxis />\n  <Legend />\n  <Tooltip />\n  <CartesianGrid vertical={false} />\n  <ReferenceLine y={3200} stroke=\"red\" />\n  <Bar dataKey=\"uv\" fill=\"#ff7300\" />\n  <Bar dataKey=\"pv\" fill=\"#387908\" />\n  </Bar>\n</BarChart>\n```\n\nYou can use this feature when the next version is released.\n\nThanks!\n  In fact,  `react-dom/server` package is equivalent to `react/lib/ReactDOMServer` package.\n\nThe code in `react-dom/server` is as below:\n\n```\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = require('react/lib/ReactDOMServer');\n\n```\n\nWe can't diagnose the problem without your webpack config code, can you show your webpack config code here ?\n  You should specify `type` in `XAxis` to be `number`.\n\n``` jsx\n<BarChart \n  width={600} \n  height={300} \n  data={data} \n  layout=\"vertical\"\n  margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}\n>\n  <XAxis type=\"number\"/>\n  <YAxis type=\"category\" dataKey=\"name\" />\n  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n  <Tooltip/>\n  <Legend />\n  <Bar dataKey=\"pv\" fill=\"#8884d8\" />\n  <Bar dataKey=\"uv\" fill=\"#82ca9d\" />\n</BarChart>\n```\n\nBecause the default value of `type` in `XAxis` is `'category'`.\n  Fixed in version 0.10.5.\n\nNow props `type` in  `Curve` supports `'basis'`, `'basisClosed'`, `'basisOpen'`, `'linear'`, `'linearClosed'`, `'natural'`, `'monotone'`, `'step'`, `'stepBefore'` and `'stepAfter'`.\nAdd `type` can set to be a interpolation function, just like:\n\n``` jsx\nimport { curveCardinalClosed  } from 'd3-shape';\n\n...\n  <Curve type={curveCardinalClosed.tension(1)} points={points} />\n...\n```\n PR is welcome! But we haven't think very clear whether such charts which are not very widely used should be contained in Recharts.  \n  Thanks! It seems to be a bug.\n Fixed in v0.10.4\n  Thanks!  We'll consider this feature.\n  Yeah,  this feature is being planned. And `Treemap` has implemented this feature.\n@jasonHzq \n Done in v0.10.4.\n  Well, I don't think your positioning strategy is very appropriate. Because it can cause the problem of tooltip covering the active dots.\n Yeah, tooltip located at the right of cursor is natural. But when we detect the tooltip will exceed the viewing area, the position of tooltip will be adjusted to the left of the cursor. \n  @michalg42 \n\nIn your case, you can set the props `name` of each chart item just like the following example:\n\n``` jsx\n<LineChart width={400} height={400} data={data}  margin={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 30, right: 30}}>\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" />\n  <Tooltip/>\n  <Legend/>\n  <CartesianGrid stroke=\"#f5f5f5\" />\n  <Line name=\"My X value\" dataKey=\"x\" stroke=\"#ff7300\" />\n  <Line name=\"My Y value\"  dataKey=\"y\" stroke=\"#387908\" />\n</LineChart>\n```\n\nThanks! I'll add this in the document.\n  Thanks!\nBut `getTooltipBBox` is not a misspelling, it means getting bounding box of the tooltip.\nIf you have used _Raphael.js_ before, you may know `getBBox`  which is a method of Raphael element.\nI just borrowed the naming from _Raphael.js_.\n @doublelduob  Thanks~  Pull request is welcome!\n  Thanks~ Treemap will support Tooltip in next version.\n Done in version 0.10.1\n  This problem has been fixed in version 0.10.0. And this problem was caused because `scalePoint` in d3-scale eliminate duplicate data internally.\nBut I am curious how can a list data has two duplicate element which have different values. Can you show me an example?\n  Recharts support server side render. But some components need to calculate the width or height of a  dom node, so some component can't show in server side, just like `Tooltip`, ResponsiveContainer.\n\nMaybe you  can show  your code, or give me a jsfiddle example.  \n Yeah. It was because animation of `Line`, `Area`, `Bar` was added by default.\nYou can solve this problem by removing animation.\n\n``` jsx\n<ComposedChart width={600} height={400} data={data}\n            margin={{top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20}}>\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\"/>\n  <YAxis />\n  <Tooltip/>\n  <Legend/>\n  <CartesianGrid stroke='#f5f5f5'/>\n  <Area isAnimationActive={false} type='monotone' dataKey='amt' fill='#8884d8' stroke='#8884d8'/>\n  <Bar isAnimationActive={false} dataKey='pv' barSize={20} fill='#413ea0'/>\n  <Line isAnimationActive={false} type='monotone' dataKey='uv' stroke='#ff7300'/>\n</ComposedChart>\n```\n  Thanks! haha~\n  It's correct the domain of RadarChart  is specified in `domain`  on `PolarRadiusAxis`, and `fullMark` is a original value. If `domain` isn't specified, then the domain is calculated by the minimum and maximum value of dataset .So I gave two examples in  the example page.\n\nBut now we can't support such data:\n\n``` js\nconst data = [\n    { subject: 'Math', A: 120, B: 110, fullMark: 150 },\n    { subject: 'Chinese', A: 98, B: 130, fullMark: 150 },\n    { subject: 'English', A: 86, B: 130, fullMark: 150 },\n    { subject: 'Geography', A: 99, B: 100, fullMark: 100 },\n    { subject: 'Physics', A: 85, B: 90, fullMark: 100 },\n    { subject: 'History', A: 65, B: 85, fullMark: 100 },\n];\n```\n\nThat means each element in the `data` may have different scale. Now I have thought of two ways to specify the domain of each element in a `data`.\n\nFirst, specify domain in `data`:\n\n``` js\nconst data = [\n    { subject: 'Math', A: 120, B: 110, fullMark: 150, domain: [0, 150] },\n    { subject: 'Chinese', A: 98, B: 130, fullMark: 150, domain: [0, 150] },\n    { subject: 'English', A: 86, B: 130, fullMark: 150, domain: [0, 150] },\n    { subject: 'Geography', A: 99, B: 100, fullMark: 100, domain: [0, 100] },\n    { subject: 'Physics', A: 85, B: 90, fullMark: 100, domain: [0, 100] },\n    { subject: 'History', A: 65, B: 85, fullMark: 100, domain: [0, 100] },\n];\n```\n\nSecond, specify domain in `Cell`:\n\n``` js\n<RadarChart cx={300} cy={250} outerRadius={150} width={600} height={500} data={data}>\n  <Radar name=\"Mike\" dataKey=\"A\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" fill=\"#8884d8\" fillOpacity={0.6}>\n    {\n        data.map((entry, index) => (\n          <Cell domain={[0, entry.fullMark]} key={`cell-${index}`}/>\n        ))\n    }\n  </Radar>\n  <Radar name=\"Lily\" dataKey=\"B\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" fill=\"#82ca9d\" fillOpacity={0.6}/>\n  <PolarGrid />\n  <Legend />\n  <PolarAngleAxis dataKey=\"subject\" />\n</RadarChart>\n```\n  This problem may due to two react in your local project.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/28519287/what-does-only-a-reactowner-can-have-refs-mean\n\nIf you have used webpack, you can add `resolve` in your _webpack.config.js_.\n\n```\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      'react': path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'react'),\n    },\n    extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx', '.css', '.scss', '.json']\n  },\n```\n  Thanks! @slestang \nCan you show me your code, and how you want to use recharts?\n Thanks! I 'll think about supporting scaleTime.\n @slestang \nMaybe your case can be implemented by set customized `ticks` and `tickFormatter` in `XAxis`. \n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/ntmm30gk/\n  Thanks. This problem was fixed in v0.8.8.\n\nInitially I think that the width and height must be a percentage. But you may need to set the width to be a percentage, but the height to be a fixed value. So the width and height of `ResponsiveContainer` can be a percentage or a fixed number in v0.8.8.\n   `transform` is a good way to change the postition of label. Because we can only use css to change some presentation attributes, but we can't change the position attributes such as `x`, `y` in css. \n\n``` css\n.recharts-cartesian-axis-label text {\n  fill: red;\n}\n```\n\nAnother way is to set `label` into a function, or react element.\n\n``` jsx\nconst renderLabel = (props) => {\n    const { x, y, width, height } = props;\n\n  return (\n    <text x={x + width / 2} y={y - 10} className=\"customized-x-axis-label\">Anything</text>\n  );\n};\nconst SimpleLineChart = React.createClass({\n    render () {\n    return (\n        <LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data}\n            margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\n       <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" label={renderLabel}/>\n       <YAxis/>\n       <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n       <Tooltip/>\n       <Legend />\n       <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" />\n       <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" />\n      </LineChart>\n    );\n  }\n})\n\n```\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/sh2bLsh2/\n  It's my mistake, the stage-0 will be splitted to specific packages. I will fix the babelrc\n  The default width of  `YAxis` is 60, maybe you can set the width to be a smaller value just like the following example.\n\n``` jsx\n   <YAxis width={40} />\n```\n  Thanks!\nThe customized payload is overwritten by the legend data calculated in `LineChart`, but the data won't be overwritten in the test file.\nMaybe the `payload` should not be overwritten when you have set a customized `payload` in a `Legend`.\n Fixed in v0.8.7\n  @kennetpostigo \nI think you should set the `cx`, `cy`, `innerRadius`, `outerRadius` of `RadarChart` and `RadialBarChart` to be  a  percent value.\n\n``` jsx\n<ResponsiveContainer  width='100%' height='100%'>\n        <AreaChart className=\"area\" data={data}\n              margin={{top: 10, right: 30, left: 0, bottom: 0}}>\n            <XAxis dataKey=\"name\"/>\n            <YAxis/>\n            <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n            <Tooltip/>\n            <Area type='monotone' dataKey='uv' stackId=\"1\" stroke='#8884d8' fill='#8884d8' />\n            <Area type='monotone' dataKey='pv' stackId=\"1\" stroke='#82ca9d' fill='#82ca9d' />\n            <Area type='monotone' dataKey='amt' stackId=\"1\" stroke='#ffc658' fill='#ffc658' />\n        </AreaChart>\n      </ResponsiveContainer>\n\n      <ResponsiveContainer width='100%' height='100%'>\n        <RadialBarChart className=\"radial\" cx=\"50%\" cy=\"70%\" innerRadius=\"20%\" outerRadius=\"80%\" data={data2}>\n          <RadialBar minAngle={15} label background clockWise={true} dataKey='uv'/>\n          <Legend iconSize={10} width={90} height={140} layout='vertical' verticalAlign='middle' wrapperStyle={style}/>\n        </RadialBarChart>\n      </ResponsiveContainer>\n\n      <ResponsiveContainer width='100%' height='100%'>\n        <RadarChart className=\"radar\" cx=\"50%\" cy=\"50%\" outerRadius=\"80%\" data={data3}>\n            <Radar name=\"Mike\" dataKey=\"A\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" fill=\"#8884d8\" fillOpacity={0.6}/>\n            <Radar name=\"Lily\" dataKey=\"B\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" fill=\"#82ca9d\" fillOpacity={0.6}/>\n            <PolarGrid />\n            <Legend />\n            <PolarAngleAxis dataKey=\"subject\" />\n            <PolarRadiusAxis angle={30} domain={[0, 150]}/>\n          </RadarChart>\n      </ResponsiveContainer>\n    </div>\n\n```\n\nYou can see the [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/0xu0gsgq/).\n  The default value of props `interval` in  `XAxis` and `YAxis` is `'auto'`, then we will calculate the width and height of each tick to determine whether there is enough space to display a certain tick. But the calculation can't be done on server side, so led the such inconsistencies. \nMaybe you can set the value of props `interval` in `XAxis` or `YAxis` to be a number, just like the following example. When you set the `interval` to be 0, then all the ticks will be drawn.\n\n``` jsx\n  <LineChart data={data} width={400} height={400}>\n     <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" interval={0}/>   \n     <Line dataKey=\"a\"/>\n   </LineChart>\n```\n  Thanks. Recharts will support React 15.0 in next version\n we already support react 15.0 in v0.9.2 \n  Thanks! We plan to release a stable version in April. But we will do as soon as possible to support wireless.\n  Fixed in v0.8.6\n  Fixed in v0.8.6.\nAnd SSR and CSR is unlikely to be completely consistent. \nFor example when you want to render legend in a line chart. The width and height of legend can be calculated in client side, but such calculation can't be done in server side.  \n  When `XAxis` is a category axis, `tickCount` won't affect the count of ticks. \n  Fixed in v0.8.5\n  Thanks! Maybe `invariant` is not suitable to be used here. We will add a log util to output some warning messages.  \n Fixed in 0.8.4\n  When using custom label element, It wasn't getting rendered next to the slice.\n- added label formatter for tooltip. (Ex: date formatting)\n- pass the pie slice percentage as part of props for custom pie label element\n Thanks~\nMaybe we need to add a props `labelLine` to control the lines between labels and slices.\n  Now the color of slices can be set in the data like the example:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/j8w3176p/\nBut I don't think it's a good idea.\nDo you have any advice?\n Yeah, add presentation attributes in the data fields is not a good idea. \nAnd put all the different colors in an array is not a good idea too, in such case we may need to add props like `strokes`,`fills` and so on.\n\nI think your suggestion is very good, we will consider carefully.\n @joshafest  Not closed yet! \n Thanks! PR and advice are welcome! @joshafest \n Fixed in v0.8.4.\nWe add a component `Cell` which can be child of `Pie`, `Bar`, `RadialBar`, so that the attributes of each sector in a pie  can be specified in cells.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` jsx\n<PieChart width={730} height={250}>\n    <Pie data={data} cx=\"50%\" cy=\"50%\" outerRadius={50}>\n      {\n        data.map((entry, index) => (\n          <Cell key={`cell-${index}`} fill={colors[index]}/>\n        ))\n      }\n    </Pie>\n  </PieChart>\n```\n\n``` jsx\n<BarChart width={730} height={250} data={data}>\n    <Bar dataKey=\"value\">\n      {\n        data.map((entry, index) => (\n          <Cell key={`cell-${index}`} stroke={colors[index]}  strokeWidth={index === 2 ? 4 : 1}/>\n        ))\n      }\n    </Bar>\n  </BarChart>\n```\n\nAnd we still can specify the attributes of each child node through `data`, but `Cell` is of higher priority.\n @steve-taylor You can set a customized `label` of `Pie`,  which can be a function, a react element.\n\nHere is the [document](http://recharts.org/api#Pie).\n  Great idea! Thanks for @rrag. What do you think? @xile611\nreact-stockcharts is awesome probject too. Maybe we will be worth to join forces, borrow the ideas. :-)\n Thanks for @rrag .\n\nI also thought about what you said when I started recharts.Then in the process of implementation, I began to doubt in what scenario user want to draw a circle, a line or a rectangle with specified coordinates.\n\nSo I implement `ReferenceLine` which accept a value as input and draw a line whose coordinates are calculated internally. `ReferenceDot` is similar.\n\nAnyway, limit child type is really not flexible enough.I will consider about the implementation.\n  `stroke-dasharray: 0px 1px;` means that you want to draw the line with `0px` dash and `1px` gap repeatedly.\nThen of course, the path is invisible. You can view the following example, and you will find that normal behavior of the browser always been this way.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/dv8b287f/\n\nYou can also view the following documents about `stroke-dasharray` further:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dasharray\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#StrokeDasharrayProperty\n Sorry for  misunderstanding what you mean.\nAnd of course, rendering behavior should be same on server side and client side.\nSome bug happens in  server side rendering when `stroke-dasharray` is set in `Line`.\n Fixed in v0.8.0\n @isilweo Can you show you code here? I do not quite understand what is your problem now.\n\nAnd  I will add the apis about animation in the document.\n @isilweo \nI have found the reason. The paths have attributes `stroke-dasharray=\"none\"`, `style=\"stroke-dasharray: 0px 1px;\"` because we need to hide the path before animation of paths start, otherwise paths will blink in client side.\n\nAnd It seems impossible that the behavior of SSR and CSR is exactly the same when paths have animation.\nMaybe you can set `isAnimationActive={false}` in `Line` when you need SSR.\n\n``` jsx\n<LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data}>\n  <Legend />\n  <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" isAnimationActive={false} />\n  <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" isAnimationActive={false}/>\n</LineChart>\n```\n  Fixed in v0.8.0\n  `ResponsiveContainer` will calculate the width and height of parent node after `componentDidMount` or   resize of window. If width or height of parent node is 0, or the props `width` for `height` is `0%`, then no chart will be rendered.\n\nSo you have to set the `width` and `height` of the parent node in style or css.\n  PR is welcome!\n`AutoSizer` is more perfect than ResponsiveContainer. \n But I am worried about the size of Recharts.js now.\nYou can run  `npm run bundle-analyse` after improvement. \n Fixed in 0.8.6\n  Now I need to set three props ( `type`, `value`, `xAxisId` or `yAxisId` ) to describe a reference line. Just like: \n\n``` jsx\n  <ReferenceLine type=\"vertical\" value=\"Page C\" xAxisId={1} stroke=\"green\" label=\"Min PAGE\"/>\n  <ReferenceLine type=\"horizontal\" value={4000} yAxisId={1}  label=\"Max\" stroke=\"red\" strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n```\n\nI think the props names are a bit obscure. And in order to be consistent , the `value` props of   `ReferenceDot` (Planning Component) would be an object or a string:\n\n``` jsx\n  <ReferenceDot value={['someVal', 12]}  xAxisId={1}  yAxisId={2} stroke=\"green\" label=\"Min PAGE\"/>\n  <ReferenceDot  value={{x: 'someVal', y: 12}} xAxisId={3} yAxisId={1}  label=\"Max\" stroke=\"red\" strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n```\n\n Maybe we can describe a reference line like this:\n\n``` jsx\n  <ReferenceLine x=\"Page C\" xAxisId={1} stroke=\"green\" label=\"Min PAGE\"/>\n  <ReferenceLine y={4000} yAxisId={1}  label=\"Max\" stroke=\"red\" strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n```\n\nIt's just like we describe a horizontal line by `y = 10;`, or a vertical line by `x = 1;` in mathematics.\nThen we can describe a reference dot similarly:\n\n``` jsx\n  <ReferenceDot x=\"Page C\"  y={1000} stroke=\"green\" label=\"Min PAGE\"/>\n  <ReferenceLine x=\"Page C\" xAxisId={2}  y={1000} yAxisId={1}  label=\"Max\" stroke=\"red\" strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n```\n\n@arcthur @vanthiyathevan @bkniffler @Cloudo \n The mathematics formula is great. The `ReferenceLine` has not only two kinds of types, 'vertical' or 'horizontal', but that is most useful. That may be a formula types, such as curve and discontinuous lines. So we can combine formula, and custom render option.\n Implemented in v0.8.0\n  When a reference line is present, the yaxis domain should include the `ReferenceLine` value. Right now the reference line get rendered out side the domain. See the screenshot where the goal value is at 10%\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1296183/13154813/ccd5f142-d648-11e5-9086-2f75304e5857.png)\n Thanks!\nThis bug related to two problems:\n1. A warning should be given when the value of `ReferenceLine` is not within the domain of axis. \n2. The domain of a numeric types axis which has positive values should be minimum 0 by default. \n\nSo I plan to change the default value of domain in `XAxis` and `YAxis` to `[0, 'auto']`. If the domain is specified as `['dataMin', 'dataMax']`, than the max of the axis is the maximum value of the input data, and  the min of the axis is the minimum value of the input data. And if the domain is specified as `['auto', 'auto']`, comprehensible scale ticks will be calculated, and the final domain of axis is generated by the ticks.\n Good idea! A `alwaysShow` props can be added to `ReferenceLine`.\n Yeah. Of course.\n Fixed in v0.8.0\n  Fix in 0.7.0\n  Actually, recharts didn't depend on whole lodash. The build config include [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash). That could be transformed the lodash import. The whole lodash file size is 400k+.\n\nBut the file size of recharts is really the problem. We will check the built file, and check d3-scale and lodash import. I planed create babel plugin like babel-plugin-babel to reduce the size. It will do after 1.0 release.\n The recharts ver 0.7.0 has reduced the lodash filesize, but the whole library size is bigger ;-) \nNow the webpack don't support ES2015 modules. Otherwise, we will reduce the smaller size.\nI will take that to 1.0 release plan for new issue.\n  I did an experiment and found no problem. Do you depend on `react-router` or any other packages which define history as a peerDependency?\n So that's it. My local npm version is 3.3.12, so no problem. \n Yeah, it's really strange! I have used 0.6.3 for a long time .\n Thanks! I will fix these problems soon.\n It seems that the bug was resolved in npm2, but not properly fixed for npm3.\n\nSee the issue of react-router-redux:\n[react-router-redux issue](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux/issues/133)\n I have try v3.4.0 and v3.7.3, the bug happened again.\nSo I checked the file [utils/tar](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/v3.7.3/lib/utils/tar.js#L75) in all the 3.x versions. Then I find that the bug wasn't fixed in any 3.x version.\n\nSo I submitted a [issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/11582).\nHope fixed soon.\n I fix the release script, and fix the history pack problem. We will publish next version to remove the package.\n  Thanks! It's really a good idea.\nWe will add label of ReferenceLine in the next version.\n Fixed in v0.7.0.\nhttp://recharts.org/api#ReferenceLine\n  You can set the props `type` to be `monotone`, just like the following example\n\n```\n   <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" />\n```\n\nThe props `type` of Line means the interpolation used to generate the curve.\nWe will optimize the api document in the few days.\n  Have implemented In v0.7.0\nhttp://recharts.org/examples#TwoSimplePieChart \n  Have implemented in v0.7.0.\nhttp://recharts.org/examples#ComposedChartWithAxisLabels\n  First of all Awesome library. I am trying this chart, so far very impressed at the ease of use.\n\nBut the following errors\n- line chart `Cannot read property 'coord' of undefined` is being thrown when data length increases. Tracked it down to `getComposedData` function in `LineChart.js`. \n- `Cannot read property 'getStyle' of null` is being thrown when data is updated in `handleStyleChange()` function in Animate.js\n\nThis is my chart so far\n\n``` jsx\n<ResponsiveContainer>\n  <LineChart data={data} margin={{ top: 15, right: 20, bottom: 5, left: 15 }}>\n    <XAxis dataKey=\"date\" strokeOpacity={0}/>\n    <YAxis width={10} tickFormatter={() => {}} strokeOpacity={0}/>\n    {\n      graphs.map(g => (\n        <Line\n          key={g.name}\n          {...g}\n          label={<Labeler {...g} lastIndex={data.length - 1}/>}\n          dot={g.dot !== false ? <Dotter {...g} /> : false }\n        />\n      ))\n    }\n   </LineChart>\n</ResponsiveContainer>\n```\n\nThank you\n Thanks! Can you give the full code in jsfiddle? \nMaybe you can fork one of our demo in http://recharts.org\n The first error is due to forget to update some states when data is update. \nThis bug is fixed in version 0.6.3.\nThe second error is likely due to the props `strokeColors`  in `Dotter` is `undefined`, and the exception seems to be catched in React.\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/rezxmfxm/5/\n I find that `strokeDasharray` doesn't  get applied because we change `strokeDasharray` to generate the animation effect of line. @jasonHzq \nWe will consider this problem.\n Fixed in v0.7.0.\nhttp://recharts.org/examples#DashedLineChart\n  Initially I think the calculation of the with and height of the legend is very troublesome and expensive. so, I left part of location task to the user.Just like your example, adjusting the value of margin to {top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 35} can fix the problem.\n\nBut this's really not too convenient.\nHow do you look on this problem?\n Legend has been refactor in version 0.6.3\n Yeah, I  just want to get the width and height of `Legend` before the `Legend` will be rendered, so that it can avoid the change in size of a chart.\n\n`Recalculating` like `react-dimensions` may bring a lot of callbacks. Is that right?\n I think most users should know that the `PropType` of `wrapperStyle` is consistent width `style` in `React`.  so I didn't add any format requirement in `PropType`.\nIt's repetitive  to add the `PropType` of all the css properties.\nRemove 'px' in your example, the chart show normally.\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/fxtwg1k7/3/\n\nI wonder why no warning when the value of `bottom` and `fontSize` is wrong.\n @Cloudo \nCan you give me an example in  jsfiddle ? Or you can paste you code here. \n I know you problem.\n\n``` jsx\n<PieChart width={300} height={300}>\n  <Pie isAnimationActive={false} data={data01} fill=\"#8884d8\" label/>\n  <Tooltip/>\n  <Legend/>\n</PieChart>\n```\n\nThe default value of props `cx` in Pie is `'50%'`, the default value of props `cy` in Pie is `'50%'`, and the default value of props `outerRadius` in Pie is `'80%'`.\nWhen `cx`, `cy`, `outerRadius` are not specified, default values are used.\nIf I add a lot of restrictions of `cx`, `cy`, `outerRadius` internally, it will affect the flexibility of `PieChart`.\n\nMaybe this problem can be solved by adjusting some parameters.\n  It's really a problem.The state of LineChart is changing  when mouse is moving in the chart, because we keep the location of mouse in state.\n The most condition is the reference of array or object. I use lodash isEqual function to re-write pureRender. It works faster.\n\n```\nLine              yes: 1023      no: 0\nLayer             yes: 1955      no: 2197\nCurve             yes: 1245      no: 253\nLineChart         yes: 556       no: 81\nSurface           yes: 556       no: 0\nCartesianGrid     yes: 0         no: 354\nCartesianAxis     yes: 1215      no: 0\nLegend            yes: 0         no: 47\nTooltip           yes: 481       no: 7\nDefaultTooltip    yes: 481       no: 0\nDot               yes: 493       no: 497\n```\n Thanks @Cloudo to support the project, and welcome to provide the better codes to improve the recharts. :smile:\n\nActually, `isEqual` isn't a better method that I may not spend much time to think about the problem. but the original `pureRender` is too simple that didn't satisfied most conditions, such as complex object. I will custom the better `pureRender` function to divisive the difference for next few days.\n Thanks @Cloudo  for  your enthusiasm.\nI plan to refactor the chart components in the next period of time.\nI think the components can be optimized in the following two points:\n1. Store some auxiliary objects (axisMaps, offset and so on)\n2. Don't store the position of cursor in state\n\nThe job involves so much components, may take longer.\nP.S.  I'm sorry I didn't reply to you at the first time. We are on vacation for Chinese New Year, and we will start work next week.\n We optimized the pureRender function above official pureRender, that may be solved more problems. Always thanks!\n  Hi, @checkraiser \nplease share `package.json`, we could be check the problems.\n\nThank @Cloudo for help!\n  Thanks for great advice! We will change `AdaptionWrapper` to `ResponsiveContainer` just a moment.\n Thanks~ Fixed in version 0.6.0\n  Thanks!\nFixed in v0.5.1.\n  I think the adaptation should be a concern of the container component, just like the example (http://jsfiddle.net/cmx66300/).\n\nMaybe we can provide a component to wrap the chart. The wrapper component can do the event binding. \n We add a wrapper component AdaptionWrapper in version 0.5.0. \nHere is an example (http://jsfiddle.net/Lpk2ky66).\nAnd in the future we need to support percentage value of cx, cy, innerRadius, outerRadius in polar coordinate charts, such as  PieChart, RadarChart, RidalBarChart. \n Support percentage value of cx, cy, innerRadius, outerRadius in v0.5.1\n  Thanks ! We will constantly improve the library. We expect that you will use the library and give us more advice. \n  yeah, I add  this badge just now.\n  @Cloudo \nThank you very much!\nRecharts is not prefect yet. util now, recharts do not support XY LineChart of C3 yet.\nWe will consider about XY LineChart.\n @Cloudo \nI think XY LineChart of C3 is much more like ScatterChart with line jointed by all points.\nAdd the points in the demo of C3 are ordered by x-coordinate.\nSo we add curve in scatter, and the type of line can by 'joint' and 'fitting'. \nThe 'joint' curve in scatter just joint all the points.\nThe 'fitting'  curve is more difficult which we will support in the future.\n\nMaybe you can look for  the demo in ScatterChart.\n", "text_all_count": 27377, "text_word_token": ["How", "do", "you", "skip", "a", "bar", "when",

Fixing unwanted behavior, demos included in the issue.\r\nhttps://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/1529\r\n\r\nThe problem,\r\nIf we update the domain even when we don't show an axis (YAxis), then the 'y' offset for the max value of the data is different for each set of data.\r\n(since the max tick value may differ from the max value of the data supplied)\r\n\r\nThis means that if an app displays several simple charts (tiny*chart) in a row with different sets of data, the charts will have different heights, resulting in inconsistent UX.\r\n\r\n  The height of the AreaChart differs with different data sets - even though a fixed height is specified.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\nCorrect behavior: https://jsfiddle.net/r1tf29ap/\r\n(The height of the chart is '100', like specified)\r\n\r\nIncorrect behavior: https://jsfiddle.net/8415b7yx/\r\n(The height of the chart is '84.17' - it should stretch to '100')\r\n\r\nLast working version was 0.7.x @xile611 \r\nThank you for the workaround.\r\n\r\nI've tested all the demo cases in various conditions (different data, with and without X and Y axes) and couldn't find any erratic behavior with this commit.\r\n\r\nCan you point me to some areas you think this commit can be dangerous to, so I can refactor the underlying design if possible?\r\n  I have been trying to use recharts through UMD as defined in the site\r\nhttp://recharts.org/en-US/guide\r\n\r\nIncluded this script file in my html\r\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/recharts/umd/Recharts.min.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nWhen i run the html on browser by window.Recharts is always undefined.\r\n\r\nLooking to use Recharts directly from Html without npm .

Sorry. My Mistake. I did update my libraries. The is gone now. Thank you. ~~Finally had the time to debug. This error shows up (in 1.3.0 and 1.3.1) when `AreaChart` receives an empty array.~~\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this with `domain={['dataMin', 'dataMax']}` on an axis.

Before 11s, after 67s. Do you think it's relevant? There's a different in output. New build provides more: development bundle and production minified bundle, information about circular dependencies, information about bundle size. When I\u2019m pulling in recharts as a dependency with yarn link, and hacking on the library, I have to run the es6 build after every change. It feels like slow iteration as is; I feel a minute is too long. It's just `build-umd` command. `build-es6` is not changed. Ah, gotcha.\r\n\r\nI don't think the umd build is going to be anyone's primary development environment, especially if the build is going to take a minute. Wouldn't the development bundle and circular dependencies be better identified earlier in the process?\r\n\r\nAlso, doesn't the karma config depend on webpack?

Only full rebuild will take a time. But you will see even more info about your bundles. Size snapshot is able to produce treeshakability info for esm format. /cc @xile611  Webpack still bigger. Rollup produces the most readable and compact code. Okay, will go to write simple and fast charts to finally remove this a piece of dependency bloat.

Though I want to draw the part of the reference area that lies on the canvas, it doesn\u2019t make sense to draw the part that spills out.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to grow the canvas to accommodate the reference area by specifying `alwaysShow`. Though after thinking about this for a while, it seems that _both_ these things should be possible: to show reference items which are partly off the canvas, and to extend the chart domain to accommodate reference items. This deprecates the `alwaysShow` prop, and adds an `ifOverflow` prop which supports four values:\r\n\r\n- `ifOverflow=\"discard\"` (default) \u2013 If the reference item falls partly outside the canvas, don't display it. This is the old default.\r\n- `ifOverflow=\"extendDomain\"` \u2013 If the reference item falls partly outside the canvas, extend the domain so it fits. This is the old `alwaysShow` behavior.\r\n- `ifOverflow=\"clip\"` \u2013 If the reference item falls partly outside the canvas, clip it to the canvas.\r\n- `ifOverflow=\"keep\"` \u2013 If the reference item falls partly outside the canvas, draw it anyway. Hi @xile611, it's a good question.\r\n\r\nThe `ReferenceArea` element already takes an `overflow` property as part of `PRESENTATION_ATTRIBUTES` which is forwarded to `Rectangle`. It seems confusing to have a particular presentation attribute behave differently from the others so I renamed this one to avoid the collision.\r\n\r\nAnother option could be to drop `overflow` from `PRESENTATION_ATTRIBUTES` and `getPresentationAttributes`, and prevent it from forwarding to the `Rectangle`. Would that make any sense?\r\n\r\nGreat idea to align with the css properties: `keep` to `visible` and `clip` to `hidden`. Updated!

This was already done in #888, but somehow managed to trickle in via #916.\r\nSince the dependency is unused, I believe there is no reason to keep it around, it's just causing confusion, bloating the node_modules and can cause incompatibility issues with `react-transition-group@1.x.x`. @xile611 I saw that, although I'm unsure why this happens. The tests are [passing](https://travis-ci.org/markogresak/recharts) when I ran them on my TravisCI. Same code, same config.\r\nI might be mistaken, but to me, it doesn't make sense that removing a dependency would break test run.

So do I need to add some props to the tooltip component? @xile611 I confirm the same issue, if the provided data collections contains `name` parameter, it should be the one displayed in the tooltip, ie in @Eric24 example, it shows `waiting` which is the name of the dataKey instead of `Dogwood`, which is the name of hovered value. This is how BarChart behaves, but RadialBarChart do not. @xile611 A JSfiddle to reproduce the bug: http://jsfiddle.net/4qo7ba5L/118/\r\n(I just forked the SimpleRadialBarChart http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleRadialBarChart jsfiddle example to add a `<Tooltip />` component). As you can see, if you hover the purple radial bar, the tooltip displays `uv: 31.37`, instead of `18-24: 31.37`\r\nHope this clarifies.  I have a few questions about 1.0.0-beta6:\r\n\r\n1.

This would be really useful for a project I am currently working on. I basically need the same functionality that it currently has with the accumulator, but able to wrap the result in my own custom html. I am using this for rendering the total above a stacked bar chart. If there is another way to do this and still keep the result centered above  the bar, then that would work for me as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!

I'm not seeing it in the docs, perhaps it's not so stable yet?\r\nI'm asking because I'd be interested in making more improvements to `Sankey`. @xile611 thanks :)\r\n\r\nI might have another bugfix to `Sankey` component (in certain cases, when the nodes are wide and not far apart, the links aren't drawn accurately).\r\nWould you be interested in such bugfix or is it better to wait until the `Sankey` refactor?  ## Do you want to request a feature or report a bug?\r\nbug\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nException thrown\r\n`TypeError: Cannot read property 'ReactCurrentOwner' of undefined`\r\n\r\n## If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: http://jsfiddle.net/ndLhnegs/).\r\nUse react `15.6.1` and recharts `beta.5`\r\n\r\n## Which versions of Recharts, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

I guess something is wrong with my `package.json`, I will test it later today and reopen if it's relevant.  When I pass an object with all the value equal to zero to Pie chart, as expected the chart disappear, but the legend is also missing. \r\nMy chart tool has a controller when click on legend, it sets the value to 0 to hide the data from the chart.\r\nI'm setting the value to zero, to keep the legend displayed on the chart, and it's possible to return the old values clicking again.\r\nHere's the example of data passed to the Pie chart.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst pieChartData = [\r\n  {name: \"Bar\", value: 0},\r\n  {name: \"Foo\", value: 0}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bar charts on the other hand if I pass values equal to zero, the legend and the Cartesian grid is still there. There's mine expected behavior for the PieChart. Keep the legend to control the values.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst barChartData = [\r\n  {timestamp: 1483315200000, foo: 0, bar: 0},\r\n  {timestamp: 1483401600000, foo: 0, bar: 0}\r\n]\r\n```\r\nSomeone had this problem? There's a workaround? Is it a bug??   @xile611 Yes, that's exactly what I need to do @guilhermedelucas thanks for bringing this up - we have the same issue  When I do this...\r\n\r\n```\r\n<CartesianGrid verticalPoints={[\"33%\", \"66%\"]} horizontalPoints={[\"33%\", \"66%\"]} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the following warnings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `verticalPoints[0]` of type `string` supplied to `CartesianGrid`, expected `number`.\r\nWarning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `horizontalPoints[0]` of type `string` supplied to `CartesianGrid`, expected `number`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, everything works fine (i.e. the warnings appear to be false negatives).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Tested in version `1.0.0-beta.4`_ The use case is to render exactly 5 lines, evenly spaced apart, on a responsive chart -- how would I achieve this given the chart is responsive?\r\n\r\nAlso, this it appears to work, so perhaps \"adding the feature\" would be as simple as just removing the warning? \ud83d\ude1b  ahh yes - that would explain the behaviour I saw when the grid lines were being drawn relative to top-left corner of the viewbox.\r\n\r\nFor my specific case this is actually fine, but understand why this wouldn't be desirable for others.\r\n\r\nWhat's the recommended way forward?\r\n\r\nIMO percentages are a must for `CartesianGrid` when combined with `ResponsiveContainer` -- everything else scales relatively, so must the grid. @xile611 What's the status of this issue ? @merraysy Looks like it works. I still get the warnings. Any new updates on how to suppress them or\u2026? Any updates? Any updates?  Hi,\r\n\r\nI am observing the same problem for the bar charts. A good example can be seen here:\r\nexpected behavior: http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleBarChart\r\nbuggy behavior: http://jsfiddle.net/v8gxrbyu/\r\nFor me it looks like the coordinates of the tooltip are always 0,0.

Not sure if it's been this case all the time.\r\n Extra comment: if I'm understanding the code correctly, this seems to be related to the recent change of replacing `name` with `dataKey` (which is a required attribute). @xile611 Sorry. It's my bad. The issue happens when using `ScatterChart`. Neither `dataKey` nor `name` is defined on `ScatterChart`.\r\n\r\nI just updated the demo. This now looks more like issues of `Scatter` itself. `name` and `dataKey` are both undefined by its current `propType`. I guess that the last time when `Scatter`'s interfaces was changed, the `ScatterChart` was not taken care of properly. @xile611 I mean... `Scatter` doesn't use either `name` or `dataKey`. Is it proper to add these to its propType?

Hello guys. I am developing a react application that has many charts. I used some of this library charts. Now I need a bubble chart like d3.js. Can any one help me how to use that d3 library in react, or can you add bubble chart to this library (recharts). Any help would be good. Duplicate of https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/589  I'm trying to define a height on y axis, but looks like it is calclauting the height internally and not taking my height into account.

I don't have any time to look into it right now, but my hunch is that it is related to commit 93c1366b38affe57531c8e66fb43d2a204bde04d.  how to give label to stacked bar Put a `LabelList` component as the nested component of `Bar`\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<Bar dataKey=\"uv\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#82ca9d\">\r\n    <LabelList dataKey=\"name\" position=\"top\" />\r\n</Bar>\r\n```\r\n\r\njsfiddle link http://jsfiddle.net/dv9ctsrq/ I'm also seeing the same problem.\r\n\r\n@hueitan, \r\nThat works in the fiddle but the exact same code doesn't work in my own project.\r\n\r\n\"recharts\": \"^1.0.0-beta.1\", the jsfiddle uses the recharts version beta.1\r\n\r\nhttps://npmcdn.com/recharts@1.0.0-beta.1/umd/Recharts.min.js @hueitan,\r\nYeah, I know -- I can't explain why it's not working on my own project though. The same exact code doesn't work but I'm not sure why. I'm using the same version of React and the same version of the Recharts library (es6 though, not umd).\r\n\r\nThe <g class=\"recharts-layer recharts-label-list\" ...> is never rendered into the DOM for me...  @hueitan,\r\nI really appreciate the help. I tracked down the issue on my end -- apparently my outer component containing the chart was causing the chart to re-render very quickly and that was somehow causing the labels to never render (probably related to the way the animations work but to be honest I don't fully understand the source code or the cause yet). If I have some time I'll try to setup a minimal sample case and post it here under another ticket. Great! Just use the jsfiddle link above(lots of the setups are already done), all you have to do is updating the code. But if you'll try to give label list for more than one bar you get another problem - positioning/zindex\r\n![2017-11-22 17 29 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9008978/33132426-b20b6fa6-cfaa-11e7-8b58-eef346681c34.png)\r\nany way to solve this? @bibblebabl was experiencing the same myself with versions prior 1.0.0-beta.3. Upgraded to the last 1.0.0-beta.4 fixed it for me! @bibblebabl \r\n\r\nI was having the same issue you had. The problem is that the `svg`'s `z-index` stack order is sequential by render order. What I did was to invert the implementation of the bars (so they are rendered the correct way, and then I reversed their order again with `reverseStackOrder` on `BarChart`. It will make the svg to render in the correct order.\r\n\r\nWhat also helped me was to position the `LabelList` properly throught `position` property. It supports these following options: `\"top\" | \"left\" | \"right\" | \"bottom\" | \"inside\" | \"outside\" | \"insideLeft\" | \"insideRight\" | \"insideTop\" | \"insideBottom\" | \"insideTopLeft\" | \"insideBottomLeft\" | \"insideTopRight\" | \"insideBottomRight\" | \"insideStart\" | \"insideEnd\" | \"end\" | \"center\"`  ## Do you want to request a feature or report a bug?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is a Feature or Bug\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nThe animation looks buggy and not a good user experience\r\n\r\n## If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce\r\n\r\njsfiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/7yb87att/\r\nClick the More Data / Less Data Button\r\n\r\n![bug-more-less-data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18140315/32848536-0b7867f2-ca2d-11e7-8ca7-1bd0cb8ae89b.gif)\r\n\r\n## What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nBetter animation for the data update?\r\n\r\nDesired behaviour, demo from React-vis\r\n![vis-desired-behaviour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18140315/32848847-cd840202-ca2d-11e7-957b-ac02c262659b.gif)\r\n Here's the temporary solution for **appending the data** which the domain is type number.\r\n\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/csen65sk/\r\n```es6\r\n// example code\r\nappendData() {\r\n this.setState( () => ({\r\n  \tleft : 1, right : 7, animation : false, data : data2.slice()\r\n }) );\r\n    \r\nsetTimeout( () => { // setTimeout does the trick\r\n  this.setState( () => ({\r\n      left : 1, right : 20, animation : true, data : data2.slice()\r\n    }) );\r\n  }, 0 );\r\n},\r\n```\r\n![recharts-append-animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18140315/32943540-bf92cede-cb8c-11e7-9147-30d6bec88993.gif)\r\n\r\nBut this trick doesn't apply to updating the data **in-between**, because the animation doesn't happen\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/o0v5heyp/\r\n![recharts-update-inbetween](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18140315/32943801-a18bf108-cb8d-11e7-9ef5-f49dc395a769.gif)\r\n  This pull request fixes only the prop `minAngle` `maxAngle` of `Polar/RadialBar`, \r\n\r\nI have two questions\r\n\r\n1.

I can't get my pieChart to redraw when moving to another page and coming back.\r\nAt this point you can't redraw the graph when the data doesn't change. So when you come back from another page, the chart doesn't redraw/animate and so my custom labels (called at animationEnd) are not rendered anymore. +1 for this. I'm dynamically changing a second chart axis - recharts doesn't seem to be aware of this and isn't redrawing.\r\n\r\nIf the data changes - it rerenders just fine.

How can i do it?  ## Do you want to request a feature or report a bug?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nAPI docs mention arbitrary shapes such as [Polygon](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Polygon), which leads me to believe that I should be able to include these shapes as part of a chart. For example, something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript.jsx\r\nconst data = [\r\n  {x: 100, y: 200}, {x: 120, y: 100}, {x: 170, y: 300},\r\n  {x: 140, y: 250}, {x: 150, y: 400}, {x: 110, y: 280},\r\n];\r\nconst polygon = [\r\n  {x: 45, y:100}, {x: 45, y:200}, {x: 90, y:200}, {x: 90, y:100},\r\n];\r\nreturn (\r\n  <ScatterChart width={400} height={400} margin={{top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20}}>\r\n    <XAxis type={'number'} dataKey={'x'} name='stature' unit='cm'/>\r\n    <YAxis dataKey={'y'} name='weight' unit='kg'/>\r\n    <CartesianGrid />\r\n    <Scatter name='A school' data={data} fill='#8884d8'/>\r\n    <Tooltip cursor={{strokeDasharray: '3 3'}}/>\r\n    <Polygon data={polygon} fill='#8884d8'/>\r\n  </ScatterChart>\r\n);\r\n```\r\nHowever, it seems that there is only a list of children expected of any particular chart, and anything else is ignored. So, `Polygon` inside any chart is not rendered at all.\r\n\r\n## What is the expected behavior?\r\nShapes inside chart can be added and rendered as a layer within the same coordinate system. The above code should render something like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1696726/31913908-971cca24-b7fd-11e7-9f55-53ddceeb6399.png)\r\n\r\n## Which versions of Recharts, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of Recharts?\r\n`1.0.0-alpha.6`\r\n I had overlooked the `ReferenceArea` component. That's pretty close to what I need to do except I would need to draw polygons and not just rectangles. @xile611 I'm aware of that, but I will have to put in actual svg coordinates, rather than data points on the same scale as my normal data series. I've got a decent implementation using `ReferenceArea` working already, I can open a PR if you are interested. :)  I believe that with `Scatter` it's also possible to draw \"shape\" like Polygon  ## What is the current behavior?\r\nI am trying to generate a scatter chart with some data which has an x and y values.\r\nX ranges from 1-5 and y ranges from 0-25.

Also experiencing this :(\r\n\r\n@ryanand26's solution seems like a good workaround, but this is definitely a bug. @rafaelc0sta @jgentes Can you create a demo on jsfiddle? The code I had with the issue was really convoluted so not suited to a demo.\r\nEdit: here's a (hopefully) working JSfiddle template: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanand26/sh4vuy4c/ The problem happens when you re-do the lines in the render() method. If the lines stay the same (lines, not data), the problem goes away. Moving the lines to the constructor() makes it work. I am running into this same issue. It seems to occur when a part of the state is updated which isn't relevant to the chart.  I was able to reproduce it here: http://jsfiddle.net/sh4vuy4c/17/ Having the same problem!\r\n\r\nMy LineChart component is a stateless component and is used by a wrapper component which has a state. Whenever the state is updated in the parent wrapper (not the data. Only other variables in the state) I get the same error. A solution would be highly appreciated :) Hey, for my project, the problem occurs when using the `ScatterChart` (but it could happen to any components generated by `generateCategoricalChart` upon the analysis)... After some analysis with my team, the issue stems from lines of these two files:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/7e7127387ba64f57299eaff8656542cea6fb3a2d/packages/react/src/ReactChildren.js#L405-L407\r\nhttps://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/b95a84aa1e879c0f6de05219696a54220048a976/src/util/ReactUtils.js#L370\r\n\r\nSince `this.props.children` can return multiple types (ReactNode, ReactNode[] or undefined), **[line370](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/b95a84aa1e879c0f6de05219696a54220048a976/src/util/ReactUtils.js#L370) in ReactUtils.js** should pass the single node rather than the whole array into the checker.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be an easy fix. Not sure if anyone is interested in raising a PR to fix it. Or I can take care of it later in the next few weeks. Thanks. I've created a test case for this issue in my fork. Unfortunately I don't know the innards of React well enough to be confident in changing the equality check but hopefully this gives someone a head start.\r\n[Fork commit](https://github.com/DaftApethIndustries/recharts/commit/7d0785b72592d04a88440979d5df7acfacd30254)\r\n\r\nEdit: I've made a suggested fix in a PR. @ryanand26 I took a look at your PR. Great Job! But, removing `Children.only` seems altering the code's logic, because after the change, `isSingleChildEqual` (which internally expects two ReactNodes to before shallow comparision, check out [this line](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/9511adcf62ea0d8bb847b6b4c4d90e62b8ee73f9/src/util/ReactUtils.js#L351))  will always return false for single node array. As a result, it in turn affects this line https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/9d42367e658cab6bed0a8f2517f17be9e0cf0957/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L185. The code governed by this condition affects Brush and etc. @ZheyangSong @xile611  I've looked into it a bit more and the root cause seems to be that the single elements return a count of one but are wrapped in an array. The code change in the fork above is probably safer than the first attempt. @ryanand26 Yes, it is the root cause. You can find more details regarding it from my earlier comment in this thread. Glad to see you pin the issue down! \ud83d\udc4d   Is there an easy way to calculate the position for each `Label`? I have a line graph with 2 lines, and want to display the label on top for the top line and underneath for the bottom line (the lines may cross, so one is not strictly greater than the other).\r\n Yes, but is there a way to give each point a different label position? When the 2 lines get near each other at certain points, it would be nice to reverse the positions (eg, if line 1 is `position=\"top\"` and line 2 is `position=\"bottom\"`, I want to switch this at certain x positions to be line 1 `position=\"bottom\"` and line 2 `position=\"top\"`)  Trying to get a label shown on a simple pie chart. No lines or anything are shown.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar COLORS = ['#3DCC91', '#FFB366', '#FF7373', '#FFCC00', '#3B22FF'];\r\n\r\n        <PieChart width={300} height={200}>\r\n          <Pie data={data} cx=\"50%\" cy=\"50%\" dataKey=\"value\" label={true} labelLine={true}>\r\n            {\r\n              data.map((entry, index) => (\r\n                <Cell key={index} fill={COLORS[index % COLORS.length]}  />\r\n              ))\r\n            }\r\n          </Pie>\r\n          <Tooltip />\r\n          <Legend />\r\n        </PieChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy do none of the examples work on jsFiddle or on the main site? It just renders blank page.\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\nSo, I dropped back to version 0.22.4 and it shows the label. The latest version doesn't show it. I have the same issue, but I would like not to roll back to an old version! I had the same problem. I came back to the version as the @quangas said and it worked. in the end i went to another lib @davidsonsns which lib did you switch to? Having the same problem. Switching back to 0.22.4 works but then I get other problems. I'm using this @stevelacy [react-chartjs-2](https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2) In my case setting isAnimationActive={false} resolves the issue. Of course this means doing without the animation.\r\n\r\nThe line of code below seems to be the problem - \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/polar/Pie.js#L346\r\n\r\nThe intent is to not render labels until animation completes which makes sense. However, there appears to be a race condition that means labels are never rendered. \r\n Hmm - well I am definitely reproducing the issue but I have more than one Pie shape in my PieChart. \r\n\r\nThis issue also appears to be present in the examples. I am away from my computer but I will try produce a fiddle to reproduce the issue when I get back. Thanks! @xile611 - I added an additional Pie shape to your fiddle and it works fine. So that's not the problem. I also tried changing a few other properties to try to isolate the issue I am seeing in my build and did not reproduce the issue in your fiddle. It seems to be pretty stable.\r\n\r\nMy webpack based build is very different from the test and so I am unable to isolate any further at this time. Since the other users on this thread mention an old version and the fiddle is working with a new version - it seems to me like this issue could be closed. I can open another separate issue if I can isolate a problem in my build. Thanks. I think there is currently a bug with the Customized Label. If you go to http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/PieChartWithCustomizedLabel directly, the customized label will be drawn. But if you go to any other link first such as http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleScatterChart then click on \"PieChartWithCustomizedLabel\", then the customized label won't be drawn. I think this is still not working.\r\nI'm on 1.0.0-beta.10\r\n\r\nAlso example which @xile611 provided http://jsfiddle.net/8wLgvst6/ is all blank isAnimationActive={false} worked for me. Although, my labels are aligning a little funny. I use `<Pie label={customLabel} />` and I also get the problem, unless I deactivate the animation it won't show.\r\n\r\n**react**:  ^16.2.0\r\n**recharts**: ^1.0.0-beta.10\r\n\r\n\r\n Still happening here too. The work around seems to be disabling the animation which isn't ideal.  So we have to choose between animation or label ... \r\n\r\nreact : 16.3.1\r\nrechart : 1.0.0-beta.10 still having this problem as well, seems to happen when fetching async data then the label draw function is never called I'm seeing the issue as well in beta 10. Appears to be happening in the JSFiddle as well. Is there something I can do to help to get this resolved? Preventing the animation does not appear to fix the issue. Why this was closed? The problem still exists (Recharts 1.3.4). Still an issue in 1.4.1.\r\n- animation enabled: no labels\r\n- animation disabled: labels show  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1348993/30981679-19ae686c-a453-11e7-96aa-76b0538120b6.png)\r\n\r\n404ing on all the resources needed to load the examples from JSFiddle\r\n Getting the same errors Same issue here.

However, I would like to render custom svg icons (like checks or x marks) instead of circles as reference points and was wondering if the code supported that, and if not, if it was a feasible feature that could be added.\r\n\r\nUsing v0.22.4 Thanks, I've got an icon showing up now. However, it's not in the correct position. I've tried passing down the props to the custom element and the html shows that i received the x, y, cx, and cy values but it is shifted on the graph.\r\n\r\nReference Dot:\r\n`<ReferenceDot shape={<ValidateCheck />} x={index} y={5} key={`referencedot-${index}`} isFront={true} />`\r\n(where index = 60 for example)\r\n\r\nCustom Icon:\r\n`const ValidateCheck = (props) => {\r\n  <svg width=\"13\" height=\"10\" viewBox=\"0 0 13 10\" {...props} xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\r\n    <title>Path 277</title>\r\n    <path stroke=\"#57DA06\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M1 5l3.5 3.5 7-7.5\" fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"/>\r\n  </svg>\r\n}`\r\n\r\nFor Reference:\r\n<img width=\"566\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-10-03 at 11 22 14 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14262965/31141813-4484b7f2-a82d-11e7-954d-28537a3b351e.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"876\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-10-03 at 11 21 55 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14262965/31141798-381beef4-a82d-11e7-8489-dd2bad250443.png\">\r\n\r\nI'm using the reference dots as a placeholder but I would like the check marks to be where the circle reference dots are.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nI needed to pass down the cx value and apply it as the x coordinate in the custom component.

React 16 changed the URLs. So it would be reasonable to pin examples to a specific version (in this case, 15) rather than use the implicit `latest` version.\r\n\r\nEven if we provided fallbacks for old style URLs, the \u201cReact with addons\u201d build doesn\u2019t exist anymore.

Any help is appreciated. Otherwise i would look at it on this weekend. It's not required to upgrade to React Router v4 btw. React Router 3.2.x upgraded to prop-types package. But looks like you did it without issue \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nI can try to help with the LineChart test. Did a lot of Enzyme changes this week at work lol. @NathanCH yes it's not required but to test locally i have changed. Anyway newer is better right. Thank you for helping with Linechart I really like this pull request :) Thank you.\r\n\r\nI read through your code @kamthamc and noticed you put \"react-transition-group\" into peerDependencies but the changelog for 1.0.0-alpha.5 states:\r\n```\r\n- remove react-transition-group in peer dependencies\r\n```\r\n--> Maybe remove this again from peerDependencies? I feel like there are lots of things happening in this pull request.\r\nI.e. the eslint updates could happen in a different step. They introduce lots of not so nice .eslintrc details IMO. @dmr i am not touching eslint fixes, i am just upgrading libs @dmr i can revert the commits \r\n60b3730, 38b788a if you think too much is going on this pr I added some code here: https://github.com/kamthamc/recharts/pull/1 to fix brush behavior. I don't think there is going on too much yet, but just wanted to ask how others think about this.\r\nThank you for pushing the react-16 issue, I really want to see this get merged once it runs. To fix the test you need to do this where you there `.find(DOMselector)` \r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- expect(wrapper.find('.recharts-tooltip-cursor').length).to.equal(0);\r\n+ expect(wrapper.find('.recharts-tooltip-cursor').hostNodes().length).to.equal(0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of `.find()` changed in Enzyme 3.x, more info [here](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/1237), [here](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/master/docs/guides/migration-from-2-to-3.md#element-referential-identity-is-no-longer-preserved) & [here](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/master/docs/api/ReactWrapper/hostNodes.md)\r\n\r\nAs for the changes in general, I think this PR should focus only on React 16 upgrade. ESLint, React Router, etc.. (if they are not needed for R16) should be done in separate PRs. To keep the change surface to the minimum & we keep the PR focused.\r\n\r\nOne thing that is worrying that I'm not seeing any activity from the owners of the library & not even a comment. There ist still some testcases failing but maybe it's a good starting point For the failing tests, most probably the answers are here https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/master/docs/guides/migration-from-2-to-3.md because enzyme went through a big change & some APIs changed in behaviour  @ahmedelgabri i tried with hostnodes and its undefined. I was going through documentation & i noticed i have to increase the length by 1. That's odd I just cloned the repo & tried `hostNodes()` & it worked fine, I don't think increasing by one will work\r\n @kamthamc I opened a PR https://github.com/kamthamc/recharts/pull/2 to merge into your branch that fixes the failing test any eta when this will be merged? =p I fixed a couple of more places that required `.hostNodes()` the tests are still failing, maybe @xile611 can give us some hints or help on how to fix them. Here are a couple of places were the tests are failing:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kamthamc/recharts/blob/739ca2ea03eab84c931368b733f6c2c77feb1f88/test/specs/chart/LineChartSpec.js#L340\r\n\r\nThis now returns `6` instead of `3` & you can easily see this if you do `console.log(newLineDots.children().debug())`, on master it returns `3` though.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kamthamc/recharts/blob/739ca2ea03eab84c931368b733f6c2c77feb1f88/test/specs/chart/LineChartSpec.js#L343\r\n\r\nThese are not the same objects\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(newLineDots.childAt(0).props().payload)\r\nconsole.log(data[2]) \r\n```\r\n\r\nWill give this output\r\n```\r\nLOG: '{\r\n  \"name\": \"Page A\",\r\n  \"uv\": 400,\r\n  \"pv\": 2400,\r\n  \"amt\": 2400\r\n}'\r\nLOG: '{\r\n  \"name\": \"Page C\",\r\n  \"uv\": 300,\r\n  \"pv\": 1398,\r\n  \"amt\": 2400\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanging the assertion to this, will fix it but I'm not sure if this the expected behaviour or not. Because this is tested after calling [`wrapper.instance().handleBrushChange({ startIndex: 2, endIndex: 4 });`](https://github.com/kamthamc/recharts/blob/739ca2ea03eab84c931368b733f6c2c77feb1f88/test/specs/chart/LineChartSpec.js#L335)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexpect(newLineDots.childAt(0).props().payload).to.equal(data[0]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n What is missing here to merge this pull request? @xile611 any updates on this, tests are passing & seems like everything is good, no? @xile611 makes total sense, thanks! I agree. \r\nMaybe offtopic, but what else is blocking a 1.0.0? Also been testing this PR against an existing project with extensive `recharts` usage. No issues found \ud83d\udc4d  Any update @xile611, this is really the only thing blocking us to update to React 16 in our apps.

ResponsiveContainer is always 100% of the width of its container element. However the container element needs to have a fixed width or % of another container element which has well defined width. @howardya can you please explain with a sample code. That would be lil helpfull how about this http://jsfiddle.net/4zja5eo0/17/ ? \r\n\r\nThe div containing the <ResponsiveContainer> has 50% width. \r\n\r\nAlso this one http://jsfiddle.net/4zja5eo0/18/ @howardya both the code are working in fiddle but when i do it in my local system Charts are not displayed. No error in console too  Most likely is your parent element, or the parent of your parent element. \r\n\r\nOr there is no height defined.\r\n\r\nFor responsive to works, the parent container needs to have well defined height. \r\n\r\nTry debugging it by setting the parent element to have background-color: black then slowly work your way up the tree till it reaches the body or html tag. \r\n\r\nOr try some of the suggestions [here](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=css+with+percentage+not+working) http://jsfiddle.net/dqj2k8dc/ \r\nmy code is in this format \r\nresponsiveness is not happening @howardya  how about this http://jsfiddle.net/dqj2k8dc/1/\r\n\r\nyou need to have 100% in all the div container all the way up until either one of this:\r\n1. reach the html/body or\r\n2. reach a div container which explicitly has the width defined. This is working fine in fiddle but, not sure what is going wrong with me. \r\ni will start from scratch and try for solving the problem\r\nThanks @howardya  for ur help. @vikkya this solves your problem: https://css-tricks.com/NetMag/FluidWidthVideo/Article-FluidWidthVideo.php\r\n\r\nJust wrap your ResponsiveContainer with this below (the paddingBottom will define the proportion of your container (a square, a rectangle etc.):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div style={{\r\n  paddingBottom: '56.25%', /* 16:9 */\r\n  position: 'relative',\r\n  height: 0\r\n}} >\r\n  <div style={{\r\n    position: 'absolute',\r\n    top: '0',\r\n    left: '0',\r\n    width: '100%',\r\n    height: '100%'\r\n  }}>\r\n      <ResponsiveContainer>...</ResponsiveContainer>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```  Is it possible to mark a straight line on a bar chart?

Need help with the alignment too @botaifilip I have implemented this feature by overwriting Reference Line Label component. so, you can try it. @xile611 still doesn't work.\r\n@wewoor can I see what you did? same issue here @westoncolemanl @fengshuo \r\n\r\nThe below is my custom ReferenceLabel component. you can try it.\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nexport function ReferenceLabel(props) {\r\n    const { \r\n        fill, value, textAnchor, \r\n        fontSize, viewBox, dy, dx,\r\n    } = props;\r\n    const x = viewBox.width + viewBox.x + 20;\r\n    const y = viewBox.y - 6;\r\n    return (\r\n        <text \r\n            x={x} y={y}\r\n            dy={dy}\r\n            dx={dx}\r\n            fill={fill}\r\n            fontSize={fontSize || 10} \r\n            textAnchor={textAnchor}>\r\n            {value}\r\n        </text>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nuse it\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<ReferenceLine label={<ReferenceLabel  />} /> \r\n```\r\nhope it can help you. Is there a way to make it stick to left or right? \r\n\r\nBasically making it act as a tooltip, its position would be depending on \r\n1. where the reference is located in the chart\r\n2. the actual width of the label\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nalso, are PRs welcome?\r\nI can try implementing a `position: 'auto' ` > I can try implementing a position: 'auto'\r\n\r\nThat would be grand. I currently use vertical referencelines for annotation like: `Deploy x happened`, `Launch feature Y`, `Adwords campaign 1 started` to help us spot what caused trends. But if there are events close to each other they become unreadable.\r\n\r\nAutomatically shifting the labels vertically, or making them show only when hovering over the ReferenceLine would solve the problem for my use case, but I wouldn't know how to go about that.\r\n\r\nPS, much love for recharts! It's the most delightful graphing environment i've ever experienced and i've tried, well, all of them :) does anyone know how to influence positioning of the ReferenceLine?

Might be another issue to submit but maybe I'm missing how to use it?\r\n\r\n## What is the expected behavior?\r\n`<YAxis/>` should respect those props even if domain is set. \r\n\r\n## Which versions of Recharts, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of Recharts?\r\n1.0.0-alpha.2/Chrome and Safari. Unsure.\r\n I think I identified where the issue is. \r\n\r\nIt's in `getNiceTickValues.js` from `recharts-scale` library. \r\n\r\nThe following lines:\r\n```\r\ntickMin: Arithmetic.minus(middle, Arithmetic.multiply(belowCount, step)),\r\ntickMax: Arithmetic.sum(middle, Arithmetic.multiply(upCount, step))\r\n```\r\ndon't take into account of `allowDecimals` prop as far as I can tell, so we get integer steps but `tickMin` and `tickMax` may still be decimals. \r\n\r\nI suggest that `tickMin` and `tickMax` be converted to integers when `allowDecimals` is `true`, which should solve the decimal issue. I'll look into the `tickCount` issue soon. \r\n I just think there is a small mistake since the operations are made inside of strings.  \r\nHave you tried `domain={[dataMin - 0.5, dataMax + 0.5]}` ?   Yes, and the result is\r\n\r\n```\r\nUncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: dataMin is not defined\r\n``` Ok, well it seems like your problem is not related to recharts. Maybe you can show some code about this specific error for further help. How can you say that after I've basically narrowed down the cause in my first comment? Did you even try to replicate my bug with any test data? \r\n\r\nHere is a JSFiddle that clearly demonstrates the problem I am referring to in this issue:\r\n\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/x1yoboc7/829/ If you use numbers inside your array for the domain, it works perfectly [fine](http://jsfiddle.net/3v6ecrgc/). As soon as you put strings, it indeed causes a weird behaviour since the Y values are numbers. Maybe I am not understanding you well, let me know if this helps.  \r\n\r\nBy the way, to use variables like dataMin and dataMax, make sure those are actually numbers before passing them to the array and do not put them inside quotes as those will be interpreted as the actual strings \"dataMin\" and \"dataMax\". 1. You are incorrect. Recharts can support string based domains for `XAxis` and `YAxis`. The creator has stated it here: https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/123\r\n\r\n> XAxis and YAxis can support domain like ['dataMin - 100', 'dataMax + 50'].\r\n\r\n2. Have you actually read my issue? What you're proposing is literally what I did for my second workaround but if you read what i wrote you'd see that I still have issues with that. \r\n\r\n> As you can see, there are now decimal-less tick values but there are only 9 ticks, which is better than 8 from before but still not the 10 that we want.\r\n\r\nI understand variable assignment - was only doing it to show you that your suggestion didn't work.  I have run into this same bug when attempting to use strings with decimal values. @al3x-huang is correct about string usage here. \r\n\r\nHere is an example from the API docs: http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/YAxis\r\n```domainArrayoptional\r\nSpecify the domain of axis when the axis is a number axis. The length of domain should be 2, and we will validate the values in domain. And each element in the array can be a number, 'auto', 'dataMin', 'dataMax' or string like 'dataMin - 20', 'dataMax + 100'. If any element of domain is set to be 'auto', comprehensible scale ticks will be calculated, and the final domain of axis is generated by the ticks.\r\nDEFAULT: [0, 'auto']\r\nFORMAT:\r\n<YAxis type=\"number\" domain={['dataMin', 'dataMax']} />\r\n<YAxis type=\"number\" domain={[0, 'dataMax']} />\r\n<YAxis type=\"number\" domain={['auto', 'auto']} />\r\n<YAxis type=\"number\" domain={[0, 'dataMax + 1000']} />\r\n<YAxis type=\"number\" domain={['dataMin - 100', 'dataMax + 100']} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the API docs, you would expect `<YAxis type=\"number\" domain={['dataMin - 0.1', 'dataMax + 0.1']} />` to work. @al3x-huang It is indeed supported, my mistake, I thought it was a local variable you had defined. It is even in the API [documentation](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/YAxis) as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nSo, it is true that having a minimum value that is a decimal number would result in having decimal numbers as your ticks. Here is a temporary workaround : \r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nconst values = data.map(obj => { return obj.pv; });\r\nconst min = Math.min(...values);\r\nconst max = Math.max(...values);\r\n\r\nconst domain = [Math.floor(min / 100) * 100 - 100, Math.ceil(max / 100) * 100 + 100];\r\n```\r\nSorry for the misunderstanding. No problem, but this still doesn't solve the fact that it doesn't respect `tickCount` I'm getting a similar problem where tickCount is not respected when I set a custom domain on a 'number' type axis.  Here's my example:\r\n\r\n<XAxis tickCount={10} type=\"number\" domain={['dataMin', 'dataMax']} \r\n\r\nBut my chart only has 4 ticks showing. <YAxis dataKey={'data'} type=\"number\"  domain={[1000000,1141999]} /> ..yaxis not displaying when the datamin and datamax value is greater than 10 lakhs ..how to solve this...  Hi\r\n\r\nI did a npm update, but when webpack rebuilt my project appears this log below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in ./~/recharts/es6/util/ChartUtils.js\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'recharts-scale' in '.../node_modules/recharts/es6/util'\r\n```\r\nversion => 1.0.0-alpha.2\r\n  Hi,\r\n\r\nI am trying to make 9 box plot graph using scatter graph in react js. \r\nI want to fix the value of X and Y axis. for example the value of X axis labels should be 1.2, 2.8 , 4.4 , 6 and similarly form Y axis. I don't want to derive these value from any column.\r\nHow can we do that?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot. \r\n If by label you mean the axis ticks, here's how you can do it:  \r\n``` javascript\r\n<XAxis ticks={[1.2, 2.8, 4.4, 6]} />\r\n``` Hi @Amthieu \r\nThanks for your response.\r\nFor example lets take this example from there official website.\r\n\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/zdhvvt2e/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=zdhvvt2e\r\n\r\nIn this I was X axis to have these points 100,120,140,160,180. \r\nI tried using ticks but when i apply it the whole graph disappears.\r\n\r\nI know I am missing something. But don't know what.\r\n\r\nThanks once again :) The example is just missing `type=\"number\"` in order to display the ticks you want. You can also specify a domain to make it look better. Here is what I used for your values :  \r\n``` javascript\r\n<XAxis  \r\n    dataKey={'x'}  \r\n    name='stature'  \r\n    unit='cm'  \r\n    ticks={[100, 120, 140, 160, 180]}  \r\n    domain={[80, 200]}  \r\n    type=\"number\"  \r\n/>\r\n``` @Amthieu Thanks a lot :) It worked :D I'm using unit=\"U$\" and getting only values, without U$\r\n`<YAxis unit='U$'/>`\r\n\r\n I think it is important to note that you might have to set an interval between ticks when defining them as a fixed set.

Using this example on my app has the same affect, no labels. What should they look like? Same issue. Upgraded to latest and this occurred. Last tested version was 0.15.2 and labels were working. Had the same issue, reverted to 0.15.2 and labels work fine now. The jsfiddle official example doesn't seem to be updated  I need to be able to trigger a mouse event from the entire vertical bar of a Stacked Bar Chart.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, if you add `onMouseEnter` on on `<Bar ...` it triggers when you mouse over the corresponding colour on each bar (which makes sense), but isn't what I need.\r\n\r\nWhen you add a `<Tooltip ...` it is able to trigger when on a single bar, which is what I need, but i don't need the Recharts tooltip.  I need to be able to call a function that triggers state within my React component.  I've played around with trying to manipulate the `Tooltip` to do what I want, but I can't send down the `active` state (and the `label` which i was planning on using to differentiate between which bar was being hovered over) unless I sent it through the `Tooltips`'s `content` prop as a new component.  This doesn't work because you end up leaving the original component and therefor don't have access to its state.\r\n\r\n### My code:\r\n```\r\n        <BarChart\r\n          width={205}\r\n          height={275}\r\n          barCategoryGap=\"25%\"\r\n          data={graphData}\r\n          margin={{ top: 20, right: 15, left: 0, bottom: 5 }}\r\n        >\r\n          <XAxis\r\n            dataKey=\"name\"\r\n            tickLine={false}\r\n            tick={<XAxisTick />}\r\n            stroke={color.grey400}\r\n          />\r\n          <Bar\r\n            dataKey=\"project\"\r\n            stackId=\"a\"\r\n            fill={color.blueMedium}\r\n            isAnimationActive={false}\r\n            label={<BarLabel currency={currencySymbol} />}\r\n            onMouseEnter={this.handleShowDivA}\r\n            onMouseLeave={this.handleHideDivA}\r\n          />\r\n          <Bar\r\n            dataKey=\"reccuring\"\r\n            stackId=\"a\"\r\n            fill={color.blueDark}\r\n            isAnimationActive={false}\r\n            onMouseEnter={this.handleShowDivB}\r\n            onMouseLeave={this.handleHideDivB}\r\n          />\r\n        </BarChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What currently happens when using `onMouseEnter` etc:\r\n![current mouse events](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5469814/27778530-e846c1d6-5ffe-11e7-8cca-db59636d8c35.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What I need to happen:\r\n![desired mouse events](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5469814/27778548-0baa7ac8-5fff-11e7-8acd-72ac0768fdfc.jpg)\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how to do this?

You'll see in console that the console.log changes.  Now try hovering over each green portion of multiple bars, then hover over the purple portion of multiple bars.

Anyway, how would you get only the active bar on mouseover and change its style? @yuriploc did you check out my codesandbox.io?\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/n15x65pw4j @neu5 Yes, I checked your code, it's not useful for the problem I need to solve. The object is read-only and has no style attrs.\r\n\r\nThe solution I had was to use the `Cell` and vanilla JS. The problem is that the stacked bar renders the bottom bars, then it renders the top bars, and we can't access _a_ stack as an element. @yuriploc yup, unfortunately that's the way it's implemented.  Hi, \r\nFirst off, awesome project. Love how seamless and reusable the components are.\r\n\r\nI wanted to see if it was possible to shade _vertical_ sections of an area chart with different colors.

Any idea if this is possible? You would have to render each colour as a separate <Area/> inside <AreaChart/> @xile611 give me pls example, thx. Here's the example: http://recharts.org/api/#/en-US/api/AreaChart @jgentes is there a way to use gradient fill with pies? @jgentes got that working, using `fill={url(#colorPv)` props on `PieChart`.\r\nIt may be obvious, but not familiar with SVG so it took me some time.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nNext question, but unrelated to this thread: Is there a way to change the size of a pie cut?\r\nE.g: I want my pie to look like this \r\n![screen shot 2017-11-13 at 1 58 19 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5843816/32751417-ba51de84-c87a-11e7-9584-00c79ca1165a.png)\r\n\r\nwhen it currently look like this:\r\n![screen shot 2017-11-13 at 1 58 47 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5843816/32751444-c9b18c1c-c87a-11e7-8415-94286f0f3b98.png)\r\n I am curious about how you fixed the problem. Is here any example?  I would like to add my own custom tooltip ( popup which a list of links or icons, so a user can click on it to perform some actions).

My current implementation of the PieChart component works, but throws the following error in the console.\r\n\r\n> Failed prop type: The prop `dataKey` is marked as required in `Pie`, but its value is `undefined`.     in Pie (created by PieChartContainer)\r\n\r\nI've bumped my Recharts version to the latest build of Recharts 1.0.0.alpha.1 which allowed the Pie chart to render, but didn't suppress the error. \r\n\r\nIs this working as intended?\r\n\r\nSee a snippet of my implementation below...\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n        <PieChart onMouseEnter={this.onPieEnter}>\r\n              <Pie data={this.props.data} labelLine={false} label={renderCustomizedLabel} innerRadius={60} outerRadius={120} fill=\"#8884d8\">\r\n                { this.props.data.map((entry, index) => <Cell key={index} fill={this.COLORS[index % this.COLORS.length]}/>) }\r\n              </Pie>\r\n              <Tooltip/>\r\n              <Legend />\r\n            </PieChart>\r\n``` you should  add prop 'dataKey' in 'Pie' component.\r\n\r\nexample\r\n\r\n        <PieChart width={800} height={400} >\r\n          <Pie dataKey=\"value\" data={data} cx={250} cy={200} innerRadius={112} outerRadius={122} >\r\n            {\r\n              data.map((entry, index) => <Cell key={index} fill={COLORS[index % COLORS.length]}/>)\r\n            }\r\n          </Pie>\r\n          <Tooltip/>\r\n        </PieChart> This still doesn't work for me. The official documentation says to add `nameKey` and `valueKey` to the `Pie` component, but doing so has no effect. When I put my value data key under the `dataKey` prop it still does not render. Here's my code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst data = [{ name: 'Last 30', value: 2200 }, { name: 'Last 7', value: 977 }, { name: 'Today', value: 625 }]\r\n\r\n<PieChart height={250}>\r\n    <Pie data={data} cx=\"50%\" cy=\"50%\" outerRadius={50} fill=\"#6179b6\" dataKey=\"value\" />\r\n    <Tooltip />\r\n</PieChart>\r\n``` Please note that as of today, the Recharts website doesn't mention neither `dataKey` nor `nameKey`/`valueKey`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/820758/28491721-2c0d2562-6ef6-11e7-9d70-d7091c395637.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/820758/28491725-4bd5676a-6ef6-11e7-8152-846873df21d4.png)\r\n It looks like caused by the label `ResponsiveContainer` or `PieChart` is no height.\r\nI have a same problem, then I give a height ,it works.\r\nYour can have a try. @chuyinweilai That did fix my problem, thanks! @chrisjpatty could you tell me how to fix the problem, I met the same trouble\u3002 Thanks very much!\r\n`\r\nrender() {\r\n\r\n        return (\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"chart piechart\">\r\n\r\n                <PieChart width={800} height={400}>\r\n\r\n                    <Pie data={data01} cx={200} cy={200} outerRadius={60} fill=\"#8884d8\"/>\r\n\r\n                    <Pie data={data02} cx={200} cy={200} innerRadius={70} outerRadius={90} fill=\"#82ca9d\" label/>\r\n\r\n                </PieChart>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n        );\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16200931/29852451-b3582db6-8d6c-11e7-8670-d5d25621ee31.png)\r\n @xile611 \r\n\r\nadding prop 'dataKey'='value in 'Pie' component solved the problem, please update the following example. Thanks\r\n\r\nhttp://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomActiveShapePieChart  Following the example or recharts.org, I'm passing an array of objects to a LineChart component. This seems to work visually, but throws the following error in the console.\r\n`Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `data` of type `object` supplied to `LineChart`, expected an array.  `  \r\n\r\nIs this working as intended?\r\n Sorry, didn't understand the reply. I am facing the same error in console. What should I do to avoid this? @xnog The `data` property must be an array of objects, like shown in the examples:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst data = [\r\n      {name: 'Page A', uv: 4000, pv: 2400, amt: 2400},\r\n      {name: 'Page B', uv: 3000, pv: 1398, amt: 2210},\r\n      {name: 'Page C', uv: 2000, pv: 9800, amt: 2290},\r\n      {name: 'Page D', uv: 2780, pv: 3908, amt: 2000},\r\n      {name: 'Page E', uv: 1890, pv: 4800, amt: 2181},\r\n      {name: 'Page F', uv: 2390, pv: 3800, amt: 2500},\r\n      {name: 'Page G', uv: 3490, pv: 4300, amt: 2100},\r\n];\r\n...\r\n<BarChart width={600} height={300} data={data}>\r\n  ....\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck what type your `data` property is. It's a list, but i always get the error in the console and works. Maybe is something with Mobx. @xnog You need to invoke .slice() on the observable mobx array. Internally an observable array in mobx is actually an object - to get the raw array you should create a shallow copy by using .slice. \r\nSee [https://mobx.js.org/refguide/array.html#observable-arrays](https://mobx.js.org/refguide/array.html#observable-arrays)\r\n\r\n> Bear in mind however that Array.isArray(observable([])) will yield false, so whenever you need to pass an observable array to an external library, it is a good idea to create a shallow copy before passing it to other libraries or built-in functions (which is good practice anyway) by using array.slice(). In other words, Array.isArray(observable([]).slice()) will yield true. Just add a slice() call to your data as in:\r\n\r\ndata: {this.props.myData.myarray.slice()}    I have some JSON having 4474 objects contained within an array which looks like:\r\n\r\n ```\r\ndata: [\r\n  {\r\n    \"T\": \"2017-02-04 14:16:51\",\r\n    \"Min\": 0,\r\n    \"Max\": 0,\r\n    \"Average\": 0\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"T\": \"2017-03-27 14:51:23\",\r\n    \"Min\": 0,\r\n    \"Max\": 0,\r\n    \"Average\": 0\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"T\": \"2017-03-27 14:53:23\",\r\n    \"Min\": 0,\r\n    \"Max\": \"1,7\",\r\n    \"Average\": \"0,1\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"T\": \"2017-03-27 15:23:23\",\r\n    \"Min\": \"1,6\",\r\n    \"Max\": \"1,6\",\r\n    \"Average\": \"1,6\"\r\n  },\r\n............\r\n............4473,\r\n{\r\n    \"T\": \"2017-05-05 14:16:51\",\r\n    \"Min\": \"1,3\",\r\n    \"Max\": \"1,3\",\r\n    \"Average\": \"1,3\"\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am trying to drawa line chart with T as X axis and Max as Y axis.

I am encountering an odd error... \r\n\r\nI am currently using a bar chart.  I started out by setting the data to a test variable I created within the local file, and everything is working beautifully.  However, I updated the test variable to a state variable that I set using getInfo() so I can use real data from my database.  \r\n\r\nAt this point, the chart still \"renders\" in that when I mouseover, I can still see the tooltip which shows that the correct data is being used.  However, the actual bars themselves in the bar chart are no longer rendering (so I was basically mousing over blank space to see the tool tips).

From the tooltip, you can also confirm that it is using the correct data and the correct number of bars, except the bars themselves (and the y-axis numbers) are not visible.  \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-05-31 at 4 57 21 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9296896/26667934/576a3924-465c-11e7-8477-4ccf2da85465.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-05-31 at 11 54 18 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9296896/26667970/830c3f28-465c-11e7-83dc-2205e83a7b01.png)\r\n  ## request a feature\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nI am making a chart with neither XAxis nor YAxis. The chart displays Y domain as [0, max]. Since the differences between values are small the chart looks like it was almost a straight line. I would like to be able to change the Y domain, but the only way to do it is to add YAxis, which completely destroys my layout. I have overcame this problem by subtracting the minimal value from all the values, but it is too cumbersome.

Came across this same issue and this PR fixes it. Please merge it. @xile611 Just tested with recharts@1.0.0.alpha-4 and the problem gone. It's weird because as I said in the first comment, I checked with Lodash's docs and apparently it's possible to pass a single function into `sortBy()`. Lodash's version at that time was 4.17.4 and it seems there is no newer version since then. Seems to be fine now  Current behaviour: When defining multiple data sets for a ScatterChart, all of them share the same x-axis and y-axis.\r\n\r\nFeature request:  I need to be able to define multiple y-axes. Each data set should have its own y-axis. All the y-axes should appear at the left-hand side of the chart. Each y-axis should be drawn in the colour of the dataset (the same as scatterProps.fill). The x-axis should be shared by all the datasets.\r\n  This is a feature request\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the charts had a zoom and pan feature (per axis).\r\nIf there is a way to achieve this, please let me know.

The goal being that we could do things like change fill values when one of the synced charts has an active tooltip. Only way I can think to achieve this currently would be to hack it together by abusing custom tooltips.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? Any chance there's just something I'm missing?\r\n @xile611 Thanks for the response! Yeah, I've got the charts synced and everything's working, so the issue isn't getting sync functionality working, it's getting access to the active label at the `Bar` component level.\r\n\r\nLooks like things have been refactored a bit since I tried to dig into this a few days ago, but the tl;dr is I was hoping there was something I was missing about getting access to `activePayload` without setting up a `onMouseMove` handler. I ended up getting halfway to what I want by setting up the mouse event handlers in a stateful component that wraps `BarChart`, but that doesn't allow me to show an active state on the `Bar` component when the `LineChart` above has an active tooltip.\r\n\r\nSetting up the mouse events on a higher level component that wraps both charts felt reasonable, but then you get in the catch-22 of setting state and causing a re-render that stops the tooltip itself from being rendered.\r\n\r\nIf this kind of functionality isn't anywhere on the roadmap just let me know, I can see what I can do about a PR in the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nEdit: For clarity, while I think having access to the active tooltip payload at the `shape` level would be useful for other things, essentially what would completely solve my current problem would be the equivalent of `activeDot` for a `Bar`.  There seems to be a bug around updating bar components that are added dynamically. \r\n\r\nFailing example: (notice that we have to update the data in state in order to see the new color state)\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/9x9cnfpr/3/\r\n\r\nWorkaround example: (here I added an extra <Bar/> component that isn't generated by a .map function)\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/5gy5oaru/2/\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I can help. Great project btw! I've been enjoying using it.\r\n\r\n**Update**: I've found that removing everything but the Bar components from within the BarChart component allows for the fill of the bars to be changed. Here's an example:\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/eceh1hyj/1/\r\n\r\n@xile611 - any ideas on this?  Hi, i need pass payload data in Cursor Rectangle to use it in cursor onMouseOver handler. Thx for awesome lib!  is it possible to get data when click the line and area chart just like when click the bar chart? +1 A simple event API would let us extend the core components to access the chart's model. For instance, I have an elevation map using the Area chart. I'd like to update my UI with a point object containing lat / lons as the mouse travels across the series. \r\n\r\nAnyway, it would be useful to make data available in this way.  Currently it's not possible for me to view a single bar in my barchart, since the loop that decides the bandSize can't handle when the ticks array has only one element. BandSize is returned as 0, and that means the bar has 0 width.\r\n\r\nMy fix for this was to take the axis width if there is only 1 tick in the array. I'm not certain if this is the best way to fix this, but I didn't see any other issues about trying to view a single bar in a bar chart, so I assumed this was an edge case.

The code is as follows:\r\n\r\n     <PieChart width={410} height={410}>\r\n                                <Pie\r\n                                  data={pieData} \r\n                                  cx=\"50%\" \r\n                                  cy=\"50%\" \r\n                                  innerRadius=\"72%\"\r\n                                  outerRadius=\"80%\"\r\n                                  /*fill=\"darkBlack\"*/\r\n                                  paddingAngle={3}\r\n                                >\r\n                                  {\r\n                                    pieData.map((entry, index) => <Cell fill={COLORS[index % COLORS.length]}/>)\r\n                                  }\r\n                                </Pie>\r\n                                <Tooltip/>\r\n                              </PieChart>\r\n\r\nIf I don't specify a width or height for the pie chart, it does not render.  And if I add a responsive container, whether with or without the height and width properties, the pie chart also does not display.  Do you know what the problem is and how to fix?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n Also, should PieChart still display with a default height and width if we remove those properties?  Currently, it doesn't seem to...\r\n@xile611  @xile611 \r\nI tried to make this pie chart responsive (http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomActiveShapePieChart) and it doesn't work. Demo available at http://jsfiddle.net/o7rtavcg/1/. \r\n\r\nIf you change the width to 300px, it cuts the chart in half. In case of 400px, it doesn't display the chart entirely. @giokokos In the case of pie charts, look at the `cx` and `cy` props for the `Pie` component. These are the coordinates for the center of the pie, so make sure that you either (1) remove them entirely to make the pie position center or (2) explicitly place the pie graph into a coordinate that shows when the width is cut off.\r\n\r\nCheck this [JS fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/o7rtavcg/4/). I removed the `cx` and `cy` props and it renders in the middle. I also moved the `width` and `height` props to the `ReponsiveContainer` component and made the width 100% to respond to the parent container. @christiancho this [JS fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/o7rtavcg/4/) reports an error (Bad JSFiddle configuration, please fork the original React JSFiddle): is it just me?   ## Do you want to request a feature or report a bug?\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\n## If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: http://jsfiddle.net/9y45ut13/).\r\n\r\n## What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\n## Which versions of Recharts, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

Hi, I have been used Recharts for couples of weeks, and i do think it's a really good library for me. Today my boss give me a requirement to display the relationship of some things just like [this](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045)(a node graph). But Recharts dosen't support graph now.\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7600149/25602464/d087663a-2f26-11e7-911d-076d8f4268dc.png)\r\n\r\n  How can I get started to encapsulate d3 like Recharts?  I can't get any info from the online document.\r\nOr maybe all I need is just read the code of Recharts? :)\r\n Or I should use d3 alone?\r\n @xiaosansiji \r\nAny plan about adding relationship chart to this library? :) @CrisLi \r\n I used d3 and react alone to render force map just like [this](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/blob/master/examples/force-directed-graph/force-directed-graph.js) .You still can use recharts components such as ResponsiveContainer.  \r\n Or you can use this [libray](https://github.com/xswei/d3js_doc/tree/master/API/d3-force-master). \r\n Recharts focus on common needs, topological graph isn't in their plans as far as I know.  @xile611  as per  your fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Luk2xapk/1/ this worked but i  had few other requirement so had to add a onClick as well on Legend so i added onClick and i was overriding the .recharts-legend-item CSS for having a border-radius in my legend now after the JsFiddle integration it looks like only Content is working and my onClick doesn't work and it overides my css as well \r\n\r\ncomplete code here \r\n\r\nconst {LineChart, Line, Symbols, Surface, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend} = Recharts;\r\nconst { OverlayTrigger,  Tooltip: BootstrapTooltip, Popover } = ReactBootstrap;\r\n\r\nconst data = [\r\n      {name: 'Page A', uv: 4000, pv: 2400, amt: 2400},\r\n      {name: 'Page B', uv: 3000, pv: 1398, amt: 2210},\r\n      {name: 'Page C', uv: 2000, pv: 9800, amt: 2290},\r\n      {name: 'Page D', uv: 2780, pv: 3908, amt: 2000},\r\n      {name: 'Page E', uv: 1890, pv: 4800, amt: 2181},\r\n      {name: 'Page F', uv: 2390, pv: 3800, amt: 2500},\r\n      {name: 'Page G', uv: 3490, pv: 4300, amt: 2100},\r\n];\r\nconst SimpleLineChart = React.createClass({\r\n\r\n  handleClick(e){\r\n   alert(\"alert comes here \");\r\n  },\r\n  \r\n  renderPopoverTop(dataKey) {\r\n  \treturn (\r\n    \t<Popover id={`popover-${dataKey}`} title={`${dataKey} popover`}>\r\n        <strong>{dataKey}</strong> info here.\r\n      </Popover>\r\n    );\r\n  },\r\n  \r\n  renderCusomizedLegend(props) {\r\n  \tconst { payload } = props;\r\n    \r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"customized-legend\">\r\n       {\r\n       \t\tpayload.map((entry, index) => {\r\n            const { dataKey, color } = entry;\r\n            const url = dataKey === 'pv' ?\r\n             '//jsfiddle.net/img/logo@2x.png':\r\n             '//avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9164357?v=3&s=60';\r\n             \r\n           \r\n            return (\r\n            \t<OverlayTrigger \r\n              \tkey={`overlay-${dataKey}`} \r\n                trigger=\"hover\" \r\n                placement=\"top\" \r\n                overlay={this.renderPopoverTop(dataKey)}\r\n              >\r\n                 <span className=\"legend-item\">\r\n                 \t <Surface width={10} height={10} viewBox=\"0 0 10 10\">\r\n                 \t   <Symbols cx={5} cy={5} type=\"square\" size={100} fill={color} />\r\n                   </Surface>\r\n                   <span>{dataKey}</span>\r\n                 </span>\r\n              </OverlayTrigger>\r\n            );\r\n          })\r\n       }\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  },\r\n\r\n\trender () {\r\n  \treturn (\r\n      <div className=\"main-legend-style\">\r\n        <LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data}\r\n              margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\r\n         <XAxis dataKey=\"name\"/>\r\n         <YAxis/>\r\n         <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\r\n         <Tooltip/>\r\n         <Legend content={this.renderCusomizedLegend} onClick={this.handleClick} />\r\n         <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" activeDot={{r: 8}}/>\r\n         <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" />\r\n        </LineChart>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  <SimpleLineChart />,\r\n  document.getElementById('container')\r\n);\r\n\r\n\r\n css code  here for overriding  .recharts-legend-item \r\n\r\n.main-legend-style .recharts-legend-item {\r\n  border: 2px solid #a1a1a1;\r\n  padding: 6px 11px;\r\n  font-size: small;\r\n  border-radius: 146px;\r\n  margin: -6px;\r\n  margin-bottom: -13px;\r\n}\r\n\r\nplease help me to fix this what am i doing wrong here,  the onClick is not firing and CSS is not getting a border-radius after overriding , both were working fine before this came <Legend content={this.renderCusomizedLegend} />  \r\n\r\nthanks :)\r\n\r\n   How did you solved.. ? pls share @NischithBopaiah \r\n I'm running into the same issue, I would appreciate it if you shared your solution to this problem\r\n\r\nEDIT: Managed to get it to work by moving onClick to the method where I am rendering custom content.

Axes are properly set to use categories and numbers respectively, but the first bar is missing. Same problem here, created jsfiddle which reproducing the problem http://jsfiddle.net/ptev9np1/  Is it possible to omit the first (or last) tick label on an axis? The tick should remain and all else should be the same, just without rendering the label itself?

Is this possible? No, I mean between the X-axis data points (i.e. no gap between the bars in Page A, Page B, ... in your example). Yep, that works. I'm almost certain I had already tried that and didn't get the result I was looking for, but I must have missed it.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly not an example of poor API translation. barCategoryGap definitely makes sense (which is why I thought I had tried it), but I'm happy to help if I can.  #### I used websocket to dynamically update state, and now the curve has changed, but the value on the axis is unchanged\r\n\r\n#### I want the chart to show changes with the state changes, is there any way?\r\n\r\n#### version: 0.22.3\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport { ComposedChart, Line, Area, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts';\r\n\r\nexport default class extends Component {\r\n  static defaultProps = {\r\n    chartData: [],\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  state = {\r\n    chartData: this.props.chartData,\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentWillReceiveProps({ chartData }) {\r\n    if (this.props.chartData !== chartData) {\r\n      this.setState({ chartData });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { chartData } = this.state;\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {\r\n          chartData.length ? <ResponsiveContainer height={250} >\r\n            <ComposedChart data={chartData} margin={{ top: 0, right: -15, left: -8, bottom: 0 }} >\r\n              <XAxis dataKey=\"Name\" />\r\n              <YAxis yAxisId=\"left\" orientation=\"left\" />\r\n              <YAxis yAxisId=\"right\" orientation=\"right\" />\r\n              <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" />\r\n              <Tooltip />\r\n              <Legend />\r\n              <Area yAxisId='left' type='monotone'  dataKey='TotalCount' fill={'#00BCD4'} stroke={'#00BCD4'}  />\r\n              <Line yAxisId='right' type='monotone'  dataKey='AverageElapsed' stroke={'#00E676'} unit='ms' />\r\n              <Bar yAxisId='right' type='monotone'  dataKey='TotalErrors' fill={'#F44336'}  />\r\n            </ComposedChart>\r\n          </ResponsiveContainer> : <div className='chart-empty'>empty</div>\r\n        }\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n http://jsfiddle.net/f07jao0m/4/\r\nI'm sorry, I know the reason, can not directly operate state.\r\nBut can not open the animation when you update it? **Version: 1.0.0-alpha.2**\r\nI don't know if this is the right place to ask but I'm too facing a similar problem.

I'm having exactly the same issue as Rud156, tooltip gets update but chart doesn't, the only way I was able to fix this was by setting the data in my state as [] and then updating it again with the new state. @rubensbarreto How to then updating it again with the new state ? Please describe in detail, I also encountered this problem. Hey @sanshuiwang , just clear all the data on the state, before setting the state again:\r\n\r\n```\r\nasync getData() {\r\n    let min=0;  \r\n    let max=100;  \r\n    let generatedData=[];  \r\n    let index=0;  \r\n    let cycle=0;  \r\n    let oldGeneratedData=this.state.dashboardData;  \r\n    await this.setState({. \r\n      dashboardData: generatedData //Clear data with empty array, this forces recharts to evaluate a redraw. \r\n    });  \r\n   //get generatedData from backend. \r\n   await this.setState({. \r\n      dashboardData: generatedData,  \r\n      cycle: cycle. \r\n    }). \r\n    console.log(generatedData);  \r\n    return;  \r\n  }\r\n```\r\n  \r\n\r\n @rubensbarreto  So ? How to set new state? The code only to clear.  Notice that I set state twice, the first time i'm clearing the array, the second time im setting with the data i got from the backend, I commented out the section i'm getting my data from the backend since it doesn't matter here.\r\n\r\nJust remember to use await, so that Reacts waits for the first setState to finish. The problem for me was that the API returned the numbers in a string format which confused Recharts.  ## Do you want to request a feature or report a bug?\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\n## If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: http://jsfiddle.net/9y45ut13/).\r\n\r\n## What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\n## Which versions of Recharts, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

In recharts package.json i see this...\r\n\r\n\"peerDependencies\": {\r\n    \"react\": \"^0.14.0 || ^15.0.0\",\r\n    \"react-addons-transition-group\": \"^0.14.0 || ^15.0.0\"\r\n},\r\n\r\nIt means that every time i run my assembly. I will get npm ERR! Is it possible to do something about this?\r\n  I would like to apply a different color for one or more bars (i.e. if a specific bar is an anomaly).  Since the property only accepts a string, it will only allow for one color for the entire series.  Extending the fill property to allow for either a function, array, or a string, would enable (at least I think after looking at the code) the property to change based on the data.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nChris  @xile611 Thanks.  I looked for a solution, I guess I missed it.  Sorry to open a useless issue.  Hello, I am looking for a way to place a polygon on a ScatterChart at the CartesianGrid level. Is there a way to achieve this behavior? Ultimately, I am looking for the ability to create Area-like behavior on the ScatterChart since there is not a way to use the ComposedChart with an AreaChart and a ScatterChart so this seemed like the best way to go.\r\n  ## Do you want to request a feature or report a bug?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nNot Supported.\r\n\r\n## What is the expected behavior?\r\nA chart that display dots of different proportions through a timeline, where the scales represents multiples values of an index.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4905837/25354621/01595bf6-290a-11e7-89cb-391a526f0046.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Currently if there's no data, the chart will not display, can we display something like there's no data, to let user know?\r\n\r\nEspecially for line chart, can we still keeps XAxis & YAxis with empty content but some word in the center of the chart showing no data available?  ## Do you want to request a feature or report a bug?\r\ni am using  Line chart for my project where i want my functionality to be like , when i click on the legend i want it to show a tool tip   i.e like giving a small hint information about the legend (static information to be shown )\r\nwhich i am unable to find can you please help me with this like how to proceed. can you please have a look at this code and tell me \r\n\r\nclass Line extends React.Component {\r\n\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props)\r\n    this.state = {\r\n     data: []  \r\n     }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentWillMount() {\r\n    this.setState({\r\n      data: [\r\n\r\n      {name: 'Page A', uv: 4000, pv: 2400, amt: 2400},\r\n      {name: 'Page B', uv: 3000, pv: 1398, amt: 2210},\r\n      {name: 'Page C', uv: 2000, pv: 9800, amt: 2290},\r\n      {name: 'Page D', uv: 2780, pv: 3908, amt: 2000},\r\n      {name: 'Page E', uv: 1890, pv: 4800, amt: 2181},\r\n      {name: 'Page F', uv: 2390, pv: 3800, amt: 2500},\r\n      {name: 'Page G', uv: 3490, pv: 4300, amt: 2100},\r\n      ]\r\n})\r\n}\r\n  \r\n  render() {\r\n    \r\n  return (\r\n\r\n     \r\n        <LineChart\r\n          width={this.state.width} height={400} data={600}\r\n          margin={{ top: 45, right: 30, left: 50, bottom: 5 }}\r\n        >\r\n          <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" tickLine={false} />\r\n          <YAxis type=\"number\" domain={[\"dataMax\"]} mirror tickCount={1} />\r\n          <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" />\r\n          <Legend\r\n            iconType=\"circle\"\r\n            wrapperStyle={{ top: 280 }}\r\n            \r\n          />\r\n          <Line dataKey=\"name\" stroke=\"#1e90ff\" dot={false} />\r\n          <Line dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#FF0000\" dot={false} />\r\n          <Line dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#eedd82\" dot={false} />\r\n          <Line dataKey=\"amt\" stroke=\"#7fffd4\" name=\"amt\" dot={false} />\r\n          </LineChart>\r\n        )\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n> \r\n\r\n> `}`\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\ni need something like this  just have taken a random image here  \"setting\"  name , uv , pv , amt to be my actual legends  and onclick i need a tooltip to show a message same follows for others.. \r\n![legend](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9164357/25385782/b7c76efe-29e2-11e7-9e55-191c23e35678.jpg) i don't want to customize my legend icon as you doing it here http://jsfiddle.net/Luk2xapk/ , all i need is to have the legend icon as it is  and when i Click on the legend a Tooltip to show as it is being displayed in the above pic i posted that's exactly what i am looking for ? can you help me with that ... thanks for your time  \ud83d\udc4d  after little  research i did  came to know modifying this file code  **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recharts/recharts/master/src/component/DefaultLegendContent.js** and using in my project as a  component will do the job so please help me with the modification needed  @xile611  thanks \ud83d\udc4d   Hi,\r\nIs there a way to get something like classic javascript event.pageX/pageY ?\r\nWhen handling onClick event in bar chart im getting only x,y inside bar\r\n\r\nthx in advance\r\n\r\n Thx a lot .

It's hard to hover over individual lines, because they're super thin. I want them to look thin, but I want to have some \"slop\" around them. Is there some way to add a hover \"slop\" to a line? I could imagine putting a fatter line behind it and hovering, or adding transparent stuff to the edges of the line, but I'd have to hack against the library to do it I think.\r\n2. Dots don't trigger hover events on lines, even though they're part of the line. I don't see anything in the API that has a `onDotHover` or anything similar. How can I capture dot hovers?\r\n\r\n## Which versions of Recharts, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of Recharts?\r\nAll\r\n\r\nThanks!  I am trying to build a stacked bar chart that is laid out vertically and can hold many data series that have just one data point each. Basically, it will be just one single horizontal bar containing different segments for each series. I want to have a label on `top` of each segment. \r\n\r\nHere's what I got:\r\n```javascript\r\n<BarChart className=\"segmented-barchart\" data={data} maxBarSize={30}  layout=\"vertical\">\r\n    <XAxis hide type=\"number\" domain={[0, maxTotal]} />\r\n    <YAxis hide type=\"category\" />\r\n    <Tooltip/>\r\n    <Legend />\r\n    { \r\n        someKeys(data).map( \r\n          keyName => <Bar unit=\" countries\" key={keyName} dataKey={keyName} stackId=\"single-stack\" label={{fill: '#000'}} fill={ makeFill(keyName, colorDict) } />\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n</BarChart>\r\n```\r\n![bildschirmfoto 2017-04-22 um 04 05 11 nachm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5918060/25305103/8edbbe38-2775-11e7-9817-0b361c8cf988.JPG)\r\n\r\nThere are 2 problems with it like you can see:\r\n1. The labels appear at the right end of each bar to which they belong, making the label appear on top of the bar belonging to the next series\r\n2. The numbers inside those labels are accumulative numbers, not the numbers of the series itself\r\n\r\nThe Tooltip shows the correct numbers:\r\n![bildschirmfoto 2017-04-21 um 03 15 25 nachm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5918060/25305093/50442aac-2775-11e7-83ed-1273eca587a3.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the bar chart without the stacking renders correctly too:\r\n![bildschirmfoto 2017-04-21 um 03 17 38 nachm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5918060/25305088/33908a36-2775-11e7-82b8-4efd984bdab6.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for any hints!  Currently, all of Lodash is imported as a dependency. This results in a somewhat large bundle size (relative to the rest of the package), which is not desirable. I'm wondering if the package maintainers have considered instead importing only the lodash functions that are used, instead of the whole thing? I haven't looked at the whole repo but from what I saw it seemed like it was mostly a small subset of functions being used.\r\n\r\nIf this is desireable, I would be glad to look into this further and start a branch and make a pull request. Gotcha, might be something wrong with my build then, thanks! Could you reconsider using separate lodash packages like `lodash.sortBy` instead of defining whole lodash as a dependency? @xile611 But when I compile my code using webpack with recharts in it, I get the entire lodash library. I can make a PR for this if you want. @xile611  :)  Getting a new error:\r\n```\r\nRecharts.js:139 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'string' of undefined\r\n    at Object.__webpack_exports__.b (Recharts.js:139)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (Recharts.js:30)\r\n    at Object.RADIAN (Recharts.js:1705)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (Recharts.js:30)\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (Recharts.js:7097)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (Recharts.js:30)\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (Recharts.js:33116)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (Recharts.js:30)\r\n    at module.exports (Recharts.js:76)\r\n    at Recharts.js:79\r\n```\r\nDowngrading to 0.22.0 fixes this. `15.4.1` I've noticed a couple of jsfiddles are broken too with the same error using 0.22.3.\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/fvcc6m14/\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/nickstanish/zrhudh0f/4/\r\n\r\nI found those links on different tickets.

I want to normalize these data to percentages so when i have different Bars in BarChart all would have same sizes visually. Then max value on all Bars would be 100(%) but after hover it would show real values (e.g 200 and 300).\r\nIs there some way to do this without hacking into library ?  I just started using the new error-bar feature (thanks for that!) and the error bar's often crosses the x-axis domain max:\r\n<img width=\"923\" alt=\"errorbarsoutofdomain\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/148472/25090292/a3f1fc66-2382-11e7-8013-567cabbfd9bc.png\">\r\n\r\nWhile i can easily fix that by setting the x-axis domain with a manual calculated dataMax, it just looks not a nice as if the auto would have respected the error-bar max! Thanks a lot!  I need a custom \"y axis\" from 130 to 200.  Where 130 is the base line.\r\nHow can I do that?\r\n\r\n**Each line are independent of yAxis values. yAxis is only for representation purpose.**\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst yAxisProps = {\r\n      name:\"Height\",\r\n      unit:\"cm\",\r\n      allowDataOverflow: true,\r\n      mirror: false,\r\n      reversed: true,\r\n      label:\"Height\",\r\n      domain: ['dataMin', 'dataMax'],\r\n      interval: \"preserveStart\",\r\n      ticks: [130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 200]\r\n    };\r\n\r\n<LineChart width={750} height={550} data={this.data()}\r\n          margin={{ top: 15, right: 20, left: 20, bottom: 15 }}>\r\n          <XAxis {...xAxisProps} />\r\n          <YAxis {...yAxisProps} />\r\n          {/*<CartesianGrid />*/}\r\n          {/*<CartesianAxis />*/}\r\n          <Tooltip />\r\n          <Legend />\r\n          <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"d\" stroke=\"#FF0403\" />\r\n          <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"c\" stroke=\"#E8760F\" />\r\n          <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"b\" stroke=\"#AA29E8\" />\r\n          <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"a\" stroke=\"#5D7DFF\" />\r\n   </LineChart>\r\n``` @xile611 Thanks.\r\n\r\nYes, it works.

Did this work in previous versions of Recharts?\r\ncurrent\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is something specific to recharts or just an npm issue. I have never encountered it with other npm libraries so I am assuming this is recharts specific. If it's not rechart specific, is there a general recommended workaround other than manually installing the dependencies (it's a pain for my automated deployment process)\r\n  I have been trying to modify the margin or location of the brush when using a line chart with no success. Right now it slightly overlaps the x axis  tick (labels).\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of how I am using the brush.  I have also tried with margin as well and to no avail. It appears that all the props for positioning of the brush are being rewritten in   LineChart  or some other component.  \r\n```\r\n\r\n        <LineChart width={600} height={200} data={data} syncId=\"anyId\"   margin={{top: 5, right: 10, left: 0, bottom: 10}}>\r\n          <XAxis stroke=\"#00b4cd\"  tick={<AxisLabel angle={-90}/>}  dataKey=\"minV\" />\r\n          <YAxis stroke=\"#00b4cd\"  tick={<AxisLabel angle={  0}/>}/>\r\n          <Tooltip  content={<Toolip/>} />\r\n          <Line type='monotone' dataKey='minV' stroke='#82ca9d' dot={false} fill='#82ca9d' />\r\n         <Brush y={250}/>    \r\n        </LineChart>\r\n```  The documentation does not make it clear how the data source is specified. For example, what is the format of the `data` props? Specifically, I want to have a chart with a line along with *some* dots along it. The dots are not continuously on their x coordinates.

I was working on a dashboard which i am making using React.\r\nI used Rechart to show the data on graph. Now my problem is that i am not able to centrally align (horizontal) the chart using any of the CSS property. I tried margin: auto; text-align:  center nothing worked. I know this is supposed to be very basic but would love your help here.\r\n Hi Xile,\r\nIt worked. Thanks a top. though i would like to understand that declaring the class name as \".rechartswrapper\" did not work but \".recharts-wrapper\" worked with the same css property. Am i missing something. Also, there seems to be a left margin which is pre assigned (Meaning, when i centred the chart as you suggusted, its not centered exactly but slightly toward the right). Can i prevent this from happening? use `http://recharts.org/#/zh-CN/api/ResponsiveContainer` also can auto centre align  const React =require(\"react\");\r\nconst {LineChart, Line, CartesianGrid, YAxis, XAxis, Tooltip,Legend} =require(\"recharts\");\r\nconst demo = require('../../../resources/demo-util');\r\n\r\nconst data = [];\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < json.length; i++)\r\n{\r\n    var mtrcs = json[i];\r\n\r\n    var mtrName=mtrcs.name;\r\n    var mtrMemory=mtrcs.metrics.memory;\r\n    var mtrCpu=mtrcs.metrics.cpu;\r\n    var mtrTime=mtrcs.metrics.time;\r\n\r\n   data.push({\r\n\r\n        name:mtrName,\r\n        cpu:mtrCpu,\r\n        memory : mtrMemory,\r\n        time:mtrTime\r\n\r\n    });\r\n\r\n}\r\nclass Rechart extends React.Component{\r\n\r\n    render(){\r\n\r\n\r\n        return(\r\n\r\n          <div>\r\n              <LineChart width={1300} height={400} data={data} margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\r\n                  <XAxis dataKey=\"time\"/>\r\n                  <YAxis/>\r\n                  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\r\n                  <Tooltip/>\r\n                  <Legend />\r\n                  <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"cpu\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" activeDot={{r: 8}}/>\r\n                  <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"memory\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" />\r\n              </LineChart>\r\n          </div>\r\n      );\r\n\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nmodule.exports=Rechart;\r\n  I also have this problem, with versions v1.0.0-alpha.2 and v0.22.4.\r\n\r\nThe issue is not that we want only dots, it is that only dots are appearing, even though the stroke property is set.

If anyone else has the issue described above, diagnose by setting `connectNulls={true}`, and if this allows your lines to appear, you may have an issue similar to what I've described above.   Fixes: #581 \r\n\r\n[index as a key is an anti-pattern](https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318)\r\n\r\nIf you add new children to a chart it will compute the key based on the index of that element.\r\n\r\nA problem comes up when you add a new child to the beginning of the children array.  This will bump the other indexes forward and cause a re-render if the key has changed.\r\n\r\nThe fix I propose is to use children keys if present so a user can specify their own.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a more robust solution would be to use something like `child.props.dataKey` as the default.\r\n`key: child.key || child.props.dataKey`  I'm wondering if it's possible to display a vertical list of Legend items on the right of a graph. I have a LineChart with a custom Legend, but it seems the only position the Legend (wrapper) can take now is top or bottom. I've checked all examples and they confirm this notion.\r\n\r\nI can achieve my goal with ugly css positioning or other suboptimal ways, but isn't there a proper way of doing this? for those that cut and paste, there is a typo.  change vetical to vertical . :)  ## Do you want to request a feature or report a bug?\r\n\r\nFeature Request\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nToday there is no way to have a tooltip show for a reference line. The label for a reference line can only show a small amount of information because it is easily occluded by other data on the chart. I would like to show a longer string when the user user hovers over the reference line.\r\n\r\n\r\n @xile611 There is no Tooltip support for ReferenceLine, ReferenceDot, or ReferenceArea components. Your answer to the above question is not helpful - will this be supported in the future or am I misreading the docs? @SalilUCSF , you are correct, there is no Tooltip support for ReferenceLine, ReferenceDot, or ReferenceArea components @xile611 @abhatia-lix I have opened an issue for this: #1512   const data = [];\r\n        for (var i = 0; i < json.length; i++)\r\n        {\r\n            var mtrcs = json[i];\r\n\r\n            var mtrName=mtrcs.name;\r\n            var mtrMemory=mtrcs.metrics.memory;\r\n            var mtrCpu=mtrcs.metrics.cpu;\r\n\r\n\r\n            data.push({\r\n\r\n                \"name\":mtrName,\r\n                \"cpu\":mtrCpu,\r\n                \"memory\" : mtrMemory,\r\n            });\r\n\r\n        }\r\n        return(\r\n\r\n          <div>\r\n              <LineChart width={1300} height={400} data={data} margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\r\n                  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" tickFormatter={dateFormat}/>\r\n                  <YAxis/>\r\n                  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\r\n                  <Tooltip/>\r\n                  <Legend />\r\n                  <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"cpu\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" activeDot={{r: 8}}/>\r\n                  <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"memory\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" />\r\n              </LineChart>\r\n          </div>\r\n      );\r\n\r\n\r\n    }\r\n} This doesn't work as written. dateFormat is not defined - you've closed the issue prematurely @patientplatypus dateFormat in the example above is a function that you are required to define yourself.\r\n\r\n`tickFormatter` takes a `function` that is intended to format the ticks however you would like. I realize that - the question was \"How do I display the XAxis in dateFormat?\". Saying, \"yes, indeed you do define a date format function yourself\" is not answering the question of how to get date ticks on to a time series graph. From what I can tell this is actually a very difficult problem in this library and there is not very good documentation or examples that I could find. It was in fact the reason that I switched to another application.  I am overriding Recharts' Tooltip functionality to provide the hover data elsewhere on the page (in another component).\r\n\r\n`<Tooltip content={ this.showTooltipData.bind(this) } />`\r\n\r\nshowToolTipData fires off an action creator which modifies a part of the state tree which the current render method is **not** sensitive to, but I still get the dreaded anti-pattern warning:\r\n\r\n`Warning: setState(...): Cannot update during an existing state transition (such as within `render` or another component's constructor). Render methods should be a pure function of props and state; constructor side-effects are an anti-pattern, but can be moved to `componentWillMount`.\r\n`\r\n\r\nThis warning is both correct and incorrect, as the rendering component is not affected by the state change. The only reason I care about this is that the warning can spam the console (there are 10s of 1000s of points to hover over). \r\n\r\nIs there a better way to do this? I have considered using the the target hover data component's \"private\" state (as opposed to the redux state now in use) but I need that data elsewhere as well. Moving the functionality to **componentWillMount()** is impossible.\r\n\r\nAnyone found a safer way to override the ToolTip function? \r\n\r\nrecharts@0.21.2, Chrome 56.0.2924.87 (64-bit)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJohn I tried the same thing -- it's very tempting to use the tooltip as an \"event\" that changes some state -- I also tried using setTimeout to get past the React error....but the bottom-line is that whenever you change state the chart re-draws itself ( including its little animations, and excluding tool-tips ), so it's a Catch-22... In this project the charts can have many points (10s of 1000s, may scale up higher). The re-draw action was painful and almost forced me to move to a different tech. I was able to get around the re-draw (block it completely) with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  shouldComponentUpdate = () => {\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\nWorks very well. FYI.\r\n\r\nHowever, even with this in place, I still get the anti-pattern warning... @xile611  `chartState` in `handleMove()` works well and provides me with the same data as the payload from the tootltip object. Thanks!\r\n\r\nTo have this data displayed in a table elsewhere on the page (along with other, synchronous data) `showToolTipData()`  updates sections of the redux state which that target display table is sensitive to.  I believe this means my `showToolTipData()` function is _not_ stateless - how else could I get this information to a separate container in real time? Or do I misunderstand? Is this perhaps a question for the redux forums? For the record it works very, very well!\r\n\r\nThanks for the help and the reply, I like the `onMouseMove` event idea.  ## Do you want to request a feature or report a bug?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nThe source order (for chart rendering) is [hard-coded](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L1022)\r\n\r\n## What is the expected behavior?\r\nA few options I can think of:\r\n1.

But I do understand the downside of doing it inside Recharts.\r\n\r\nIn many projects, I got various kind of numbers in string format from server-side, like `\"99.7\"`, `\"$12.4\"`, `\"2,345,678\"`, etc. Let's assume that Recharts uses `new Number(value)` to parse these strings, it will return a lot of `NaN`, which is unexpected to users. \r\n\r\nAn option is to leverage `Numbro` lib to parse those number-like strings: http://numbrojs.com/format.html#unformat . The parsing result looks good, but it's still not a good idea to make Numbro a direct dependency of Recharts.\r\n\r\nI have another idea, what about adding a new prop `dataConverter` along with existing `dataKey`? Something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<Line dataKey=\"price\" dataConvertor={value => numbro().unformat(value)} />\r\n```  Does reacharts support bubble charts? I mean chart, in which each bubble reflects an element's size and has distinct colour. Something like this - http://blogs.it.ox.ac.uk/acit-rs-team/files/2014/10/bubble_chart.png\r\n\r\n Although a bubble chart is similar to a scatter chart, the difference is mainly in the label placement \r\n* Bubble labels are inside the bubble\r\n* Scatter labels are outside the bubble\r\nas well as the size of the bubble - a 4th data dimension.\r\n\r\nWhy don't we spec out a bubble chart and add it to the docs?  @xile611 happy?   Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to render a LineChart ToolTip elsewhere on my page. It seems the ToolTip function would be the way to do this? From the API:\r\n\r\n\"If set a React element, the option is the custom react element of rendering tooltip. If set a function, the function will be called to render tooltip content.\"\r\n\r\nI have been unable to access the content of the data returned directly. I am trying this:\r\n\r\n`<Tooltip content={ this.showTooltipData.bind(this) } />`\r\n\r\nelsewhere:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  showTooltipData = (data) => {\r\n    console.log(data);\r\n    // console.log(data.payload[0].color);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe attempt above to access the \"color\" object as above  just returns an \"undefined\" error, though I can see it in the console log. Can anyone tell me the secret syntax sauce to get at this data?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14285373/24172771/da6da246-0e5f-11e7-9a1e-7e83182d3d02.png)\r\n\r\n Using the container's props is not that easy as this is deeply nested in a redux state. I have been trying a similar tactic to see if the payload is defined and I can see it and log it, but still can't access it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nshowTooltipData = (data) => {\r\n  if ( typeof data.payload[0] !== 'undefined') {\r\n    console.log(Object.keys(data.payload[0]));\r\n    console.log(\"dataKey = \" + data.payload[0][\"dataKey\"]);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first log shows the expected data, the second log errors out?\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: The above works fine, thanks for the example and the feedback!  I've tried various forms of Line charts and Scatters etc and can't find a way to do what I want, hoping there is a solution or a possible enhancement to help.\r\n\r\nI would like a single chart with 2 lines. X being datetime, each with their own numeric Y axis. This part I have done, not a problem.\r\n\r\nNow I want to be able to add dots (or some kind of shape) at various points - using the same x-axis, ie a datetime, a y-axis on the same scale as one of the existing ones, and a size (a z-axis?). Preferably this data would come from a separate dataset as the 2 lines - but merging the data beforehand would be somewhat possible.\r\n\r\nIs this possible? Yes, I think it should be possible with a ScatterChart. I see that version 1.0.0-alpha.4 is in NPM, wondering if this feature is in it?  is this feature released in latest version? any updates on this?  I am trying to display the ticks vertically .

I haven't tested this with any of the other graphs, but if you don't supply height/widths, or nest in a `ResponsiveContainer`, the bar chart doesn't render at all.\r\n\r\nI understand this is most likely expected behaviour, however a) it is not documented and b) there are no warnings in the console.

I am trying to create a ScatterChart with a ReferenceLine. I want to put the ReferenceLine inside a Redux connected component, which means I have to put it in a separate custom component. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that unless I explicitly place the ReferenceLine inside the chart it doesn't appear in the chart at all. Even if I put it in a simple wrapper component the ReferenceLine disappears.\r\n\r\nHere is a JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/9xjjuwkk/27/\r\n\r\n**Chart**\r\n```jsx\r\nclass Chart extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        const { now } = this.props;\r\n        return (\r\n            <ResponsiveContainer width=\"100%\" height={400}>\r\n                <ScatterChart >\r\n                    <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" />\r\n                    <Scatter name=\"vector\" data={data} fill='#8884d8'\r\n                        line\r\n                        shape={shape} />\r\n                    <XAxis dataKey=\"time\" name=\"time\" unit=\"seconds\" label=\"seconds\" domain={[0, 1]} />\r\n                    <YAxis dataKey=\"vector\" unit=\"g\" name=\"acceleration\" />\r\n                    <ReferenceLine x={0.5} stroke=\"red\" strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" label=\"Crash\" />\r\n                    <NowLine now={now} /> {/* should also return ReferenceLine */}\r\n                </ScatterChart>\r\n            </ResponsiveContainer>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Component that returns a ReferenceLine**\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nclass NowLine extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        const { now } = this.props;\r\n        return (\r\n            <ReferenceLine x={now} stroke=\"blue\" strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" label=\"Current\" />\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThere should be two reference lines inside the chart, a red one which is placed inside the chart explicitly, and a blue one which should be returned through the NowLine component. However the blue one doesn't appear. Why is this the case?\r\n\r\nI am using recharts v0.20.8 on Chrome 55/Windows 7.\r\n\r\nThis could be related to #41 but I'm not 100% sure. \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated! Right... Ok I understand. But can't something be done about this? \r\n\r\nThe reason I want to put it inside a customised component is that I my graph displays a ton of data, and forcing React to recompute the component tree on change of a single prop (`now`) is making the whole chart slow down - hence why I need to put the ReferenceLine inside of a redux connected component, to avoid an entire component rerender.\r\n\r\nHm. What if in addition to checking if the inside component is a ReferenceLine , the chart also checked for the presence of a special prop to indicate that that component returns a reference component? \r\n\r\nEg something like `<CustomComponent isReference={true} />`? I suppose my real question is: how can I change a ReferenceLine without forcing the entire chart recompute? That's what I'm really struggling with. When you have a few hundred/thousand of data points the entire page starts going janky - especially if you're trying to update a prop several times a second.\r\n\r\nThat's the reason why I want to put the ReferenceLine inside a connected component, so it connects directly to a redux store, bypassing the prop chain, thereby avoiding a chart recompute. \r\n\r\nHowever if the ReferenceLine actually just adds props onto the parent chart then does that mean avoiding a recompute is not possible? Ok... can you at least reopen this issue then so someone else can find it? Exactly - which is a problem. Maybe it would be possible for someone to create a pull request with some code refactors that would allow one part to update without the other? \r\n\r\nEither way the problem still exists; it may not be a bug as such, but it's still a problem.  Barsize doesnt work when updated to this new version 0.21.2.  It does not accept the bar size and calculates it internally. Can you please check? It works in 0.20.2, the last version i was using. whebn i updated it, the barSize doesnt take effect at all. Any idea why?  Can confirm this is still the case  Here is a simple AreaChart (not sure if other charts are affected) with a `domain={['auto', 'auto']}` prop on the `YAxis`.\r\n- `v0.20.7`: http://jsfiddle.net/c6kvLkn2/\r\n- `v0.20.6`: http://jsfiddle.net/7feeL86k/\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the Y axis on the chart running 0.20.7 starts at 0 instead of 1800. Same issue if using `dataMin`, etc.\r\nI'm not sure what the issue is, but having a quick look at the diff (https://github.com/recharts/recharts/compare/v0.20.6...v0.20.7) hints this is a regression introduced by the `mirror` setting.\r\nThanks.  Since the new version i'm getting this:\r\n\"Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique \"key\" prop. Check the render method of `ComposedChart`.\"\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?

Thanks for the fast answer.\r\n\r\nI checked these keys. They are all unique and if I don't add them i'm getting the unique key warning twice.\r\nI even get this warning if I use the code of the documentation.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18700777/23401926/c740a018-fda9-11e6-9bc6-8938a495e273.png)\r\n Sorry wasting your time.

I will dig into this.

Thanks for awesome work! (y)  I am layering quite a few radars on a radar chart The tooltips display data of the active (or top) layer, ignoring the data below. It would be nice to have an option to display the data within the active \"wedge\" or axis of the radar chart. Similar to the tooltip cursor attribute for Bar Charts... allow a hover state and data display for the active wedge or axis, instead of radar layer.  Is there currently a way to get the CartesianGrid to show in front of the data series? For area and some bar charts, a CartesianGrid that's drawn behind the data series isn't very useful. Our specific use-case was with a \"100%\" area chart, where the area plots completely cover the background (and the grid). I know we could reduce the opacity of the areas to have the grid show through, but it seemed like support for an \"isFront\" prop on the grid would have been better/easier in this case. Perhaps mine is an edge case. I ended up going with semi-transparent area plots with the grid behind.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the 100% area chart is one where the various area plots are forced to fill the entire chart rectangle (so without going semi-transparent, the grid is completely hidden).  I know it's possible to use a custom label formatter to do labels inside pie \"slices\", but that seems like such a common thing to do that a simple labelRadius prop (which would work the same way as inner/outerRadius, except that it sets the radius that the labels are drawn at (anchor:middle/baseline:middle).\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, you might consider an \"angle\" prop that would control the rotation of the individual labels, with a value of 0 meaning \"no rotation\" and a value of \"radial\" meaning rotation based on the angle of the text location (i.e. radial lines extending from the center of the pie would be perpendicular to the baseline of each label's text). Interesting, but it doesn't quite work:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/685316/23393139/44a4de7a-fd46-11e6-9fb0-216223eff8cc.png)\r\n\r\nI suspect the text alignment/baseline is off (I tried setting these in the object, but I could not find a combination that had any effect). Also, While inner/outerRadius can be set as a percentage (thus creating a size-responsive pie chart), offsetRadius seems to only accept a numeric fixed pixel value.\r\n\r\nRegarding angle, that's fine, I realize not everything can or should be a built-in feature. And I agree that angle 0 is easiest to read, but we have seen some use cases where radial alignment around a partial pie/donut is desirable. Sounds good. For simple stuff like putting the label inside the pie/donut slice, that shouldn't require external code. I agree that the \"base library\" can't possible cover all use-cases, the trick is sometimes to figure out where that line is. PS - This may get fixed with the alignment/baseline fix, but notice that there is a significant difference in label position between offsetRadius:0 (or omitted) and offsetRadius:1 (or -1).  Any thoughts on adding the ability to drive the position of a ReferenceLine with an aggregate function calculated across all samples of a particular datakey? In other words, for a horizontal ReferenceLine, instead of declaring \"y\" as a static value, specify \"datakey\" and a new \"function\" prop to calculate the position of the line in real-time. Potential (easy) functions would be \"average\", \"min\", \"max\", \"mean\", \"mode\", etc. Some more elaborate functions could be supported by passing a user-defined function in the \"function\" prop, where the function is passed a reference to the data array and key, and returns a single value used to set the line position. As a follow-up to this, just allowing \"x\" or \"y\" props to be set to a user-defined function (that returns the single value for the line) would be an even simpler enhancement. I think parameters passed into the function, if any, would be very specific to the function and so would need to be supplied by the user as arguments to the function in its declaration. I don't see any need for any \"dynamic\" parameters to be sent. I'm not sure I understand the distinction. Are you saying this could be done now? If so, can you show me a simple example? Yes, that's exactly what I had in mind. Thank you! PS - Not a big deal, but if you ever think about enhancing this, it would be nice to pass the data (as defined in the chart) to the function.  If I remove the ResponsiveContainer .... I get Server Side Rendered Graph.... But If I use ResponsiveContainer... The Graph is rendered in the client side alone....\r\n ```javascript\r\n<div id=\"canvas_dahs\" className=\"demo-placeholder\" style={{ width: '100%', height: '270px' }} >\r\n        <ResponsiveContainer width='100%' height='100%' minWidth={100} minHeight={100}>\r\n          <LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data} margin={{ top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5 }}>\r\n            <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" />\r\n            <YAxis />\r\n            <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" />\r\n            <Tooltip />\r\n            <Legend />\r\n            <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" activeDot={{ r: 8 }} />\r\n            <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" />\r\n          </LineChart>\r\n        </ResponsiveContainer>\r\n      </div>\r\n``` Is there a workaround for this? @xile611  @xile611  but it is not fixed( As per my requirement ).... the graph has to adjust its width depending on the browser size.... If a div of width in percentage is responsive on the server side render why cant a svg graph be responsive? A chart can be in percentages too... Not only in pixels(If that is the case, then what is the use of ResponsiveContainer in recharts then? )... Recharts creates an svg.  SSR can also append svg into html and also, svg can be in percentages... What Iam asking is to use percentages for width and height for the generated svg. 100% true.... that is what is needed.... and that is what responsive container does.... and that is what bootstrap or foundation does for us (SSR also) ..... If bootstrap or foundation can use percentages to make an html element responsive... Why cant an svg be responsive... ? when SSR is used?  Is it possible to add a payload to a Tooltip for charts that used stacked data such as BarChart and AreaChart? Looking at the source it doesn't appear that it can, but I could be very wrong. There also appear to be no examples to check.\r\n\r\nAssuming that I've not made a horrible mistake; It would be nice if the payload could take an array of arrays of objects, or alternatively, take a string which points to a property in the data. Thanks, I'm currently using this. However, I was specifically asking about the payload, since I quite like the default behaviours. Alright, sorry. I thought I could set it through the payload property ([Tooltip API](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Tooltip)) Then please adjust the API Documentation. \r\nPayload exactly was what we were looking for. But it doesn't work.  Is it possible to make the Brush itself display data?\r\n\r\nAttached is what I am trying to accomplish; The problem is with attached I'm just using CSS to move a second AreaChart inside of the Brush which makes the Brush Traveler not work.\r\n\r\nis there a way to put data directly within the Brush component?\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-02-21 at 10 37 04 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22822404/23179161/cb341e44-f821-11e6-82b6-dee56bd5cb3d.png) Has this been implemented?\r\nIs usage like \r\n<Brush dataKey=\"the_dataKey\" /> ? @xile611 you keep sending notifications to the wrong Greg \ud83d\ude09   area chart with irregular xAxis. ![3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/226573/23157708/3421a13a-f857-11e6-8162-1ea703a396a6.png) i use scatter chart temporarily, \r\n```\r\nconst JointLineScatterChart = ({data1, data2}) => {\r\n    var start = new Date().setHours(0,0,0,0);\r\n    var ndata1 = data1 && data1.map ((item)=>{\r\n        var ttt = new Date(item.createdAt).getTime() - start;\r\n        var x = ttt*24/(24*60*60*1000);\r\n        var y = item.value;\r\n        return {x, y};\r\n    });\r\n    return (\r\n    <ResponsiveContainer>\r\n    \t<ScatterChart width={600} height={400} margin={{top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20}}>\r\n      \t<XAxis dataKey={'x'} name='stature' unit='cm'/>\r\n      \t<YAxis dataKey={'y'} name='weight' unit='kg'/>\r\n        <ZAxis range={[100]}/>\r\n        <CartesianGrid />\r\n      \t<Tooltip/>\r\n        <Legend/>\r\n      \t<Scatter name='watt' data={ndata1} fill='#8884d8' fillOpacity={0} line lineType='joint'  lineJointType='linear'/>\r\n      \t{/*<Scatter name='watt' data={ndata1} fill='#8884d8' line lineType='joint'  lineJointType='natural' shape=\"circle\"/>*/}\r\n        {/*<Scatter name='B school' data={data02} fill='#82ca9d' line shape=\"diamond\"/>*/}\r\n      </ScatterChart>\r\n    </ResponsiveContainer>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand got below:\r\n![4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/226573/23158000/5d83502c-f858-11e6-88ec-1af75ae43eb4.png)\r\n\r\n @xile611 is there any way to tackle it? @xile611 after dive into the source code hardly, finally, I got the solution. just set the 'type' of xAxis. \r\n``` <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" type=\"number\"/> ```\r\nreally, need more document or examples! example: <http://jsfiddle.net/agooou/p39k0vwt/>  Now you can pass an explicit `id` to the Pie component in order to better support server side rendering.

I tried to achieve this by delaying animationBegin by animationDuration for all the bars to the left to load, but this does not work when there are data rows with values of 0.  Can't wait for this... It looks interesting, but it's hard to tell how it would be used without an example--is that possible? Yes, I think this is a good step, but I would not deprecate the label props in Line/Area/Bar... I see these new components as being a more advanced option, but sometimes just the basic label prop is all you need (plus, it would be a breaking change). Looking forward to see these componentized  @xile611 can you provide example for stacked bar chart where do we mention a common label   It would be really cool if you could pass in a function to `<Legend/>` which transforms the payload. I want to just effect a subtle change to it and don't want to have to recompute all the other properties which are fine by default.\r\n\r\nEven if we could just transform the `value`, that's what I need most. For example, it would be useful in [this jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/xpegg70o/2/) from #323. \r\n\r\nIn it, the Legend payload has a custom `value`, but it looks uglier because it's missing the rest of the default properties. @xile611 Sounds great and exactly what I'd like. Is that already possible as is? @xile611 By new feature, do you mean a new feature that's recently been added but is undocumented, or new feature that ought to be added? \ud83d\udca9 So shall we add the enhancements tag?  In this example: [http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomizedLabelLineChart](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomizedLabelLineChart)\r\n\r\nNo labels are shown. Ah, OK. So I can almost accomplish the same thing like this:\r\n\r\n`{fill:\"#82ca9d\", stroke:false, fontSize:10, dy:-4}`\r\n\r\nBut dy doesn't work. Is there a way to control the offset of the label (without a custom function)? I've tried this every which way, but dy still has no effect on the position of the label. Can you show me in a jsfiddle (I essentially did that, using the CustomizedLabelLineChart example as a starting point)?  What's the difference between using iconType with Legend vs using it in Area/Bar/Line?  Chart is being responsively changed according to the size but label (if they're to long) seems not to be considered in the measurements which means they're cut in some circumstances. \r\n\r\nJSFiddle with repro: http://jsfiddle.net/6rtyqjf8/ how do you render Labels inside?

The issue is that the *first* render with actual data does not take into account the space occupied by legend but the *second* render (with actual data) does.\r\n\r\nSo basically after the first render, the chart has a bit too much height but it gets readjusted when rendering new data, for example.

I'm still seeing this issue on first load and then it resizes to the correct size on something like onMouseOver. @ctoppel I am having the same issue I see the same issue, where it resizes to the correct size after a while(maybe after some event). same issue I solved this issue by simply returning `null` if there is no data or if data's length equals to zero. Please help. I'm facing the same issue. Legend and chart overlaps initially. When hover over the chart, It resizes and displays both chart and legend properly.  I'm working on a project that's testing with jest and skin-deep. We're trying to test that we've passed the correct data to AreaChart. \r\n\r\nHowever, when we call `sd.shallowRender(<OurComponent />`, we're seeing that the included `AreaChart` component is fully rendered. This makes it impossible to test, since we don't know exactly where our data will end up. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to not fully render the charts with `sd.shallowRender()`?  I set the orientation of the Y axis to \"right\" and now I wanna display the tick values inside the chart. I know it is possible on d3, but I did not see any config on the API page (http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/YAxis).\r\n\r\nI know I could create a custom tick component and change the dx value to negative, but this is quite a lot of work to a simple functionality that already exists on d3.  Hi, I am trying to add custom labels into the bar chart near the bars.\r\n[http://www.clipular.com/c/6279233242660864.png?k=JETXTDXXrS_rtX3aBNQXtDKhqCk](http://www.clipular.com/c/6279233242660864.png?k=JETXTDXXrS_rtX3aBNQXtDKhqCk)\r\nI have tried to add <Text> element but the  text does not appear. ([http://jsfiddle.net/t4t5rx16/16/](http://jsfiddle.net/t4t5rx16/16/))\r\n Also I want to place text near the end of each bar, so the x and y position shoud be relative to bar length.  How can I accomplish that?  - direct load method as a package from lodash definition\r\n- instead of loading the entire lodash library just load what needed.  After customizing the x axis bar \"labels\" to turn them on an angle, as shown [here](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/CustomizedLabelLineChart) , the brush is rendered on top of some portion of the longer labels.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is no way that I have come across to move the brush down, or even placing it on top of the chart. How can I do this?\r\n\r\nIf i update the \"y\" in the developer tools of the browser, it seems to move the brush, however, changing the \"y\" prop for the brush component does not have the same results.\r\n\r\nI have to say, I really do love this library for ease of use. However, the custom styling of most of these components is a nightmare, and should possibly be rethought, and reworked, as style should not be forced to be the way the creator of the library thinks it should be. \r\n\r\nI updated the fiddle in your example to show the [issue](http://jsfiddle.net/97oecp4k/)  Just importing from recharts gives me lots of errors from node_modules/math-expression-evaluator/src/lexer.js. All the errors are about the variables \"i\", \"x\", and \"y\" being undefined. Is anyone else seeing this? Maybe that dependency is currently broken. I can't reproduce this now, so I'm closing it. Sorry for the noise.  isomorphic/universal rendering failing due to Date.now() usage for id creation in Pie component\r\n\r\n- Included a new prop 'clipPathId' for Pie component which can be used for isomorphic apps @xile611 Request you please take a look at my pull request. Would be helpful if this can be merged in and released with next version. \r\n\r\nI am awaiting for this fix and release to update this library accordingly in personal project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. Great job done with D3 and react here! I developed few charts with D3+React for my projects as well and I totally understand the effort it takes to get them right :) Really like your project here. Do let me know in case I can help you with anything here. @xile611 Yes, that could possibly fix this case.\r\n\r\nBut there's one more case I have in mind which might fail if we do the above. Since we are assuming lodash will be imported as a singleton on both server and client and therefore would generate the same unique id, but what about the case where ` lodash.uniqueId` is being used at server for any other application specific task before server rendering. That would take the lodash's unique id counter one step ahead of what client would be calculating. \r\n\r\nI suggest we should still keep `clipPathId` as prop and replace the calculation in `defaultProps` with ` lodash.uniqueId`.  That could cover all our cases. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you agree and I will reopen this PR with necessary changes. @xile611 Completely agree on `clipPathId` as prop is needless. Only suggesting it as it was giving me control from my app to fix this scenario. However, your suggestion of having rechart's own `uniqueId` generator function should solve this \ud83d\udc4d   `Warning: React.createElement: type should not be null, undefined, boolean, or number. It should be a string (for DOM elements) or a ReactClass (for composite components). Check the render method of `Bar`.`\r\n\r\nI am getting the above error. I don't what is happening. I didn't do any changes to my code. All that I did is I've deleted my node_modules folder and then `npm install`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n         <ResponsiveContainer height={300}>\r\n            <BarChart data={this.props.stats} width={150}>\r\n              <XAxis dataKey=\"title\" />\r\n              <YAxis />\r\n              <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" />\r\n              <Tooltip />\r\n              <Bar dataKey=\"bookings\" fill=\"#009f8b\" />\r\n            </BarChart>\r\n          </ResponsiveContainer>\r\n``` @xile611 No, I am using below line for importing Bar, and other components.\r\n`import { BarChart, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Bar, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts';`\r\n\r\nPlease let me know any mistakes.

But how to configure the chart to show begin and end values of the domain so that           `interval='preserveStartEnd'` works as expected?  Is there a way to plot multiple time series with differing time frames?

Right now, there does not appear to be a way to pass differing data elements into two different X-axes. Do you think you could give an example using the above data? Thank you.  I tried the following code, but all I got was a blank grid:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\t\t<ScatterChart width={600} height={400} margin={{top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20}}>\r\n\t\t\t\t<XAxis xAxisId={0} dataKey='x'/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<XAxis xAxisId={1} dataKey='x'/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<YAxis dataKey='y'/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<CartesianGrid />\r\n\t\t\t\t<Tooltip cursor={{strokeDasharrasales: '3 3'}}/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Legend/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Line xAxisId={0} name={\"Hi1\"} data={ts1} dataKey={'y'} fill={'#8884d8'}/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Line xAxisId={1} name={\"Hi2\"} data={ts2} dataKey={'y'} fill={'#8884d8'}/>\r\n\t\t\t</ScatterChart>\r\n```  Hello, \r\n\r\nSo I've been evaluating recharts, and after browsing through the code and the documentation, I've been unable to find anything about grouping components. I was curious if there was any way to do this, especially with a bar chart. \r\n\r\nEssentially I'd just like to be able to group bar elements, so you could have:\r\n\r\n```\r\n| 123   456   789 | 123   456   789 |\r\n|_________________|_________________|\r\n```\r\n\r\nReally, all this would require is the ability to pad each bar element differently from the center tick mark, so this may exist, but I couldn't find anything about it. Any thoughts on how to do this, or if it can be accomplished? \r\n Sorry for the slow response. In the event of grouped data, say car types, I'd like to display them together, but a little separated. \r\n\r\nE.G, Cars Purchased\r\nHonda = { accord: [{x: Tuesday, y: 4}, {x: Wednesday, y: 9}], civic: [{x: Tuesday, y: 2}, {x: Wednesday, y: 7}] }\r\nFord = { explorer: [{x: Tuesday, y: 2}, {x: Wednesday, y: 9}], {focus: [{x: Tuesday, y: 2}, {x: Wednesday, y: 9}] }\r\nToyota = { camry: [{x: Tuesday, y: 18}, {x: Wednesday, y: 19}], prius: [{x: Tuesday, y: 2}, {x: Wednesday, y: 19}] }\r\n\r\nBelow is a silly photoshop example of roughly what I'm asking for. Kind of a group for a single x-axis value. \r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2700571/23382088/ee297344-fd0e-11e6-8c77-0b219a25f536.png)\r\n\r\nEssentially, the ability to space apart certain kinds of x-elements. Is this possible? \r\n\r\n Yeah, I think that should work. Thanks!  After reading the DOCs of the Brush Component, [http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Brush](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Brush)\r\nI did not find a way to change the styles of the component, even with pure CSS.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do that?\r\n\r\nThanks!  Is it possible within composed charts to align points with an `area` chart and a `bar` chart.\r\nThe following screenshot illustrates the points I am trying to align.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/323731/22486029/f07776a4-e85b-11e6-9d5a-296aa6da1871.png)\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if this is possible with recharts, or could point me in right direction of how to achieve a similar result.\r\n\r\nLove the project, many thanks.\r\n  If the label is longer then what it has room for, then it is placed at the very top of the screen and taken out of the axis markup.  Is there a way that will just chop off the edge of the text but put as much as possible in the right place?  http://jsfiddle.net/jlarso11/rzhrLogy/\r\n\r\nHere is the basic problem.  We have applied some extra styling to ours to make four out of five show up but this gives the basic idea   Is there a simpler/cleaner way to add colors to pie chart slices? The current example (like this [PieChartWithPaddingAngle](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/PieChartWithPaddingAngle)) seems overly convoluted for something that really should be \"built in\". Maybe just an attribute on the \"pie\" component that allows you to set an array of colors, which are then selected in order, like in the example? Yes, but to your point, maybe not the cleanest solution. I know that Pie (and Bar) will pick up and override the component settings for fill, stroke, and strokeWidth from the underlying data array (although it isn't always possible to set it there). What other attributes do these components look for in the data? Wow. That's a lot of attributes! OK. How about this? Since the components can already pick up these attributes from the data array, why not have a separate \"style\" array. That array is simply a list of objects, each with one or more presentation attributes. The first item in the style array is applied to the first item in the data array (with the data array taking precedence), the second style to the second data, and so on, but MOD the length of the style array, so it gets reused from the beginning when there are more data items than style items. This ticket seems related to this one https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/986 that help me find the solution for the color. @xile611 your like is very usefull. THX. I did not see it in the documentation (I just had a quick look) so maybe it could be added (maybe close to this doc http://recharts.org/#/en-US/guide/customize).   According to the docs, the Line component has an `onClick` property but the method I'm providing isn't getting invoked. With that said, the LineChart element's `onClick` property works as expected.\r\n\r\nI have a [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/x1yoboc7/339/) set up here. it would not look good if I'm going to make a TinyLine chart  Is onClick supported in the ReferenceArea component?\r\n\r\nThank you for the great library.

Thanks,  Hi,\r\n\r\nIs there a way to increase the distance between the labels and its axis ?\r\nAlso how do I change the label font ?\r\n\r\nThanks, Not the best solution, but I've found out that this works:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.myChart .recharts-x-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick-value {\r\n  transform: translateY(6px);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.myChart .recharts-y-axis .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick-value {\r\n  transform: translateX(-6px);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you think that axis text customization might be something worth of adding in the next versions ?  Is it currently possible to create an Axis where the tick labels are non-linear? In other words, if the domain is  linear from 0 to 100 but I only want to show tick labels at 0, 20, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95.  > From Docs:\r\n> A boundary value of the area.

I will definitely use that. \r\n\r\n_But I still think that there is an issue with `ReferenceArea`_ I do agree with @liubko, I'm trying to draw a ReferenceArea in a BarChart that starts in the x1={0}, or beginning of the chart up until the first X value, not in the middle of it but the the bar ends.  Could you add support for 3D charts? e.g. 3D scatter chart  On some Chart objects, [there is a \"title\" prop](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/PieChart.js#L53), but this does not manifest into a displayed title (it is unused).\r\n\r\nAny chance this can be implemented?\r\n\r\nFor now, help with placing a <Text/> object would be appreciated... (no x and y location data available). @xile611 how do title of charts differ very much? I'm expecting something as simple as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<LineChart title=\"Chart of PU x UV\">...</LineChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe at the top of the chart, it displays the title. This is pretty standard across all chart presentation (Bar, Circle, Pie, Graph, etc).  I'm going through the [API documentation](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api) and it looks like useful details are missing.\r\n\r\nFor example, the docs for the [`Tooltip`](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/api/Tooltip) `formatter` prop only state that it's an optional function; there is no information on what arguments are provided and what the function should return.\r\n\r\nBy providing such details, it will save users from digging through the [source code](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/component/DefaultTooltipContent.js#L62).  I am trying to create a punch card chart like shown below but the scatter axes won't let me give string values to axes.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to achieve this ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![punch](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1297759/22250571/77fcca66-e258-11e6-969d-59f9a5ad8df4.PNG)\r\n How would the data formatting approach look like? I've created a [JSFiddle with an ideal case](http://jsfiddle.net/897gh2pp/) I would like to make work (notice that both X and Y axis use type `category`)\r\n\r\nIf this is something that is never going to be supported, then I believe this behaviour should be documented, as of right now there is nothing in any of the Axis saying that type `category` can only be used per one axis of a single chart.  ```js\r\nclass Tick extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    const {x, y, stroke, payload, data} = this.props;\r\n    console.log(data);\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <g>\r\n        <text x={x} y={y} fill=\"#5d6571\" textAnchor=\"middle\" dy={16}>tick</text>\r\n      </g>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Performance extends React.Component {\r\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState){\r\n    return (JSON.stringify(nextProps) != JSON.stringify(this.props));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    const data = this.props.data;\r\n    console.log(data);\r\n    const length = data.length;\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"chart-performance\">\r\n        <LineChart width={935} height={150} data={data}>\r\n          <XAxis dataKey=\"title\" tickLine={false} axisLine={false} padding={{left: 37, right: 37}} tick={<Tick data={??}/>}/>\r\n          <YAxis tickLine={false} axisLine={false} type=\"number\" domain={['auto', 'auto']}/>\r\n          <Tooltip/>\r\n          <CartesianGrid fill=\"#f2f2f2\" horizontal={false} vertical={false}/>\r\n          <Line dataKey=\"pp\" type=\"monotone\" stroke='#9ca1b0' fill='#374151'/>\r\n          {\r\n            length > 12 ? <Brush/> : null\r\n          }\r\n        </LineChart>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCan I pass only that data in an array?\r\nlike dataKey=\"title\"\r\n  Below is a screenshot of my stacked bar chart:\r\n<img width=\"1127\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-01-23 at 2 47 57 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7084294/22226334/ff247072-e17a-11e6-9d61-c2580e6c9452.png\">\r\n\r\nI would like to add a **bold** `label` to the end of each bar which would show the combined total of each section in that bar.

Why is this issue closed , and @xile611 what do you mean by try component  I had the same problem and was able to accomplish the goal by adding two separate LabelLists.\r\n\r\nThis code is straight from my project but should explain the idea.\r\n\r\n1. The first LabelList only returns a number from the valueAccessor for the last entry.

I didn't manage to find a way to modify default icons for `Legend` component (e.g. line without a dot). Creating custom component with styling to pass it in `content` prop seems to be overkill for such simple task. Would it be possible to provide `legendIcon` prop to pass function rendering svg icon in future release? Another way would be to export ```DefaultLegendContent``` component for overriding methods like `renderIcon`. Thanks!   This not work for area charts \ud83d\ude1e  It works. Sorry.

It looks like a value point but not shown on charts:\r\n\r\n`{name: 'Page G', uv: 3490, pv: 4300, amt: 2100},`\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is it for ? Is it something special ? @evilucifero \r\n\r\nOn the example that @cemremengu is referencing, `amt` is no shown on the chart.  The data comes from the Stacked Bar Chart example http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/StackedBarChart\r\n\r\nThe bar shows displays that `uv` is `3490` and that `pv` is `4300`, but where is `amt` shown? Is it suppose to be a third stack? Is it another data point that is needed but isn't shown?\r\n\r\nBasically, where is `amt` on the example chat? And is it necessary to product the chart? @corinnebrady it's not something necessary/required. It is another data point but in the example they did not add something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Bar dataKey=\"amt\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#ff0000\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nso that's why it is not shown as a third stack. Nothing to worry about :)\r\n @cemremengu  Thanks for clearing that up. That was really confusing.  It would be great to have support for axis labels that appear rotated, to the left/right of a Y-axis or the top/bottom of an X-axis. See \"Temperature\" and \"Rainfall\" in this link for an example: [Rotated Axis Labels](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/combo-dual-axes) I would like this too - I don't use your axis labels for just this reason. Well, OK, but that feels like a workaround to me. Since axes already have labels (which the should--it's an inherent feature of an axis), I think it should be possible to specify how/where the label is drawn. IMHO, the current (exclusive) default of horizontal text at the end of the axis is just about the least likely place the label should be. @xile611 Your suggestion gives me this error:\r\n\r\n> [at-loader] ./src/components/molecules/cohortTable.tsx:21:39 \r\n>     TS2339: Property 'angle' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & IntrinsicClassAttributes<XAxis> & Readonly<{ children?: ReactNode; }> & Rea...'.\r\n\r\nThis is the version of Recharts I'm doing (from package.json):\r\n\r\n`\"recharts\": \"^1.0.0-alpha.4\"` @su-narthur \r\n\r\n`<XAxis dataKey='name' angle={-45} textAnchor='end'/>` work in `\"recharts\": \"^1.0.0-apha.5\"`\r\n\r\nrecharts site indicate alpha.4 as last version, but alpha.5 it's already availabe in npm at the time of writing.\r\n\r\nTry an update I get this error with recharts `^1.0.0-alpha.6`:\r\n```\r\nWarning: Unknown prop `angle` on <line> tag.\r\nRemove this prop from the element.\r\nFor details, see https://fb.me/react-unknown-prop\r\n```\r\nFrom this code:\r\n```jsx\r\n<YAxis dataKey=\"value\" angle={-45} textAnchor=\"end\" />\r\n```\r\n This is how you make a vertical or otherwise rotated Y-axis _label_: https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/782#issuecomment-316449331 ```\r\n<YAxis>\r\n   <Label angle={-90} value='custom label' position='insideLeft' style={{textAnchor: 'middle'}} />\r\n</YAxis>\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"276\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-10-31 at 12 45 11 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2819448/32207812-69954ba2-be39-11e7-91ff-2873e1fc3e76.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n I was following other issues and it is using the `angle` prop.

You saved my weekend. Thanks.  Is there a way to export/download the charts currently ? Or any known way to implement it if it does not exist ? >recommend use npm and webpack to import or export charts.\r\n\r\nCan you please elaborate @arcthur ? \r\n\r\nI need to export charts clientside. ie. Save as image or pdf. This should definitely be open - is there any built in method(s) in recharts that would support client side downloading of a rendered rechart in some format? Say SVG, PNG, JPG, XLS, PDF... @Chris-Petty I definitely agree with you, I see an open issue https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/1027 in which we should ask for more clarification or a path to add this as a feature.  It's easy to reproduce. I've just tried to use link to JSFiddle on demo page http://jsfiddle.net/kca9npkg/6/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=kca9npkg\r\n \r\nThen I added YAxis prop \"scale\", so the chart is visible when scale=\"auto\" is shown, when I set any other value, e.g. scale=\"log\", the chart disappears.\r\n\r\nThe question is what I should do to have a bar chart with logarithmic yAxis? or that's a bug?\r\n\r\nAny information would be much appreciated! Cheers! Thank you for the reply. I've just had a quick look at http://jsfiddle.net/kca9npkg/117/ and it doesn't seem to be working properly. uv bars aren't visible and pv bars stick to the top of the chart.  Using the following chart: \r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<ResponsiveContainer width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\">\r\n  <RadialBarChart cx=\"50%\" cy=\"100%\" innerRadius=\"1%\" outerRadius=\"100%\" data={data} onClick={::this.requestTagsWithPattern} >\r\n    <Legend align=\"left\" verticalAlign=\"top\" onClick={::this.requestTagsWithPattern} />\r\n    <RadialBar label={radialLabelStyle} className=\"clickable\" minAngle={15} background clockWise={true} dataKey=\"uv\" />\r\n    <Tooltip />\r\n  </RadialBarChart>\r\n</ResponsiveContainer>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am receiving the following error when hovering over the `RadialBar`: \r\n\r\n```\r\nutil.js:51 Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded[Symbol.replace] \r\n@ (program):665replace \r\n@ (program):119generatePrefixStyle \r\n@ util.js:51(anonymous function) \r\n@ util.js:119reduce \r\n@ (program):999translateStyle \r\n@ util.js:118render \r\n@ Tooltip.js:220(anonymous function) \r\n@ ReactCompositeComponent.js:796measureLifeCyclePerf \r\n@ ReactCompositeComponent.js:75_renderValidatedComponentWithoutOwnerOrContext \r\n@ ReactCompositeComponent.js:795\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue started occurring after upgrading from **0.20.2** to **0.20.4**. Also, this error only occurs when the `RadialBarChart` has 4 or more values. Hovering over the first 4 values will not cause an issue, but once you try to hover over the 4th or 5th, the chart and tooltip freeze up and fire off the above error in the console.  +1, do confirm the issue, it also occurs with `PieChart` (whatever the number of displayed values is). By the way, it only occurs when chrome console / react devtool are opened (looks like it comes from some dev-only benchmark methods like `measureLifeCyclePerf`) @loris You're right that it's only happening in Chrome as I tried on IE11 with no issue. However it happens regardless of console being open or not - at least for me anyway on `Chrome 53.0.2785.116 m` @xile611 Please refer to this [fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/patryk0605/hbyfdkk2/1/) and hover over some of the bars to trigger error.  @xile611 After updating to **0.20.5**, I am no longer encountering the issue. Thanks for the quick turnaround on this.   Fix react-smooth broken version Issue.: #457  thanks!  The line  126  in react-smooth/src/easing.js is:\r\n`case 'ease-int-out':`\r\n\r\nIs it an error and should be \r\n`case 'ease-in-out':` ?  I have an event handler function setup for onMouseLeave in BarChart. The object passed in used to contain things like \"bucket\" and \"value\", which are pretty important for functionalities that need to know which bar of the bar graph was interacted with. Now only \"isTooltipActive\" is provided. Did this get removed intentionally, or is it a bug, or is there a new way to access the other properties (since it used to work)? PieChart's onMouseLeave still has everything (bucket, value, stroke, innerRadis, etc). Thank you @xile611, that worked. I've moved the one on PieChart to the Pie component as well, and it returned the samething. Still don't know why Bar vs BarChart is different but Bar works so all good!  I am creating a custom Bar shape and using the Rectangle component to render the bar shape. The bar chart I creating has the possibility of negative values. When I apply a radius property to the Rectangle shape renderer, it works fine for any of the bars that have positive values, but not for any that have negative values. Here is a JSFiddle of the issue: http://jsfiddle.net/1vq6jhbx/1/ @xile611  can you indicate what change you make to fix it? find it nvm, thanks https://github.com/recharts/recharts/commit/4bbed677410b51329e3fe344971d45df954557b6  It is working fine in chrome, but not for Internet explorer 11, \r\n\r\nhttp://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleBarChart Anyone with any solution??? I don't know if this is enough of a description where they are the same issue, but I also had an issue with animations in ie11 and it was because the recharts library uses Array.prototype.find which isn't supported in ie11. The solution was to just include a polyfill in my codebase.  For example, the type \"width\" and \"height\" property in <PieChart> is number. \r\nWhen I use <PieChart width={400} height={400}>, it works.\r\nBut when I use <PieChart width={'100%'} height={'100%'}> or \r\n<PieChart width={'inherit'} height={'inherit'}>, the component does not work.\r\nHow to inherit the css style from the parent label?

Hello recharts team,\r\n\r\nI've noticed that when there is only 1 value to display for AreaChart, it messes up the look.

It still has area...\r\n\r\nsomething like this:\r\n![screen shot 2018-02-07 at 2 56 27 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10411174/35946477-c1b96dc2-0c18-11e8-9dc0-94a6284c669e.png)\r\n\r\n  Is it possible to display graphable data in the brush?\r\n\r\nFor example, the dataKey is the x-axis key, but can we also have show one (or more) of our y-axis data in the brush?\r\n\r\n[Like this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JYBwS.png) Has this been implemented?\r\nIs usage like \r\n<Brush dataKey=\"the_dataKey\" /> ? +1 Hi, I've created a PR #586 for this ticket, could you please help review it when you have some time? Thanks.  I'm attempting to get this project building/running on my system with a view to making some contributions.   I may be doing something stupid, but I'm having a few issues.\r\n\r\n1) [I'll submit this fix when I've got everything working] package.json needs to make use of cross-env in some of the script entries to make it work on Windows (and have a dev dependency of cross-env).\r\n\r\n2) Demo/index.html contains a reference to  <script src=\"bundle.js\"></script> whereas the webpack is putting bundle.js into the build subfolder.  So at least on my system I need  <script src=\"build/bundle.js\"></script>.  I just wanted to check whether a) I've missed the point b) non-Windows systems somehow look in build/  c) it's a bug.\r\n OK I now understand how 2 is works using npm run-script demo.  Although I'm not yet sure how it works - I *think* that webpack is serving its in-memory copy of bundle.js (because the name, if not the path, matches) and so it doesn't notice that the path is wrong.  I still suspect that the reference in index.html should be build/bundle.js  - which works with webpack-dev-server and also with visual studio.\r\n\r\nIf we want to encourage windows developers, it might be worth adding a note to the readme as to how to fire up the demos? And I think I've got the stage where I have some minor changes on my fork to commit, but the lint rules are insisting on LF linebreaks, whereas git has pulled CRLF style files because I'm on windows, and  I've got 12252 lint errors :(   \r\n\r\nAny suggestions?  I hesitate to hack the lint rules for the project on my first commmit! Done.  That's my first ever GitHub pull request, so I hope I've got it right.  I'm from a Windows+SVN background...  Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI'm having problems getting recharts tooltip to work with mobile touch events for area charts.\r\nI see that it has been fixed for lineCharts per https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/204\r\n\r\nAny help with area charts?\r\n\r\nThanks! @xile611 I'm confused on how I'd implement that.\r\nDo I need to simply \r\nImport \"generateCategoricalChart\" from \"recharts\" ? @xile611 so what happens is touchEvents work once; i.e. touch on tooltip -> shows tooltip -> can't touch on any other tooltips... is this a known issue? I don't know why the touch event can work in Android, but not ios. @xile611  Add the onClick function in the Chart, then it can work! Even adding `onClick={null}` will enable mobile touch event in chart. I don't know why! Why adding onClick={null} in the Chart component not work  In the [SimpleRadialBarChart](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleRadialBarChart), the text of the value within each radial bar use to be visible, but now the text is the same color as fill - masking the value. For example, if the `uv` value is reduced from **6.67** to **0.67** like so: `{name: 'unknow', uv: 6.67, pv: 4800, fill: '#ffc658'}` to `{name: 'unknow', uv: 0.67, pv: 4800, fill: '#ffc658'}`, then the value can be seen partially: \r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7227636/21821579/10acdf0c-d742-11e6-86f1-97699133b4cd.png)\r\n\r\nIs there another value to specify the color of text? Can it be defaulted to white or it's previous behavior? \r\n Super, thanks!   Hi! I like this project very much. Please help to support typescript as https://git.itch.ovh/itchio/itch/blob/2f1b4f0535a3ee91739f3371414642e6d9e0d3d5/typings/recharts.d.ts  If you're data contains stacked area graphs, with let's say one of the stacks at some point reaching 0, you can't set your domain to be, for example [50, 100]. It will still show the YAxis domain as [0,100]. If you remove the part of the stacks that has the data with points < 50, then the domain will be properly updated. Same issue here, here is a [jsfiddle demo](http://jsfiddle.net/ze8c333g/20/)\r\nI just modified the documented [StackedAreaChart demo](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/StackedAreaChart) to set `type=\"number\" domain={[2000, 15000]}` on the `YAxis`. As you can see, the axis starts at 0 instead of 2000. It does not work with `auto` or `dataMin` neither. By the way, same issue with `BarChart` too. @xile611 The result is essentially the same as the fiddle shared by @loris . @loris thank you for sharing.\r\n  Is there a way to overlay bars on top of each other so they start from the baseline y and are centered on the same point on the x axis? Currently they can be stacked on be side by side. \r\n\r\nThe width and color would be specified in order to differentiate the bars at each point. \r\n\r\nThis is useful to have a reference (or multiple) at each point. For example, visualising the current value against historical peak and historical average.  Demo is perfect once I set barSize on each bar. Thanks a lot!  I like the ability to customize tooltips for points on the charts.  However it would be nice if the payload represented the data that corresponded to the point originally.  e.g. if my data consisted of objects such as\r\n{ x: 2005, Score: 30, When:new Date(2005,1,6)  }\r\nand I'm graphing x vs Score, then it would be nice to get hold of this whole object as the payload so that I could use When in my tooltip.  At present the payload only includes the fields used in drawing the chart (so x and Score). Scatter -  I'm looking at this as a work around for no data axes in scatter charts.  Thinking of having numeric years as the axis and the date as a tool tip on each point  +1 on this. It seems like the payload is inconsistent across the board. \r\n\r\nFor example, the `<Bar />` payload represents the entire object but `<XAxis />` payload seems to only represent the fields used in drawing the chart. \r\n\r\n +1 here too. I was quite surprised that the value passed to a custom label on a bar only returns the second array element. So, I can't represent both min/max labels at present.\r\nhaving access to the payload would be perfect. (I actually want to represent min/avg/max values as labels on the bar) For a workaround, I did the following:\r\n```\r\n<BarChart\r\n    layout=\"vertical\"\r\n    data={this.props.data}\r\n>\r\n    <Bar\r\n        dataKey={(x) => this.getData(0, x)}\r\n        fill={COLORS[0]}\r\n        barSize={15}\r\n        minPointSize={2}\r\n        isAnimationActive={this.props.isAnimationActive}\r\n        label={(x) => this.getCustomLabel(0, x, this.props.data)}\r\n    />\r\n    <Bar\r\n        dataKey={(x) => this.getData(1, x)}\r\n        fill={COLORS[1]}\r\n        barSize={15}\r\n        minPointSize={2}\r\n        isAnimationActive={this.props.isAnimationActive}\r\n        label={(x) => this.getCustomLabel(1, x, this.props.data)}\r\n    />\r\n```\r\n\r\nand using function like:\r\n```\r\n    getCustomLabel(ix, props, data)\r\n    {\r\n        const {x, y, fill, value, index, offset, width, height} = props;\r\n        const d = data[index].data[ix];\r\n        return <text\r\n            x={x+3}\r\n            y={y+16}\r\n            dy={-4}\r\n            fontSize='12'\r\n            fontFamily='sans-serif'\r\n            fill='white'\r\n            textAnchor=\"left\">${d.min} / ${d.avg} / ${d.max}</text>\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI still need to update this so the min, avg and max are positioned properly on the X axis, but am able to get chart data into the label function.  I'm wondering if it's possible to customize the ticks in such a way, for example, in the [RadarChart](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleRadarChart), style History to red, because the student have low score.\r\n\r\nSo far I can only style all ticks with same color, is there a way to achieve this? Thanks! @xile611 Thanks, it works like a charm, really appreciate your demo!  I've been playing around with Recharts for the past couple of days and am finding the Tooltip animation very inconsistent. This could be due to the animation changing on every mouse move.\r\n\r\nHere's a demo where I've extended the animationDuration to exaggerate what happens.\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/Billsy/un16cwkd/3/\r\n\r\nIf you move from one bar to another slowly (keeping your mouse on the same Y axis) you can see the animation. However, move your mouse and the Tooltip jumps to your mouse position.\r\n\r\nisAnimationActive={false} doesn't solve the issue and I also think this could be making the Tooltip appear jerky when the duration is shorter. Nice example.\r\nThis looks like the animation starts from the previous point to the new mouse location each mouse update.\r\nIf the mouse has moved a lot, the animation starts to play and the box starts to slide between the old and new locations.\r\nHowever, _during an animation_, if the mouse moves a tiny amount more, the box snaps to the previous new location, then animates across the tiny distance.\r\n\r\nThis is my best guess...  The graph is offset by some default values which leaves so much blank space around the graph.how to reduce the offset.I am using composedchart with bar and line and i would like to reduce the offset between svg container start and the graph start.\r\n I don't have XAxis in my chart and I set margin-left to -40 to make out for the unnecessary blank space. If this is the desired approach, I am fine with that, but it's nasty.

I would like to know if it's possible to create lines dynamically.\r\n\r\nSo this is my chart:\r\n```\r\n<LineChart data={this.data}>\r\n            <XAxis dataKey=\"name\"/>\r\n            <YAxis/>\r\n            <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\r\n            <Tooltip/>\r\n            <Legend />\r\n            <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" />\r\n</LineChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd my data looks like this:\r\n[{\"channel_id\":1,\"date_time\":\"2016-08-12 10:22:04\",\"value\":43,\"created_at\":\"2016-10-19 12:26:05\",\"updated_at\":\"2016-10-19 12:26:05\"},\r\n{\"channel_id\":2,\"date_time\":\"2016-08-12 08:49:04\",\"value\":14,\"created_at\":\"2016-10-19 12:26:05\",\"updated_at\":\"2016-10-19 12:26:05\"},\r\n{\"channel_id\":2,\"date_time\":\"2016-08-12 07:44:04\",\"value\":29,\"created_at\":\"2016-10-19 12:26:05\",\"updated_at\":\"2016-10-19 12:26:05\"}]\r\n\r\nBut than a 1000 more.\r\nNow the thing is that I have to create a line for every unique channel_id. But I don't know the amount of unique channel_id's on forehand. \r\nSide note: The x-axis is for the value and the y-axis is for the date_time.\r\n\r\nYour answers are appreciated. Thank you for your respone, so the only way to do this is format my data.\r\nI will see if that is possible. I was able to get the `<LineChart>` to render dynamically. Can I change the color of those different line charts dynamically too? why not derive the line names directly from data structure? I have unknown list of variables that I would be plotting.. so I would like to be able to draw the lines - after I have some of the data received  **Build process:** Webpack via `create-react-app`\r\n**Modules:** ES6\r\n**Issue:** I'm having some issues getting Recharts to work with my ES6 configuration. This is the module import statement ([image](http://image.prntscr.com/image/62981871d2b9400583ad27dd9e8d59b6.png)), and this is the component using Recharts ([image](http://image.prntscr.com/image/c81f0d3b0db54377ba6ceb61010cf3ed.png)). I'm getting this output([image](http://image.prntscr.com/image/2542654d300742eaaf2694f0efb0734e.png)) that appears to show a library component with an erroneous element name. It is also not showing any output in the DOM.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice if there was a more robust getting started guide on your site. Currently, it just gives one example without showing how you import the given components, and does not indicate for ES6 users that you need to import each chart/element module individually. (even the examples just show ES5 implementations) ES6/Webpack is the *de facto* way to write React apps nowadays, so there really isn't a good reason why this has been overlooked. Thank you @xile611.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that I did not receive any Javascript errors; is this normal? I thought an erroneous value set by a dev should throw an error, which added to my confusion of the actual problem.    When I am updating view with new props, this ERROR come up.\r\nBut I don't know if it was Recharts problem.\r\n\r\nhere is the detail:\r\n\r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'props' of undefined\r\n    at isChildrenEqual (ReactUtils.js:341)\r\n    at CategoricalChartWrapper.componentWillReceiveProps (generateCategoricalChart.js:356)\r\n    at ReactCompositeComponent.js:611\r\n    at measureLifeCyclePerf (ReactCompositeComponent.js:75)\r\n    at ReactCompositeComponentWrapper.updateComponent (ReactCompositeComponent.js:610)\r\n    at ReactCompositeComponentWrapper.receiveComponent (ReactCompositeComponent.js:547)\r\n    at Object.receiveComponent (ReactReconciler.js:125)\r\n    at Object.updateChildren (ReactChildReconciler.js:109)\r\n    at ReactDOMComponent._reconcilerUpdateChildren (ReactMultiChild.js:208)\r\n    at ReactDOMComponent._updateChildren (ReactMultiChild.js:312)\r\n\r\nversion: 0.20.0\r\n\r\nworks fine in 0.19.1  How I can draw irregular time series like this:\r\nhttp://www.highcharts.com/demo/spline-irregular-time\r\n I'd also be very interested in this.  Or to put it another way, ability to have date as an axis type on a Scatter chart. @xile611  Is there a solution? how to add this feature. ok, I found it is related with #154 . axis is number, but let axis displayName generated by a function, can solve this.\r\n @windsome I'm not sure I get your problem but if you can pre-process the data and set the axis labels as strings and the the axis as category it should work.  I was trying to wrap `<Line />` with my customized component. Like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst CurveLine = (props) => {\r\n  // do some transform with props here\r\n  return (\r\n    <Line\r\n      ....\r\n    />\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut the Line didn't render in the chart. Is there some way to do it correctly ? : ) I just ran into this issue. I'm trying to do the following:\r\n```\r\nclass MyLineChart extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <Recharts.LineChart\r\n          width={width}\r\n          height={height}\r\n          data={props.data}\r\n        >\r\n          <Recharts.CartesianGrid vertical={false} />\r\n          <Recharts.XAxis dataKey={props.xAxisDataKey} tickLine={false} axisLine={false} />\r\n          <Recharts.YAxis tickLine={false} axisLine={false} />\r\n          <Recharts.Tooltip />\r\n          {props.children}\r\n        </Recharts.LineChart>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function MyLine(props) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Recharts.Line\r\n      dataKey={props.dataKey}\r\n      stroke={props.color}\r\n      strokeWidth={3}\r\n      dot={false}\r\n    />\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ... usage\r\n\r\n<LineChart data={data} xAxisDataKey=\"time\">\r\n  <Line dataKey=\"example\" color={palette.darkGrey} />\r\n</LineChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo lines render (although the tooltip does work). thoughts? btw there's no Surface component in recharts as far as I can see. I found a workaround to customize original `<Line>` component by overwriting its default props.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { LineChart, Line as ReLine } from 'recharts';\r\n\r\n// Extends the Line component to overwrite its default props\r\nclass Line extends ReLine {\r\n  static defaultProps = {\r\n    ...ReLine.defaultProps,\r\n    // Customized props\r\n    strokeWidth: 2,\r\n    dot: false,\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\n// In real use case\r\n<LineChart data={data}>\r\n  <Line dataKey=\"example\" />\r\n</LineChart>\r\n``` I think this should be reopened as it still is an issue. The workaround from @cjies works but that's certainly not how it should be.\r\nWrapping components is a very standard thing to do in react. I believe that it should be fixed or at least it should be documented on how to do it in a proper way.\r\n\r\n@xile611  @xile611 Yes I agree I think this is still an issue.  I think that workaround is just adding more code and over declaration for wrapping components.  I have encountered the same issue. \r\n\r\nI am currently using Recharts v1.0.0 and was trying to write a wrapped component that had too much prop settings on style that hindered readability for a bar chart.  \r\n\r\n```\r\n<XAxis\r\n     domain={[0, 1]}\r\n     ticks = {[\r\n       0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1,\r\n     ]}\r\n     tickFormatter={toPercent}\r\n     tickCount={5}\r\n     type=\"number\"\r\n     tickLine={false}\r\n     tick={{fontFamily: 'Mallory', fontSize: '8px', fontWeight: 500, fill: COLOR.GREY_BAR_CHART}}\r\n     stroke={COLOR.GREY_GRID_LINE}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n// creating a wrapped component does not work\r\nexport const CustomizedXAxis = () => { \r\n    return \r\n       <XAxis>\r\n        ...\r\n       </XAxis>\r\n}\r\n\r\n// usage\r\n<BarChart>\r\n     ...\r\n     <CustomizedXAxis/>\r\n</BarChart>\r\n``` Facing same issue.\r\nMy ugly workaround is to create a function that returns the wrapped component with the desired props\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst ReLine = props => {\r\n  return <Line {...props} strokeWidth={2} />;\r\n};\r\n// and then use it like this\r\n<LineChart width={400} height={200} data={data}>\r\n        {ReLine({\r\n          type: \"monotone\",\r\n          label: \"value\",\r\n          dataKey: \"value\",\r\n          stroke: \"#137752\"\r\n        })}\r\n</LineChart>\r\n```  I could not find any example of inverted bar chart in the documentation.\r\nBasically I want horizontal bars because my x-axis datakeys are more in number and the chart becomes to wide. Is it possible to customise like this?   Documentation should mention that type props are required when using vertical layout. I used the following code and it worked.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<XAxis type=\"number\"/>\r\n<YAxis type=\"category\" dataKey=\"name\"/>\r\n```  Is there any option to make the area charts more like Google Analytics? Flat lines instead of smooth?\r\n\r\nMore like:\r\n<img width=\"356\" alt=\"a\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10688522/21470638/a3b9a9ca-cab7-11e6-9855-6b0d19365b7c.png\">\r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n<img width=\"534\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10688522/21470643/b641b51a-cab7-11e6-9b61-ed9fa7c342aa.png\">\r\n\r\nIf not, I'd like to suggest this feature. This is something people would very much want to have. Thanks for the quick reply. I knew it would be in the API and read it earlier but didn't know which option it was.\r\n\r\nIs there an option to get the dots always visible and the top border/outline thicker just like Google Analytics? Yeah, only remaining piece \u2013 can the top border be made thicker like Google Analytics? I looked at the docs for other styles and border width but didn't find that.  `<ResponsiveContainer>\r\n  <BarChart width={500} height={300} data={ plots } margin={{top: 35, right: 45, left: 45, bottom: 10}}>\r\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" axisLine={false} tickLine={false} />\r\n{keys.map(\r\n(item, i) => {\r\nreturn ( <Bar stackId=\"a\" dataKey={item} key={i} /> )\r\n})}\r\n</BarChart>\r\n</ResponsiveContainer>`\r\n\r\nI am getting errors plotting this sort of setup where keys = an array of string values of the datakeys to look for in the data object. I am not sure if this is just me and my react abilities (lack of) or if there's another way to dynamically build bars into the chart as no bar chart will be the same for it to be statically coded in a react js file. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the data object an example could be:\r\n[{name:\"name1\",a:0,b:0},{name:\"name2\",a:3,b:3}]\r\n  or\r\n[{name:\"name1\",a:0,b:0,c:1},{name:\"name2\",a:3,b:3,c:0}]\r\n\r\nIn terms of an example of the keys array this could be:\r\n['a','b'] or ['a','b','c'] or unlimited keys\r\n\r\nAny help you can offer would be greatly appreciated. thanks. It is falling over at line 176 of BarChart.js with sizeList undefined. not sure why though. Sorry my bad. version 0.14.2. Just seen: 0.18.0. Trying that now to see if I get the same thing. I am a dozy noob :) Fixed by removing the XAxis. Something in there seemed to be throwing it off and causing a null and breaking the chart. I got it all working fine after upgrading to the latest version and running an update in npm. Also removed the XAxis with the params and started again. hey presto all worked. Not sure if it was just a perfect storm of things that combined as I can't replicate it now. Thanks for your help though.  Hello,\r\n\r\nFirst of all thank you for this great library!\r\n\r\nI was looking for the ability to change the color of a Line in a LineChart depending on the value of the current point (for example a price history chart becomes green when it's cheaper than initial price and red when it's more expensive than initial price)\r\n\r\nIs it possible with the actual state of the library ? If not is someone already working on this ?  Just from a part of the line depending on the value. Something similar to applying a radial two color gradiant to the stroke (see the first part of http://www.d3noob.org/2013/01/applying-colour-gradient-to-graph-line.html?m=1)  @xile611 : Thank you a lot! :+1: \r\n\r\nIt works: [demo](http://jsfiddle.net/rntqd24h/)!\r\n\r\nYou can close this issue, thank you again Hi guys, sorry for necroposting, but this is only related to my needs topic that i've found.\r\nI need to draw  LineChart which contains only one line with dots, each segment of this line(between two dots) should be be related to value on chart, and also one of the points should be the same color of it.

Just swap the `fill` with `stroke` in a `<Line />` element instead of `<Area />` element.  Tooltip consume too much CPU load if the cursor is moved very fast. HandleMouseMove method of generateCategoricalChart reacts to mouseMove event. Handler on every tick changed state and it causes a wave of rerender. It doesn't behave the same way if you move cursor over a plot. Otherwise a lot of CPU load is allocated wich is critical fir low end devices. What do you think about adding a throttleDelay between events? Those who dont care about performace can leave throttleDelay empty. According to my tests 200ms delay decreces load from 25% to 8-10%, i attached screenshots below.\r\n\r\nI could make a pr.\r\n\r\nBefore: \r\n![default](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9361325/21359127/fdf120a8-c6fc-11e6-91b4-b1f4c938be0a.PNG)\r\n\r\nWith throttle\r\n\r\n![withthrottle](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9361325/21359139/06951b6a-c6fd-11e6-8745-bec85eaadaf5.PNG)\r\n\r\n @xile611 this [article](http://blog.revathskumar.com/2016/02/reactjs-using-debounce-in-react-components.html) has explain  @xile611 Is there a way to set the maximum height of a bar? I'm trying to make the bar labels show up on the chart but I run into problems when only one bar is showing (e.g. when there isn't any data for the other bars). In this case, that bar goes all the way to the top and the label gets hidden ([see demo](http://jsfiddle.net/matthewberkompas/n5re8vcq/5/)). Even if the label didn't get hidden, I would prefer to set a maximum height on the bar so it doesn't ever go to the top of the chart. I looked through all the props on the `Bar` component but couldn't find anything that would solve this issue.  @xile611 This workaround should fix the issue for now, thanks! In future, it would be nice if the max bar height could be set by a `maxBarHeight` prop or something similar to that.   Changing the brush bounds causes a render, which respects the bounds provided by the brush and therefore updates the graph to display the data within the brush bounds.\r\n\r\nHowever, if something _else_ causes an update, the bounds are not respected, and the full graph is rendered, despite the brush bounds being set. Try http://jsfiddle.net/b1Lb3kuk/10/\r\n\r\nSet the brush to be zoomed in\r\nthen hover over an item in the table\r\nThe view is re-rendered fully zoomed out, as the brush bounds are ignored. Tried with 20.2. This issue is _not_ solved. :( @ZephD Did you get any solution for this? Nope. 3339d6b did not solve this issue. Also having this issue, any fix planned? @xile611  27b2d33 solved it! @xile611 \r\nI'm using 1.0.0-beta.10 and this issue seems to be back.\r\nWhen my chart re-renders, the set brush range is reset to encompass all data.  ![Alt text](http://cfile30.uf.tistory.com/image/25685C3558534FA834ECE1)\r\nIs there a way to remove the border value or change the color of the pie chart?\r\nThere is no option for the border value when viewing the document.\r\n  I made a general Errorbar component that can be attached to Scatter, Line, and Bar components as a prop (example code below).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst data01 = [ { x: 100, y: 200, z: 200, errorY: [20, 30], errorX: 30 } ...]\r\n\r\n<Scatter name=\"A school\" data={data01} fill=\"#ff7300\">\r\n  <ErrorBar dataKey=\"errorY\" width={8} strokeWidth={1} width={0} stroke=\"blue\" direction=\"y\" />\r\n  <ErrorBar dataKey=\"errorX\" width={4} strokeWidth={2} opacity={0.5} stroke=\"green\" direction=\"x\" />\r\n</Scatter>\r\n```\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-16 at 6 51 11 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427089/21284011/8018a822-c3c3-11e6-85fe-525f932684d7.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-14 at 5 53 38 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427089/21209091/0f9a5372-c227-11e6-880f-10867b969643.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-16 at 7 04 02 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427089/21284002/50c505fc-c3c3-11e6-8d9f-90bcdd0574bc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n @xile611 Also, I know we talked about making this work for candlestick charts, but I actually think they are different conceptually because an error bar is a value you add onto an existing data point (similar to a label) where as a candlestick chart is an actual chart type where each point consists of four values displayed in an histogram like manner. After the error bar PR goes through I can work on the candle chart if you would like. Thanks for the feedback! \r\n\r\nOption 1 of your two ideas looks the best to me.\r\n\r\nI'll also make the error an interval instead of a single value. (My use case only needed one value but I can see how people would also need intervals.) \r\n\r\nI'll aim to have these changes done by this evening. @xile611  Let me know if anything else needs to be done before merge. I think it should be close. @xile611 I think my most recent updates covered everything you pointed out in the review.

Hi there,\r\n\r\nWe are trying to get the labels on a simple time series line chart to be centered left of and below the axes (apparently industry conventions).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we are unable to move the brush and legend down, to make space for the label, resulting in this squishy situation:\r\n\r\n![selection_039](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7287076/21108159/1668821a-c08c-11e6-93be-e4f1b6dde266.png)\r\n\r\nWe have tried adding css margins to the classes we can see of the components via the chrome devtools (e.g. class `recharts-brush`), but that seems to have no effect.\r\n\r\nSo does anyone have an idea how I can create the needed margin below the X-axis?\r\n @xile611 Ah thanks. Works well for the space around the x-axis. \r\nSince the legend appears to be outside the svg, I'll try handling that one directly with css. thx @xile611 - solved my problem  When I use CartesianGrid or XAxis on android 4.4.2 or other lower version , show the error  Object #<Object> has no method 'sign' .

Hi,\r\n\r\nSuppose I additionally have a table of the graphed XY data and an 'onHover' function which gets the X value of the table row.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to pass this X value to a Rechart for it to display the cursor (similar to the one for the tooltip) at that given value?\r\n\r\nThanks This works well.\r\nHowever, it does clash with the tooltip when using the prop \"isFront\".\r\n\r\nThank you very much. @xile611 \r\n\r\nTwo things:\r\n - The RefLine interrupts the tooltip selection - you either get one or the other\r\n - Every new render of the RefLine seems to toggle the line's state, so it shows, hides, shows, hides...\r\n\r\nAny idea why these occur? Sorry, I was not clear in my response.\r\nI think my case is a special case.\r\n\r\nOn mouse over the graph, the redux store is updated with the selected X value.\r\nThis change in state is then mapped to the graph props, which then renders the RefLine.\r\n(It also updates another graph/map, hence the reason for it).\r\n\r\nWhat I think is happening is the first time you mouse-over a value, the tooltip is rendered as expected.\r\nHowever, it triggers a redux store update, which updates the props, which causes a re-render of the graph in order to render the RefLine.\r\n\r\nI believe the tooltip is not rendered on this second render (as it already responded to it's update), making it disappear.\r\n\r\nIf you were to move the mouse on the same x-value, the tooltip does render (but this is because I do not update the redux store if the value has not changed).\r\n\r\nInteresting, no? :) http://jsfiddle.net/b1Lb3kuk/3/\r\n\r\nTry that.\r\n\r\nYou'll see a comment saying \"replace this with null\". Do that, and the problem (tool tip is not rendered) is 100% of the time, rather than only the first mouse over (tricky to do, move from one section to the next a pixel at a time). To see the problem 100% of the time, ie the tool tip will never display.\r\n\r\nAnd that's the thing. A second render occurs which resets the tooltip to not shown. Similar problem to #401. I understand your recommendation fully! I'm trying to link a map of locations with a graph of time-based data. The link between the data is the timestamp, or the X-value of the graph.\r\nUnfortunately, I would like mouse over on a **map** or the **graph** to update a single state value, and that value is mapped as props which updates the map and graph with a **marker** and **RefLine**. Oh exciting :)\r\nGood stuff :D Any chance it can be used with http://jsfiddle.net/b1Lb3kuk/3/ ? Tried with 20.2. This issue is _not_ solved. :( The problem still exists:\r\n\r\nMove your cursor VERY slowly (pixel by pixel) from one to the other.\r\nNote that the very first update to the next value does not render the tooltip (but it does render the RefLine).\r\n\r\nThis effect is very obvious when you have many many data points, ie they are all one pixel wide.\r\n\r\nSee http://jsfiddle.net/b1Lb3kuk/13/\r\nMove your curser side-to-side over the graph, note there is no tooltip.\r\nMove your curser up and down (which is similar to re-render of the same data point) and it renders the tool tip. Still not fixed with 0.22.\r\nSee http://jsfiddle.net/b1Lb3kuk/13/   **Why**\r\n\r\nI need to customize the legend items. In my case, I've added the ability to toggle elements from a chart and I want to style legend items accordingly.\r\nI could have created a custom `Legend` component for that, but I think it's a nice feature to add to the default one.\r\n\r\n**How**\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it possible by adding a `className` attribute to the `payload` property in the `Legend` component. If set, this string is appended to the other classes on the `li` element.\r\n\r\n* Tests are passing\r\n* I have updated the doc on a branch. I'll send a PR if you think this feature is worth it.

If it will be necessary i'll write one though Could be related: \r\n```\r\nCSSPropertyOperations.js:190 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'length' of object '#<CSSStyleDeclaration>'\r\nsetValueForStyles @ CSSPropertyOperations.js:190\r\n\r\nwarning.js:36 Warning: performUpdateIfNecessary: Unexpected batch number (current 2112, pending 2108)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's what is rendered:\r\n```\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n      <LineChart width={300} height={200} data={this.state.data} margin={{top: 10, right: 10, left: 10, bottom: 10}}>\r\n       <XAxis  dataKey=\"x\" type=\"number\" />\r\n       <YAxis  interval={1} hide />\r\n       <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"0.25 5\"/>\r\n       <Legend /> \r\n        <Line name=\"Frequency2\" type=\"number\"  type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"y_freq_repeat\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" strokeWidth={2}  \r\n                  connectNulls={false}  strokeDasharray=\"1 1\"/>\r\n      </LineChart>     \r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe dashed line (strokeDasharray) is drawn correctly 1 time on 2 when the data is modified (setState...). Otherwise, a full line replace it.\r\n \r\n**To solve the issue for now:**\r\nI avoid using strokeDasharray in <Line...> parameters or I add isAnimationActive={false} to it.\r\n\r\nI'm a beginner at web development. But I believe the issue has something to do with the mix of strokeDasharray and animation. The use of strokeDasharray isn't documented for Recharts line :    [http://recharts.org/api#Line](http://recharts.org/api#Line). So is this an unsupported parameter?\r\n @ShortandSweet Yes, this was the cause of my error. Rerencering a linechart with StrokeDasharray causes chart to crash. Removing it solved this issue Live example : \r\n[http://jsfiddle.net/x1yoboc7/249/](http://jsfiddle.net/x1yoboc7/249/)\r\n\r\nWhen New data is press, the dashed line is redraw as a full line. Still experiencing this bug. Initial renders of lines with stroke-Dasharray are fine, but on a setState rerender, they cause my chrome tab to completely freeze (no script error comes up).\r\n\r\nIssue is fixed by passing `isAnimationActive={false}` to the line, or removing `stroke-Dasharray`.\r\n\r\nTested it on firefox and same thing happens, firefox reports that \"A web page is slowing down your browser, what do you want to do, wait or stop it\"\r\n\r\nJust to reiterate, it's not a script error, and is happening during the webpage rendering (painting?) phase.

However, it doesn't look like you guys are using CSS to do this so I'm unsure how to go about it. Is it _possible_ to do this and if so, would someone be willing to show me an example? I would really appreciate it! Sweet! Thanks again @xile611. This is a huge help.  Let me know if I need to add tests or make any changes. I'll add to the api docs once the change is integrated.\r\n\r\nHere are example pictures of the current implementation:\r\nBasic bar chart with error bars:\r\n<img width=\"384\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-05 at 11 33 20 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427089/20899659/26ff0358-bae0-11e6-89d8-20f5dba5edde.png\">\r\n\r\nVertical bar chart with error bar color and width options changes:\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-05 at 11 41 17 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427089/20899677/3dc172d8-bae0-11e6-8a33-8abbba89d6c4.png)\r\n\r\n I just opened a new pull request.  It would be great if it were possible to pass a function that evaluates to a data points value instead of passing a `dataKey`\r\n\r\ni.e.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<Line dataKey=\"uv\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould be equivalent to\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<Line value={ (data, index) => data[index][\"uv\"] } />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would allow Recharts to make less assumptions about the passed `data`s format and would enable more use cases like computing values Would be great, common use-case is to compute the value by adding multiple values together, or to access nested values (ie, `data.users.count`) In my opinion it would be much better for `value` (or whatever the data accessor function's prop name is) to take a function `Array.map` would take, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Line value={ record => record.uv } />\r\n<Line value={ (record, index) => record.uv } />\r\n<Line value={ (record, index, data) => record.uv } />\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould this disrupt the current codebase much? Based on `dataKey` being a string I suspected that under the hood the data is simply retrieved by something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst { dataKey, data /* wherever this comes from */ } = this.props\r\nconst values = data.map(record => record[dataKey])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo here the mapper function could be simply dropped in\r\n @xile611 I think passing nested keys misses out on a lot of the flexibility enabled by a mapper function and is also a breaking change, since\r\n```\r\n{  a.b.c: 1  }\r\n```\r\nis a valid object.\r\n\r\n@bali182's solution seems ideal. @tarrencev agree, a mapper function gives way more flexibility. By the way, nested paths could be easily achieved with an helper function such as `get` in `lodash`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { get } from 'lodash/fp'\r\n...\r\n<Line value={get('a.b.c')} />\r\n...\r\n```\r\n @xile611  that's great news!  I'm not trying to pry, but wouldn't it semantically make more sense to not call the function version `dataKey`? Maybe keep dataKey as it is and introduce a new property? I know it would introduce some  complexity to check that dataKey and let's say dataFn are mutually exclusive, and also mess with proptypes, so it might not such a good idea. But passing a function to a prop named dataKey seems a bit strange... @xile611 I understand, but in the case that someone is currently using a object with a \"nested key string\" as the key, like \r\n```\r\n[{ today.a: 1 }]\r\n````\r\nintroducing nested key strings would be a breaking change. Doesn't affect me, but just wanted to make sure it's considered I see that commit reverted. Any updates for nested data keys? @raviteja83  @erayalakese using a function works for me\r\n\r\n```js\r\n//data=[{ ttt: 'a', asd: 12 }, { ttt: 'b', asd: 32 }, { ttt: 'c', asd: 55 },]\r\n\trender() {\r\n\t\tlet getVal = (x)=>{return x.asd;}\r\n\t\tlet getName = (x)=>{return x.ttt;}\r\n\t\treturn (\r\n\t\t\t<LineChart width={730} height={250} data={this.state.data}\r\n\t\t\t\tmargin={{ top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5 }}>\r\n\t\t\t\t<CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t<XAxis dataKey={getName} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<YAxis />\r\n\t\t\t\t<Tooltip />\r\n\t\t\t\t<Legend />\r\n\t\t\t\t<Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey={getVal} stroke=\"#8884d8\" />\r\n\t\t\t</LineChart>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n``` Using a function is great. However, the legend key has no name, now. How to set? Use \"name\" field. Can the documentation for `Area` and `Bar` be updated to reflect this prop can take a function (assuming they can?) I'm getting the following warning when setting `dataKey` to a callback function:\r\n\r\n`Warning: Encountered two children with the same key`\r\n\r\nThis is my callback function:\r\n```\r\n\r\n        const getVal = (val) => {\r\n           if(x === \"something\")\r\n               val[x]/1000\r\n           else\r\n               val[x]\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return (\r\n          <Area\r\n            key={x}\r\n            dataKey={getVal}\r\n            type=\"monotone\"\r\n            name=\"test\"\r\n            unit=\"cm\"\r\n          />\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `x` is a variable taking on different string values.  http://jsbin.com/ukaxod/144/embed?js,output\r\n\r\nPlease excuse me if this is not the place to do this kind of question. Let me know and I'll delete it.\r\nThanks That demo was awesome! Works like a charm. Thanks! That demo doesn't seem to work anymore unfortunately.  Does anyone have a working example?  Hi \r\nIs there a way to add a custom tooltip on hover of each cell in StackedBar chart? \r\nUsing the code below we can hover over each stacked bar but not on each cell\r\n`<Bar dataKey='uv' onClick={this.handleClick}>\r\n            {\r\n              data.map((entry, index) => (\r\n                <Cell cursor=\"pointer\" fill={index === activeIndex ?

Thanks @xile611 Thanks a lot  Simple example with a **Scatter** \r\n```\r\n<ScatterChart width={600} height={400} margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20 }}>\r\n      \t<XAxis dataKey={0} name=\"stature\" unit=\"cm\" />\r\n      \t<YAxis dataKey={1} name=\"weight\" unit=\"kg\" />\r\n        <CartesianGrid />\r\n      \t<Tooltip cursor={{ strokeDasharray: '3 3' }} />\r\n      \t<Scatter name=\"A school\" data={**test**} fill=\"#8884d8\" line shape=\"cross\" />\r\n</ScatterChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere **test** is array of arrays\r\nconst test = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]];\r\n\r\nIt works, but I get Warnings\r\n\r\n> Failed prop type: Invalid prop `points[0].payload` of type `array` supplied to `AnimationDecorator(Scatter)`, expected `object`.\r\n>     in AnimationDecorator(Scatter) (created by FocusChart)\r\n>     in ScatterChart\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n> Failed prop type: Invalid prop `points[0].payload` of type `array` supplied to `Scatter`, expected `object`.\r\n>     in Scatter (created by AnimationDecorator(Scatter))\r\n>     in AnimationDecorator(Scatter)\r\n\r\nAs it works with array of arrays properly  it would be good if in TypeProps will be both array and object  Referencing the following example:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<ComposedChart layout=\"vertical\" data={data} onClick={::this.requestTagsWithPattern} >\r\n  <XAxis type=\"number\"/>\r\n  <YAxis dataKey=\"name\" type=\"category\" width={300} onClick={::this.requestTagsWithPattern}/>\r\n  <CartesianGrid stroke=\"#f5f5f5\"/>\r\n  <Tooltip/>\r\n  <Legend />\r\n  <Bar dataKey=\"OS\" barSize={20} fill=\"#8884d8\" />\r\n</ComposedChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes  `onClick` work for `XAxis` and `YAxis`? When `onClick` is set on `ComposedChart`, it triggers when `Bar` is clicked and I am able to obtain the values from element returned, but none of the other components under `ComposedChart` seem to trigger the handler. I put the `onClick` event on `YAxis` and that does cause the handler to trigger, however `YAxis` only returns `null`. Is there  a way I can get the value of the `YAxis` on click? For example, if the label on `YAxis` **A** is clicked - return element containing value **A**.  @xile611 Super! Thanks for the continued great support.

Thanks for taking the time to do this @xile611.  One more question: is there a way to change the _color_ of a bar when you hover over it @xile611?  @xile611 I have a _stacked_ bar chart so I'm looking to make the _whole_ bar change color when I hover over one part of it and not just that single part of the bar like it does [in this example](http://jsfiddle.net/matthewberkompas/wa87o60f/). Is that possible?  @xile611 This answers my questions. Thanks a ton for your help here!   The current animation options are true and false, and when true, the entire chart is redrawn from scratch on every data update. This is fine for static data that is set once or possibly updated by user action, but it's not useful for real-time data where updates are coming in periodically. The \"solution\" for now is to disable animation. But I'd like to suggest a third animation option: morph. In this mode, the graph would morph from its present state to the state with the new data. This would make for a very smooth display of real-time data. @Eric24 Did you implement any kind of workaround in the meantime?  I turned off animation for now but not a great alternative... @kartboy16 - I just turned off animation. It's not a major issue for us. \"Delta\" animation would be great, but it doesn't affect the functionality of our application. @xile611 it's awesome that the library is so actively maintained! Thank you! would like to see this too  @kartboy16 I managed to do what @Eric24 was describing, but only by preventing the data being sent within my `actions` if it was the same as it was last time.\r\n\r\nThis caused some re-factoring but now makes my charts more dumb which I like. how to do smoothly update? is there a solution?\r\nset `isAnimationActive={false}` on `<Line/>` ? Looking forward to progress on this. Having a pie chart section \"expand\" when it's value increases will be amazing. I'm very interested in seeing this happen. We are considering using Recharts as one of our primary charting libraries, but we need the animations to update from the past value vs from zero. If having additional people working on it could help, myself and a coworker are willing to contribute. Just another note to send much love to you guys, and add a +1 to this issue. I know you're working on it, so yeah, just saying I appreciate it.  +1 for the RadialBarChart. I see that the Animation Refactor landed in 1.0.0 beta, but transitioning between datasets is still kind of wonky - are there plans for additional updates in this area? I think there is currently a bug with the Customized Label. If you go to http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/PieChartWithCustomizedLabel directly, the customized label will be drawn. But if you go to any other link first such as http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleScatterChart then click on \"PieChartWithCustomizedLabel\", then the customized label won't be drawn. @camflan I ended up adding a `key` prop to the component based on `data` to force a re-draw. Any update on the smooth transition? Victory charts handles this smoothly but if possible I'd like to use recharts, this is holding me back.  I added babel-plugin-lodash along with babel-plugin-recharts to the webpack config, and it reduced the size of the output. I thought this might be a useful tip to others.\r\n\r\nThanks for a great library \ud83d\udc4d   Hi, \r\n\r\nI'm getting the following error and warning on npm install:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install recharts --save\r\n\r\n> canvas@1.6.2 install /Users/sylvain/uplab/dashboard-react/node_modules/canvas\r\n> node-gyp rebuild\r\n\r\n./util/has_lib.sh: line 31: pkg-config: command not found\r\ngyp: Call to './util/has_lib.sh freetype' returned exit status 0 while in binding.gyp. while trying to load binding.gyp\r\ngyp ERR! configure error \r\ngyp ERR! stack Error: `gyp` failed with exit code: 1\r\ngyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.onCpExit (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/lib/configure.js:305:16)\r\ngyp ERR! stack     at emitTwo (events.js:106:13)\r\ngyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:191:7)\r\ngyp ERR! stack     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:204:12)\r\ngyp ERR!

See example, please\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/vaeum/7begLcrb/ Hello, bug not resolve ((\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/vaeum/dmeaodhc/4/  We have `document` available in the backend, th `isSrv` check for that and them renders and give a bad checksum because of the animations probably.\r\n\r\nEx:\r\n```\r\n(client) d=\"clipPath1480374909864\" data-reactid=\" (server) d=\"clipPath1480374908124\" data-reactid=\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould be nice if we could pass a prop or context to tell it's being rendered by the server. That way anyone can patch the way they want to tell that is a server rendering.\r\n\r\nThis is with animations disabled, I'm using pie chart. detect the environment is not a responsibility of recharts, any implementation you do will fail over time with different environments javascript contexts (window/global are contexts, React context is another thing).\r\n\r\nThis is a good use-case for React Context:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nRechartsComponent.contextTypes = {\r\n  rechartsServerRendering: React.PropTypes.bool\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your component you can get using:\r\n```js\r\nthis.context.rechartsServerRendering\r\n// or pure functions\r\nfunction RechartsComponent(props, context) {\r\n  context.rechartsServerRendering\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet the developer implement their logic to detect the server side.\r\n\r\nIf you want to launch a version that deprecates your isSsrv implementation without breaking the current implementation, check if that context variable is `undefined` if it's, uses the old implementation otherwise trust in the boolean from `context.rechartsServerRendering`.\r\n\r\nI suggest a long name, because contexts will transverse the whole application, and if you use `serverRendering` it might conflict with other projects implementations.\r\n\r\nMore info at: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html\r\n\r\nA good example in how contexts are implemented correctly is react-router, they use to transport their router instance over to the children components of `<Router>`.\r\n\r\nYou can use the same approach creating a context element called `<Recharts>` where the dev can add to the root of his react structure and define global configs such as `serverRendering`, ex:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Recharts serverRendering={ myLogicReturnsBoolean() }>\r\n  <MyProject structure>\r\n    ... other recharts components anywhere here will know if is server rendering\r\n  </MyProject>\r\n</Recharts>\r\n```  I recently want to build a graph with boxplot and scatters graph mixed like G2 did.\r\n[https://g2.alipay.com/demo/01-point/jitter.html](url)\r\n\r\nCan Rechats build that ? Is it supported now ?  Is there a way to omit a specific line/bar/area/etc. from the legend and tooltip, other than using a custom content for these? It would be desirable to be able to control what data series appear in the legend and tooltip at the data series component level. Yes, I understand that no SDK can possibly meet all needs without customization, but this seems fairly trivial. All I'm looking for is a way to \"hide\" a child component from appearing in the legend and tooltip. So for example, a Line chart with several Line components where I don't one one or two of those components to appear in the legend/tooltip; by default, all components would appear as they do now, but if I were to set \"hide\" to true, it would be omitted. As the internal code that builds the legend or tooltip goes through the list of child components, it simply skips any with \"hide\" set to true. Sounds interesting; it would be more flexible overall, but I still think a simple boolean include/omit prop on the child component itself would be useful as well. Two possible thoughts:\r\n\r\n1) Use the existing 'legendType' prop, and omit the data component from both tooltip and legend if it is set to false.\r\n\r\n2) Add a new prop called 'legendMode', with options:\r\ntrue (default) - Include in both tooltip and legend\r\nfalse - Omit from both tooltip and legend\r\n'tooltip' - Include in tooltip only\r\n'legend' - Include in legend only\r\n\r\nOption 1 is probably simpler (and works fine for my use case); option 2 is more flexible (and might work for more use cases). +1,  recently had this when showing distribution margins around a data line,  of similar colour (so no legend needed).\r\nNot sure how to remove these margins from the legend.\r\n\r\n> but I still think a simple boolean include/omit prop on the child component itself would be useful as well.\r\n\r\nMakes sense to me.   Just like how you set the legend icon. Any possibility to see this in the next release? Even option 1 (\"legendType\"=false) would be a tremendous help, and doing that wouldn't preclude the possibility of adding the more flexible \"legendMode\" option in the future. here is some options used in other native framework, like MpAndroidChart:\r\n\r\nthe Line itself has a prop named \"highlightEnabled\", if it is set to false, it still has legend, but not displayed in tooltip. And most important. it is not selectable.\r\n\r\nlike pic in  #563  , data in refer line is very very dense, and user data is sparse.  In current recharts, it is impossible to select x of user line dot.  if refer line 's 'highlightEnabled' is false,  then it will make it very easy to highlight user line's dot. I also need this, and am willing to submit a PR if we can agree on an approach.  My suggestion would be to add `none` to the options available to `legendType`.  If `legendType='none'`, the legend would be omitted for that component.  That's what I intuitively tried without checking if it was possible, and I was sad when it didn't work.  ;) @IanVS : legendType='none' is probably fine, although there is a precedent for legendType=false (lots of other props use false to mean \"do not render\", like line.dot, line.label, etc.) I'm not picky.  I'd be willing to implement whatever the project maintainers are willing to accept.  What do you think, @xile611?  I believe a composed chart automatically leaves room for bar charts, even if none are defined (extra space to the left and right side, extra-wide cursor, etc.). That makes sense if the chart was going to contain a bar, but not if it only contains lines and areas. Is there a recommended way to eliminate the extra \"bar\" room from the composed chart? Well, yes, \"point\" works as described, but: a) It only works if the axis type=category (my use-case is type=number); and b) with scale=point (and type=category), the \"bars\" in my composed chart are not rendered at all. Hi @xile611 - I ran into the same problem @Eric24 had/has, and it seems that removing the `barSize` prop from `Bar` makes the bars in the composed chart no longer render.\r\n\r\nUpdated fiddle [here](http://jsfiddle.net/z3wx6zm3/1/). Is this intended? Thanks so much! @Eric24 I also am experiencing this issue. Were you able to find a workable strategy for a composed chart with `Line` and `Area` components  and no `Bar` components? @Malachi-M : I ended up using the type=point suggestion from @xile611 and that worked for my use-case.  Recharts is injecting className into many of its React rendered elements. Out of the box Recharts doesn't need classnames, but they're added presumably as a convenience for those who want to use CSS to style or customise their charts or to add custom CSS based animation.\r\n\r\nGiven that the DOM is far and away the biggest cause for poor performance in SVG based charts, and React itself will add some overhead, I suggest making it possible to disable classnames altogether, certainly on the elements that are repeated (e.g. Bar, Cell in a stacked bar chart). This would reduce an additional DOM attribute that needs to be reconciled by React and interpreted by the browser, and might lead to a few percent better performance.\r\n\r\nAs discussed here:\r\nhttps://github.com/recharts/recharts/commit/e2957375b20ac6864212aae037a6bf1fa1d297e1#commitcomment-19952106\r\n\r\nThis is currently theoretical. I haven't tried it to measure the actual benefit.  Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm creating a scatter plot, however I'm adding my own mouse so I can implement a rectangular selection. Given my mouse coordinates, is there any way I can calculate what the cartesian coordinates should be, eg:\r\n\r\ngetCartesianCoordinatesForMouse(mouseX, mouseY, width, height,...)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nChris Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply. Unfortunately I can't use this, as I'm using hammer.js to support touch interaction. I need some way to obtain the cartesian (chart) coordinates given some mouse coordinates. Also from looking at the code chartX/chartY are generated using:\r\n\r\nexport const calculateChartCoordinate = (event, offset) => (\r\n  {\r\n    chartX: Math.round(event.pageX - offset.left),\r\n    chartY: Math.round(event.pageY - offset.top),\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n\r\nSo this doesn't actually give the cartesian coordinates, it gives the coordinates offset by the chart axes.\r\n\r\nI think I need to use d3 scales. A bit of background. We're trying to add marquee rectangular drag selection to create a database query that will filter the points by their real X and Y data values (not pixels).\r\n\r\nI can do this if I have access to your d3 scale which is internally as xAxis.scale() (in fact I'll want xAxis.scale.invert() to convert pixel values to data values). However you don't expose this anywhere that I can get at easily - e.g. it's not in the props of any customisable elements.\r\n\r\nI'd like to make the change and put together a PR but I'd like to know how you would prefer to architect a solution. I need to be able to query, for a given (e.g.) ScatterChart, the xAxis and yAxis objects that you're currently initialising in `ScatterChart.render()`. \r\n\r\nCurrently I'm looking at rendering a hidden ReferenceArea or something, because these include xAxis and yAxis in their props. Then using a React ref to expose this. This is quite a nasty hack. +1 FWIW, you can sort of hack around this by setting a custom label class that calls a passed through props function to update the state with the dots x and y. with all of your dots x antd y values if you sort them by x and sort your original data by x you can match them up.   I have the following legend code:\r\n`<Legend\r\n    align='right'\r\n    verticalAlign='top'\r\n    height=36\r\n    iconSize=10\r\n/>`\r\n\r\nThis works as expected in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, MSEdge\r\nBut in ie11, the positioning is wrong.\r\n\r\nMy workaround: to add custom css top: -60px specifically for ie11\r\n\r\nSee attached screen shots.\r\n![ie11legendbug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10929533/20576130/69648c22-b171-11e6-980d-598278fa61b3.jpg)\r\n![chromelegendnobug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10929533/20576136/70ea8fa0-b171-11e6-9e0f-e3427118022e.jpg)\r\n Hello, add this css code in your project\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.recharts-legend-item .recharts-surface{\r\n  height: ${your icon height in pixels};\r\n}\r\n``` Thanks. I was doing complicated things with ie-11 browser selection. I prefer this browser agnostic solution.  Given that your library has a dependency on react-dom-server and that the good folks at React state 'We don't recommend using React DOM Server on the client in most cases'; are there any plans to remove this dependency or separate it out into a second library?  https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/component/Legend.js#L5\r\n\r\nremove this line ?  With the 0.19 release; the tooltip when using bar is acting strange.  Before, I was using onMouseEnter of BarChart to get data.x (which would set/position the tooltip in the middle of a sized bar).  But now, it seems it doesn't matter what I set for position or coordinate, the tooltip doesn't move. Its stuck in the top-left corner.\r\n\r\nIn addition; the data passed changes depending where I hover over (from top, left, etc) - see 2nd screen capture below.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-11-23 at 9 23 32 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7296078/20569768/809174d6-b15e-11e6-8b49-dd1e87a79e16.png)\r\n![screen shot 2016-11-23 at 9 23 24 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7296078/20569773/82a86090-b15e-11e6-9542-babfc79785eb.png)\r\n But wouldn't the unified payload be the same regardless where the mouse enters the chart?  The log above was using the exact same chart; however, the X/Y changed based on if I hovered **from** the top,left,etc of the chart.  I have a pie and line chart on one React file and either the pie chart will load or the line chart will load. There is no observable pattern, both charts are grabbing data from componentWillMount.  I setup a simple demo with react ssr. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from 'react'\r\nimport {\r\n  LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend\r\n} from 'recharts'\r\n\r\nconst data = [\r\n  {name: 'Page A', uv: 4000, pv: 2400, amt: 2400},\r\n  {name: 'Page B', uv: 3000, pv: 1398, amt: 2210},\r\n  {name: 'Page C', uv: 2000, pv: 9800, amt: 2290},\r\n  {name: 'Page D', uv: 2780, pv: 3908, amt: 2000},\r\n  {name: 'Page E', uv: 1890, pv: 4800, amt: 2181},\r\n  {name: 'Page F', uv: 2390, pv: 3800, amt: 2500},\r\n  {name: 'Page G', uv: 3490, pv: 4300, amt: 2100},\r\n]\r\n\r\nconst width = 600\r\nconst height = 300\r\n\r\nexport default class Chart extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div style={{width: `${width}px`, height: `${height}px`}}>\r\n        <LineChart width={width} height={height} data={data}\r\n          margin={{left: 0, top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0}}>\r\n          <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" />\r\n          <YAxis stroke=\"#666\" />\r\n          <Line\r\n            type=\"monotone\"\r\n            dataKey=\"pv\"\r\n            stroke=\"#8884d8\"\r\n            strokeDasharray=\"5 5\"\r\n            isAnimationActive={false}\r\n          />\r\n        </LineChart>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the browser always throw the Warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: React attempted to reuse markup in a container but the checksum was invalid. \r\nThis generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. \r\nReact injected new markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the benefits of server rendering. \r\nInstead, figure out why the markup being generated is different on the client or server:\r\n (client) 540\" height=\"30\" x=\"573.3359375\" y=\"276\"\r\n (server) 540\" height=\"30\" x=\"600\" y=\"276\" stroke=printWarning\r\n```\r\n\r\nI refresh the browser many time seeing that, the last tick of the x and y axises always move positions when rendering changes. Looks like the axises was recalculated in the client rendering.\r\n\r\nThe client rendering was correct\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4800338/20531973/59cbf312-b113-11e6-8074-891b06ceeed1.png)\r\n\r\nThe server rendering wasn't\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4800338/20532046/8e49123c-b113-11e6-8c42-7cb0912c78e3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n @xile611 Thanks for explanation! I' ll just ignore the warnings.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I was trying to generate a SVG graph by SSR. Now I just render the `<LineChart>` and got the structure like `<div ...><svg /></div>`. And then erase the string of `<div/>`, send SVG content to the client. Is there any other way to get it work better or easier ? : )\r\n @xile611 Thanks!\r\n\r\nI found that `src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js` rendered a div wrapped `<Surface />`. I guess you could provide a way only render the chart SVG without the container, Tooltip and Legend. SVGs usually are regarded as static image, they don't need too much interaction.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for replying my questions. : ) Sorry for reopening this issue, but I'm just wondering is there any way to provide all necessary information to render charts properly on the server side?  Same question with @Havret \uff0creplace string from `<div>` to `<svg>` is really a hack. I'm curious about this too. I am as well  @xile611 I added a maxHeight definition to `lib/component/ResponsiveContainer.js` that might be helpful for others.  I didn't see a way to contribute to the npm recharts, so I apologize if this isn't the venue for that.  \r\n\r\n**Added** `maxHeight = _props.maxHeight,` line 125\r\n\r\n\r\n**Added**: `if(maxHeight && (calculatedHeight > maxHeight)) calculatedHeight = maxHeight;` after `calculatedHeight = calculatedWidth / aspect;` on line 138\r\n\r\n**Usage**\r\n`<ResponsiveContainer width=\"100%\" aspect={ 2 } maxHeight={ this.props.maxHeight || 400 }>`\r\n\r\n\r\nHope this helps someone. Thanks @xile611 -- I submitted a PR.  It seems like there is no way to use different formatters per axis inside the Tooltip.\r\n\r\nI have a LineChart with 2 Y axis, left is money and right is regular number. So I made a formatter to show the $ symbol, but it is displaying for both labels. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to make one formatter for each axis?\r\n\r\nThanks Ahh, awesome. Thanks!   I didn't see a formal way to do this, so I passed `status` as the `ZAxis` value. \r\n![Custom Tooltip](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3874813/20497404/f8c44366-aff6-11e6-933b-8bdff158d6e1.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ScatterChart width={400} height={400} margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20 }}>\r\n        ...\r\n        <ZAxis dataKey={'status'} name='status' />\r\n        <CartesianGrid />\r\n        <Tooltip cursor={{ strokeDasharray: '3 3' }} content={<CustomTooltip />} />\r\n</ScatterChart>\r\n```\r\nthen retrieved it as a payload value.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport function CustomTooltip(props) {\r\n  if (props.active) {\r\n    const { payload } = props;\r\n    // console.log(payload);\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className='custom-tooltip'>\r\n        <p className='desc'>{`${beingAsEmoji(payload[2].value)}`}</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course this prevents me from using the ZAxis value as intended. \r\nIf there really is no formal way to do this, I'd like to take a shot at a PR, to add an optional string/object to the payload like so:\r\n```\r\n<ScatterChart width={400} height={400} margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20 }}>\r\n        <XAxis dataKey={'x'} name='x' allowDecimals={true} />\r\n        ...\r\n        <Custom dataKey={'status'} name='status' />\r\n        ...\r\n</ScatterChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like the payload values are set in [/chart/ScatterChart.js](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/ScatterChart.js).\r\nI'd like to confirm if the changes would be localized there (in addition to tests).\r\n\r\nPlease advise. Hey @xile611 I see your commit, but I'm not clear on how I would make use of the changes. MInd adding an example here?  I'm using stacked bars, but the set of stacks is different per bar. I think this is not the use case the current design is for.\r\n\r\nI have about 20 bars, and 20 stacks per bar. There are about 400 unique stack values, since this is a categorical hierarchy (e.g. bars are countries, stacks are cities).\r\n\r\nSo for every bar+stack combination (400x) I'm rendering a `<Bar>`. After rendering, each of those further contains an `<Animate><g>` for every bar (20x), despite only one per bar+stack combination actually containing anything graphical inside that `<g>` (`<Rectangle><Animate><Animate><path>`).\r\n\r\nSo that's unnecessarily complex for React to manage, and is unsuitable for this kind of data breakdown.\r\n\r\nThe data model per object is:\r\n* name (the unique key on the X axis) e.g. \"France\"\r\n* stack_Paris (the height of stack for Paris)\r\n* stack_Marseille\r\n* stack_LeMans\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\nI've considered remapping the data values such that I assign a number (from zero) for each per-bar stack, and giving Recharts just the indexes, and custom renderers for labelling and colouring rectangles. It's a bit messy but should reduce the complexity significantly (down to 400x rather than 400x20x)\r\n\r\nBefore I press on with this somewhat dirty workaround, I'd be interested to hear if there are any other ways I can structure this.\r\n\r\nI'd like to raise the issue that Recharts is creating unnecessary `<Animate><g>` elements for missing (either null or absent) object atttributes for dataKey. It would be better if it we could skip them altogether, removing the 20x part of the complexity here.\r\n\r\nAlso, why two `Animate` in `<Rectangle><Animate><Animate><path>`?\r\n\r\n(Also, the `<Animate>` elements are adding overhead to React (I've not measured how much), and would like to be able to drop them when animation isn't in use.) Fantastic!\r\n\r\nNot sure I understand the first point. I think of stacked bars as a hierarchy: bars (columns) then stacks (cells). You have effectively the inverse, stacks (plots) then bars (cells), which becomes inefficient where stack keys are unique per bar.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the fixes, and perhaps it will be sufficiently improved in performance in this scenario.\r\n\r\nThanks! See here\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/L00kcpvr/\r\n\r\nThis simple example has 6 visual elements (bar x stack combinations), but demonstrates some issues that arise when you have 500 visual elements (e.g. 25 bars, 20 stacks, possibly unique to each bar).\r\n\r\n(I think I was objecting to the need for `<Bar>` per visual element - but I'm not sure that it's a problem, now I look at it again. Instead, I'll give more detail on the other points you've already answered.)\r\n\r\nBoth the React tree and the DOM tree have significant inefficiencies in number of DOM/React elements. \r\n\r\nFor example in pure DOM (I can't see the React debugger via Jsfiddle), this simple 6 (bar x stack) view results in 7 DOM elements per visual element = 42 DOM elements ('g', 'path'), but it should ideally be at most 2 'g' and 1 'path' per (bar x stack) = 18 DOM elements.  \r\n\r\nE.g. with 500 visual elements, currently 3500 DOM elements, beyond acceptable performance for SVG, this would become 1500 DOM elements.\r\n\r\nIf (by removing all 'g' and using 'path' geometry directly) it could collapse further to just a 'path' element per visual element, performance would be further improved e.g. for 500 visual elements, just 500 DOM elements.\r\n\r\nI feel that there are common cases where you have around 500 visual elements, but not dramatically more (stacking would become a riot of tiny coloured slices).\r\n\r\nI know you've already answered some of these issues above. But this serves as a good example for this issue.\r\n\r\n(Also note, the tooltip isn't stack-specific.)\r\n (link updated) Hey - sorry for commenting on such an old issue.

Hey, \r\n\r\nI've been trying Recharts for some charts, looks great and easy to use. \r\nHowever, is it possible to keep the domain (let's say  0-max) when using the brush?\r\n\r\nMy data goes from 0 to 4000 and when reducing the view, i'd like to keep the Y domain at 0-3800 not 0-[max brush displayed dataset]\r\n\r\nCheers ! My bad, i had undefined values in my array and Math.max returned NaN, not the max value...\n\nCheers!\n  One of the few \"common\" charts that can't be done with ReCharts, but something that is almost indispensable when displaying financial data (among others). Really just a chart with up to four data values, displayed in two typical ways:\r\n\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-high-low-close_chart\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart\r\n  I have a BarChart whose data changes from, say: [2 0] to [1 1]. Instead of the 2-bar shrinking and the 0-bar growing, recharts starts both bars at 0 and grows them to 1 in the animation when the graph is redrawn.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to change this behavior? A similar behavior happens as well with PieChart. I have data on a state, and when it updates, the animation restarts from 0. This is probably a subset of #375.  1. Is it possible to use HTML/React components that are HTML/JSX (i.e. not SVG elements) for custom ticks?\r\n1. Is it possible to pass an object to the tick as the dataKey, rather than just a single key (string/number). I'm hoping to create a custom tick that contains a URL to an image that is rendered and then links to another URL.\r\n\r\nThanks for the great library! My use case is that I would like to use a link react component that I have created as a custom tick. This component has variations based on props that it receives, In addition to that, I'd like to show an image above each of the buttons.\n\nI'd need to pass an object as the dataKey because in this case, I would need _at least_:\n- The image URL\n- The link URL\n\nAnd as an additional bonus:\n- Props that the button uses (button text, colour, etc)\n\nAll of these are within the realm of SVG (though being able to provide a non-SVG component would be ideal), but being locked into using a plain string or a number prevents this.\n\nExample of what I'm looking to do for each column:\n![screen shot 2016-11-18 at 4 22 42 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1631699/20419541/4f466fa0-adab-11e6-9bca-aa67cefbe013.png)\n Sure, but even if I used SVG to recreate the look of the button, I'm still unable to pass the `href` to the button **and** the image URL, because `dataKey` doesn't support objects.\n\nI believe highcharts allows this, which is why I was hoping it would be possible in recharts.\n And if you need each bar to have dynamic content which matches just pass data as a prop to your custom tick and use props.index to retrieve it `const userData = props.data[props.index]`   The documentation says the label accepts a function but I can't get it to run.  \r\n\r\nI created a solid circle chart w/ a value in the middle based off the circle chart; to create the center label I used label={this.renderCustomizedLabel} off Pie. I then tried the same with RadialBar and the function doesn't get called.  \r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n```\r\nrenderCustomizedLabel({cx, cy, midAngle, innerRadius, outerRadius, value, name, index}){\r\n   \tconst radius = innerRadius + (outerRadius - innerRadius) * 0.5;\r\n    const RADIANx = Math.PI / 360;\r\n    const RADIANy = Math.PI / 180;\r\n    const x = cx + radius * Math.cos(-midAngle * RADIANx);\r\n    const y = cy + radius * Math.sin(-midAngle * RADIANy);\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <text\r\n        x={x}\r\n        y={y}\r\n        fill=\"white\"\r\n        textAnchor=\"middle\"\r\n        dominantBaseline=\"central\"\r\n        style={{fontSize: '26pt'}}>\r\n          {value}\r\n      </text>\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n``` Thanks for pushing fix for the RadialBar; however, I still can't it it to work and now all my charts are no longer rendering custom label.  I attached a version where I use the Pie chart to build a circle with a number in the middle, which with 0.19 it's no longer working.\r\n\r\n0.18\r\n![screen shot 2016-11-23 at 7 48 30 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7296078/20566209/784c4d12-b151-11e6-861a-f4a15d11e81c.png)\r\n\r\n0.19\r\n![screen shot 2016-11-23 at 7 47 32 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7296078/20566595/db4eb656-b152-11e6-87d2-bf7eee243d6c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass CircleChart extends Component {\r\n  static defaultProps = {\r\n    data: {\r\n      value: '2.65',\r\n    },\r\n    color: '#60b990',\r\n    tooltip: 'Test | 2.65',\r\n    tooltipY: 0,\r\n  }\r\n  static propTypes = {\r\n    data: PropTypes.shape({\r\n      value: PropTypes.string,\r\n    }),\r\n    color: PropTypes.string\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  renderCustomizedLabel = (data) => {\r\n    const value = data.payload.display;\r\n    return (\r\n      <Text\r\n        x=\"50%\"\r\n        y=\"55%\"\r\n        fill=\"white\"\r\n        fontSize=\"3em\"\r\n        textAnchor=\"middle\"\r\n      >\r\n        {value}\r\n      </Text>\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { color, tooltipY } = this.props;\r\n    const { tooltipX } = this.state;\r\n    const tooltipPosition = {\r\n      x: tooltipX,\r\n      y: tooltipY,\r\n    };\r\n    const fixdata = [{\r\n      value: 1,\r\n      display: this.props.data.value,\r\n    }];\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <ResponsiveContainer>\r\n        <PieChart>\r\n          <Pie\r\n            data={fixdata}\r\n            isAnimationActive={false}\r\n            fill={color}\r\n            strokeWidth={0}\r\n            labelLine={false}\r\n            label={this.renderCustomizedLabel}\r\n          />\r\n        </PieChart>\r\n      </ResponsiveContainer>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default CircleChart;\r\n```\r\n Got it working with using text vs Text as the customized label.  Is it possible to display an empty chart (such as [this](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9ImRB.png)) with recharts? Thanks for the answer @xile611. One more quick follow-up question: is it possible to display the Y-Axis range when the Lines are not rendered?\n @xile611 Perfect! That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you\n I made a const array of dummy data for the x-axis const dummyData = [{value: ''}, {value: ''}, {value: ''},]  to conditionally render an empty graph when when my relevant data is empty. That worked for me!  The default tooltip is very helpful and meets the minimum features for most people. It has a labelFormatter option and a formatter for the value. It's unfortunately missing a formatter for the axis name. An example:\r\n\r\nLets say we're measuring leads per day. Our object may be:\r\n\r\n`{\r\n     leads: 42,\r\n     day: '2016-11-14'\r\n}`\r\n\r\nIf day is the x axis, and leads is the y axis, we can format '2016-11-14' with the labelFormatter prop and we can format 42 with the formatter prop. The resulting tool tip will be `leads : formatter(42)`, meaning you cannot format `leads :`. This is a little annoying as the backend business term may be different to what the users use. Also, following JS conventions, properties are lower camel case. \r\n\r\nWork around is to use a custom tooltip, but that's a bit annoying considering I just want to uppercase the first letter.  I have the same problem and I don't think that name prop solve this, because I can only have static content in `name` but just like @RoarkeRandall I would like to format my dynamic content, before I set it in as a label. \n  **Note**: Previous discussion at https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/265, however, the tooltip problem seems fixed. Some background in: https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/265#issuecomment-259397616.\r\n\r\nQuickly changing a recharts graph's input data making recharts redraw the graph seems to crash Chrome due to an unknown (SVG?) bug.

Something's making Chrome crash in my demo project and it might have something to do with how Webpack bundles your library (in production, not in hot reload/dev mode).\n\nAnyway, I'd really like to use recharts so I will let you know immediately if I figure out what's happening.\n @xile611 I can confirm too that restart solved this problem - did you ever find a way to get the crash happen again after restart?\n\nWould still be nice to find out the underlying reason as I can't really tell all chrome users to restart their macbook before using the site :p \n\nIt might be though that only a small portion of Chrome users are actually affected... hard to say.\n  According to this [issue](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/287) it is not possible to save tooltip's position after update.  @xile611, I'm not sure how to use a custom component for the `label` prop on the recharts `YAxis` component. Here's what I'm trying to do:\r\n```javascript\r\n// My custom component\r\nconst AxisLabel = (props) => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h2 className={theme.text}>{props.text}</h2>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\n// The Y-Axis component\r\n<YAxis type='category' dataKey=\"name\" width={yAxisWidth(data)} label={<AxisLabel text='Stages' />} />\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhat am I doing wrong here?

Still don't know how to fix it, though.\n  I am currently using the `onClick` for `Bar` and `RadialBar`. One issue is that the `onClick` only triggers when a user clicks on the value and not the bar itself. I made an [example fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/patryk0605/ydycdLpx/) to demo the issue. \r\n\r\nCan the functionality be extended to trigger when the bar is clicked anywhere and not just on the value? The problem with only having the `onClick` on the value is that when you have one value at **1** and another at **100**, it becomes very hard to click on that value with a **1**.  @xile611 Your solution resolves my issue for `ComposedChart`, however `RadialBarChart` does not seem to support the same `onClick`. Any method I can use for the whole `RadialBar` to support `onClick` and not just the area with a value?\n  I could not find the mentioned functionality and I ask if there is a feature planned that allows to toggle the visibility of elements (line,bar...) in a chart by clicking on the legend entry for that element.  Hello,\r\nI was getting `CSSPropertyOperations.js:187 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'length' of object '#<CSSStyleDeclaration>'` when a chart is updated. On trying to debug I came across that the `Curve` component is getting this prop `{style:{length:'277px'}}` I can't seem to figure out where this prop is coming from. I will try to post the problem linechart config I have soon.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen when `isAnimationActive` is `false`\r\n  Would it be possible to integrate an onClick event for `Legend` like `RadialBar` for example has?  Is there any way to add onCLick event on LineChart or Line component in order to get exact point on which I clicked?   Within my console, I noticed the following message after latest update: \r\n\r\n```\r\nEach child in an array or iterator should have a unique \"key\" prop. Check the render method of `ComposedChart`.

Running version 18.0 still receiving this warning, on Area chart.  Quick workaround is assigning keys based on Math.Random(), or from the first parameter, but I'd much rather not.\n  I am studying your API and i have posted a question in stackoverflow on how on the x and y-coordinate values of center of the dots are calculated\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate your explanation\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/40410094/calculation-the-x-and-y-coordinate-of-center-in-recharts  Updated to 0.16 this morning and noticed that now the prop strokeDasharray on Line component doesn't get passed down to Curve component. \"7 11\" outputs as \"0px, 0px\" @xile611, in my project I have a line chart with an input above it to enable users to enter a goal number which will then appear on the chart as a dashed line using `strokeDashArray`. I just updated to version 0.16.2 which was intended to fix the problem @pcmaffey mentioned above (and it did for the most part). I'm running into an issue, however, where whenever I enter a goal number that is 2 digits long (it doesn't do this with 1 or 3+ digit numbers), the goal line is no longer dashed and the console throws this error:\n\n```\nCannot assign to read only property 'length' of object '#<CSSStyleDeclaration>'  \n```\n\nI confirmed that this _is_ an issue with version 0.16.2. Any ideas? Thanks a lot.\n @xile611 any clues on what this issue is?\n  Is it just me? [link](http://recharts.org/examples) @git-toni Not only for you. All examples down\n Yup, `'t' is not a function` somewhere in the bundled `.min.js` version.\n `iteratee is not a function`\n\n``` javascript\n//Within Recharts.js\n...\n    function baseOrderBy(collection, iteratees, orders) {\n      var index = -1;\n      iteratees = arrayMap(iteratees.length ? iteratees : [identity], baseUnary(baseIteratee));\n\n      var result = baseMap(collection, function(value, key, collection) {\n        var criteria = arrayMap(iteratees, function(iteratee) {\n          return iteratee(value);   //<---- Error here\n        });\n        return { 'criteria': criteria, 'index': ++index, 'value': value };\n      });\n\n      return baseSortBy(result, function(object, other) {\n        return compareMultiple(object, other, orders);\n      });\n    }\n...\n```\n   I'm interested in this also. I want to be able to create confidence intervals for a timeseries prediction, for example:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10280734/20179961/535ed1ce-a750-11e6-8210-9acd98e1bbc9.png)\n +1 (for exactly the same purpose--confidence intervals). Specifically, it would be an area component with two values, \"high\" and \"low\", with a line component drawn over it.\r\n\r\nAnd note: While there may be internal similarities, this is not the same as #190. like @supersteves 's chart, usually used for confidence interval demonstration.\r\nJust wondering if there is a way that we write our own widget like RangeArea that can integrated into AeaChart. @BOZ88 Some ideas - we were able to customise a *ScatterChart* by passing a custom renderer to the Scatter \"line\" prop, which augmented the existing props with additional points. This is quite a lot of work when out-of-the-box is so close to being able to do this.\r\n\r\nWe've also experimented with using (hacking) a ReferenceDot or other similar component - also within Scatter - which happens to expose the axis scales such that coordinates can be mapped between the real data range and pixels. In https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/365 we suggested including the d3.scale objects for each axis as part of the props of other customisable renderers to allow more sophisticated customisation - such as this.  Error being thrown when first calling `render` on any graph. All the jsfiddles on the website look like they're affected. Looks like a regression in 0.16.0 @xile611 \r\n Hi, what option you added in LodashModule Replacement Plugin? I have problem like yours Same  `Warning: setState(...): Can only update a mounted or mounting component. This usually means you called setState() on an unmounted component. This is a no-op. Please check the code for the Animate component.`\r\n\r\nHappens when I leave the page while an animation timer is still running. Need kill the timer in componentWillUnmount().  Is there a way to always show the start and end ticks for X Axis? (For example, to show the start and end time of a time series)\r\nI am using dates on the X Axis (day), and I notice that the end tick is always missing in my case.\r\nI saw in the docs that I could pass the ticks manually, but wanted to check if there is a simpler way to force this behavior.\r\n\r\nAside from that, thanks for the awesome library.\r\n\r\n  Hello there,\n\nRecharts seems pretty awesome, I wonder if it is possible to set a rounded end strokes for lines on a radial bar or everywhere where lines are drawn (like most bar charts).\n\nTo be precise, here what I am trying to do:\n\n<img width=\"168\" alt=\"radial_bar_chart_with_rounded_end_strokes\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6024473/19768653/cda6b960-9c2e-11e6-814b-f8c14e6c790d.png\">\n\nHope some of you could give a clue on how to do this with recharts. I already took a look at the API without luck.\n Actually, better yet, this would just be an option on a pie chart. The pie chart can already do the visual representation of this, but the ends are flat instead of curved. I think adding an 'end-radius' attribute is all that would be needed.\r\n\r\nEdit: Or could this be handled with some SVG <defs>?\r\n\r\nAnd regarding the OP's other notes, technically the end-radius could be added to bars and radial bars, too. That would add a nice, modern look to any bar- or curve-drawing chart. This might be useful: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/aff9e559c5c9968b7ac6 @Eric24 Is there support for the  rounded end strokes ?? I saw it was still in the open issues list.\r\nhttps://recordnotfound.com/recharts-recharts-6939/issues @VrajSolanki Yes, it was added on 26DEC16. The prop that controls the end-radius of bars on a Radial Bar chart is cornerRadius. Can you use the RadialChart for a progress/percentage chart? if you have only one entry in data object you get a full circle.. i want to set somehow the maximum value of the chart, so if i have only one item in data the fill has to be scaled according to the maximum value setted. +1 > Can you use the RadialChart for a progress/percentage chart? if you have only one entry in data object you get a full circle.. i want to set somehow the maximum value of the chart, so if i have only one item in data the fill has to be scaled according to the maximum value setted.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/1100 There is one possible workaround for this. You can add styles to corresponding svg paths (parts of circle).\r\n```\r\n.recharts-sector {\r\n  stroke-linejoin: round;\r\n  stroke-width: 7px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`Pie` component should be declared similar to this\r\n```\r\n<Pie\r\n  data={data}\r\n  innerRadius={37}\r\n  outerRadius={37} \r\n/>\r\n```\r\nand `data` should contain `stroke` field with color value.  Adding the angle property to the PRESENTATION_ATTRIBUTES array in util/ReactUtils.js allows ticks in the cartesian axes to be positioned at any angle. It was not listed as a presentation attribute before, but I believe it should be, as there is no other way to rotate each tick's text while using tickFormatter, i. e., without creating a custom React class as it's done in the [CustomizedLabelLineChart](http://recharts.org/examples#CustomizedLabelLineChart) in the docs.\n Thank you! When can we expect a new version to be out that includes this change?\n Which release contains this change?\n Thank you! \n  When I try to use a `Brush` with a `ScatterChart`, no `Brush` shows up, and no warning or error is visible. Is this expected behavior? Because of this issue, I am now trying to create a scatter-like chart from of a `LineChart` (in order to get `Brush` functionality) but it is a lot more difficult.\n @xile611 thanks for the clarification\n @xile611 Why do the docs have `<ScatterChart />` listed as a parent of `<Brush />` then? I got working ScatterChart and Brush (although onChange listener is needed, but that's no big deal):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { startIndex, endIndex } = this.state;\r\nconst data = unchangedData.filter(datum => datum.hour >= startIndex && datum.hour <= endIndex)\r\n\r\nreturn (\r\n  <ScatterChart width={width} height={300} data={unchangedData}>\r\n    <XAxis type=\"category\" dataKey=\"hour\" interval={0} />\r\n    <YAxis type=\"number\" dataKey=\"processor\" interval={0} />\r\n    <Brush \r\n      dataKey=\"hour\"\r\n      height={30}\r\n      stroke=\"#8884d8\"\r\n      onChange={({ startIndex, endIndex }) => this.setState({ startIndex, endIndex })} />\r\n    <Scatter data={data} />\r\n  </ScatterChart>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice data props for ScatterChart and Brush components.  if all the scatter lengths are same, is it possible to use brush? Thanks.  There are obviously many applications where a logarithmic is preferable to a linear scale. It would be really cool to be able to pass a `scale` function to the `YAxis` and `XAxis` components, which could optionally accept a number to use as a \"base\" in a logarithmic function (defaulting to a base of 1 for linear):\n\n``` jsx\n// linear\n<YAxis {...props} />\n\n// base10\n<YAxis scale={10} {...props} />\n\n// natural log\n<YAxis scale={Math.E} {...props} />\n\n// snap to increments of 5\n<YAxis scale={(y) => Math.round(y % 5) * 5} {...props} />\n```\n +1\n Is it possible to keep linear scaling but utilize [scale-breaks](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/36408/how-to-visualize-data-with-extreme-value-differences)?  Not sure if this is a bug or perhaps something in my code, but I I'm using the ResponsiveContainer and AreaChart and if I update the state of the parent component or even click on a menu above the chart, it redraws the chart.  The data is static, so it's not changing anything.  Any thoughts?\n The same problem when using BarChart, but the PieChart works well.\n @truenorthcreative, isn't React.js supposed to re-render when you update state on components ? \nit would be nice if you could post some code or jsfiddle to demonstrate\n @jareechang yes, of course. But the re-render will only affect the changed element, etc. my point is the state changing for _anything_ in the parent will re-render, as will clicking sibling components (even if you want to remove the state argument)\n @xile611 in site examples. When we resize render-area (right bottom), \u0441hart is not repainted upon resize only when new data is provided. @truenorthcreative  meant that Pie chart repaining when we resize block and using ResponsiveContainer, but all the other charts don't behave in such away.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/znqLLdev/1/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=znqLLdev\n @xile611 if you want i can add width and height to componentWillReceiveProps and make PR, but i don't know how it feature will affect performance\n @xile611, I was playing around with demo (Adding ResponsiveContainer to charts) and after investigation on the `react-container-dimensions` library, it seems that the library sets a new state **on resize** which is why it redraws (or re-render the child elements). \n\n**src/component/ResponsiveContainer.js, line 83-85**\n\n``` javascript\n<ContainerDimension>\n  ...\n</ContainerDimension>\n```\n\nFunction called on **resize** and **componentDidMount** in `<ContainerDimension>` component [(library reference)](https://github.com/okonet/react-container-dimensions/blob/master/src/index.js):\n\n``` javascript\nonResize() {\n   const clientRect = ContainerDimensions.getDomNodeDimensions(this.parentNode)\n   this.setState({\n       initiated: true,\n       ...clientRect\n   })\n}\n```\n\nWe might have to fork the lib to make changes or investigate alternatives such as [digidem/react-dimensions](https://github.com/digidem/react-dimensions) which looks quite promising. However, that might require significant change to source code. Let me know what you think. \n @Jareechang charts are rerender. But they not recalculate points for charts\n Why did this close?\n @truenorthcreative Are you generating the data from a function like so: http://jsfiddle.net/h449h9oe/ ?\r\n\r\n@xile611 Perhaps this is what he means? What is the fix for this? @Sunil6591 -- I found a component that was forcing the parent to re-render the page. Hope this helps.  @Sunil6591 Just see @noahnu 's posted code I'm using a `PieChart` in a `ResponsiveContainer` and each time it set the state of the container, the pie is rerender. Anyone found a solution?\r\n\r\nExample\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/4d402ff81dd628a37b740da40e0903bd @tiaaaa123 it looks like the data is changing, so what do you want the experience to be? Nvm. Found the issue with what you said!\r\nThanks This is definitely an issue. If your component rerenders (say because of a Redux state change), ReCharts redraws the chart even when the props supplied to the chart (the data) have not changed. All the animations retrigger unessecarily. \r\n\r\nBest hack I've come up with is to disable animations. Definitely takes away from the UX though. Facing the same issue...\r\n\r\nIf i copy and paste the LegendEffectOpacity example (http://jsfiddle.net/z9orjuww/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=z9orjuww) into my project (exporting SimpleLineChart and use it in another component), then on hovering the legend, the chart is re-drawn (animations kick in again).

I'll stay tuned and will try to implement a work-around in the meanwhile.\n Is there any known workaround for this at the moment? This is clearly a hack, but given you have a flag variable ``isAnimationActive`` with default to ``true``, you could then listen in for``componentWillReceiveProps()`` (when more data is added to the chart) and set  a ``isAnimationActive=false``. This will cause the animation to only be executed when the component is mounted (the first time the chart is rendered). \r\n\r\nAs a down side, when new data-points are added to the chart, no animation from the last point known to the newest one added will be executed (it will just suddenly appear in the chart).

Filling a rectangle with a slightly darker background starting from the lower y ref line to the upper y ref line and extending the full x width would look much more clean and would also be very intuitive if one of the reference lines is missing (i.e. when the reference range is \"open\", such as \"< 2 mg\").\n\nIs it possible to render a filled rectangle on the chart?

I now have:\n\n```\n<ScatterChart {...chartProps}>\n    <ReferenceLine {...lowerRefLineProps} />\n    <ReferenceLine {...upperRefLineProps} />\n    <XAxis {...xAxisProps} />\n    <YAxis {...yAxisProps} />\n    <Scatter {...myData} />\n</ScatterChart>\n```\n\nWhat I'd like to do:\n\n```\n<ScatterChart {...chartProps}>\n    <Rectangle y1=\"0.5\" y2=\"7.1\" bgColor=\"#f0f0f0\" />\n    <XAxis {...xAxisProps} />\n    <YAxis {...yAxisProps} />\n    <Scatter {...myData} />\n</ScatterChart>\n```\n  Recharts isn't taking full advantage of React's rendering optimizations for sub-trees. The \"shallowEqual\" function in PureRender is actually a deep-equal, which is very expensive and re-computed several times on any given event (e.g. mouse moving over the graph).  For a graph with hundreds or thousands of points, this can become very slow.\n\nPart of the reason a deep equality was likely used was that some of the props, like the axis maps and ticks, were being generated as brand new object on every render, even though the data in them was the same, so a shallow equality would have failed.\n\nIn order to remedy this situation, a couple of changes are needed\n1. modify the shallowEqual function to actually be a shallow equality, only checking one level deep for === equality on all keys in an object\n2. ANY object that would be expensive to generate when looping over a large dataset (e.g. axismaps, ticks, etc.) is generated only when necessary and stored in state to be passed down to child components as props. Since the objects will pass === checks in this scenario, child components never re-render unless necessary, and determining necessity is cheap now.\n\nThese changes have already been made in pull request #277, so this issue can be marked as resolved when that is complete.\n Agree...

I had to artisanally merge the last change from BarChart to get maxSize in, but I think it came out OK ;)\n I added two more commits from our fork that are performance related.  I think that's it for these performance changes.\n On a side note, we've effectively abandoned recharts for our project, after we had made some interesting changes to it.  You may want to pull them in from our fork.  Let me know if you need any help.  You can look at the commits after October 3rd, 2016 to get an idea of what we added:\n\nhttps://github.com/billneff79/recharts/commits/master\n\n**Highlights include:**\n- Allow className attribute to be passed through and added to outside element of ReferenceLine\n- Added support for new affectedCharts parameter on Brush component to specify  which charts the brush affects (handy if you want to have a context chart that doesn't change while controlling another chart that does)\n- Added the ability to overlay a Brush on a chart\n- Use globally registered mouse events for the brush for a better UX \n \\o/\n Other performance tips you might want to try for big data sets that we've seen tremendous (4-5x performance boost) results from include:\n\nDon't plot more than one data point per css pixel.  i.e. if you have 1000 data points, but your graphable width in your chart is only 300 pixels, you will waste a lot of cpu calculating the path for your chart without being able to see 2/3rds of it.  So, we just pruned the data when generating the ticks for our area/line/etc. charts to get it down to 1 point max per pixel: i.e. if there are 3 times as many points as pixels, we generate the graph from data[0], data[3], data[6], data[9], ....\n\nAs the user uses a Brush to zoom in on the graph, we re-calculate the data points used for drawing the path, so you can get to full data fidelity on the graph as soon as you zoom into a view where there is at least one point per pixel.\n\nIt turns out that it's just way faster to prune the data on each Brush movement than it is not render a full, but overly granular, path\n @billneff79 You are a champion.

The Y-Axis will be the `speed` of vehicle and the X-Axis will be the `time`. The data I have is the speed of the vehicle for every few seconds. What I want is to have X-Axis with 1 hour difference and Y-Axis to be the speed.\n\nSomething similar like this: \nhttp://www.highcharts.com/demo/line-time-series\n\nIs it possible to create a one?\n\nThanks.\n I'm attempting something very similar - I'd like to create a `BarChart` that'll render a variable number of bars on an x-axis that will always have 12 ticks (one for every month). Is this what a `CartesianAxis` is for?\n @xile611 I see over in https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/305 that you released a `scale` prop for the Axis components.\r\n\r\nWould you mind sharing how that can be used to achieve a line chart of time series data?\r\n\r\nGiven the following data, how would we configure the x-axis to display only 2 labels (one for each month), but still plot each data point for each individual day?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst data = [\r\n  {name: 'Jan 01 2016', value: 2400},\r\n  {name: 'Jan 02 2016', value: 2210},\r\n  // etc...\r\n  {name: 'Jan 31 2016', value: 2290},\r\n  {name: 'Feb 01 2016', value: 2000},\r\n  {name: 'Feb 02 2016', value: 2181},\r\n  // etc...\r\n  {name: 'Feb 28 2016', value: 2500},\r\n];\r\n```  ``` javascript\n<ReferenceLine\n  key={index}\n  label={<span>123</span>}\n  stroke=\"#f2be35\"\n  x={key}\n  isFront\n/>\n```\n\nresults in following dom structure:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1336484/18890852/8adbbc94-8535-11e6-8f50-eceb900eeda4.png)\n\nwhich is not allowed by SVG specs, and got wrong positioning at all.\n  I'm not sure if there is functionality in already but I don't understand it. I have a section of figures in an array that start at say 380,000 and range to 410,000. The graph needs to fit into a small area but when I plot it the line looks almost flat. Is there a way of clipping the display start point so the graph does not look like a flat line and can show the top portion of the data in the graph and any fluctuation within that top area?\n Thanks very much will give that a try today. Love the module btw.\n Works a treat thanks :)\n<img width=\"355\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-09-26 14 54 20\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5984529/18836772/53a073ec-83f9-11e6-907c-68acbe43d491.png\">\n  Would be super sweet if you could somehow pass an error array as a prop to make error bars on line and bar charts (especially bar chart). \n\nThanks for making this tool!\n @xile611 \n\nKinda like that, but being able to control the height of the reference line and place it on points. So something more like:\n\nhttp://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/figure/ggplot2/ggplot2-barplot-with-error-bar-data-visualization-1.png\n\nor \n\nhttp://www.phplot.com/phplotdocs/examples/points1.png\n\nEven just a straight error bar option without the horizontal top and bottom lines would be helpful. \n\nAlso, here is a stack overflow of people discussing how to do it in d3: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22620064/adding-error-bars-to-grouped-bar-chart-with-d3-js\n +1 Would like that too! Any workaround do get something like that ?\n +1\r\n\r\nRegarding closing #349 and including it here, it's not quite the same thing as error bars, but I can envision that it may have a lot in common under the covers. Just submitted a PR to add error bars    https://github.com/recharts/recharts/pull/399 Hey @xile611 ,\r\n\r\nso my use case is:\r\n- have horizontal bars \r\n- for each bar i wanna indicate an error / confidence interval\r\n\r\nSo for example if the score for a bar is 130, the confidence interval could be from 110 to 135 e.g.! @jzillmann @xile611 I definitly think the interval is a good idea and will add that to the PR. \r\n\r\nAlso, I like option one of your two ideas. @xile611--\r\nI'm not sure I have a strong preference to either option, but I lean toward the first one because I think it will be more clear that the error bars belong to a particular series, especially when the series themselves have their own data prop (like ScatterChart). But having said that, can ScatterChart (and other data-series child components) really have useful error bars? If not, then the second option may be better, and is more consistent with ReCharts' overall architecture.\r\n\r\nI do think that the error bar component, regardless of how it's implemented, should allow for both high and low offsets, as well as absolute values. There are many error bar scenarios where the error range is not symmetrical.\r\n\r\nJust a thought: If you treat the error bars as just another child component, then the existing Bar component almost gets the job done. It just needs the ability to supply both a high and low value. In fact, by \"overlaying\" two Bar components with slightly different bar widths/styles, you could easily produce just about any error bar, candlestick, high/low/close, etc. chart you wanted.\r\n @Eric24 @xile611 @jzillmann \r\n\r\nI just updated the PR so it uses the first option API and allows for both high and low offsets.\r\n\r\nYour probably right that the bar components could be used to make this, but I had already coded the logic in SVG lines which was fairly straightforward. Bar would probably be more helpful for candlestick though. I can work on that after the error bar PR is merged.\r\n\r\n`const data = { name: 'Page A', uv: 1000, pv: 2400, amt: 2400, uvError: [75, 20] }, ... ]` \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<Line type='monotone' dataKey='uv'>\r\n  <ErrorBar dataKey=\"uvError\" />\r\n</Line>\r\n```\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-15 at 5 39 08 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427089/21249031/0b0cab2e-c2f0-11e6-8955-e48e0664bef2.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-14 at 5 53 38 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427089/21209091/0f9a5372-c227-11e6-880f-10867b969643.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-14 at 5 57 53 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427089/21209062/f034de58-c226-11e6-9601-3e6e6210b344.png) @McMenemy--Very nice! I personally like the solution of allowing a single value for symmetric errors and an array for asymmetric errors. It's clean and requires no other attributes to \"configure\" it.\r\n\r\nBut shouldn't \"error bars\" on a scatter plot really be a rectangle around the point? After all, it technically has two dimensions of error.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what options you have for formatting the bars, but I can see needs for:\r\n\r\n- just a vertical line (without the I-beam)\r\n- a rectangle (i.e. a line with more width)\r\n- the ability to set opacity\r\n- the ability to specify that the error bar is drawn behind the main plot line\r\n PS to @xile611 - The idea of using an array as data point could be useful for things like #316, where if supplied for an area plot, the array would be interpreted as the low and high value for the area. This enhancement would allow the kind of \"error range\" display originally shown in #316 (and one that I'm also personally interested in), by simply specifying both a line and area (with [low, high] Y data) plot on the same chart. You could also include that capability in the ErrorBar component with the option of specifying a \"type\" of \"area\" instead of \"bar\", although the array data points would still be useful outside of error bar applications. @Eric24 @xile611 Thanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\nGood point scatter plots should definitly have the option for two error bar directions. I also left the option for their just to be one direction for situations like IQ vs Number of Siblings where there might be an error in only one direction. \r\n\r\nBoth a rectangle and just lines are possible with the current width and stroke width options.\r\n\r\nI added opacity.\r\n\r\nI did not give the option to draw the error boar behind the plot line but I did move it behind the plot line for scatter and line charts because that is what most other libraries do and I think it does look nicer. \r\n\r\nHere are some new examples\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst data01 = [ { x: 100, y: 200, z: 200, errorY: [20, 30], errorX: 30 } ...]\r\n\r\n<Scatter name=\"A school\" data={data01} fill=\"#ff7300\">\r\n  <ErrorBar dataKey=\"errorY\" width={8} strokeWidth={1} width={0} fill=\"blue\" direction=\"y\" />\r\n  <ErrorBar dataKey=\"errorX\" width={4} strokeWidth={2} opacity={0.5} fill=\"green\" direction=\"x\" />\r\n</Scatter>\r\n```\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-16 at 7 04 02 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427089/21284002/50c505fc-c3c3-11e6-8d9f-90bcdd0574bc.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-16 at 6 51 11 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427089/21284011/8018a822-c3c3-11e6-85fe-525f932684d7.png)\r\n\r\n @McMenemy -- Nice work. Having a little trouble applying this to a bar chart.\r\nTrying\r\n```\r\n<Bar\r\n    dataKey=\"score\"\r\n    stackId=\"a\">\r\n    <ErrorBar\r\n         dataKey=\"scoreConfidence\"\r\n         width={ 4 }\r\n         strokeWidth={ 2 }\r\n         stroke=\"red\"\r\n         direction=\"x\" />\r\n</Bar>\r\n```\r\nBut since value is an array, xMid is as well (vertical layout) which results in an NaN for xMin. @jzillmann \r\n\r\nTry removing the direction=\"x\" prop - that is really only needed for scatter plots where there are two valid directions, otherwise the correct direction is automatically chosen.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work do you mind posting a sample of the data array you are passing in? Might help me better understand the NaN for xMin you are describing. Hey @McMenemy , removing direction=\"x\" doesn't make a difference.\r\nSo this is the data (as json):\r\n```\r\n[{\"index\":0,\"name\":\"arrayList\",\"score\":3467631,\"scoreError\":98563,\"scoreConfidence\":[3369067.897461809,3566194.5626392737],\"subScores\":[[3524193.1540743182,3531314.663170731,3532453.3325443356,3520395.64538141,3474431.2865468427],[3440045.3067861893,3333994.173460993,3445535.4557112623,3475555.716890452,3398393.5659388755]]},{\"index\":1,\"name\":\"arrayList_preSized\",\"score\":4434114,\"scoreError\":162358,\"scoreConfidence\":[4271756.831267686,4596472.032614275],\"subScores\":[[4387907.870160588,4415369.455557752,4235234.929285744,4493163.454426142,4515565.210563311],[4498258.182714103,4616972.696033958,4469945.743256911,4348193.164669668,4360533.612741628]]},{\"index\":2,\"name\":\"arrayList_preSized_reUsed\",\"score\":4361609,\"scoreError\":939443,\"scoreConfidence\":[3422166.159698941,5301052.838664772],\"subScores\":[[4494893.115865175,4708594.13630849,4731623.863515516,4546631.485472386,4347826.860553541],[4559416.52133731,4714948.775639965,4294497.89978434,4574162.969722556,2643499.3636192847]]},{\"index\":3,\"name\":\"immutableList\",\"score\":2981815,\"scoreError\":531678,\"scoreConfidence\":[2450136.660624976,3513493.542793048],\"subScores\":[[2945691.3886469672,3070641.4787076386,2877623.558878289,2044142.2793960872,3041207.6020551748],[3113544.6225625942,3080874.188561396,3320440.164272431,3120207.5510048973,3203778.183004643]]}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is the complete chart:\r\n```\r\n<BarChart\r\n  layout=\"vertical\"\r\n  width={ 900 }\r\n  height={ chartHeight }\r\n  data={ dataset }\r\n  margin={ { top: 20, right: 30, left: maxMethodNameLength * 5, bottom: 5 } }>\r\n  <Bar\r\n    dataKey=\"score\"\r\n    stackId=\"a\"\r\n    stroke={ blue }\r\n    fill={ blue }\r\n    unit={ ` ${scoreUnit}` }\r\n    isAnimationActive={ false }>\r\n    <ErrorBar\r\n      dataKey=\"scoreConfidence\"\r\n      width={ 4 }\r\n      strokeWidth={ 2 }\r\n      stroke=\"red\"\r\n      dataPointFormatter={ dataPointFormatter } />\r\n  </Bar>\r\n  <XAxis type=\"number\" />\r\n  <YAxis dataKey=\"name\" type=\"category\" />\r\n  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" />\r\n  <Tooltip content={ <SingleRunChartTooltip scoreUnit={ scoreUnit } /> } cursor={ { stroke: green, strokeWidth: 2 } } wrapperStyle={ { backgroundColor: tooltipBackground, opacity: 0.95 } } />\r\n  <Legend verticalAlign='top' payload={ [{ value: `${benchmarkMode} ${scoreUnit}`, color: blue, type: 'rect' }] } height={ 30 } />\r\n</BarChart>\r\n``` Hi @jzillmann\r\n\r\nI did not get the NaN value you were getting. Here is a screen shot of your chart with all the custom tooltips removed (maybe thats where the error is coming from)?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"430\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-10 at 9 38 59 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427089/24893121/5eb31d52-1e36-11e7-9210-7733f306930c.png\">\r\n\r\n`<p>Github Test</p>\r\n       <div className=\"bar-chart-wrapper\">\r\n         <BarChart\r\n           width={400}\r\n           height={400}\r\n           layout=\"vertical\"\r\n           data={ data69 }\r\n         >\r\n           <Bar\r\n             dataKey=\"score\"\r\n             stackId=\"a\"\r\n           >\r\n             <ErrorBar\r\n               dataKey=\"scoreConfidence\"\r\n               width={ 4 }\r\n               strokeWidth={ 2 }\r\n               stroke=\"red\"\r\n             />\r\n           </Bar>\r\n           <XAxis type=\"number\" />\r\n           <YAxis dataKey=\"name\" type=\"category\" />\r\n           <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\" />\r\n         </BarChart>\r\n       </div>\r\n`\r\n\r\nAlso, the error bars are really wide because the errors should be relative, like how much below and how much above, not the actual values. Hmm, not sure.. \r\nI was able to get a horizontal bar-chart to work... but when i copied your code from above i still get NaN. See https://jsfiddle.net/oae9/un16cwkd/13/\r\n\r\nNote: used 0.22.0 ( 0.22.1 throw an error on all recharts examples i found...)\r\n Okay thanks for making the jsfiddle. I made a couple changes which got it working: https://jsfiddle.net/mshdoe14/ . \r\n\r\nOne change was changing the \"scoreConfidence\":[**-4**,2] to \"scoreConfidence\":[**4**,2] . Error should always be positive. (This actually didn't throw an error it just draws the error bar in the wrong place.)\r\n\r\nThe other change was removing the stackId=\"a\" from the bar component because stackedBars with errorBars will not work at the moment. Do you plan on using a stacked bar chart with errors? If so, I'll try to find the underlying cause.\r\n\r\nIt works on my local computer which runs an older version of recharts so a later update must of broken the stacked part.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the future just open up an error bar problems you have as a new issue. Thanks @McMenemy . After removing the stackId error-bars started working for me!\r\nI was just using stacked bars to circumvent missing error bars so i'm not troubled with that not working.\r\n\r\nSorry for spoiling this issue!  Using the following snippet:\n\n``` jsx\n<BarChart data={initialData} >\n   <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" label=\"Devices\"/>\n   <YAxis unit=\"MB\"/>\n   <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n   <Tooltip/>\n   <Legend />\n   <Bar dataKey=\"used\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#8884d8\" unit=\" MB\" />\n   <Bar dataKey=\"available\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#82ca9d\" unit=\" MB\" />\n</BarChart>\n```\n\n`label` on the `XAxis` is not rendering and neither is `unit` on the `YAxis`. Am I doing something wrong? The following is an example render: \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7227636/18751544/6db1d9e6-80ad-11e6-94ac-b00fd940269e.png)\n @xile611 Thanks for your response. What about the `label` in the `XAxis`?\n `label` of `XAxis` is not working as expected here. For example, in the [ComposedChartWithAxisLabels](http://recharts.org/examples#ComposedChartWithAxisLabels) example: **Pages** is showed on the `XAxis` and **Index** is showed on the `YAxis`. In my initial post, I want my `XAxis` to show the label **Devices** at the end, however nothing is showing. Does `label` on the `XAxis` not work with a `BarChart`?\n In this example: http://jsfiddle.net/patryk0605/akpt76jg/\n\nI set `label=\"Devices\"` in `<XAxis dataKey=\"name\" label=\"Devices\"/>`, however there is no label showing on the x-axis.\n Was able to make some progress by setting `<BarChart margin={{top: 20, right: 80, bottom: 20, left: 20}}>`, similar to how the [ComposedChartWithAxisLabels](http://recharts.org/examples/#ComposedChartWithAxisLabels) does it above. Def not ideal, but at least it's a start.\n\nmight also be able to just set some css:\n\n``` css\n.recharts-surface {\n    overflow: visible;\n}\n```\n Seems like this issue is related with #308 where the right is being cut off. \n   <XAxis dataKey=\"name\"  tick={<CustomizedAxisTick />} interval={0} />\r\n\r\nset interval={0}  Apparently, after the first few tooltips are shown on hover, the next hover (in my case usually the 8th or 9th time) will get the 'Aww, snap' crash.\n Example code: \n\n```\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { LineChart, Line, YAxis, XAxis, Tooltip } from 'recharts';\n\nexport default class StatisticsView extends Component {\n  data = [\n    {\n      \"hash\": 4,\n      \"day\": \"1\"\n    },{\n      \"hash\": 5,\n      \"day\": \"2\"\n    },{\n      \"hash\": 6,\n      \"day\": \"3\"\n    },{\n      \"hash\": 4,\n      \"day\": \"4\"\n    },{\n      \"hash\": 3,\n      \"day\": \"5\"\n    },{\n      \"hash\": 7,\n      \"day\": \"6\"\n    },{\n      \"hash\": 11,\n      \"day\": \"7\"\n    },{\n      \"hash\": 5,\n      \"day\": \"8\"\n    },{\n      \"hash\": 6,\n      \"day\": \"9\"\n    },{\n      \"hash\": 4,\n      \"day\": \"10\"\n    }, {\n      \"hash\": 1,\n      \"day\": \"11\"\n    },\n  ];\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <LineChart data={this.data} width={1280} height={300}>\n        <Line dataKey=\"hash\" stroke=\"#000000\" />\n        <YAxis/>\n        <XAxis dataKey=\"day\"/>\n        <Tooltip/>\n      </LineChart>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n Right, sorry. \n54.0.2840.34 beta (64-bit)\n\nOn OSX.\n\nDoes the same thing on canary.\n Can confirm, I'm also having this problem in Chrome 54 beta (OSX). I can reproduce it every time if I go to a bar, and quickly move around with my mouse.\n\nCould be a bug in Chrome 54...\n I am also having the same problem with Chrome Version 54.0.2840.59 (64-bit) on linux.\n\nThis is the component that causes issues:\n\n``` javascript\n<LineRechart \n  width={WIDTH} \n  height={HEIGHT} \n  data={data}\n  margin={{top: 10, right: 30, left: 0, bottom: 0}}\n>\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\"/>\n  <YAxis/>\n  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n  <Tooltip/>\n  <Line type='monotone' dataKey='pv' stroke='#82ca9d' fill='#82ca9d' />\n</LineRechart>\n```\n\nIf I remove the `<Tooltip />` component the error goes away.\n\nEdit:\n\nNow the error also appears on windows. And it happens before I even show the tooltip sometimes. \n\nChrome version on windows is: 54.0.2840.71 m\n Same here, Chrome version is 54.0.2840.50 beta (64-bit) on Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS.\n\nWhat I found strange though, is, that the examples on your website, which are also using the tooltip, are not crashing.\n\nAside of that I just want to say, this is an awesome project, thanks for creating it!\n We also just find this problem today on my chrome version is 54.0.2840.59 (OSX). Another guy uses\n firefox on linux as the below black boxes lag issue.\n\n![screenshot from 2016-10-19 17_09_17](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3892004/19573208/e29c8d18-96ca-11e6-9d0c-0721f0c76e26.png)\n\nI analyze the CPU and memory usage on chrome task manager. Before the tab crashes, cpu usage hikes to 100. Also if I take a closer look at the tooltip rendering process, it's blurry initially and becomes clear after a second. Can we simplify the animation on tooltip so it won't use so much cpu?\n\nThe chrome crash issue happens after I upgrading following library, but the black box on firefox is always there. I think the rendering might be a bit too complicated, could we simplify it?\n\nThis is part of my package.json upgrades:\n\"dependencies\": {\n     \"classnames\": \"^2.2.5\",\n-    \"is-my-json-valid\": \"^2.13.1\",\n+    \"is-my-json-valid\": \"^2.15.0\",\n     \"isomorphic-fetch\": \"^2.2.1\",\n     \"querystring\": \"^0.2.0\",\n     \"object-assign\": \"^4.1.0\",\n-    \"react\": \"^15.1.0\",\n-    \"react-dom\": \"^15.1.0\",\n+    \"react\": \"^15.3.2\",\n+    \"react-dom\": \"^15.3.2\",\n     \"react-redux\": \"^4.4.5\",\n-    \"react-router\": \"^2.4.1\",\n+    \"react-router\": \"^2.8.1\",\n     \"react-router-active-component\": \"^4.0.0-rc.0\",\n-    \"react-router-redux\": \"^4.0.4\",\n+    \"react-router-redux\": \"^4.0.6\",\n     \"react-scroll\": \"^1.4.0\",\n-    \"reactable\": \"^0.13.2\",\n-    \"redux\": \"^3.5.2\",\n-    \"redux-logger\": \"^2.6.1\",\n+    \"reactable\": \"^0.14.0\",\n+    \"redux\": \"^3.6.0\",\n+    \"redux-logger\": \"^2.7.0\",\n     \"redux-thunk\": \"^2.1.0\",\n     \"moment\": \"^2.14.1\",\n-    \"react-datepicker\": \"^0.29.0\",\n-    \"recharts\": \"^0.15.0\"\n+    \"react-datepicker\": \"^0.32.0\",\n+    \"recharts\": \"^0.15.2\"\n}\n\nThanks!\n Fwiw, the crash happens for me on a line chart but not a scatter chart, where there is no tooltip animation. `animationActive={false}` didn't seem to have any effect, so granting the ability to disable animation on a line chart tooltip would really help me out.\n Same issue for me on Chrome 54.0.2840.71 (64-bit) mac OS. I'm sure it was good on Chrome 53.\n\nBoot Chrome with `--enable-logging --v=1` and I see the following error in terminal:\n\n```\n#\n# Fatal error in ../../v8/src/compiler/representation-change.cc, line 796\n# RepresentationChangerError: node #367:NumberSign of kRepFloat64 ((MinusZeroOrNaN | Range(-1, 1))) cannot be changed to kRepWord32\n#\n\n==== C stack trace ===============================\n\n    0   Google Chrome Framework             0x000000010852df63 ChromeMain + 15502163\n    1   Google Chrome Framework             0x000000010852c8ed ChromeMain + 15496413\n    2   Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000107fd8bfa ChromeMain + 9910250\n    3   Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000107fd9cd0 ChromeMain + 9914560\n    4   Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000107ff73f0 ChromeMain + 10035168\n    5   Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000107ff5e3d ChromeMain + 10029613\n    6   Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000107fe6e0c ChromeMain + 9968124\n    7   Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000107fe6d8b ChromeMain + 9967995\n    8   Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000107fbc5b6 ChromeMain + 9793958\n    9   Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000107fbaeb8 ChromeMain + 9788072\n    10  Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000107fba79d ChromeMain + 9786253\n    11  Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000107ed2110 ChromeMain + 8834304\n    12  Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000107ed4953 ChromeMain + 8844611\n    13  Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000107ed3b44 ChromeMain + 8841012\n    14  Google Chrome Framework             0x0000000108355532 ChromeMain + 13566242\n    15  ???                                 0x00000ca435d063a7 0x0 + 13899417019303\n```\n\nSo it seems a Chrome/V8 regression bug.\n The problem is not in Tooltip source, even we set an empty component with `displayName='Tooltip'` instead of current Tooltip it break the page.\n\nSomething with Dot rendering\n As a fast dirty fix, debouncing this code part https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L536-L537\nwith 100ms delay makes crash possibility very low.\n I'm having the same issue. I have a `<BarChart />` and a custom tooltip.\n- It only crashes in Chrome, I'm using (v54.0.2840.71)\n- It only crashes when I'm in development mode, if I do a \"release\" build I can't make it crash.\n I also can't reproduce it in release mode and in any mode on Canary Chrome\n Is there a workaround for this?\n I'm getting the same crash not only for Tooltip but also for resizing window.\n @xile611 We really want to use recharts in production, but this crash is preventing us from doing so. Do you have any recommendations?\n Came here also looking for a solution, it seems that most charts are crashing for me after hovering/clicking around the charts for a few seconds. Looking at the timeline in DevTools, I'm thinking this is due to some memory leak somewhere, but since it crashes, I've been unable to trace it down!\n\nCurrently crashing on Chrome 54.0.2840.71 (64-bit), at least. Anyone has any leads?\n I would recommend trying 0.15.3, as it contains a pr/fix to improve performance with tool-tips displaying (and other events).\n\n> The \"shallowEqual\" function in PureRender was actually a deep-equal, which was very expensive and re-computed several times on any given event \n\nhttps://github.com/recharts/recharts/pull/277\n @rhurkes I was running 0.15.3 already, but I actually found something interesting here. It seems that this behaviour only happens whenever I'm running in development mode, my fully compiled build seems to perform well and I can't get it to crash.\n\nLooking at the `Tooltip.js` implementation, I see some checks for server side rendering, which are probably being checked on the development environment. Thinking this might be related, but I'll a bit more of a spike once I can get to this.\n Play with v0.16.0 and it no longer crashes for me.\n Can't confirm, still crashing here with v0.16.0 :(\n I just updated to version 0.16.1 and I'm not experiencing this issue any more. Thanks for the fix!\n Yay, 0.16.1 works great for me now as well. Thanks for the fix, whoever did it! :) :+1: \n Still experiencing this issue in v0.16.2.\n 0.16.1 fix problem\n Okay, completely reinstalled recharts, now works fine. Thank you!\n after installing `0.17.1` from npm this problem actually got **worse**.\n\nAlso, it is not just the \"tooltip\" that crashes chrome, just quickly changing the data source and redrawing the graph alone is enough to crash chrome. Before updating from `0.13.4` this problem was pretty hard to reprocude (had to redraw the graphs a lot until crash) - now switching the data just a couple times is enough for a crash.\n\nA screenshot of my use case: \n\n![Image of Dashboardh](https://i.imgur.com/XNoFcb3.png)\n\nClicking daily will almost surely crash the current tab as there are a lot of data points.\n\nMacOS 10.12.1\nChome Version 54.0.2840.71 (64-bit)\n @xile611 I'm using `NODE_ENV=production webpack` for building my project and the problem is still there. I'm gonna try adding the minified version directly without going throuh my own webpack build pipeline.\n\nThis is how I init the charts:\n\n```\n<div style={{display: 'block', marginTop: '20px'}}>\n  <LineChart data={data} height={220} width={graphWidth} margin={{ top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5 }}>\n    <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" />\n    <YAxis/>\n    <CartesianGrid stroke=\"#eee\" strokeDasharray=\"5 5\"/>\n    <Legend />\n    <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"credits\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" />\n\n  </LineChart>\n</div>\n```\n @xile611 true, without hot components works fine, but i have this problem only at Win, in Linux all fine with --hot too\n I've also experienced the issue on development mode only, especially with `--hot` enabled. Unfortunately, since I was using `react-create-app` for this, I had basically no control over the development execution :(\n @xile611 I do not feel strong discomfort when i remove --hot because project on which I'm working on it is poorly configured and there is no hot-updated correctly. I think we can try webpack 2.*, maybe here this problem solved\n Seems like the tooltip issue has been fixed... I've set up a new issue with an example project that demoes the crash. https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/341\n I've met similar crash issue on Chrome for Mac Version 54.0.2840.71 (64-bit), using webpack 1.13.1.

While many libraries set the value to `0` (unlimited; no warning), the best approach I've seen so far is [dynamically setting the limits](http://www.jongleberry.com/understanding-possible-eventemitter-leaks.html).\n\nAny other idea?\n @xile611 - none of them are synchronized.\n @xile611 - right, that's my use case. Many, unsynced charts on one page.\n  Numbers and texts are not clear and tooltip opens in wrong place.\n![screen shot 2016-09-21 at 1 44 58 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12202757/18707150/a34bfa2a-8001-11e6-9f1a-58c276f0112a.png)\n http://jsfiddle.net/morajabi/2nry4psq/\n the example is missing the line\n\n```\ndirection: rtl;\n```\n\nas css property for `#container` \n Sorry for the unchanged demo, I think it's correct now.

I would like to display the value of the datakey on top of every bar on the bar chart. I am not able to find anything related to this in the documentation. I'm not sure we have the capability to show that are not too.\n\n```\n<Bar dataKey=\"mydatakey\" label />\n```\n\nBut it shows the label (I understood this is working as expected), but I was expecting to show the actual y axis value.\n  I only found mouse event interface in bar chart and pie chart\n For example, I would like to do something like showing details right after the user click the vertical line.\n I'm using a Line Chart, and i'm in this trouble as well, i need the user to click a point, and i want to grab the information on that specific point so i can query the database to give the user more detailed information.\n\nA onClick event would be greatly appretiated!. \n\nExcelent package for react btw.\n @weita0 I created a fork of Recharts and added a On Click functionality:\nhttps://github.com/Hectorhammett/recharts/tree/package\n\nI've created it until they add a complete functionality, use it if it serves you.\n\nTo use it, in the LineChart element, add a prop called onDotClick (The event fires when you click a dot) and pass a function to it.\n\nThe function returns in the first parameter, the label on the bottom axis (x axis) and its value.\n\n@xile611 I don't think my code is perfect, but for the moment i can work with these, you have any plans to add this feature in the future?\n @Hectorhammett  Excellent job! \n @weita0  Thanks! \n\nI could've made m code better but i was focused in fixing my problem, would you like me to ask for a Pull Request? Again, my code right now is not perfect, but if you like it, i could improve it.\n @Hectorhammett \n\nMaking a PR would be awesome as I have the exact same issue!\n I found an alternative solution, somewhat hacky though.\n\nTo accomplish getting data about the specific point clicked, I first set the `activeDot` prop on the `Line` component to false to removed it entirely. Then I created a custom label component with the same shape/styles of `activeDot` component, and added it to `Line`. Because the label has `payload` as a prop, you now have access to the data behind the point!\n\n```\nimport LabelAsPoint from './LabelAsPoint.js';\n\n...\n\n<LineChart {/* your props here */} >\n    // other components such as <XAxis />, <YAxis />, < Tooltip />, etc\n    <Line\n        label={ <LabelAsPoint /> }\n        activeDot={false}\n        dataKey=\"pv\"\n        stroke=\"#8884d8\"\n    />\n/>\n```\n\ncustom label as a point with look/style of active dot:\n\n```\nconst styles = require('styles.css');\n\nexport default class LabelAsPoint extends React.Component {\n    onClick = () => {\n        const { index, key, payload } = this.props;\n        // you can do anything with the key/payload\n    }\n    render() {\n        const { x, y } = this.props;\n        return (\n            <circle\n                className={`${styles.dot}`}\n                onClick={this.onClick}\n                cx={x}\n                cy={y}\n                r={8}\n                fill=\"transparent\"/>\n        );\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith styles.css: \n\n`.dot:hover {\n    fill: #2B98F0;\n    stroke: white;\n    stroke-width: .2em;\n}`\n  Not sure if I'd call it a bug, but it's at least unexpected behavior for me.\n\nIn the attached screenshot, I have a yAxis domain set as [-8,8] and my data points range from -10 to 10. At the top of the graph, the data points disappear as the line extends above 8. At the bottom, the line overlays the X axis and is visible until reaching the bottom of the container.\n\nI would expect the line to disappear at the bottom when it reaches the X axis, not when it reaches the container edge.\n\n<img width=\"664\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-09-20 at 2 50 01 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/881769/18684306/bb1b3ece-7f41-11e6-8490-fe254337eb7e.png\">\n That is the behavior I would expect. But if others feel differently I defer to their opinion.\n  The minPointSize property on <Bar /> components fixes a problem I'm having, where I need to differentiate between values of 0 and undefined values. However, if the value is 0, a bar does _not_ render at the defined minPointSize. Any other value (0.0000000001 for example) will render the bar.\n Thanks for merging, @xile611. Any idea when this will be pushed to a release?\n  Using a ResponsiveContainer with aspect (and no other attribute) has a bug, wherein its width and height shrink as you shrink the window, but do not expand as you expand the window.\n\nI fixed it by changing the following code:\n\n```\nif (aspect && aspect > 0) {\n  // Preserve the desired aspect ratio\n  if (calculatedHeight > 0 &&\n      (calculatedWidth === 0 || calculatedWidth / calculatedHeight > aspect)) {\n    calculatedWidth = calculatedHeight * aspect;\n  } else if (calculatedHeight === 0 || calculatedWidth / calculatedHeight < aspect) {\n    calculatedHeight = calculatedWidth / aspect;\n  }\n}\n```\n\ninto just this:\n\n```\nif (aspect && aspect > 0) {\n  // Preserve the desired aspect ratio\n  calculatedHeight = calculatedWidth / aspect;\n}\n```\n\nI think this makes sense: if you specify aspect, you want your height to depend on the container's width, and that's it. \n\nWhat do you think?\n Maybe we mean different things, but usually in a \"responsive\" layout, such as the widely used Twitter Bootstrap library, the width is fixed (either the device width or a fraction of it, say 3/12) and the height is free.\n I'm running into this as well and support @tobia's proposal (only affect the height)\n  Please refer to my concerns here: https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/183#issuecomment-248284741\n\nLong story short, currently if you were to create e.g. a `LineChart` with 2 different lines and 2 different x-axes, there's no way to make those lines overlap. Think, Google Analytics chart for comparing visits in 2 different periods of time:\n![GA](http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/google_analytics_v2_context_from_time.jpg)\n\nWith this functionality, you can specify domain for a categorical axis, allowing you to chop off the time period, you are not interested in. Your data could look something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nconst data = [\n  {timestamp: '2015-01-01', oldValue: 5, newValue: null},\n  {timestamp: '2015-06-01', oldValue: 4, newValue: null},\n  {timestamp: '2016-01-01', oldValue: null, newValue: 3},\n  {timestamp: '2016-06-01', oldValue: null, newValue: 7}\n];\n```\n\nAnd your axis configuration could be:\n\n``` javascript\n<XAxis dataKey='oldValue' xAxisId='oldValues' domain={[0, 1]} allowDataOverflow />\n<XAxis dataKey='newValue' xAxisId='newValues' domain={[2, 3]} allowDataOverflow />\n```\n\nDomain configuration is very similar to that of numerical axis, however instead of operating on values, you operate on indices (indices specified are always inclusive - this is different to how `_.range` works, but similar to how you specify domain for the numerical axis), e.g.:\n\n``` javascript\nconst categories = [0, 1, 2];\nconst domain = [1, 2]; // > visibleCategories === [1, 2];\n\nconst categories = [0, 1, 2];\nconst domain = [-1, 'auto']; // > visibleCategories === [-1, 0, 1, 2];\n\nconst categories = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];\nconst domain = ['auto', 3]; // > visibleCategories === ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 3];\n```\n\n~~I probably need to add `BarChart` support as well.~~ done\n [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/7970670/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/7970670)\n\nCoverage decreased (-0.09%) to 92.68% when pulling **1caf8df61267169c4aaf78b914b54664dddf3364 on kujon:category_domain** into **1987fd35d6e87a02d2ecb0cd82f9141514db290d on recharts:master**.\n [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/7971166/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/7971166)\n\nCoverage decreased (-0.09%) to 92.68% when pulling **d380fc38c5978e19daac668bfaa836f8289c33f7 on kujon:category_domain** into **1987fd35d6e87a02d2ecb0cd82f9141514db290d on recharts:master**.\n [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/7971264/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/7971264)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.03%) to 92.807% when pulling **ec9b5913a0378a7cc74e776939c883793de37f93 on kujon:category_domain** into **1987fd35d6e87a02d2ecb0cd82f9141514db290d on recharts:master**.\n [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/7971445/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/7971445)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.03%) to 92.809% when pulling **0df2a5c064dbfc38f31d8588beaf8acc400da36e on kujon:category_domain** into **1987fd35d6e87a02d2ecb0cd82f9141514db290d on recharts:master**.\n [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/7972872/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/7972872)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.03%) to 92.809% when pulling **49f724ccfa27690212a3298287e01011a968af6a on kujon:category_domain** into **1987fd35d6e87a02d2ecb0cd82f9141514db290d on recharts:master**.\n [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/7986197/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/7986197)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.03%) to 92.809% when pulling **b91e6c17f539f0c442f0681587b900902008dd22 on kujon:category_domain** into **f2fdae30d62693ffa4fd0ee587f3955e6783d76a on recharts:master**.\n @xile611 will address all of those issues, thanks a lot for feedback! On a more general note: what do you think of the idea itself? I find it to be a gimmicky, but useful workaround around some of the current limitations. Ideally IMHO, however, you should simply be able to pass the data in at the Line/Area/Bar level (like you do in the Scatter), rather than at the level of the chart itself. Uber guys have got quite a similar idea here https://github.com/uber/react-vis. This, however, would mean breaking changes.

I try to use recharts with redux and websocket. I get all the new data, but my chart does nothing.\n My code looks like this:\n\n```\n<ResponsiveContainer height={ 200 }>\n  <LineChart data={props.data}\n                   margin={{ top: 10, right: 20, left: 20, bottom: 0 }}\n                   syncId=\"anyId\">\n         <XAxis\n           height={ 30 }\n           dataKey=\"created\"\n           stroke={ text }\n           style={{ fontSize: '12px' }}\n           tickLine={ false }\n           axisLine={ false }\n           padding={{ top: 10 }}\n          />\n         <YAxis\n           width={ 20 }\n           stroke={ text }\n           style={{ fontSize: '12px' }}\n           tickLine={ false }\n           axisLine={ false }\n          />\n    <Tooltip content={<CustomTooltip />} />\n    <Legend />\n    <Line type=\"natural\" dataKey=\"max\" stroke={ red } dot={{ r: 0 }} activeDot={{ r: 4, strokeWidth: 0 }} isAnimationActive={ false }/>\n    <Line type=\"natural\" dataKey=\"usage\" stroke={ green } dot={{ r: 0 }} activeDot={{ r: 4, strokeWidth: 0 }} isAnimationActive={ false }/>\n  </LineChart>\n</ResponsiveContainer>\n```\n\nThe component lives in a stateless function. The data comes from a redux store which is dispatched by a websocket connection. I tried to deliver the data directly from the store in a component. Both gave me the same result.\n 1. The data is correct\n2. Yep\n3. Color variables\n\nThe problem is not to draw a chart. I get initial data from a redux store. A websocket connection updates the store every 10 seconds. If the store receives a update, the chart does not rerender but the chart receives the new data.\n\nI've tried victory charts and it works. I think recharts ignore new data or something. Any idea?\n Everything seems to be fine. I try to provide an example later today.\n Any update on this?\n @HashDot  [Live Example](http://jsfiddle.net/ca1g5Lrf)\n\nMost of the time people forget to use **this.setState()**\n I found a workaround by adding key={Math.random()} to the LineChart element, which forces React to redraw the chart when the component re-renders. I also had to use isAnimationActive={false} on the Line component.  I have a bar graph where there are frequently instances of 0 values, as seen in this image:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/176993/18588237/a0c6ee0c-7bf3-11e6-9a8a-e3299d6038e7.png)\n\nIs it possible with an existing option or custom function not to show bars with a value of 0?\n That's correct, yeah. Ideally, even, I'd love to get rid of the space apportioned for that bar, or be able to set it to a minimum amount. But I'm not exactly trying to create a feature request here, I was mostly trying to see if it was currently possible.\n\nI was able to get something that was close enough to what I wanted by using custom React elements for both the bar and the label that test for value:\n\n```\nconst CustomBar = (props) => {\n    const { stroke, fill, x, y, width, height } = props;\n\n    if (height > 0) {\n        return <rect\n            x={x}\n            y={y}\n            width={width}\n            height={height}\n            stroke={stroke}\n            fill={fill}\n        />\n    } else {\n        return <path d={getPath(x, y, 0, 0)} stroke=\"none\" fill={fill}/>;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n```\nconst BarLabel = (props) => {\n    const {\n        payload,\n        textAnchor,\n        fill,\n        x,\n        y,\n        width,\n        height\n    } = props;\n\n    if (payload.value > 0) {\n        return (\n            <text\n                textAnchor={textAnchor}\n                fill=\"hsla(0, 100%, 100%, 0.8)\"\n                x={x}\n                y={y}\n                width={width}\n                height={height}\n                className=\"recharts-bar-label\">\n                {payload.value}\n            </text>\n        );\n    } else {\n        return <text></text>;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n...and then use them with `<Bar shape={<CustomBar/>} label={<BarLabel/>}/>`.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/176993/18632074/92c47b92-7e43-11e6-8740-9530f070b644.png)\n  I'd like to get something similar to the `PercentAreaChart` example:\n\nhttp://recharts.org/examples#PercentAreaChart\n\nHowever, I'd like it to be a `BarChart`... a `PercentBarChart`.

Works fine locally in Chrome (53), Firefox (48), and Safari (9.1).  I've tried changing and relaxing my tests to get these to pass, but I still have 1 that fails (surprising change from \"2em\" to \"32px\" still fails, even though 2em should be 32px (by default)).\n\nAny idea how to work around this?\n\n---\n\nAlso, my hope is to allow passing any of <Text> props defined within a component's `label` prop defined as an object down to `<Text>`.  Currently these are filtered by `ReactUtils.getPresentationAttributes`, and the additional props do not belong there (`verticalAnchor`, `lineHeight`, `fit`, `angle`, `capHeight`)\n\nWhile the user could import the text label and use it within the label props, like so:\n\n``` jsx\nimport { Bar, Text } from 'recharts';\n\n<Bar dataKey=\"value\" label={<Text verticalAnchor=\"middle\" />} />\n```\n\nit would be nice if the following was allowed:\n\n``` jsx\n<Bar dataKey=\"value\" label={{ verticalAnchor='middle' }} />\n```\n\nThere are some presentation attributes that `<Text>` uses (primarily `width` to word-wrap), but it would be nice if all props were passed.\n\nThoughts?\n @xile611 I know you're busy, but do you have any feedback on this?  Hoping to get it merged soon if possible.\n @xile611 I know SVG doesn't, but this new `<Text>` component does ;).  See also - https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-label/\n If you take a look [updateWordsByLines](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/pull/243/files#diff-6bc302cee0e627fcdb36a23c8e081fa6R44), the calculation is only performed if required (`width` or `fit` prop set).  Have you taken a look at the Text demo yet?\n @xile611 I'm fine with not making it an internal component if that's the direction you prefer, I was just trying to simplify using it by not requiring the user to import and building the component themselves.  It seems like a useful feature to use it throughout, and one reason I spent a good bit of time making sure it was performant (for lack of a better word).  It only calculates the width of words if required (when a fixed width (for word wrapping) or when `fit` is set (to size the font dynamically to fit the container)).  It also only does this once at first, and will only recalc if needed (words change, for example).\n\nI'm fine with keeping this as a component you must import and pass in to use if that's the direction you choose.  If you have any feedback on how to fix the failing test(s), I would appreciate it.  It runs run on all the machines / browsers I have, so I think it has to due with the Linux / older Firefox setup used in CI (system font differences, etc).\n [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/7975518/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/7975518)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.01%) to 92.795% when pulling **650f4373a69a4af57def67ce53356ef8093e603b on techniq:text_component** into **2832d7795cb5118851e0d9274247f962de0c075f on recharts:master**.\n @xile611 Explicitly setting the font-family in the tests fixed the CI failures.

If there isn't, please add an option. Or better, add an option to specify the maximum delay in milliseconds (0 would completely disable the animation).\n Works like a charm. It would be more intuitive if the property existed on AreaChart, BarChar, LineChart, etc as well, though.\n Makes sense. But you could also allow it on the parent for the default behaviour, and override that default on the child element.\n +1 for adding the props at the chart (parent) level Hi All, I am trying to make the area chart real time using socket.io , The problem is every time it get new data, it gets re drawn. Tried setting  \"isAnimationActive\" property to \"false\", but did not help. Any idea how can I stop this redrawn/animation?  I think there is currently a bug with the Customized Label. If you go to http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/PieChartWithCustomizedLabel directly, the customized label will be drawn. But if you go to any other link first such as http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleScatterChart then click on \"PieChartWithCustomizedLabel\", then the customized label won't be drawn. Unfortunately, `isAnimationActive` doesn't work anymore for at least `Line`  If we want to format the symbols, besides the fill, applying a style to the Scatter, won't affect the symbols.\n\nAlso the properties `tickLine` and `axisLine` on `X/YAxis` don't work in the ScatterChart context like it does for `AreaChart` \n ```\n.scatter-point {\n  stroke: rgb(0, 157, 249);\n  stroke-width: 1px;\n  fill-opacity: 0.25;\n  fill: rgb(0, 157, 249);\n}\n\nconst data = [{x: 1, y: 2}, {x : 1, y: 12}, {x: 0.132, y: 19}, {x: 1,y: 1}, {x: 0.17,y: 14}]\n\n<ScatterChart width={600} height={300}>\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"x\" tickCount={4} tickLine={false} axisLine={false}  />\n  <YAxis dataKey=\"y\" tickCount={4} tickLine={false} axisLine={false}  />\n  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"1 1\" />\n <Scatter data={data} className=\"scatter-point\" />\n</ScatterChart>\n```\n\nWith this example you will see that the style won't be applied to the dots.\n `tickSize` and `tick` on `X/YAxis` don't work too for the same case.\n  Here are two JSFiddles that are the same except that the second one has twice as many data points:\n- http://jsfiddle.net/1b5qv2Ld/1/\n- http://jsfiddle.net/1b5qv2Ld/2/\n\nAs you can see, when you double the amount of data points the chart stays the same height, but the bars become twice as small. \n\nWhat I would like to do is the opposite: keep the bars **the same size**, but make the chart **twice as big**. \n\nI still want the chart's width to adapt to its parent though. So how can I do that using `ResponsiveContainer`?\n Sorry, setting the `barSize` by itself doesn't make the chart taller, it makes the bars closer together:\n- http://jsfiddle.net/twzLm0he/\n- http://jsfiddle.net/zvr2qa90/1/\n\nI tried setting `barGap` too but that doesn't seem to do anything. \n Here's a temporary solution I found:\n\n``` js\n    const rowCount = this.props.data.length -1\n    const aspect = 15 / rowCount\n    return (\n      <ResponsiveContainer aspect={aspect} width=\"100%\" >\n          ...\n```\n\nI want the container to stay responsive, so that's why I'm using `aspect` instead of setting the `height` or `width`. It'd be great if aspect was documented by the way, I couldn't find much info about it apart from reading the source. \n @SachaG Thanks!  ![Alt text](http://cfile27.uf.tistory.com/image/2161BB4957D76A7D13871F)\n\nThe space left in the picture\n It solved in width values.\n  When ResponsiveContainer is used with react-router, it's not showing anything.\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { AreaChart, ComposedChart, Line, Area, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts'\n\nimport Navbar from './common/Navbar.jsx'\n\nconst data = [\n      {name: 'Page A', uv: 4000, pv: 2400, amt: 2400},\n      {name: 'Page B', uv: 3000, pv: 1398, amt: 2210},\n      {name: 'Page C', uv: 2000, pv: 9800, amt: 2290},\n      {name: 'Page D', uv: 2780, pv: 3908, amt: 2000},\n      {name: 'Page E', uv: 1890, pv: 4800, amt: 2181},\n      {name: 'Page F', uv: 2390, pv: 3800, amt: 2500},\n      {name: 'Page G', uv: 3490, pv: 4300, amt: 2100}\n]\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <div className='react-wrapper'>\n        <Navbar />\n        <div className='container'>\n          <ResponsiveContainer>\n            <AreaChart data={data}>\n              <XAxis dataKey='name' />\n              <YAxis />\n              <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray='3 3' />\n              <Tooltip />\n              <Area type='monotone' dataKey='uv' stroke='#8884d8' fill='#8884d8' />\n            </AreaChart>\n          </ResponsiveContainer>\n        </div>z\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n Yes, `aspect` worked for me!

On the second page, the 0 width error comes up. I also noticed that if I remove the span caching from `getStringSize` everything works as well. I haven't been able to figure out why this util breaks some of the time but not all of the time. Any assistance is much appreciated.\n Thanks for taking a look. I realize I didn't give much  to help in reproducing. I'll see if I can put together a little example of the bug to share with you.\n Ok. I figured out how to reproduce it and made a little demo showing the issue: https://flame-healer.hyperdev.space/ (click the \"Switch\" button to render a new graph that shows the label collision issue).\n\nThe issue is that I'm using [turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) on this project, so the body of the page gets re-rendered on page navigation. The effect of this is that the `span` that is automatically added to the DOM is removed. However, because turbolinks only replaces the body, and doesn't do a full browser navigation, we aren't reloading the page's javascript. The Recharts library caches the span in memory (via a pointer), and this pointer is not cleared when the user navigates via turbolinks. This means that the `getStringSize` attempts to use that span to do the dimension calculation, but the span is no longer in the DOM, so the result is 0.\n\nI'm not sure what the best solution for this is. I attempted some hacks to make it so turbolinks doesn't remove the span, but none of those worked. If I could clear the cached span pointer, or turn off caching that would fix this issue for me. Please let me know what seems reasonable to you.\n\nThanks!\n Small update. I did figure out a way to store the span element and restore it after turbolinks does the page navigation, so I have a workaround for this. If there was an API for clearing this cached span that would still be cleaner, but I am at least not experiencing the bug anymore.\n We don't want to do that or else a new span will get added every time `getStringSize` is called, which is messy. A better approach would be to set a well known id on the measurement span (e.g. 'recharts_measurement_span' or something), and use `document.getElementById('rechargs_measurement_span')` to look up the span in `getStringSize`. If it doesn't exist in the body, then add it.\n\nI made the change here https://github.com/recharts/recharts/pull/241.\n @xile611 any feedback on #241?\n  Hi, first off, the plugin is great and it's incredibly easy to use.\n\nI am running into one issue: I have a use case where I would like to define a custom domain on an Y Axis and I have data points extending beyond the min or the max value. Example, domain is set as [0, 100] and I have data points [60, 89, 103, 116, 89, 85].\n\nI would expect that my graph would extend out of vision past the Y Axis and the top edge of the chart, but instead, the Y Axis domain is automatically being reset to accommodate all data points.\n\nIs it possible to force the Y Axis domain and not alter it based on the graphed data set?\n\nThanks!\n A prop for affecting the behavior would be perfect. How about `allowDataOverflow` ?\n  For my `PieChart`, I want the `Tooltip` to always appear in the lower right corner of the chart, no matter which section i hover over. I've seen that there are `coordinate` and `viewBox` props, but if I set them, they are overwritten.\n The link is missing from you post. I assume you mean http://recharts.org/examples#BarChartWithCustomizedEvent.\n http://recharts.org/examples/#/en-US/examples/BarChartWithCustomizedEvent. Changed again... an auto-redirect to a default language wouldn't hurt :( For any others who come across this same requirement, you can set the Tooltip `position` which will get respected and not overriden/transformed dynamically. For example:\r\n```\r\n<Tooltip position={{ x: 400: y: 0 }} />\r\n```\r\nEDIT: thanks @breadadams for fixing my typo!\r\nVia https://github.com/recharts/recharts/commit/31d2b2d367adecaef34c5bb0371f27126dc51d8b And for anyone copy-pasting the above solution, you'll want:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Tooltip position={{ x: 400, y: 0 }} />\r\n```  strokeDasharray param of <Line> in <ResponsiveContainer> don't work until redraw, when isAnimationActive is false\n  I have a `Pie` with a custom `label` function. The props passed to the function contain a `percent` property, but the value is not a percentage (e.g. 50 for 50%) but a decimal (e.g. 0.5).\n My point was that the value is wrong, if the property name is \"percentage\", it should be 50, not 0.5. But I can work around that.\n  Hey! First off, thanks for a great library.\n\nUnless I'm misunderstanding the API, I may have found a bug where AreaCharts don't stack as expected.\n\nReproduce: \n1) AreaChart\n2) Use several yAxis\n3) Link the stacked Area chart to any yAxis other than the first one\n\nExample JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/wf2rwcne/\n\n(If you switch `yAxisId={1}` back to `yAxisId={0}` it will properly stack)\n @xile611 I think you misunderstood me - of couse all areas have the same yAxisId and stackId. Check out the JSFiddle for a case where that is not working properly.\n  Is it possible to create a 2-tier (or more) category axis, such as this?\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10280734/18319373/4b2e29ba-751d-11e6-959c-fd3048651b8c.png)\nhttp://peltiertech.com/chart-with-a-dual-category-axis/\n\nI can see I might be able to create a 2 tier by manually specifying a `<Bar />` for each and every grouping value, but it's not ideal.\n Thanks @xile611 it's a good solution although ideally there would be wider gaps between major tiers.\n Is there any roadmap for this functionality ? @xile611 Your demo link does not navigate to a example of customized event. Could you please provide a example of how to go abt this ? @xile611  your link is dead. I think this is what you mean - http://recharts.org/examples/#/en-US/examples/CustomizedLableLineChart - though it no longer shows 2 tiers. Any updated examples? the jsfiddle on CustomizedLableLineChart points to CustomizedDotLineChart jsfiddle.\r\nAnyone know where the  CustomizedLableLineChart jsfiddle is?    Preview\nFollowing along the lines of the ResponsiveContainer example at http://recharts.org/api#ResponsiveContainer I substituted a BarChart for the LineChart shown in the example. However, this did not result in a responsive BarChart.\n\nResposiveContainer creates a ContentContainer element from the react-container-dimensions library. The react-container-dimensions documentation states that \"Children component will receive top, right, bottom, left, width, height as props\".\n\nIt was only after specifying my BarChart's height and width as shown below that the BarChart became responsive.\n\nheight={this.props.height}\nwidth={this.props.width}\nIs this the correct usage of ResponsiveContainer? Nothing along these lines is mentioned in the example documentation at the recharts.org website.\n I will try to create an example this weekend.  Hopefully, I will have something to show in the next few days.\n I'm unable to reproduce the problem I had using jsfiddle.   I'm pretty sure the original problem was due to something on my end so I will close this issue.\n  I'm running into the following problem with a stacked bar chart:\n\n![https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1L2j0r220F0z0I2w1i0j/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-06%20at%206.45.26%20PM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=01406470cd8cc4d8af4ff992d3ec662f&v=0a778b63](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1L2j0r220F0z0I2w1i0j/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-06%20at%206.45.26%20PM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=01406470cd8cc4d8af4ff992d3ec662f&v=0a778b63)\n\nAs you can see the labels overlap each other because the bars are too short. Ideally I would be able to offset a label if the one above is too close, but I'm not sure how to make labels know about each other's positions. \n\nEven if I used some kind of global array to hold the positions, the chart gets drawn from the bottom up which means the bottom label gets drawn before the top one\u2026 Any idea how I can work around this?\n OK, I found a solution that works alright. Here's a quick overview in case it helps others.\n\n![https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/3m361N3U0x3v371N0N2G/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-07%20at%209.04.49%20AM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=01406470cd8cc4d8af4ff992d3ec662f&v=714785e6](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/3m361N3U0x3v371N0N2G/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-07%20at%209.04.49%20AM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=01406470cd8cc4d8af4ff992d3ec662f&v=714785e6)\n\n1: Initialize an empty two-dimensional array to hold all label coordinates:\n\n``` js\n    const bars = 5\n    const columns = data.length\n    const coords = new Array(columns)\n    for (let i = 0; i < columns; i++) {\n      coords[i] = new Array(bars)\n    }\n```\n\n2: Create getter and setter functions and pass them to each custom label component\n\n``` js\n    const setCoords = (column, bar, coord) => {\n      coords[column][bar] = coord\n    }\n    const getCoords = (column, bar) => coords[column][bar]\n```\n\nI'm also manually passing the current bar (i.e. row) number to each label.\n\n3: Inside the component, compare the current label's y coordinate with the previous label's and offset it if needed. \n\nYou can get the previous label by subtracting 1 from the current bar number and calling `getCoords`.\n\n4: Call `setCoords` with the current label coordinates to make them available to the next one. \n\nI would love to know if there's a simpler way to do this, but for now it seems to work well enough. \n This is also relevant for pie charts.\n There's actually one issue with my method: as you can see in the last two columns, the line for \"1%\" goes _behind_ the blue bar. This is because of SVG elements stacks in the order they are drawn, and I don't think there's any way around it\u2026\n\nThe best solution would be drawing all labels _after_ all bars. But that would probably require some changes in the library itself.\n @SachaG is the option for the lines pointing to small areas mentioned in the Brush component API or is this a custom format? I also have an issue of horizontal overlap - when using the Recharts Responsive Container the bar widths become too small for the text labels and they start to overlap horizontally.  Sorry I don't use this library anymore. But as I remember it was all custom code back then.   While I appreciate that Recharts comes with a set of pre-made inline styles to speed up the process, there's some cases where you'll want to customize your chart with your own set of styles. \n\nSo I think it'd be a good idea to always have an option to completely disable inline styles, for components such as `<Legend/>` for example.\n It's good that you can do this, but I still think you should be able to disable inline styles altogether. A practical use case is media queries: maybe you want to style the legend (or other elements) differently on mobile and on desktop. You can't do that if these elements have their own inline styles. \n\nI think as a general best practice, any component that has inline styles should also offer an option to disable them. i.e. something like\n\n```\n<MyComponent style={ this.props.disableStyles ? null : inlineStyles } />\n```\n The problem comes from CSS specificity: \n\n> Inline styles added to an element (e.g., style=\"font-weight:bold\") always overwrite any styles in external stylesheets and thus can be thought of as having the highest specificity.\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity\n\nPractically speaking, this can be a problem if you'd like to overwrite one of the inline styles with a style from your own stylesheet, for a responsive mobile version for example. \n\nSo let's say I want the label to be `position:static` on desktop and `position:absolute` on mobile, with the current system I cannot do that. \n\nSo what I'm suggesting is adding a `disableStyle` option to the `Legend` component that would simply make it have no inline styles at all. I think it would be a relatively easy fix, and I would be happy to submit a PR for it. \n I total understand the problem that @SachaG brought up, inline styles make it hard to overwrite just using CSS (may need `!important`), but I don't think an API named \"disableStyles\" is an answer for that. \n\n@xile611 instead of inline styles, have you thought about using `CSS-Module` ? which should be easier to maintain styles and will not cause overwriting your default style to be a problem.\n +1 for CSS-Modules support. That could be. I'll think more about it. It looks like https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components is doing a lot of things right and it was made with theming in mind.  I'm still not sure what the right answer is, but on this same topic, it would be very useful to be able to set the data plot components (area, bar, line, etc.) styles (stroke, fill, stroke-width, etc.) from a style sheet, rather than specifying each attribute in-line.\r\n\r\nThat way, the config for the components needs only to specify a CSS class (something like \"chart-data-series-1\"). This would be particularly useful when it comes to themes, where the data plot styles need to be easily modified by the underlying theme, without having to change the component configs. as a follow-up to https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/210#issuecomment-285980467 , I also would like to ask if the class that I see generated from the components in the SVG code can be used in the stylesheets to style the individual object of a chart. (the value circles etc).\r\nFor example, this seems to work in the inspector: \r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1768834/26224116/4ebf0646-3c21-11e7-9d0a-cb26beb22376.png)\r\n For the next guy who is trying to invalidate the position absolute property and place it in a style sheet here is what I used.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Legend  \r\n   content={legendJSX} {...legend} wrapperStyle={{ position: null }}  \r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then in your stylesheet your can do \r\n```\r\n@media (min-width: 801px) { \r\n     .recharts-legend-wrapper {\r\n        position: absolute;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n@media (max-width: 800px) { \r\n     .recharts-legend-wrapper {\r\n        position: sticky;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```  It seems like stack charts legends get generated with the wrong order. Assuming you have:\n\n```\n        <BarChart width={600} height={300} data={data}\n            margin={{top: 20, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\n       <Bar dataKey=\"pv\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#8884d8\" />\n       <Bar dataKey=\"uv\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#82ca9d\" />\n      </BarChart>\n```\n\nBar `uv` will appear on top, and `pv` on bottom (see http://recharts.org/examples/#StackedBarChart). \n\nThe problem is that the legend has `pv` first, and `uv` second. Which is confusing especially if you chose to use a vertical layout. \n OK, here's what I mean. If you chose a vertical layout for the legend, it would be:\n- pv\n- uv\n\nOn the other hand, the bar are stacked in this order:\n- uv\n- pv\n\nWhat I'm saying is that the legend and the bars should be stacked in the same order.\n I don't know how I can make it any clearer than that: http://jsfiddle.net/y9bxhbkj/ (I don't know why the legend is overlayed on the chart but that's another matter).\n\nIs it not clear that the bars and the legend are in opposite orders?\n\nThe chart has green on top and purple on bottom, and the legend has purple on top and green on bottom.\n Any thoughts? Would you accept a PR to add an `order` prop to `Legend`?\n By the way, in the meantime I'll use:\n\n```\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column-reverse;\n```\n Well it's true that the order of stacked bar is the opposite of the markup order. So you're right, maybe the bars order should be changed. \n @xile611 I am still seeing this inverted behavior in my horizontal chart:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14200749/21811034/1a68fb78-d71c-11e6-9fe3-af865b94bac7.png)\r\n\r\nThe code used to generate this graph is as follows:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<BarChart layout=\"vertical\" width={800} height={300} data={data}\r\n    margin={{top: 20, right: 30, left: 40, bottom: 5}}>\r\n  <XAxis type=\"number\" />\r\n  <YAxis type=\"category\" dataKey=\"name\"/>\r\n  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\r\n  <Tooltip/>\r\n  <Legend />\r\n  <Bar name=\"Fitness Level 1\" dataKey=\"Level1\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#FBB040\" />\r\n  <Bar name=\"Fitness Level 2\" dataKey=\"Level2\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#0D79A7\" />\r\n  <Bar name=\"Fitness Level 3\" dataKey=\"Level3\" stackId=\"a\" fill=\"#589241\" />\r\n</BarChart>\r\n```  Small typo here: https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/dd7b4b19892a22b7bbfec022f701656b67ef8ec6/src/util/AnimationDecorator.js#L5\n The spelling of `AniamtionDecorator`. \n BTW let me know if you want me to open a PR for this.\n  Curious if there is a particular reason that the legend is not part of the main chart `<svg>`?\n\nUse-case is that users customize charts within our app, and when done are able to download/export them as either a standalone `.svg` or `.png`. In either case, the legend being separate complicates this.\n Maybe even a separate legend component designed to be composed into the main svg, keeping the functionality of both... like an `<SvgLegend>` or something. Just thinking out loud...\n I'm working on making charts exportable as images (to let people share them as Twitter cards) so I also think this would be useful. \n @SachaG I had started a decorator here based on that need: [react-download-svg](https://github.com/derrickpelletier/react-download-svg) for (ideally) use with any svg-based component. It's just a first working pass, open to ideas on a better api for it \ud83d\udc4c \n This looks really cool! Does it convert the SVG to PNG right in the browser? I didn't even know you could do that!\n\nThat being said for Twitter Cards I need to be able to point my meta tag at an image file, so I think I would have to do the conversion server-side first and host the file somewhere. \n Anybody try [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com) which I guess can export to PNG? Or maybe this one https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image/blob/master/README.md\r\n\r\nI'm gonna need this functionality soon, so will be trying it out soon-ish  **How to reproduce**\n1. Implement a simple LineChart:\n\n```\n<LineChart data={data}>\n  <XAxis/>\n  <YAxis width={12} tick={{strokeWidth: 1}}/>\n  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"1 5\"/>\n  <Tooltip />\n  <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#FBC011\" dot={{stroke: '#FBC011'}}/>\n  <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#47484A\" />\n</LineChart>\n```\n1.

Can you have a look?\r\nhttps://github.com/recharts/recharts/pull/402 @xile611 @thoqbk \r\n\r\nCan I help in any way so that this PR is accepted?  Hi\n\nI'd like to hide the first (lowest) tick on the Y-Axis, is this possible?\n\nI'd also like to apply some right-padding to the ticks, because they're touching the axis. I tried to accomplish this with setting the tick function to a custom react element, but when doing so, no tick is displayed at all.\n Thank you so much, worked perfectly\n  When hovering over a bar on ComposedStack (or actually on all bars), the rectangle/cursor background effect should be customizable.\n- a unified and more global approach of doing this is highly appreciated, due to time constraints, I couldn't develop a global utility, I just fixed it on ComposedStack, any other volunteer?\n that's fine, thanks. \n  It would be very useful if there was a React `<Text>` component that could be used in place of the direct SVG `<text>` element that supported word wrapping.\n\nThis component could then be used for wrapping long axis labels (like [this](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7555321) d3 demo), but also used for custom labels.  For example, I have a similar pie chart to [this example](http://recharts.org/examples#CustomActiveShapePieChart) and would like to word wrap long labels in the center.\n\nI envision you would set a fixed width prop on the component and it would wrap the contents (using `<tspan>s`).  For example:\n\n``` jsx\n<Text width=\"200\">\n  Discovered howto \u201clike\u201d things mentally\n</Text>\n```\n\nwould produce something like (stolen from d3 example):\n\n``` html\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"9\" dy=\"0.71em\">\n  <tspan x=\"0\" y=\"9\" dy=\"0.71em\">Discovered how</tspan>\n  <tspan x=\"0\" y=\"9\" dy=\"1.81em\">to \u201clike\u201d things</tspan>\n  <tspan x=\"0\" y=\"9\" dy=\"2.91em\">mentally</tspan>\n</text>\n```\n\nBtw, Victory has a similar concept with their [VictoryLabel](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-label) component.  I'm not sure if using explicit new lines `\\n` is the way to go, or having a `width` prop and having the text wrap to fit.\n The `VictoryLabel` component is nice as it goes beyond this request and supports rotation (angle), anchor positions (horizontal/vertical), and others\n @xile611 I can try to get to this.  I'm under a few deadlines right now myself, but I also need the feature.  If I don't get to it this weekend, I might try to (if you haven't) during a long flight in a week or so.\n\nA couple implementation questions:\n- Should we call it `<Label>` similarly to Victory, instead of the generic `<Text>`?  This would also cut down on confusion with the svg element `<text>` (I've updated the issue to reflect this, but am open for discussion).\n- I think it would be nicer if we had the `width` property and used `getComputedTextLength()` to determine if we need a new line/tspan than the explicit `\\n`.  Thoughts?\n  - I'm not exactly sure how accomplish this within React.  I'm assuming I'll need to use `refs` (which I've not had the need to thus far), but I need to create some temporary nodes, evaluate them, and then change generated DOM structure accordingly.  Any ideas on how best to approach this?\n- Initially I plan to just have the `<Label>` component used by itself for use, but I figure we'll want to use it within existing components (axises, etc).  Any thoughts on how/where this should be done?\n\nI might initially start with just creating a standalone Codepen example of the `Label` component, and then maybe leave it up to you to integrate (if possible) based on the answers above.  Thanks\n Here's a rough proof of concept in a [Codepen](http://codepen.io/techniq/pen/rLXwJJ?editors=0011).  It needs a lot of improvement / cleanup though.\n- Currently only works on initial mount (`componentDidMount`).  Attempting to wire up `componentDidUpdate` resulted in `Maximum call stack size exceeded` (you can uncomment the range input as well as the componentDidUpdate method to reproduce)\n- This implementation works by first rendering each word of the `<Label>` into it's own `tspan` element, measuring the length of each (from `refs`), and then updating the state to set the appropriate lines based on the defined `width` prop, ultimately performing a second render with the corrected lines.  While I didn't witness any flicker for artifacts, it seems like this approach could have problems.  I later [came across](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31305071/measuring-text-width-height-without-rendering/31305410#31305410) a way to do this without rendering by using a canvas to measure text size, but there were some caveats with this approach using `ems` (my current approach may very well have some of the same caveats as well).\n- The implementation doesn't take into consideration the space between words, so it would be possible for a line to exceed the requested width after spaces are inserted.\n\nI'm not sure I'll get much more time on this for a while, so if you do get some free time and want to tackle this further, I would greatly appreciate it.  If I find some more time, I'll try to flesh this out more, but not sure when I'll be able to get this to a PR-level quality.  Also, bullet 3 in my previous comment (integrating/using Label for other components) I figure should be handled.  It would also be nice to look at VictoryLabel and support more of it's features (angle, etc).\n I had a little more time today to work on the Codepen POC and was able to resolve the `componentDidUpdate` issue, as well as take into effect spaces for the calculations.  I ended up using regular old javascript DOM api instead of refs with a temporary `<svg>` and `<text>` element to perform the width per word calculations.\n\nStill need to remove the hard coded `lineHeight`, `x`, `y`, and `dy` values.  Will need to instead take these in and take into affect styling (`fontWeight`, `fontSize`, etc).  This will need to be done on the elements in the calculation, as well as the rendered ones.\n\nAnyways, if someone else can run with this and turn it into a proper PR  before I can, that would be awesome.  If not, I'll try to get to it when I can.\n @xile611 I'm good with calling it `Text`.\n\nI've updated the Codepen again with some tweaks and at this point I feel pretty good about the approach and have resolved all the issues I've encountered thus far.\n\nLooking at VictoryLabel's [source](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-label/blob/master/src/components/victory-label.jsx) and [docs](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-label/), it would be nice if we did something similar with the way they handle anchoring/positioning.\n Does anyone know how to use this to wrap X-axis label? @James2516 set `<Text />`'s width attribute.\r\nhttp://recharts.org/en-US/api/Text#width\r\n\r\n> The width of Text.

I am trying to add JSX either to content prop or as children prop (displays as [object Object]) and both does not work. @essaji, @nivedhithaVenkatachalam: I've hit the same rock.\r\n\r\nSeems that `Label` actually implements `<Text>` [(link)](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/component/Text.js) which is basically `<text>` [(link)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/text) so it won't support html elements, only what's supported by native `<text>` element.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if `<Label>` was implemented using `<g>` so it could be more flexible.\r\n   @xile611 ,\r\nHi I'm utilizing recharts for our new project that includes data visualization, \r\nand one of the requirements is to present some text in middle of the pie/donut charts - \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4598162/34953334-377f1c06-fa25-11e7-9b97-bac644e125b0.png)\r\n\r\nI've noticed that I can use the `<Label >` element to present some text,\r\nbut I can't influence on it's position by setting the `position` prop or x/y props, the following failed - \r\n```\r\n        <PieChart width={200} height={200}>\r\n            <Pie dataKey=\"value\" data={data} innerRadius={60} outerRadius={80} >\r\n                {\r\n                    data.map((entry, index) => <Cell fill={COLORS[index % COLORS.length]} key={entry.name} />)\r\n                }\r\n                <Label value=\"any text\" position=\"center\" />\r\n                <Label value=\"more text\" position=\"insideBottomRight\" />\r\n            </Pie>\r\n            <Tooltip />\r\n        </PieChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAre there additional options to control the label location or utilizing multiple labels, or even pass some \"child\" elements to the Pie chart to be presented in the middle that I missed in the documentation?\r\n\r\nP.S. the data within the pie chart is not derived from the data supplied to the pie chart, \r\nit's unrelated, but this is the requirement of the project lead that designs the project.\r\n\r\nThanks. Any update on supporting multiple labels in center of PieChart? Any update? Hello, any updates? +1\r\nLabel appears to work with a plaintext `value`, plaintext `children`, and `content=renderLabel`, where `renderLabel` returns plaintext.\r\nBut attempting to return html elements from `renderLabel`, or passing them directly to `content` does nothing..\r\n\r\nedit:\r\nAh, so if you try to use non-plaintext content, you need to be aware that:\r\n- your positioning and presentation attributes will get ignored. See how it exits out early here: https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/component/Label.js#L297-L337\r\n- you can only render svg-friendly components.\r\n\r\nHere's a basic example of rendering a custom component in the Label, with centering.\r\n```\r\n          <Label\r\n            content={props => {\r\n              const {viewBox: {cx, cy}} = props\r\n              const positioningProps = {\r\n                x: cx,\r\n                y: cy,\r\n                textAnchor: 'middle',\r\n                verticalAnchor: 'middle',\r\n              }\r\n              const presentationProps = {\r\n                fill: colour || theme.colours.text,\r\n                ...theme.typography.h1,\r\n              }\r\n\r\n              return (\r\n                <Text {...positioningProps} {...presentationProps}>{\"My centred text\"}</Text>\r\n              )\r\n            }}\r\n          />\r\n```\r\nNote that if you only need a single Text element, you can avoid doing the above by just expanding your presentationProps into `Label` and passing your text into its `value` prop.\r\n\r\nWould be nice if `getAttrsOfPolarLabel` was exposed to end users, so we didn't have to copy stuff out of its innards. @qborreda You got those demos?  Hi once again,\nThis will be a quick question.\n\n![example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8009142/17900257/d0f026fe-695e-11e6-82ea-797688dc8289.png)\n\nWould it be possible to somehow force the Area chart to start applying that fill below the curve (at all times), so that I don't get that sort of effect where the curve is intercepting \"fills\", but instead get the effect where fill is always below the curve? \n\nThanks again, super charting library!\n  Hey guys, \nThis might be weird since the Recharts.org example page of AreaChart really works well in both Chrome and Firefox, but I'd really like some help or direction as I'm clueless what to do next but I really like this library and would be more than happy to keep using it in all my future projects.\n\nI'm using Recharts.js in Meteor.js application (if it helps). \nOn the page I render 2 Line charts and 1 Area charts . \nWhat happens is the following:\n- On Chrome, every chart works nicely, meaning animation fully plays.\n- On Firefox, every chart works nicely except the AreaChart type. In its case, animation kinda jumps from 0% to 100% in like a second, barely noticeable that there's is animation in it, more like jerk effect, video below.\n\nWhat I did is I basically took the simplest area chart example (http://recharts.org/examples/#SimpleAreaChart) and put it on the page, no responsive containers (so I can rule that as being the problematic thing out), basically the simplest I can make it.\n\n```\nimport {AreaChart, Area, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, ResponsiveContainer} from 'recharts';\n\nconst data = [\n      {name: 'Page A', uv: 4000, pv: 2400, amt: 2400},\n      {name: 'Page B', uv: 3000, pv: 1398, amt: 2210},\n      {name: 'Page C', uv: 2000, pv: 9800, amt: 2290},\n      {name: 'Page D', uv: 2780, pv: 3908, amt: 2000},\n      {name: 'Page E', uv: 1890, pv: 4800, amt: 2181},\n      {name: 'Page F', uv: 2390, pv: 3800, amt: 2500},\n      {name: 'Page G', uv: 3490, pv: 4300, amt: 2100},\n];\n\n<AreaChart width={600} height={400} data={data} margin={{top: 10, right: 30, left: 0, bottom: 0}}>\n    <XAxis dataKey=\"name\"/>\n    <YAxis/>\n    <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n    <Tooltip/>\n    <Area type='monotone' dataKey='uv' stroke='#8884d8' fill='#8884d8' />\n</AreaChart>\n```\n\nThe only two differences that I'm doing VS the recharts.org site that I can think of are:\n- I'm using class Panel extends React.Component { } notation instead of React.createClass({})\n- I'm using Meteor.js \n\nHere's video of what's happening:\nChrome: https://miscstuff.tinytake.com/sf/OTI2OTE1XzM5MTM1MTQ\nFirefox: https://miscstuff.tinytake.com/sf/OTI2OTE4XzM5MTM1MTc\n\nThe console output on both Chrome and Firefox shows exactly 0 errors/warnings.\nFirefox is also updated to its latest version available as of this moment.\n\nAny ideas? Could Meteor.js, server-side/client-side rendering play role on this?\nThanks in advance!\n @xile611 That totally worked! Thanks! I though I had the latest version but I obviously didn't. I guess you can close this issue then. I can't thank you enough, really good support on this package!\n  This library is great. \n\nAny chance of porting to React Native? Charting libraries are few and far between on React Native.\n Victory charts just recently added React Native support.

How do I start it from 12'o clock?\n  Hey folks, \n\nRecharts looks perfect for a new project I'm working on, but the one thing holding me back right now is IE10/11 have considerably worse performance with larger data sets.\n\nIt's very possible our customers will require charting with 365 points for a years worth of data, in a combination chart. What we've found interesting is that [Morris.js](http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/) seems to perform fine (obviously we'd rather with a React-based library if possible, though) on those browsers.\n- Is it possible the performance on these browsers is due to poor React render operations? \n- Is this something you've looked at before?\n\nCheers,\nSean.\n Thanks @xile611 -- Recharts looks fantastic, we just need to ensure our customers on IE10 aren't getting left out, when comparatively, other libraries seem to perform better. We'd love to use Recharts. :)\n One of the performance issues we've run into is that the XAxis (and subsequent formatting of all ticks, which can be not-free with date formatting) is re-computed/rendered on every render, which is super expensive with large data sets.  \n\nhttps://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/38269105832e2ab3a353e091ddb874b2c39adcfb/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L614\n\nReally need to update the Axis so that they are pure components that don't re-render if the props don't change, and defer formatting of the ticks into the component itself rather than formatting them prior to sending them as a property the component\n I submitted pull request #277.  That should help with some of the large dataset performance issues.  Still need to fix it so that it doesn't format every tick on every render.  Since the ticks are formatted each time, the CartesianAxis can't act as as pure function and will always re-render because the old \"ticks\" object will never === the new \"ticks\" object.\n @billneff79 I noticed in the PR you said\n\n> we've effectively abandoned recharts for our project\n\nI'm curious what you replaced recharts with?\n We ended up writing our own wrapper library that uses d3's rendering methods as well as it's math methods, but makes it all accessible via react components (technically, we use [preact](http://preactjs.com)).  After I got the recharts performance somewhere close to where I wanted it to be for large datasets, I realized that there was still more work to do in adding zooming functionality, native time series, touch handling, etc that I thought it would just be faster to write a library from scratch using what d3 already provides than update recharts.\n\nFor example, instead of re-writing an area chart component from scratch like recharts did, we created an `<Area>` component that takes in as props the scales for the x-axis and y-axis generated using d3-scale methods, as well as the full data array.  \n\nAll `<Area>`'s render method does is render a `<g/>` tag.  The magic happens in componentDidMount where we use the d3-shape library to create a new `area` function and we apply that function to our <g> tag.  componentDidUpdate updates the `area` function and reapplies it to the same <g> tag from the render method.\n\nWe applied that same pattern to create XAxis, YAxis (using d3-axis), Area (d3-shape), Line (d3-shape), Brush (d3-brush), and Zoom (d3-zoom).  We created our own ReferenceLine, Tooltip and other handy stuff using straight react/preact code as we didn't need any magic from d3 for rendering other than the data from the scales.\n\nIn the end, our component definition ends up looking something like this.  The `<Chart>` component takes those scaleDefs props, creates d3 scales from them, and passes it as an array to all of it's children - that's where a lot of the magic lies in addition to just calling d3's rendering functions.\n\nWe may open-source our project some day, but it's not quite ready for open-source prime-time yet - it's still a little too specific to our use case.\n\n```\n<div class={style.stockChart} >\n    { /* MAIN AREA CHART */ }\n    <div>\n        <Chart\n            class={style.mainChart}\n            border\n            width={width}\n            height={300}\n            startIndex={startIndex}\n            endIndex={endIndex}\n            scaleDefs={[\n                { scaleId: 'mainXScale', type: TimeScale, data, startIndex, endIndex, dataSelector: xAxisSelector },\n                { scaleId: 'zoomXScale', type: TimeScale, data, dataSelector: xAxisSelector },\n                { scaleId: 'mainYScale', type: LinearScale, data, startIndex, endIndex,\n                    dataSelectorFactory: isPercentChange ? priceChangeSelectorFactory : false,\n                    dataSelector: isPercentChange ? false : priceSelector,\n                    symbols\n                },\n                { scaleId: 'volumeYScale', type: LinearScale, data, startIndex, endIndex,\n                    dataSelector: volumeSelector, symbols, multiplier: 0.3\n                }\n            ]}\n        >\n            <XAxis\n                height={17}\n                scaleId=\"mainXScale\"\n            />\n            <YAxis\n                width={60}\n                showGrid\n                border\n                scaleId=\"mainYScale\"\n                tickFormat={isPercentChange ? percentFormatter : priceFormatter}\n            >\n                <ReferencePill class={style.lastPricePill} value={lastClosingPrice} formatter={priceFormatter} />\n            </YAxis>\n            <Area\n                class={cx(style.price, style[`compare-color-${i+1}`])}\n                xScaleId=\"mainXScale\"\n                yScaleId=\"mainYScale\"\n                symbol={symbol}\n            >\n                    <ReferenceLine value={lastClosingPrice} />\n            </Area>\n            {/* VOLUME CHART OVERLAYED ON AREA CHART at 30% scale */}\n            <Area\n                class={style.volume}\n                xScaleId=\"mainXScale\"\n                yScaleId=\"volumeYScale\"\n                curveFunction={curveStepAfter}\n                symbol={primarySymbol}\n            />\n            <Tooltip\n                symbol={primarySymbol}\n                referenceLineValue={isPercentChange ? false : priceSelector(primarySymbol)(data[data.length-1])}\n                xScaleId=\"mainXScale\"\n                yScaleId=\"mainYScale\"\n                xFormatter={dateFormatter}\n                yFormatter={isPercentChange ? percentFormatter : priceFormatter}\n            />\n            <Zoom\n                xScaleId=\"zoomXScale\"\n                startIndex={startIndex}\n                endIndex={endIndex}\n                onChange={this.handleIndexChange}\n            />\n        </Chart>\n    </div>\n\n\n    { /* BRUSHABLE CONTEXT AREA CHART  */ }\n    <div>\n        <Chart\n            class={style.contextChart}\n            border\n            width={width}\n            height={50}\n            scaleDefs={[\n                { scaleId: 'contextXScale', type: TimeScale, data, dataSelector: xAxisSelector },\n                { scaleId: 'contextYScale', type: LinearScale, data,\n                    dataSelector: priceSelector,\n                    symbols: [primarySymbol]\n                }\n            ]}\n        >\n            <Area class={style.context} xScaleId=\"contextXScale\" yScaleId=\"contextYScale\" symbol={primarySymbol} />\n            <XAxis height={0} scaleId=\"contextXScale\" />\n            <Brush xScaleId=\"contextXScale\" startIndex={startIndex} endIndex={endIndex} onChange={this.handleIndexChange} />\n        </Chart>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n @billneff79 Thanks for your very thorough response and the code. Eagerly looking forward to your open source debut!\n @billneff79 I'd jump at that. Looking forward to the day.  Tooltip doesn't display the same way if you add or remove `XAxis`.\n\nWithout `XAxis` the tooltip doesn't know the datakey and so display a number.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/areski/97q4apgw/2/\n\nWith `XAxis` we got a perfect tooltip:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/areski/97q4apgw/5/\n Additionally if the chart is display inside a `html table` the tooltip is not being displayed\n I was able to fix this by adding the XAxis, but then hiding it.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<XAxis hide={true} dataKey='name' />\r\n```  There doesn't seem to be way to do a vertical Y-Axis Label like this:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/31308/17833451/864d77f2-66d2-11e6-980a-876703191ddd.png)\n\nMaybe I am missing something, but if I am not it would be great to support. Right now I am using multiple `div`s and transforming `transform: 'rotate(270deg)`, which becomes problematic when dynamic labels are different lengths. Or maybe there's an easy way to use the `label` prop on `YAxis`? Thanks!\n > Currently, you can get this only by a customized label which can be a function or a react element. \n\nFair enough, thanks for the response. FWIW, I would argue that for a `YAxis` label it should be vertical by default mainly because I've never seen a library that doesn't do it that way. When it's horizontal it's either creating extra width on the left or it's bleeding over the axis and potentially clashing with the proper title of the graph.\n I don't see how #160 is a solution to this issue, and therefore am confused as to why this issue was closed.\r\nThe current axis label positioning is very unusual.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have the common situation:\r\nY-axis label vertical and to the left of the y-axis (rather than at the top of the axis)\r\nX-axis label horizontal and under the x-axis (rather than at the far right)\r\nLegend to be vertical and on the right of the chart\r\n\r\nI've tried multiple libraries and rechart is truly the best I've found, apart from the above issues. custom label with these values sort of works...\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst AxisLabel = ({ axisType, x, y, width, height, children }) => {\r\n  const isVert = axisType === 'yAxis';\r\n  const rot = isVert ? -90 : 0;\r\n  const cx = isVert ? -height / 2 : x + (width / 2);\r\n  const cy = isVert ? y : y + (height / 2) + 14;\r\n  return (\r\n    <text x={cx} y={cy} transform={`rotate(${rot})`} textAnchor=\"middle\">\r\n      {children}\r\n    </text>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe vertical alignment of the y-axis label is not quite right.\r\nAlso, transforming rotates before doing the x-y offset, so have to switch those values. Changing the rotation point makes positioning the y-axis label much easier. The following is working for me.\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nconst AxisLabel = ({ axisType, x, y, width, height, stroke, children }) => {\r\n  const isVert = axisType === 'yAxis';\r\n  const cx = isVert ? x : x + (width / 2);\r\n  const cy = isVert ? (height / 2) + y : y + height + 10;\r\n  const rot = isVert ? `270 ${cx} ${cy}` : 0;\r\n  return (\r\n    <text x={cx} y={cy} transform={`rotate(${rot})`} textAnchor=\"middle\" stroke={stroke}>\r\n      {children}\r\n    </text>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n``` Hey @youngnicks can you please provide an example on how would you call this inside <YAxis \r\nlabel={SOMETHING} /> I'm new to react and not yet used to all the prop stuff. @malbolge44, just create the component above and include it in your graph component. You would then use it with the following.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<YAxis label={<AxisLabel axisType='yAxis'>Cost / Customer</AxisLabel>} />\r\n``` @youngnicks thanks it works well. The only thing for me now is that it looks that the `label` prop does not render HTML element (like div, span), I still need to do some format for the label ( in my case the label will consist of two paragraph, one is like `last available month` and the second is`05/06/2016 - 05/07/2016) I enhanced a little based on @youngnicks 's work:\r\n\r\n```html\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\n\r\nfunction renderText(child, x, y, rotate, stroke, key) {\r\n  if (child && child.content) {\r\n    return (<text\r\n      key={key}\r\n      x={x}\r\n      y={y}\r\n      transform={`rotate(${rotate})`}\r\n      textAnchor=\"middle\"\r\n      stroke={stroke}\r\n      {...child.props}>\r\n      {child.content}\r\n    </text>);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (<text\r\n    key={key}\r\n    x={x}\r\n    y={y}\r\n    transform={`rotate(${rotate})`}\r\n    textAnchor=\"middle\"\r\n    stroke={stroke}>{child}</text>);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default function AxisLabel({ axisType, x, y, width, height, stroke, children }) {\r\n  const isVert = axisType === 'yAxis';\r\n  const cx = isVert ? x : x + (width / 2);\r\n  const cy = isVert ? (height / 2) + y : y + height + 20;\r\n  const rot = isVert ? `270 ${cx} ${cy}` : 0;\r\n  const lineHeight = 20;\r\n\r\n  if (children.length > 1 && children.map) {\r\n    return (<g>\r\n      {children.map((child, index) =>\r\n        renderText(\r\n          child,\r\n          cx,\r\n          cy + index * lineHeight,\r\n          rot,\r\n          stroke,\r\n          index)\r\n      )}\r\n    </g>);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return renderText(children, cx, cy, rot, stroke);\r\n}\r\n\r\nAxisLabel.propTypes = {\r\n  axisType: React.PropTypes.oneOf(['yAxis', 'xAxis']),\r\n  x: React.PropTypes.number,\r\n  y: React.PropTypes.number,\r\n  width: React.PropTypes.number,\r\n  height: React.PropTypes.number,\r\n  stroke: React.PropTypes.string,\r\n  children: React.PropTypes.any,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that you can use it as simple: \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<XAxis label={<AxisLabel axisType=\"xAxis\">Hello</AxisLabel>}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you have multiple paragraphes, you can do:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<XAxis label={<AxisLabel axisType=\"xAxis\">{['hello', 'world']}</AxisLabel>}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also tweak the text a little bit:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<XAxis label={<AxisLabel axisType=\"xAxis\">{{\r\n    content: 'hello',\r\n    props: { fontSize: 14, fontWeight: 200 },\r\n}}</AxisLabel>}\r\n``` @neekey I had to use this to get it to align nicely.\r\n```\r\nconst cx = isVert ? x + 20 : x + (width / 2);\r\nconst cy = isVert ? (height / 2) + y : y + height;\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Notice the +20 moved. The y-axis label was too far left, and the x-axis was too low)\r\n\r\nDoes this mean the alignment is not adaptive enough yet? Your example : \r\n\r\n`<XAxis label={<AxisLabel axisType=\"xAxis\">Hello</AxisLabel>}`\r\n\r\nDoesn't work for me.\r\n\r\nI get - \r\n\r\n> Error: <text> attribute y: Expected length, \"NaN\".\r\n\r\nDo you need to feed in the arguments as properties like something like this ?\r\n\r\n`<AxisLabel axisType=\"yAxis\" x={123} y={123} stroke=\"blah\">`\r\n\r\nMy full code :  \r\n\r\n```\r\n        <LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data}\r\n                   margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\r\n          <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" label=\"asdfasdf\"/>\r\n          <YAxis label={<AxisLabel axisType=\"yAxis\">Hello</AxisLabel>}/>\r\n          <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\r\n          <Tooltip/>\r\n          <Legend />\r\n          {lines}\r\n        </LineChart>\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Still newish to react)\r\n Hey @oliverwatkins I had the same problem and I solved it by specifying default values for x and y (the origin).

The newer API for Labels should work inside:\r\n\r\nhttp://recharts.org/en-US/api/Label\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n`<YAxis label={{ value: 'My Y Axis', angle: -90, position: 'insideLeft' }} />` This doesn't fix longer text strings. The rotation is still happening from (0,0) of the text.  Is it possible to create a LineChart (and AreaChart) with numeric data values for both x and y axis? I want a Line calculated with both dataKeys (so that x-axis values are not evenly distributed).\n\nI see how to do this for a ScatterChart (and even connect with linear line), but I want a curved line, and gradients, and options available only with Line/Area charts.\n\nOr is the only option to input connected Null points to simulate that spacing between values?\n\nPS. Great work!\n Both this issue and https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/154 highlight a few of shortcomings:\n1) While almost all line/area charts can be drawn with x-axis being categorical, the problem occurs if you'd like to use axis' domain (imagine a line chart, where you want to draw 2 overlapping lines with different x-axes, both of which have different domains - currently impossible). Then, if you start supporting domains for categorical axes, what should happen if the domain is wider than the categories provided?\n2) Replicating this scenario using scatter chart is not possible either, since it doesn't support multiple axes (and it wouldn't make much sense for it to do so).\n3) Mocking numerical x and y values with scatter chart is also different in terms of behaviour - in scatter chart you interact with data points only, whereas in line/area chart you can be scrolling through their x-axis and the tooltip is always going to show something.\n  You all are awesome! Working on a project on a tight deadline and just came across this library, it's amazing! Any idea on how I might be able to contribute?\n  Is there a way i can force the overflow to be visible? As you can see in the below example, the results are being cut off: \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7227636/17787218/2d33ddb4-6556-11e6-8b2d-7ed0f817fe66.png)\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n  For complex graphs, it is sometimes necessary to highlight one data stream over the others. Hovering over the legend is a good trigger for this. An example of this is found in the [c3 library](http://c3js.org/) (e.g. [here](http://c3js.org/samples/simple_multiple.html))\n\nIn the jsfiddle graph linked below, for example, hovering over the \"Left\" area of the legend would make the corresponding \"Left\", purple bars highlighted and the \"Right\", green bars decrease their opacity.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/dyujxk7L/\n\nI've been trying to figure out how to do this by myself, but although the legend has some unique class names, the charts themselves do not. Therefore I can't do a quick jQuery `onHover` link between the two items.\n\nI suppose I'm asking if option 1 (hover over legend to highlight the corresponding chart) is a possible feature. If not, could option 2 (an id correspondence between the legend and the chart itself) be implemented \u2013 or do you have another suggestion for how to achieve the desired effect?\n\nGreat job with this library; I've found it very useful.\n  I want to achieve something like this.\n<img width=\"976\" alt=\"chart\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4010960/17737257/e32de0ae-64a9-11e6-990e-ed2f49c6083a.png\">\n\nBut the bars are overlapping(http://jsfiddle.net/ragrbruL/15/). i want it to be on side by side.\n\nI can add placeholder dataKey to achieve this though(http://jsfiddle.net/ragrbruL/22/).\n\nIs there anyway to do this without placeholder dataKey?\n  This PR fixes #177 .\n\n`series[i][j][1]` is summation of previous values, so there's no need to add it to `positive`.\n [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/7484345/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/7484345)\n\nChanges Unknown when pulling **a8868b8a0f68ddb01801c94004cf84aa022b5c46 on kazup0n:fix-issues-177** into *\\* on recharts:master**.\n @xile611 It's OK. thank you!\n  As shown in the attached screenshot, The third stack in a stacked bar chart will be shown in unexpected position.\nIf a bar chart contains more than three stacks, the position of stacks may be misplaced\n\n![](https://i.gyazo.com/4fdca38e3d69e5d5c7ea8557dd99bfe9.png)\n\nHere's a reproduction code.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/kauzp0n/m7w8c7uq/\n\nAnd it is not happened if value is negative.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/kauzp0n/csqxnk43/1/\n  **URL**: http://recharts.org/examples/\n**OS**: Linux (Arch)\n**Firefox**: 47.0.1 (empty profile)\n\n![recharts-wrap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/31533/17713217/bc4a6e66-63f1-11e6-8697-5c43beb7bbb7.png)\n\nThe first can be fixed by adding `white-space: nowrap` to the `header .logo` rule:\n\n``` css\nheader .logo {\n    float: left;\n    width: 130px;\n    margin-right: 60px;\n    font-family: Roboto Mono,Consolas,Liberation Mono,Courier New,Courier,monospace;\n    font-weight: 300;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    white-space: nowrap;\n}\n```\n\nNot sure what's causing the second. It's the same for all examples. They work fine in JSFiddle.\n  Is there an easy way to create custom labels while maintaining the layout in the following example: \n- http://recharts.org/examples/#StraightAnglePieChart\n\nMy end goal is to have custom labels and have them outside of the pie chart with lines directing the label to the slice. I have reviewed your example for custom labels (http://recharts.org/examples/#PieChartWithCustomizedLabel) and set **labelLine** to **true**, but can't figure out the math/logic to have the label be outside of the pie, by the line. The following is the function I am referring to, taken from your example: \n\n``` javascript\nconst renderCustomizedLabel = ({ cx, cy, midAngle, innerRadius, outerRadius, percent, index }) => {\n  const radius = innerRadius + (outerRadius - innerRadius) * 0.5;\n  const x  = cx + radius * Math.cos(-midAngle * RADIAN);\n  const y = cy  + radius * Math.sin(-midAngle * RADIAN);\n\n  return (\n    <text x={x} y={y} fill=\"white\" textAnchor={x > cx ? 'start' : 'end'}    dominantBaseline=\"central\">\n        {`${(percent * 100).toFixed(0)}%`}\n    </text>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nA side note: The example for **label** on http://recharts.org/api/#Pie is pointing to a 404.\n Thanks for linking to an existing issue.\n @patryk0605 you can get the labels to appear outside the pie by increasing the radius:\r\n```js\r\nconst renderCustomizedLabel = ({ cx, cy, midAngle, innerRadius, outerRadius, percent, index }) => {\r\n  const radius = innerRadius + (outerRadius - innerRadius) * 1.5;\r\n  const x  = cx + radius * Math.cos(-midAngle * RADIAN);\r\n  const y = cy  + radius * Math.sin(-midAngle * RADIAN);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <text x={x} y={y} fill=\"white\" textAnchor={x > cx ? 'start' : 'end'}    dominantBaseline=\"central\">\r\n        {`${(percent * 100).toFixed(0)}%`}\r\n    </text>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n``` is there any way to show label vertical. in line chart.  Would it be possible to allow for 1 left YAxis and a right YAxis? I want to do something like \n\n``` xml\n<ComposedChart data={data} margin={{top: 20, right: 0, bottom: 0, left: 0}}>\n    <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" tickLine={false} axisLine={false} />\n    <YAxis tickCount={10} tickLine={false} axisLine={false} minTickGap={600} />\n    <YAxis orientation='right' tickCount={10} tickLine={false} axisLine={false} minTickGap={600} />\n    <Tooltip formatter={this.props.drawTooltip} wrapperStyle={{display: 'none'}} />\n    <Legend />\n    <CartesianGrid stroke='#f5f5f5' vertical={false} />\n    <Bar dataKey='pv' barSize={40} fill='#F7B7B4'/>\n    <Line type='linear' dataKey='uv' stroke='#41527D' strokeWidth={3} />\n    <Line type='linear' dataKey='amt' stroke='#F70D1C' strokeWidth={3} />\n</ComposedChart>\n```\n\nWhere the YAxis on the right represents a different scale (related to one of the line charts). \n ah ha! thanks. \n For anyone else working example with a composed chart. http://jsfiddle.net/w7qdap9f/\n Is there a way to get both axis (and the data) to align their 0 to the center? \n My 2 domains are {-4, 4} and {-1, 1}. \n I used [yAxisId=\"right\" orientation=\"right\" ],but they throw some errors like 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'scale' of undefined'! I don't know how to fixed it...... @kekeuy  I'm getting the same error when I use a string for the `yAxisId`:\r\n```\r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'scale' of undefined\r\n    at eval (webpack:///./~/recharts/es6/chart/LineChart.js?:101:86)\r\n```\r\nHowever, the docs do say that you can also use a number for the `yAxisId` and that seems to work.  Could be a good PR opportunity \ud83d\ude04  FYI, it seems the axis id's need to be sequential numbers rather than just integers.   To reproduce:\n1) Edit the fiddle for http://recharts.org/examples#StackedBarChart\n2) Add `layout=\"vertical\"` attribute to the `BarChart` element\n3) Run\n\nIt breaks - `TypeError: g[t] is undefined`\n On my localhost I just get 'coordinate not defined'. \n\nOne would think that changing `horizontal` to `vertical` would simply put the charts on their side, without further intervention from the user.\n\nI'm not sure why you have to change the datatypes of the axes but it isn't explained in the documentation. It would be awesome to have a note explaining how `layout` works in there somewhere. And at least one example of a chart with horizontal bars.\n  ResponsiveContainer computes the size of the chart based on the current window size. It also seems to respond when you make the browser window larger, however if you make the browser window smaller, the chart stays large. Tested on chrome. \n hi Xile. You're correct that it does rescale. I believe the problem I'm having is that I have a chart inside a flexbox container. Since recharts is using javascript to compute the resize, I don't think that it will work with flexbox. This isn't necessarily a recharts issue (or d3.js), but I would presume that a change or config on the recharts side would be needed to achieve what I'm doing. \n @xile611 http://jsfiddle.net/9tjsb7k2/embedded/result/. You'll see it opens to the correct size of the window, and if you resize from a small window to make it larger, it works, but not going from larger to smaller. \n http://jsfiddle.net/oezx3kh2/embedded/result/\n\nThanks, adding width: 0 to the children fixed that issue!\n Does anyone know the fix for `flexDirection: 'column'?` Apparently setting `width: 0` does not fix the issue here.  I figured it out. Kind of. If you're trying to use `flexDirection: 'column'` and run into this issue, I suggest that on your `ResponsiveContainer` that you add `width={'99%'}` along with a static height, like `height={200}`. This will make the chart resize properly. Just setting `width: 0` on the parent element will not work because for some reason `flex: 1` will not override `width: 0` on the parent element. I have no idea why. According to this blog post, [http://gedd.ski/post/the-difference-between-width-and-flex-basis/](url), it should, but it doesn't.  This problem seems to persist. got it working with a 99% width and a fixed height We also got it working using 99% width.  Working with 99% however it would be nice if this worked at 100%. I'll do some further investigating to understand how this could be resolved in a way that doesn't include hacks.  Please add a note in the documentation defining uv and pv:\n http://recharts.org/examples#SimpleRadialBarChart\n Oh, I see. I was hoping they were Recharts values, like min & max.

It worked.\n  Hi, I'm not sure how to do this.\n\nI have this:\n\n```\n<ResponsiveContainer>\n        <AreaChart data={this.props.data} margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\n                .....\n        </AreaChart>\n</ResponsiveContainer>\n```\n\nWhen I inspect it, it shows:\n`<div class=\"recharts-responsive-container\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: relative;\">`\n\nI'd like to change that height: 100% to height: 80%.\nWhat's best way to do that?    \n\nI tried doing this: `<ResponsiveContainer height={'80%'}>` and visually it worked, but when inspecting I still noticed it says the same: `<div class=\"recharts-responsive-container\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: relative;\">`\n\nAnd because of that, chart is rendered in 80% of the space, but then there's a lot of \"margin\" below it (looks like it's still using the 100% of the height, like chart is 80% of the height now, there's empty space below it and that combined still takes 100% of the div's height) and only then does the other content continues. When I manually, in inspector change 100% to 80% it works as I want it to work.\n\n-------------------------div----------------------------\n[Chart]\n[Chart]      <- chart using 80% of the height\n[Chart]  \n.     <- empty space (other 20% of the height)\n------------------------/div------------------------------\n[other content]\n\nAnd I'd like:\n-------------------------div----------------------------\n[Chart]\n[Chart]      <- chart using 80% of the height\n[Chart]  \n[other content]      <- other 20% of the height\n------------------------/div------------------------------\n\nAny ideas?\n  Is it possible to bind a click event, not only on the bar, but also on the bar with the grey background when hovering.\n\nWould be really useful when the bar is to small to click.\n Yeah that will do.\n  Would like to pass scatter component to a composed chart. Currently it doesn't allow to do.\n Ok @xile611 Thanks for your help. I can use the idea of using smooth curve in scatter chart. \n @xile611 is this still not supported?\r\nI want to have a 3d scatter chart (like ThreeDimScatterChart in the samples) in a composed chart, I don't think I can do that with a line chart, or can I? The problem with both axes being of type=\"number\" is no longer valid. Time series data *must* be of type=\"number\" on the time-axis: http://recharts.org/en-US/api/XAxis#scale\r\n\r\nHowever, it might make more sense to just use another line chart with stroke=\"none\".  There seems to be an issue with stacking positive and negative numbers on BarCharts, I'm not sure if it's a known issue.\n\nHere is a JS fiddle showing the issue, which presents differently depending on the ordering of the two Bar elements; http://jsfiddle.net/p9830b6y/\n\nHere is what I would expect the generated chart to look like in both cases;\n<img width=\"533\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-08-09 12 10 49\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1833303/17504318/807db95a-5e2a-11e6-95f9-3db0fd870662.png\">\n\nIs there some way for me to achieve this result? Have I made a mistake, or is this a bug?\n\nThanks,\nAsh\n To clarify, I would expect any chart value that starts at zero and goes into negative (pv in this example) to stack under bars with positive values, and run from 0 to the given negative value (in this case -100).\n @xile611 Thank you for your help, much appreciated! I will use that method.\nHowever, I would consider this behaviour a bug. Would you agree?\n I agree that a stacked chart should display the sum of positive values as you've indicated. However you can see in other charting libraries that the common approach is that positive and negative values are generally separated and stacked above and below zero respectively.\n\nSome examples;\nHighcharts: http://www.highcharts.com/demo/bar-negative-stack\nExcel: http://peltiertech.com/images/2016-03/StackedWithNegative1.png\n Cheers, thanks for all your help :)\n  I want to be able to click on the area chart and be able to retrieve the data that was used to create that point. \nFor example:\n\n``` javascript\nconst collection = [{a: 1, b: 2}, {a:2, b:4}];\n...\n<Area type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"b\" onClick={x} stroke=\"#8884d8\" fill=\"#8884d8\" />\n```\n\nUpdated area example: http://jsfiddle.net/5p61t9qp/4/ to use the click. As you can see it return info about dispatch event and not the data, what should I change?\n\nKind Regards,\nAK\n\nP.S. It works with Bar charts.\n Thank you for the quick answer!\n Awesome! Looking forward to it!\n It would also be nice to select an area and not only one point. Would be useful for time-based area charts.\n @Algiras \nMaybe you can use an composed chart to get informations from an area chart:\nhttp://recharts.org/api#ComposedChart\n\nI need that functionality to and I got that idea to draw hollow bar charts which I can click to get the data. Its a workaround but maybe it fits your needs.\n Here's a solution for getting data/coordinates:\n\nAssign a ref to your chart. Add onClick function to a wrapper div. You can then reference the chart and get state.chartX and state.chartY (coordinates clicked)... or any properties you want.\n\n`<LineChart ref={(ref) => (this.lineChart = ref)} >`\n...\n\n```\nhandleClick(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    const { chartX, chartY } = this.lineChart.state;\n}\n```\n  Currently it seems to take a good bit of boilerplate code just to customize the text on a pie label.  For example, I wanted to include an additional piece of text for the label (the textual name along with the value), which from my understanding, requires the following:\n\n``` js\nconst renderLabel = ({cx, cy, midAngle, innerRadius, outerRadius, percent, index}) => {\n  const radius = innerRadius + (outerRadius - innerRadius) * 1.5;\n  const x = cx + radius * Math.cos(-midAngle * RADIAN);\n  const y = cy + radius * Math.sin(-midAngle * RADIAN);\n\n  const item = chartData[index];\n\n  return (\n    <text x={x} y={y} fill=\"black\" textAnchor={x > cx ? 'start' : 'end'} dominantBaseline=\"central\" key={`label-${data.Id}-${item.Id}`}>\n      {item.Name} ({item.Count})  // all I really need to customize\n    </text>\n  )\n};\n```\n\nSemi-related (and I can create a separate issue if needed), it would be nice if we could use d3-shape's [arc.centroid](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#arc_centroid) (or another simpler way) to center a label within a pie piece, or expose a prop to allow placing labels within the pie or outside with the line.\n\nNot that I don't appreciate all the control within the functions, it just seems like I need to \"brake glass\" too often for simple use cases.\n @xile611 Understood.  I think some util functions would be great (basically expose the same default rendering calls if possible, as well as some additional (render labels in the center of a pie slice, etc).\n @xile611 Since you mention it... :), and speaking of labels on pie charts...\n\nWhile I might ultimately take a different approach to these charts, I'm currently having difficulty getting the labels and/or activeShape's to always been visible when using a `<ResponsiveContainer>` with little real estate.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/177476/17425891/65637f70-5aa0-11e6-8eff-044ebaf06b58.png)\n\nIt seems like I need to be able to determine the `<ResponsiveContainer>`'s width/height and account for a label being rendered outside it's bounds and reposition the labels/etc accordingly (place them in the corners with longer connecting lines, etc)\n\nAny thoughts (or examples) on how to accomplish this?  I might ultimately put all the label in the inside of the pie (when active), or show just the percentages within the pie slices themselves, but it seemed like something that could be solvable none-the-less.\n\nOh, and great work on the library.  It's been the best React graphing/d3 library I've [come across](https://github.com/techniq/wiki/wiki/React-Components#libraries)\n We could check the return value of the `label` function and, if it is a string, treat it as if the string was passed as `label` in the first place. This would allow us to write\n\n``` jsx\n<Pie data={chartData} label={(name, value)=>`${name}: ${value}`}>\n\n```\n PR created: #219\n  When I am transpiling my project, I am getting the following

down and this actually related to ExtractText for CSS in the end for some random reason. Apologies for wasting your time. Closing off.\n  I'm trying to put rechart on dark background.  For a line chart I can see how to change color (stroke) of the lines but I it's not clear to me from docs how to customize any other colors.   I see fill colors specified in SVG attributes.\n  I combined a few example to have a nice half-circle PieChart with an active state. The clipPath used for animating the pie chart (even though I disabled the animation) is actually clipping my active labels as well.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1522455/17277268/f5600d7e-573e-11e6-81cc-af42ce967bf2.png)\n(http://jsfiddle.net/j3d22g0m/)\n\nI tried passing a custom maxRadius to the Pie component, but PieChart actually overrides it based on the Pie width and height.\n\nI guess I could subclass Pie and just remove the clippath, but it feels like there could be a better solution. Maybe Pie could take the max of it's computed maxRadius and the one in Pie's props (if passed), for example.\nNot a big issue and there are workarounds, just wondering what the optimal solution would be and if you'd like a PR for it.\n\nOther than that, works perfectly fine, great work !\n I can do a quick test/PR with a different approach to maxRadius : compute the minimum radius that covers the whole surface of the bouding box. \n Probably as simple as `maxRadius = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(width * width + height * height)` (maybe using cx and cy to compute the maximum width/height values)\n Thanks !\n  I am trying to plot a time series graph using line chart. X axis will have time and Y axis will have price of an item. Since there is not date/time type in this library, I'm using a number corresponding to the time. But when I render, I get a console warning \"x-axis should be category axis when the layout is horizontal\" and an error \"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'coordinate' of undefined\"\n\nHere is the code I am trying\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { LineChart, Line, CartesianGrid, YAxis, XAxis, Tooltip } from 'recharts';\n\nconst data = [\n    {date:10, price:50 },\n    {date:11, price:60 },\n    {date:12, price:54 },\n    {date:15, price:55 },\n    {date:18, price:58 },\n    {date:20, price:53 }\n]\n\nconst SimpleLineChart = React.createClass({\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data} margin={{ top: 5, right: 20, bottom: 5, left: 0 }} >\n              <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"price\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" xAxisId=\"dateAxis\" yAxisId=\"priceAxis\" unit=\"Kg\" />\n              <CartesianGrid stroke=\"#ccc\" strokeDasharray=\"5 5\" />\n              <XAxis type=\"number\" dataKey=\"date\" xAxisId=\"dateAxis\" />\n              <YAxis yAxisId=\"priceAxis\" />\n              <Tooltip />\n            </LineChart>\n        );\n    }\n})\n\nReactDOM.render(<SimpleLineChart />, document.querySelector(\"#main\"));\n```\n I have only two data axes so line chart is better suite for my purpose. In my use case some days the product may be unavailable so I have to skip plotting a data point on that line and plot the trend accordingly. \n Second chart is exactly what I am looking for. But I want the line connecting all the data points (In the image, line is only connecting data points against 10,11 and 12)\n Thank you @xile611 \nProblem with the scatter charts is that it lacks the **curves** ;-)\nIt would be great if you can include a time series chart in your future plans.\nThanks a lot\n Great news. Waiting for the update.\n I actually prefer using Composed, Line, or Area charts for time-series data. It works OK with the X axis being \"category\", but I think it makes more sense to use \"number\" (there are fewer tick labels and the labels shown are evenly spaced, regardless of the exact time values in between). Of course, as expected, it doesn't work (exception right after the X axis is redrawn), but why it is a problem to use \"number\" for both X and Y axis? Hmmm. Since what version? We are having trouble with this with version 0.18.0. Ah so. Yes, it turns out we were running 0.15.3. After upgrading 0.19.0, it now works as expected. Wow. Tested it and it works great. Thanks a lot.  Are there plans to tackle such feature? From what I understand the only thing blocking it is `dataStartIndex` and `dataEndIndex` being part of the state.\n  ![legend_r1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15674149/17133701/c20ff6ac-5359-11e6-9326-105826bc1b80.png)\nI would like to make a bar chart where the the upper min value of y-axis set to 10000 although the highest value is 8000.\n  It would be great to be able to sort the order of items in the tooltip. This could be a prop for ASC/DESC of the original order, or a sorting function with the label name and value.\n\nThe use case is that with stacked bar charts where bars are stacked bottom-up but tooltip labels are top-down. http://jsfiddle.net/nickstanish/zrhudh0f/1/\n  I am working on a LineChart, and I noticed that there is a bug where the point is not being rendered when there is only one data point.

I want to just format my value properly\n It's working now. I don't know, why it wasn't. \n  Is it possible to use this library to make a chart similar to this:\n\n![bar chart with threshold line](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n8/images/nclimate1265-f1.jpg)\n\nAdditionally, can I colour the bars differently depending on whether or not they are above the threshold line?\n @xile611 thanks for the reply. That is very helpful! \n\nRe: fossil fuels, I'm not sure either. I just found this random chart on the web as an example. My own application has nothing to do with it.

Used the example from the docs. http://jsfiddle.net/znqLLdev/1/\n\nRemoving ResponsiveContainer and adding width/height props to AreaChart renders successfully.\n @xile611 There were no console logs. Browser is mobile safari. Tried iOS simulator with ios8.3, and tried an iPhone 4 with ios 6. However, IOS 8.4 simulator worked fine.\n\nThis may have to do with how safari is handling the dimensions of the parent element.\n @xile611 Safari version on io8.3 simulator is the same as yours. Strangely enough, it renders some times but not every time. The axes are there though.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1869157/16621983/e9e01a1a-435d-11e6-8b91-a00cf92299d4.png)\n Discovered the issue while using it with ReactBootstrap tabs which hide/show content depending on which tabs are selected, and then I went back to the recharts website to see if they worked there. The navigation needs some work on mobile, but I tried a direct link to the responsive container examples and the jsfiddles. The axes and gridlines would appear despite the area not appearing. \n\nIn my case, the charts wouldn't render at all, until I forced the tabs component to remove the nodes from the dom. It seems that react-container-dimensions was getting 0 for the dimensions of the parent element despite the styles being set to 100%, and then didn't trigger an update as the visibility changed. That doesn't appear to be the case with the jsfiddle though since the axes and gridlines are there.\n I'm having this exact problem right now in a react/redux/react-router app. Any charts wrapped in a responsive container won't render at all on first load... It has to be some kind of timing issue with the route switching and the responsive container not being able to read the height of the parent correctly. It works fine if I resize the window immediately after page load... but it just won't load anything otherwise. Kinda makes it unusable in its current state :/\n\nThis is just a normal single page app in Chrome for me.\n\nEDIT: \n\nActually, I just discovered that it's VelocityTransitionGroup from the velocity-react animation library that is causing this problem. I am running a transition animation on the entire inner content of the app when routing to new pages... this transition causes the ResponsiveContainer to not be able to get the proper width of the parent container. I just tested it with the animation disabled, and it works correctly. Is there any way to get around this problem?\n @xile611  I'll try to put something together when I get some time.\n I am having the same problem with ResponsiveContainer and react-router. The container is set to a height of 100%, but there is other content above and below the chart and so the browser is happy to squish the div to zero height because there is no content in it. The SVG doesn't render because the div has zero height and thus the container never gets any height and the SVG never can render. I have to set a height on the container to get it to render, but then it isn't really responsive in terms of changes in width shrinking the height. Also when it gets narrow the SVG is cropped instead of scaling in both height and width.\n\nWhy not use a different technique for scalable SVGs? In particular I am used to specifying the desired aspect ratio of the chart using the viewBox and then scaling that using an `<object>` tag. One could also use the padding-bottom hack if you object to the `<object>` tag method. See here for a discussion of techniques for scaling them without the use of javascript:\n\nhttps://css-tricks.com/scale-svg/\n\nI will look to put a pull request together today that uses this technique in conjunction with the ability to pass down a viewBox. It seems Surface supports the viewBox but charts (like PieChart) don't allow it to be specified and passed to the Surface. They are just taking height and width parameters, which are useful but specify the aspect ratio of the container not the chart.\n\nThoughts?\n Here is a fiddle with the problem I am having:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/d0k0rk0m/1\n @xile611 \nSorry I haven't had a chance to create a jsfiddle for it. \n\nIn my case the issue was that the chart wouldn't render on ios 8 at all when used with react-router and tabs through react-bootstrap. However I was able to fix the issue by forcing the react-bootstrap tabs to remove the tab's content (including the chart) so that the chart is re-rendered and the height is correct. It seems that react-container-dimensions doesn't respond to the way react-bootstrap hides/shows the tab content by default without a re-render. \n\nIn the process of debugging that issue, I found the issue on the recharts jsfiddle where sometimes when refreshing the axes would be visible and correct height but area chart would not be visible.\n @nickstanish sounds very related to the problem I was having with react-router & velocity-react. In my case, elements were hidden as velocity-react transitioned them into view (animation). The responsive container seems to have problems with calculating proper values in scenarios where there are hidden parent elements.\n @xile611 Forcing users of the library to set heights on all elements of the tree that leads to a responsive graph really lowers usability. Most developers are used to just placing elements and allowing the browsers render engine to sort out the required height to contain the content.\n\nI think the main problem is that ResponsiveContainer doesn't render anything if the height or width are zero. It just returns null. Maybe defaulting to some minimum height or width would be better?\n An additional idea would be to set an aspect ratio on ResponsiveContainer and if one of the measures is zero then use the aspect ratio and the other to come up with the initial size.\n Something like this:\nhttps://github.com/nick-codes/recharts/commit/0d66374ee06db2c498b458e686f7815e7807c4be\n\nThoughts?\n @nickpalmer What if you use `Math.max` along with the calculatedWidth/calculatedHeight so that percentages are still supported? Maybe aspect should be optional.\n Second pass:\nhttps://github.com/nick-codes/recharts/commit/839506e318b880f955db21800217b58f0cb83f19\nFeel free to comment on the commit as well.\n\nIf this is more like what you would accept I will add some tests around it and submit a PR.\n Awesome!\n I feel like I'm running into a similar issue. This renders fine:\n\n```\n<BarChart width={600} height={400} data={data} barCategoryGap=\"30%\" margin={{top: 75, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\n          <Bar className=\"not-interested\" isAnimationActive={false} dataKey=\"I've heard of it, and am not interested\" stackId=\"a\" fill={fills.notInterested} />\n          <Bar className=\"never-heard\" isAnimationActive={false} dataKey=\"I've never heard of it\" stackId=\"a\" fill={fills.neverHeard} />\n</BarChart>\n```\n\nBut if I wrap the block in `<ResponsiveContainer>`, it stops rendering. Am I missing something?\n It turns out that ResponsiveContainer doesn't work when the inner component has a `height` and width`. This makes sense I guess, but maybe something about it could be added to the docs, if that's the expected behavior?\n Still not working for me :/ (Safari 9.3.1 & Chrome 52)\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { AreaChart, ComposedChart, Line, Area, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts'\n\nimport Navbar from './common/Navbar.jsx'\n\nconst data = [\n      {name: 'Page A', uv: 4000, pv: 2400, amt: 2400},\n      {name: 'Page B', uv: 3000, pv: 1398, amt: 2210},\n      {name: 'Page C', uv: 2000, pv: 9800, amt: 2290},\n      {name: 'Page D', uv: 2780, pv: 3908, amt: 2000},\n      {name: 'Page E', uv: 1890, pv: 4800, amt: 2181},\n      {name: 'Page F', uv: 2390, pv: 3800, amt: 2500},\n      {name: 'Page G', uv: 3490, pv: 4300, amt: 2100}\n]\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <div className='react-wrapper'>\n        <Navbar />\n        <div className='container'>\n          <ResponsiveContainer>\n            <AreaChart data={data}>\n              <XAxis dataKey='name' />\n              <YAxis />\n              <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray='3 3' />\n              <Tooltip />\n              <Area type='monotone' dataKey='uv' stroke='#8884d8' fill='#8884d8' />\n            </AreaChart>\n          </ResponsiveContainer>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n Add an aspect to the ResponsiveContainer to resolve the issue.

The other approaches involve creating multiple `Bar` elements for each color type w/ separate sets of data. I was trying to add a convenience method to avoid creating multiple `Bar` elements and iterate over a single set of data.\n\nUnderstood if you'd rather avoid having multiple ways to do things, but I feel this feature is the most developer friendly, moreso than creating multiple bars. I included a test to help w/ maintenance in the future. If having multiple approaches is less desired than developer friendliness, I can close the commit and use the aforementioned approach.\n\nBut I may be misunderstanding, and I'm a bit unclear about how to do this w/ `style` - would you mind elaborating here?\n @xile611, For the record, I think Recharts is absolutely the most developer friendly d3 react library out there, it's why I chose it - regardless of this feature or the approach. I didn't mean anything negative by that comment.\n\nThanks for detailing the hesitancy of making too many props, I can understand the want to avoid code with endless if statements.\n\nAlso, thanks for the fiddle's showing alternative implementations. Personally I'd prefer the library I'm using obfuscate such tasks, so I do like the `attrFormatter` approach as it allows my application code to be less verbose.\n\nSo, here's my question: would you want an `attrFormatter` in the code, or would you prefer people use the shape / data formatting approach for this feature? If so I can start implementing, but otherwise I could close this PR. I should have made an issue for this first, so just checking this time around :)\n No problem, will do\n  <img width=\"782\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-23 at 21 58 05\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2077683/16302318/ca86bd10-398d-11e6-8bd2-8e66d448b75a.png\">\n [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/6721802/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/6721802)\n\nCoverage remained the same at 93.737% when pulling **1bc20126d1d41f6c534485a66f2297d4d316bc09 on iuriikozuliak:hotfix/composed-bar-chart-yAxisId** into **0b2be09c90c1b3c2962d9f76cde8f681f24a5316 on recharts:master**.\n @xile611 Please take a look on it at http://jsfiddle.net/jvhd96pq/ and check error in the console, it happens at this line - https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/c326127737687e0e89d75935c799f3b1e70b8e56/src/chart/BarChart.js#L125\n\n`sizeList` is undefined at `this.getBarPosition(bandSize, sizeList[axisId])` since `axisId` equals `xAxisId` for horizontal layout instead of `yAxisId`.\nIn general it is rather a hotfix, than a proper solution for a problem, current version works only because usually xAxisId === yAxisId === 0\n   [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/6719078/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/6719078)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.02%) to 93.754% when pulling **a4c96851c3c1eb9200c8d168006a06cf63b2a098 on george-cz:master** into **0b2be09c90c1b3c2962d9f76cde8f681f24a5316 on recharts:master**.\n [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/6719935/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/6719935)\n\nCoverage decreased (-0.05%) to 93.686% when pulling **2780b60261c55ffd5cbffe1d26245704d3b74022 on george-cz:master** into **0b2be09c90c1b3c2962d9f76cde8f681f24a5316 on recharts:master**.\n You're right, I believe my latest commit fixed that.

When I hover over a tick and my cursor is in the right hand half of the tick, the tooltip is displayed on next tick.\n\nIts even visible in example here: http://recharts.org/examples#SimpleBarChart\n\nDo you know about this issue? Are you planning to address it anytime soon? \n Hey, I created a pull request that should fix this: https://github.com/recharts/recharts/pull/126\n  Question: How can i set min-height of `<Bar />` component ?\n @xile611 wow! thank you so much!\n @xile611 what does the number represent? Percentage? Or pixels?  I am struggling to find a way to allow padding on the Y axis so that the top value is not coming close to the top of the graph itself. This is a stylistic thing that I believe should probably be best achieved while building the svg elements and can not be easily modified using css after the svg has rendered.\n\nA good example of what I want to be able to control in recharts is [how c3 handles Y axis padding](http://c3js.org/samples/axes_y_padding.html).\n\nHere is an image of what I am seeing is desirable to be able to control.\n\n![paddingtop](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/996725/16247420/418978e6-37cf-11e6-9489-3693b8448d05.png)\n @xile611  I saw `domain` and if I understand it correctly the problem I see is that is you can't really say `max + 20px` as `max` could be any number large or small. The designer in me loves how easy c3 allows you to just throw pixel values at it so my chart doesn't look so crammed and I don't have to worry about the data involved as it's merely a style issue.\n\nSo for example your example of `[0, max + 100]` works great for any data that is in the 100's .... but say you have data that could exit in the 100's in some cases but then exist in the 10,000's the next time the same chart is used. This means you would have to evaluate the data first and decide on what fraction of the total data gives you the best breathing room. `[0, max + (n * dataRange)]`\n\nI see value in separating style from data in this case, but I appreciate the example it will definitely work to give the desired result.\n You are awesome, thanks a lot!\n  Thank you for recharts!\nI've got a simple example going and the tooltip box is too small to show all the data.\nAlso the text is inline instead of in 3 separate lines.\nI'm using es6, babel, webpack.\n\n![image](http://i.imgur.com/DESUdkk.png?1)\n\nSorry, I couldn't make it work on JSFiddle.

How would I go about that?\nSorry to ask a million questions. You're the greatest.\n  Hello,\n\nMy team is between using c3 and recharts. We want to use recharts as our project is react and it works a lot better with our technology. BUT a lot of people see the curves on the spline line graphs on recharts to be a problem. I wanted to bring this to you and see what you think.\n\nIgnore the other styles; but as you see in the image below that c3 (the image on the bottom). Has more smoothed out curves if you look closely.\n\n![unnamed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/996725/16209682/c683c286-36fd-11e6-8551-4218e09724b8.jpg)\n\nI know this is a very nebulous ask, but was wondering if you would consider making the curves that recharts use more smooth. Thanks for recharts; it's great.\n This is great information!\n\nI didn't see you could add your own custom d3 interpolation in your [documentation](http://recharts.org/api/#Line). But that is awesome. I will definitely be using this, thanks again and sorry for missing that.\n @xile611  Hello, this is working great for us but there is something I have noticed that you should be aware of. I get this warning when using a custom d3 interpolation.\n\n```\nwarning.js?8a56:44Warning: Failed propType: Invalid prop `type` of value `function cardinal(context) {\n      return new Cardinal(context, tension);\n    }` supplied to `Area`, expected one of [\"linear\",\"monotone\",\"step\",\"stepBefore\",\"stepAfter\"]. Check the render method of `ComposedLineAreaChart`.\n```\n\nJust a heads up as if recharts is allowing a custom type this warning seems to be a tad misleading. This could be because of us using es6 as well though.\n\n```\nimport { curveCardinal } from 'd3-shape';\n<Area  type={curveCardinal} />\n```\n\nThanks!\n  Using this library for work @ NS1.com. In the past we've used Horizon charts (see http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/time_on_the_horizon.pdf) for certain sets of data where there are large spikes which obfuscate changes that are not of the same delta across the given data set (think of a line chart where there's one data point at 10000, but most other changes are in the 10's, and how the visual appearance for the lower changes are sometimes incorrectly seen as subtle).\n\nThere are some D3 applications of horizon charts out there (see http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1483226).\n\nI'd love to take on the coding work, add animations + tooltip formatting in the manner to which other chart types behave, and submit a PR but wanted to see if\n1.) That's cool re: contribution guidelines and\n2.) If horizon charts are even of interest\n\nLMK and I'll get on it!\n  [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/6625220/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/6625220)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.03%) to 93.733% when pulling **ceae75741fd87db400dfadcfd4082ef524915ad3 on feature/sankey** into **f8126a7e87e1d27b88dab4b1455770886281cf60 on master**.\n  [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/6624162/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/6624162)\n\nCoverage decreased (-0.06%) to 93.7% when pulling **965a382e1140c70047c083eac58965fcc53002d1 on feature/sankey** into **6cee618bca1cfb056641e17e61290f384cbcead1 on master**.\n [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/6624618/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/6624618)\n\nCoverage decreased (-0.06%) to 93.7% when pulling **3c86a858da805b2a316b2bfeb4c3d310b24f9977 on feature/sankey** into **07ce17017fb4596e9dda2959b43f2c6479409388 on master**.\n  Here is [fiidle](http://jsfiddle.net/mcf1akad/1/)\n\nIf data has only one item then tooltip not showing up, But when data has more than one item (uncomment second one in fiddle) then showing tooltip.\n\nIs there any other configuration to allow tooltip in single item ?\n  [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/6584235/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/6584235)\n\nCoverage remained the same at 93.765% when pulling **0ce35521354fd78a32e637e317a37a32215da637 on feature/sankey** into **0633b2e293d2e0a188d8c3e3ee424f0d07506e9c on master**.\n  Hello,\n\nI am working with recharts and and trying to produce something like this:\n\n![mock](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/996725/16024302/a70bc204-3186-11e6-8e22-74df5c99ff9c.png)\n\nBut this is not easy to achieve with recharts as the stroke I get for any custom tooltip or active dot seems to be hardcoded to `#fff`.\n\nThe fill is the only thing that has my custom color information passed down, and considering it's a reference to a gradient it doesn't do me much good.

If not, might a workaround like creating multiple data series and connecting them in the chart work?\n @xile611 Thank you, but that's not quite what I want. I'd like to draw one line made of different line types. I forked your example and tried it here: http://jsfiddle.net/nightlyop/ggg0trdh/1/ Unfortunately it does not compile, because I added the property `type=\"number\"` to `XAxis`. Without that property, the two `4` are regarded as two different categories.\n The chart is ok. I guess I could use the `content` attribute of the `Tooltip` component to make sure, that the data of the point connecting two series appears only once.\n\nUsing `type=\"number\"` does still break the example. Is this my mistake?\n  I am using a RadarChart to represent a bunch of scores ranging from 0-3 (whole numbers only) in different categories. However, no matter what I try there are always five circles drawn on the grid, one of them being at radius zero of course. As you can imagine, this seems confusing when the grid lines are between actual possible scores. How Would I go about setting the number of circles on my grid? I was hoping setting the polarRadius array on PolarGrid would do it, but I have had no luck.\n\n```\n<ResponsiveContainer width={'100%'} height={300}>\n  <RadarChart\n    data={radarData}\n    margin={{top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20}}\n    innerRadius=\"0%\"\n    outerRadius=\"100%\"\n  >\n    <Radar name=\"Left\" dataKey=\"L\" stroke=\"#e91e63\" fill=\"#e91e63\" fillOpacity={0.3} />\n    <Radar name=\"Right\" dataKey=\"R\" stroke=\"#673ab7\" fill=\"#673ab7\" fillOpacity={0.3} />\n    <PolarGrid gridType=\"circle\" polarRadius={[0, 50, 100, 150]} />\n    <Legend />\n    <PolarAngleAxis dataKey=\"test\" />\n  </RadarChart>\n</ResponsiveContainer>\n```\n My current solution was to set a domain of 0-4 instead of 0-3 to make results appear on the gridlines. However, this does add an extra gridline to the graph that is \"unreachable\".\n`<PolarRadiusAxis domain={[0,4]} tick={false} axisLine={false}  />`\n Thank you! Surprised I missed that... \n Ah that makes more sense. (: I also noticed it says default type is circle but mine defaults to the polygon...?\n Sounds good. I will let you know if I find anything else. Thank you much for theverything library. Works wonderfully.\n  I'm trying to create functionality that syncs up 2-3 charts so that I can use one Brush component to keep the displayed chart area in sync across all charts. Similarly, when I hover over a chart and get the tooltip popup display, I'd like to sync this across all charts to be able to compare all 3. The goal is to have a more clear alternative to having multiple y-axes on a single chart. \n\nA good example of what I'm trying to do can be seen in the visualizations here:\n\n[http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/)\n\nIs there anyway to compose multiple charts together to be able to more easily use singular controls like the brush across multiple charts? Something like a ComposedVisualization component wrapping multiple LineCharts (or whatever else). \n\nOr do you have any tips on how I can tap into the onHover event for a chart to trigger all tooltips displaying simultaneously for a given point hovered over?\n A little more info: I've been looking at the state properties being used for each LineChart (or ComposedChart/AreaChart/etc.) to track & show the Tooltip... just trying to figure out a good way to wrap my set of charts with a container component that syncs those state properties on each chart anytime the state changes & isTooltipActive is true.\n  Hey, guys. Nice work on recharts. Really enjoying using it so far, but just noticed one issue. When using the Brush component (view finder/zoom control/slider bar) in charts that are wrapped with a ResponsiveContainer component, they don't resize/rerender correctly like the rest of the chart does. \n\nIs there a prescribed way to make this work that I haven't found or is this a visual bug that needs to be fixed? I first noticed it my project, but added a Brush to the ComposedChart demo on JSFiddle and had the same issue.\n\n[http://jsfiddle.net/8uzkn19y/](http://jsfiddle.net/8uzkn19y/)\n\nIt's not a huge deal but seems a little wonky.

You might be adding a ref to a \ncomponent that was not created inside a component's `render` method, or you have multiple copies of \nReact loaded (details: https://fb.me/react-refs-must-have-owner).\n\n...\n\n@/......./recharts/test/index.js:89873:21 <- webpack:///test/specs/chart/LineChartSpec.js:201:20\n```\n\nI will try to fix.\n @xile611 Thanks a lot!\n  Does anyone have an example of how the line chart animation can be modified? I'm trying to see if we can have it be unique and maybe come up from the bottom instead of from the left. Thank you!\n\nAlso, if I disable animations, does react-smooth get bundled still?\n\nThank you!\n @xile611 how do I disable animation?\n Oh I see, I didn't realize it was specific to the Bar component and not the BarChart component. Thanks.\n @xile611 @jasonHzq Rather than start a new issue, I thought I would add to this. Is there a way to trigger the animation only when the graph is enters the view e.g. you scroll down to the graph area and then it starts animating? I'd rather not delay the animation using `animationBegin` or slow it down using `animationDuration`. Thanks!\n Although not ideal, I ended up using some conditional logic to display the graph component based on React's event system, specifically `onMouseEnter`. I can go into further detail if anyone was interested. Would still like to know a better way to solve that however.\n I think there is currently a bug with the Customized Label. If you go to http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/PieChartWithCustomizedLabel directly, the customized label will be drawn. But if you go to any other link first such as http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleScatterChart then click on \"PieChartWithCustomizedLabel\", then the customized label won't be drawn.    Currently, the reference lines/dots are rendered _before_ the actual chart component (in `[generateCategoricalChart.js`](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/src/chart/generateCategoricalChart.js#L750-L751))\n\nAs SVGs do not have the concept of z-index but rather renders elements as they appear in the document this means that we can't have ref lines/dots _on top of_ chart data.\n\nIs there a reason for ref lines/dots being rendered below?\n I'm not really following. Could you perhaps post a small example of how to shelter the refs from e.g. a Bar chart?\n This is awesome! Cheers!\n Hi, how about rendering the elements in the order we provide?,  i'm currently trying to show the axis inside the bars on the barchart but can't use z-index, if i could render the axis at the end this would take priority whitout the z index, \r\n```\r\n<BarChart width={400} height={400} data={data}  >\r\n  <YAxis />\r\n  <Legend />\r\n  <Tooltip />\r\n  <CartesianGrid vertical={false} />\r\n  <XAxis dataKey=\"name\" />\r\n</BarChart>\r\n``` Hey! I know this is already closed, and my question is not even entirely related, but maybe you guys have ran into it... It is #1325\r\nIm interested if it is possible to only show references after the animation has ended... Anyone?\r\nThanks! @ppseprus Did you find a solution?  Hi,\n\nWhen adding recharts to a fairly simple React project and importing it as `import x from 'recharts'` I'm getting this error in my Webpack build.\n\n```\nERROR in ./~/recharts/lib/component/Legend.js\nModule not found: Error: Cannot resolve module 'node_modules/react-dom/dist/react-dom.min/server' in /Users/emiloberg/code/charttest/node_modules/recharts/lib/component\n @ ./~/recharts/lib/component/Legend.js 51:14-41\n\nERROR in ./~/recharts/lib/component/Tooltip.js\nModule not found: Error: Cannot resolve module 'node_modules/react-dom/dist/react-dom.min/server' in /Users/emiloberg/code/charttest/node_modules/recharts/lib/component\n @ ./~/recharts/lib/component/Tooltip.js 47:14-41\n```\n\nI can't really figure out why (and not where that `.min` part comes from), but looking at the `Legend.js` and `Tooltip.js` files they're importing ReactDOM as: \n\n```\nimport ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';\n```\n\nThat points to the source files.\n\nReplacing the import lines in those two files with this line will solve the problem: \n\n```\n//import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';\nimport ReactDOMServer from 'react/lib/ReactDOMServer';\n```\n\nPlease let me know what I can do to help debugging.\n Ah finally figured it out. I was using an old webpack config and had (for some reason I can't even think of)  an alias set up; `'react-dom': 'node_modules/react-dom/dist/react-dom.min'`\n  I had read the API and examples about BarChart and wanna to mix it into my project.\nFirst, I copied the JS code from [http://recharts.org/examples/#SimpleBarChart](url) to my React Project. And I got the graph below.\n![qq 20160509175008](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14069488/15109689/3db56b26-160f-11e6-9293-e2a102717289.png)\nEverything is ok. But after I made some changes...\n\n``` javascript\n<BarChart\n    width={800}\n    height={400}\n    layout=\"vertical\"\n    data={data}\n    margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}\n>\n    <XAxis />\n    <YAxis type=\"category\" dataKey=\"name\" />\n```\n\n![qq 20160509174358](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14069488/15109773/b71c50e2-160f-11e6-972e-104395647d6e.png)\nThe uv is disappeared from Page A, and XAxis is totally wrong, obviously.\nI was wondering if you could point out my configuration mistakes about layout: \"vertical\". I will be greatly appreciated.\n seems like the default types of `XAxis` and `YAxis` are tuned for a `horizontal` layout chart - would it be an improvement to the library if the defaults for the axes would change automatically when the chart's layout is switched?  Currently the curve types are restricted to 'linear', 'monotone', 'step', 'stepBefore' or 'stepAfter'. `d3-shape` supports more of them, so it might be a good idea to allow any of them to be specified.\n\nMy reasoning behind it is that recharts have already got a glorious API and it would be good to allow people to create more chart types based on it (I personally need the chord diagram).\n Thanks a lot! Do you guys fancy Chord Diagram contribution? Something along those lines: http://www.global-migration.info/\n  When my pointer(indicated by the red point) is in the red rectangle, the tooltip of Page-B shows up. But I suppose that the tooltip of Page-B shows up when the pointer is in the the blue rectangle.\n\n![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5550931/15037838/ec5ec434-12d0-11e6-8fd3-5646bdae0e27.png)\n\nI am using Chrome 50 and edge on Windows.\n\n\u5982\u56fe, \u5f53\u9f20\u6807\u5728\u7ea2\u8272\u6846\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u65f6\u5019, \u5c06\u663e\u793aPage-B\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u5177. \u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u9f20\u6807\u5728\u84dd\u8272\u6846\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u624d\u663e\u793aPage-B\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e48?\n  just like this \n\nhttp://www.humblesoftware.com/flotr2/#!mouse-drag\n\nbut i can't find any event api \n  Hello! First of all thanks for this excellent chart library!\nA little thing that I'm missing is the option to animate again the chart when the underlying data change, to provide a visual feedback to the user when this happens.\n\nActually I've achieved this in an hacky way, by wrapping the chart in a component and force a full redraw of the chart by changing the component state inside the `componentWillReceiveProps` callback, but that's not an ideal solution.\n\nDo you think this is a feature that could be implemented in the future?\n Cool, thanks for the info!\n Great, I will try it asap! :)\n It seems to only animate the last bar or line when the data is changed. The other data shows up instantaneously. http://jsfiddle.net/x1yoboc7/249/  when tooltip reach viewBox.x + viewBox.y, it will suddenly jump to another coordination, fix to stay at bottom or top feels no surprise to user :)\n You are right.  I didn't think about that.  This is why the tooltip will jump. Let me try something make the jump smoothly.\n  Hi\n\nI haven't found anything about it in documentation, so I guess it isn't possible at the moment.\n\nIt would be useful to be able to change name in easy way of groups. Now they inherits labels from property name of data series.\n\nIn my case I need it to be translated for instance. Of course I can create new data series where I put new elements with changed keys, but in my opinion it's not good solution to this problem.\n\nI think it would be good idea to send into Chart element array/object with mapped labels, something like, if I have values like:\n[{name: 'A', x: 5, y: 7}, {name: 'B', x: 2, y: 6}, {name: 'C', x: 4, y: 4}, {name: 'D', x: 3, y: 1}]\nI would like to send there something like this:\n{x: 'My X value', y: 'My Y value'}\n Thanks, that's exactly what I was looking for. :)\n   My bad, I was reading the recharts awesome source code. Wish me next time\nwill do something right : )\n\n2016-04-27 19:28 GMT+08:00 xile611 notifications@github.com:\n\n> Thanks!\n> But getTooltipBBox is not a misspelling, it means getting bounding box of\n> the tooltip.\n> If you have used _Raphael.js_ before, you may know getBBox which is a\n> method of Raphael element.\n> I just borrowed the naming from _Raphael.js_.\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/recharts/recharts/pull/78#issuecomment-215055011\n  Can you use Tooltip with Treemap? I can't find any place in the docs where it says which components can use Tooltip.\n @xile611 wow thanks!\n Could you provide an example with tooltip and treemap?  Ideally I think both should be rendered side by side. I've tried digging into this to see if I could provide a fix but it looks like it's touching several parts of the library.\n\nTo replicate the error change line:\nhttps://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/master/demo/component/BarChart.js#L10\nto:\n\n```\n{ name: 'food', uv: 3300, pv: 4567, amt: 6500 }\n```\n\nand try and view the barchart demo.\n\nI'd be more than happy to try and put in the work here if someone could point me in the right direction of which pieces would need to be modified.\n Wow that was fast!  Thank you for all of your hard work! \ud83d\udc4d \n\nIn my case I was abusing the charts a little bit, using the dataKeys on a horizontal barchart to be the values so it was a little easier to read, and then color coding the bars for identification below them if that makes sense.\n  I have been trying to render ComposedChart and BarChart from the server. The grid and axis get rendered but data content isn't. I see no error nor warnings. It is suppose to be working? I see no mention about server-side rendering at http://recharts.org/\n\nThanx\n I have no idea how to make server-side rendering with jsfiddle.\n\nMy isomorphic app is based on react-starter-kit. I forked it so you can see the whole code here: https://github.com/Renaud009/react-starter-kit. I just added recharts library with npm and copied the ComposedChart component based on this example http://recharts.org/examples#LineBarAreaComposedChart.\n\nMaking a GET localhost:3001 with Postman shows me that items (ex. try to find class recharts-line-dots) are not rendered on the first call but axis as well as grid are.\n\nMaybe it has to do with the animation?\n Thank you, it works like a charm.\n\nAnd good job with this chart library.\n  That\u2019s it :octocat: \n  On the [Radar Chart example page](http://recharts.org/examples/#SimpleRadarChart), the `data` array contains a `fullMark` property with a value of `150`:\n\n``` js\nconst data = [\n    { subject: 'Math', A: 120, B: 110, fullMark: 150 },\n    { subject: 'Chinese', A: 98, B: 130, fullMark: 150 },\n    { subject: 'English', A: 86, B: 130, fullMark: 150 },\n    { subject: 'Geography', A: 99, B: 100, fullMark: 150 },\n    { subject: 'Physics', A: 85, B: 90, fullMark: 150 },\n    { subject: 'History', A: 65, B: 85, fullMark: 150 },\n];\n```\n\nAdding that property to my dataset did not seem to have any effect. Additionally, changing the maximum value in my array of data changed the rendering of all other data points.\n\nIt looks like `fullMark` has been deprecated in favor of `domain: [0, 150 /* desired max value */]` on `PolarRadiusAxis`.\n\nIf that is correct, a change to the example page is likely needed which I will gladly submit a PR for if desired.\n Hi there.\r\n\r\nI tried the above. It doesn't seem to work... It just plots according to the max number... no scaling :-(\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAlex The above does not work for me too. \r\nThe following code does not work.\r\n`    {\r\n        data.map((entry, index) => (\r\n          <Cell domain={[0, entry.fullMark]} key={`cell-${index}`}/>\r\n        ))\r\n    }`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I check <cell>. It's parents are `<Bar /><Scatter /><Pie /><RadialBar />`. `<Radar />` is not in the list. I guess it is the reason?  When using `0.8.8` installed from NPM, everything works as expected.\n\nWhen I clone the repo and build locally using `npm install`, `npm run build` and `npm link`, I get the following errors:\n\n```\nError: addComponentAsRefTo(...): Only a ReactOwner can have refs. You might be adding a ref to a component that was not created inside a component's `render` method, or you have multiple copies of React loaded (details: https://fb.me/react-refs-must-have-owner).(\u2026)\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nError: removeComponentAsRefFrom(...): Only a ReactOwner can have refs. You might be removing a ref to a component that was not created inside a component's `render` method, or you have multiple copies of React loaded (details: https://fb.me/react-refs-must-have-owner).(\u2026)\n```\n\nI _think_ those errors are coming from `ResponsiveContainer`, but when I remove that from my app's code, I get:\n\n```\nReact can't find the root component node for data-reactid value `.0.3.1.$appContent.$mainFeedContent.0.0.0.3.$dc627119-d8b6-4dd5-964a-bd69706b5faa.1.0.$=11.$1.0.0.5.1:$bar-0.0.$rectangle-0.0`. If you're seeing this message, it probably means that you've loaded two copies of React on the page. At this time, only a single copy of React can be loaded at a time.\n```\n\nBoth errors reference multiple copies of React, so I'm think that has something to do with it, but I'm unsure how that is happening, especially if `npm run build` is the official way to build this.\n\nAm I missing a step?\n Turns out I was bit by this: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5188\n  I am trying to graph a time-series with recharts and thing will be better/simpler if I could use the D3 timeScale (x axis values are Date).\n\nI look into the code to see where scale where set and I try to replace the scalePoint by scaleTime in getFormatAxisMap(). But it doesn't work (it would be too easy). It throw an error in getTicksOfAxis() because scaleTime obviously doesn't have the bandwidth method. I suppose that is far to be the only issue of changing the scale.\n\nDo you have any idea if making the scale customizable or having an option to specify that we want a time scale on one of the axis will be difficult to implement?\n My slightly simplified Chart component:\n\n``` javascript\nconst Chart = ({ values }) =>\n  <div style={{ height: '10rem' }}>\n    <ResponsiveContainer >\n      <LineChart\n          data={values}\n          margin={{ top: 5, right: 0, bottom: 0, left: 0 }}\n      >\n        <Line type=\"linear\" dataKey=\"value\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" dot={false} />\n        <CartesianGrid stroke=\"#ccc\" strokeDasharray=\"5 5\" />\n        <XAxis dataKey=\"time\" tickFormatter={tickFormatDate}/>\n        <YAxis dataKey=\"value\" tickFormatter={twoDigitsWithMetricPrefix}/>\n        <Tooltip\n            formatter={twoDigitsWithMetricPrefix}\n            labelFormatter={tickFormatDate}\n            wrapperStyle={{ width: 100, backgroundColor: '#ccc' }}\n        />\n      </LineChart>\n    </ResponsiveContainer>\n  </div>\n```\n\nWhere _values_ is an array of {time: Date, value: Number} and _tickFormatDate_ is a function very close to [d3.time.format.multi(formats)](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Time-Formatting#format_multi).\n\nThe component is working but the ticks aren't at _round_ time:\n![recharts_timeseries](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1727215/14180497/8624e83e-f763-11e5-946a-c61b767bcb6a.png)\n\nA similar chart using NVD3 with ticks each 5 minutes:\n![nvd3_timeseries](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1727215/14180367/00b3c40e-f763-11e5-9a1a-59bc16c5ce41.png)\n\nI also like to be able to choose the number of ticks for each axis, or precise that I want more of them.\n\nThanks for your work!\n Thanks @xile611 \nIt works with a minor modification, my _time_ property need to be a timestamp instead of Date.\n It might be useful for other people that want to use recharts for timeseries that I specify my other work-around.\n\nBy default XAxis is of type _category_ so I cannot specify it's domain and it isn't linear; if I have points every minutes with a 5 minutes hole in in the middle, the graph will display a hole of a duration of 1minute :-( .\n\nI try using a _number_ axis and specify the domain but it doesn't work because of the way recharts is done.\n\nSo I end up using a _category_ x axis but I manually ensure that they are a point every minutes of my whole domain, with some point having an _undefined_ value.\n  ``` javascript\n<ResponsiveContainer height={200}>\n  <PieChart>\n    {...}\n  </PieChart>\n</ResponsiveContainer>\n```\n\nThis works nicely but React reports warning of\n`Invalid prop 'height' of type 'number' supplied to 'ResponsiveContainer', expected 'string'`\n\nIf I change the `height` to `<ResponsiveContainer height='200'>` the container doesn't work.\n\nI looked at the source code of ResponsiveContainer.js, the propType does require string. However the function it depends on in `DataUtils.js`, here is the core:\n\n``` javascript\nexport const getPercentValue = (percent, totalValue, defaultValue = 0, validate = false) => {\n  // ...\n  const str = percent.toString();\n  const index = str.indexOf('%');\n  let value;\n\n  if (index > 0) {\n    value = totalValue * parseFloat(str.slice(0, index)) / 100;\n  } else if (percent === +percent) {\n    value = percent;\n  }\n```\n\nApparently my height '200' in string doesn't go into any of `if` branch so this function gives me a height of 0, but 200 in number works well.\n\nIs there a way supporting 200px of height, and without propType warning?\nEither a fix in `getPercentValue` or a change of propType would work for me.\n Nice work.

Also as I checked code - default value for tickCount is 5, but it displays 6 ticks.\n @xile611 \r\nCan we remove `tickCount` from the API doc for `XAxis` then? @itsdeezy PR https://github.com/recharts/recharts.org/pull/66 submitted if you want to add anything.  http://jsfiddle.net/x1yoboc7/15/\n Thats because you mutate `this.state.data` instead of creating new array based on previous.\nReplace `arr.push(a)` with `arr = [...arr, a]`.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/x1yoboc7/16/\n  I am in the process of swapping out `react-d3` in favor of `recharts` and everything has gone well up until the point that my tests ran.\n\nWhen `ResponsiveContainer` is rendered with `renderIntoDocument` in my Karma tests (with `karma-chrome-launcher`), the [`invariant` warning](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/e296ba602703176e8f744d35d5c2f82a928607f8/src/component/ResponsiveContainer.js#L60-L64) is thrown and my test blows up.\n\nAfter digging in to it a bit, it appears that `getComputedStyles`, called from `OuiDomUtils.width`, is returning an object where all values are blank strings. This means that the `width` of the container element is essentially `0` which in turns causes the `invariant` to fail.\n\nWhile I see why it would be desirable to want a container with a width greater than `0`, is that any reason to blow up the render path?\n\nAFAIK, having a `0`-width (or -height) container element won't cause any errors to be thrown, so maybe it'd be better to go with a softer `console.warn` rather than a hard stop?\n\nShort of removing the `invariant`, the only way I was able to get my tests to run was to re-write the test to use `shallowRender` (which is not something I really wanted to be forced to do :confused:)\n\n I was unable to find any way to get `getComputedStyles` to _not_ return empty values so I have a feeling like the logic for `ResponsiveContainer` simply won't work in the context of Karma + Chrome. I even looked at your own tests and noted that you are using `shallowRender` (via `enzyme`) so you are likely not seeing this particular \"feature\"\n\nSorry if it seems like I'm complaining. Its a corner case (albeit a confusing one) and the rest of this lib seems pretty :100:. Thanks!\n  Actually `labelRadius` will make sense to position the label from centre.\nEx: `{labelRadius: '50%'}` for positioning in the middle of the slice.\n`{labelRadius: 10}` or `{labelRadius: -10}` to position it from the outer radius\n  It's very weird that the default config creates all slices with the same colors. For comparison, I'm adding two pie charts. The left one is recharts, the right one is from c3js.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/941075/13228286/e6f72b66-d979-11e5-8850-a51696c08225.png)\n Yeah, to be honest, I think the api should change a bit. I was thinking in something like this:\n\n``` js\n<PieChart>\n    <Pie>\n        <Slice name=\"Mobile\" value={70} fill=\"#9cacf1\" />\n        <Slice name=\"Desktop\" value={15} fill=\"#8884d8\" />\n        <Slice name=\"Tablet\" value={15} fill=\"#82ca9d\" />\n    </Pie>\n</PieChart>\n```\n\nIMO, this makes more sense for pie charts and it's good to be declarative.\n\nIf you don't think this API is good, at least we should be able to not pass any color in the data fields and still get different colors for each slice.\n ? is issue closed?\n So ,, can i help?\n This is awesome, thanks!\n What about customization of the labels? For example, what if I want to display values as a percentage instead of just as a number?\n I want to use different colors for each pie slice and change the stroke color if a slice is hovered over. That means I have to create custom `Cell` components to be able to set `fill` and `stroke`. I have to bind `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseEnter` for the hover effect, so it reads like this\n\n``` jsx\n<Pie data={chartData}>\n{\n  chartData.map((entry, index) => {\n    const stroke = this.state.selectedIndex == index ? 'red': undefined;\n    return <Cell key={`cell-${index}`}\n                 fill={colors[index]}\n                 stroke={stroke}\n                 onClick={this.pieClicked.bind(this, index)}\n                 onMouseEnter={this.enterArea.bind(this, index)}\n                 onMouseLeave={this.leaveArea.bind(this, index)} />\n  })\n}\n</Pie>\n```\n\nNow, if I enter a cell with the mouse, the whole chart is re-rendered, because the state changes and the `render` function is called again and the handler props change (because `bind` creates new functions).\nI cannot bind the handlers to the `Pie` because they won't be called if the `Pie` has `children`.\nAny suggestions?\n Never mind, I figured out that the actual problem was that I was computing the `chartData` array in my `render` function. I moved that to the constructor and now it works as expected.\n @jochenberger Thank you very much! That fixed my issue.\r\nIn another note, do you happen to know why adding ResponsiveContainer to any Recharts graphs results on animations no working? I found that setting height and width on the ResponsiveContainer node fixes it, but then nothing is responsive anymore.  For me the Cell color don't change at all this is my issue https://github.com/recharts/recharts/issues/1043 can anyone help? here is a working fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/pwa5zka0/1/ since the one above doesn't work  Author of [react-stockcharts](https://github.com/rrag/react-stockcharts/) here\n\nI came across recharts a couple of weeks ago, and just today had a chance to read some source and play with the examples. When I looked at the API, it looked very similar to my project and was excited. Looking at the code of the different `XXXChart` I saw that you are limiting to a set of types you have created.\n\nTake an example of http://jsfiddle.net/1n97rmsy/ where I have added a `circle` and `rect` on line 20 and 21, those are not displayed. It could be as simple as the user wanting a background text on the chart.\n\nI believe it is essential to be able to support composition of custom components, at least for all the cartesian charts.\n the 2 projects are very similar, not only in the way the chart composition works. the variable exposed to `window` on the UMD build of `react-stockcharts` is `ReStock`. This similarity is just too cool to pass :)\n\nstockcharts has gone through a few iterations of api changes.\n\nWhen I started with it, I was using the `cloneElement` of all the children, then started to use the react `context` (and still do) and checking the type of children for certain props. Now with the yet to be released version (0.4). There is just one type check, and the parent passes props down via context. \n\nUsing custom components, and svg elements on a chart is a solution for many problems that are hard to imagine initially. For me it was essential, since there are so many types of financial indicators that the api had to be capable to accommodate new types.\n\nThere is duplication of logic between the different children of `CartesianChart` which can be reduced by using `context`. In any case I believe the api you currently expose is at the right abstraction, offering flexibility to improve upon later..\n\nI also draw inspiration from [d3fc](https://github.com/ScottLogic/d3fc) very nice charting library (not just for financial charting) with different renderers and indicators.\n  When rendering in server SVG Path is not visible when using LineChart (did not test other). If i use chrome devtools and remove `stroke-dasharray: 0px 1px;` from style it is visible again.\n I understand that `stroke-dasharray: 0px 1px;`. But don't you think that rendering behavior should be same on server side and client side? I've got exactly same code and different results. From the other side I think that default behavior of component should be that it is visible rather than hidden.\n It still doesn't work for me, or I don't understand something. I have updated to 0.8\nAfter server side rendering i still don't see Path because in Path i Have `stroke-dasharray=\"none\" style=\"stroke-dasharray:0px 1px;\"` \nI understand that behavior of SSR and CSR is same when rendering, but after componentDidMount you change style to `style=\"stroke-dasharray: 1180.76px, 0px; transition: stroke-dasharray 1500ms ease;\"` to have nice animation and it becomes visible.\n\nI will repeat my opinion: default props of chart should be that path is visible. I can make it visible by setting up strokeDasharray to \"1180 0\" or what is also intereseting isAnimationActive to false. \n\nbtw. i couldn't find how to disable animation in documentation.\n\nthnx for fixing other bugs\n sure. https://github.com/isilweo/recharts-ssr-test/ here is very simple repo with standard ssr rendering and on the end client side js is loaded.\n\nExact code is in shared/chart.js in my repo\n\n```\nimport {LineChart, Line, Legend} from 'recharts';\nimport React from 'react';\n\nexport default class Chart extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        const data = [\n            {name: 'Page A', uv: 4000, pv: 2400, amt: 2400},\n            {name: 'Page B', uv: 3000, pv: 1398, amt: 2210},\n            {name: 'Page C', uv: 2000, pv: 9800, amt: 2290},\n            {name: 'Page D', uv: 2780, pv: 3908, amt: 2000},\n            {name: 'Page E', uv: 1890, pv: 4800, amt: 2181},\n            {name: 'Page F', uv: 2390, pv: 3800, amt: 2500},\n            {name: 'Page G', uv: 3490, pv: 4300, amt: 2100},\n        ];\n\n        return (\n            <LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data}>\n                <Legend />\n                <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" />\n                <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" />\n            </LineChart>\n        );\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLook also on this screenshots, maybe it will be more obvious:\n1. Client side rendering, everything is visible\n   ![selection_116](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1628252/13245088/fd1907c0-da0a-11e5-87c0-f59a2d9aee4e.png)\n2.

When wrapping this around ResponsiveContainer I've got no error but also no output.\n\ncode to reproduce\n\n```\n        <LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data}\n              margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\n           <XAxis dataKey=\"name\"/>\n           <YAxis/>\n           <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray=\"3 3\"/>\n           <Tooltip/>\n           <Legend />\n           <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" />\n           <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" />\n        </LineChart>\n```\n\nand\n`console.log(renderToString(<SimpleLineChart />));`\n  Hey, \n\ni've been testing Recharts recently and jumped into few problems with server side rendering. I've tested a lot of different charting libraries for React and I would love to stop my search on recharts. Hope that we can fix SSR problems. I have very simple script with Simple Line Chart from example and use renderToString from react-dom/server. If you wish i can post it here or somewhere as a gist.\n\nWhen adding ResponsiveContainer wrapper around LineChart it doesn't produce any output.\n\n`<div class=\"recharts-responsive-container\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;\" data-reactid=\".1zgxrmyubk0\" data-react-checksum=\"1605641647\"></div>` this is all I have. \n\nI believe I should have same output for server and client.\n\nmy code\n\n```\n      <ResponsiveContainer>\n        <LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data}\n              margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>\n           <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#8884d8\" />\n           <Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#82ca9d\" />\n        </LineChart>\n      </ResponsiveContainer>\n```\n  I found a quite interesting implementation of component, which provide width and height to its children.\n[https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/blob/master/docs/AutoSizer.md](url)\n\nIts based on https://github.com/sdecima/javascript-detect-element-resize and as the docs say...\n\n> it not only detects javascript generated resize changes but also changes made from CSS pseudo classes e.g. :hover, CSS animations, etc.\n\nYou can see it in action here in `Autosizer` tab:\n[https://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized/](url)\n\nSo i already have used `AutoSizer` in my project and it works perfectly!\nI think I can make a PR a bit later.\nWhat do you think?\n  I think it is worth considering, it seems more intuitive to, in case of `ReferenceLine`, only define a `x` or `y` prop instead of `type` and `value` or, in case of `ReferenceDot`, define `x` and `y` instead of value pairs. :+1: \n You could still use this for dynamic values, so I really can't think of any problems with that solution right now\n\n``` jsx\nvar values = {x: 'Page C', y: 5};\n<ReferenceDot stroke=\"green\" label=\"Min PAGE\" {...values}/>\n```\n  If I may suggest to add an option if you are using `[auto, auto ]`, have a bool property like alwaysShowReferenceLine\n Also it shouldn't render if its out of the domain. \n  Server side rendering of ResponsiveContainer doesn't currently work because of oui-dom-utils. I've filed an issue there https://github.com/oneuijs/oui-dom-utils/issues/1\n\nMaybe we can leave this one open, until the other one is resolved to keep track of it.\n\nHere is a trace:\n\n```\nReferenceError: window is not defined\n [app]/[recharts]/[oui-dom-utils]/build/index.js:10:29\nResponsiveContainer.js:24 Object.<anonymous>\n[app]/[recharts]/lib/component/ResponsiveContainer.js:24:20\n```\n Okay, the author just released https://github.com/oneuijs/oui-dom-utils/releases/tag/v0.3.6\nA little version bump should fix this.\n  Recharts is currently the biggest library in my project.

However some of the props doesn't get applied to the graphs such as `strokeDasharray`\n  I cant make horizontal legend to be responsive for LineChart.\nI mean it would be nice to set height for LineChart and then chart would be use that height to recalculate height of Surface and Legend so `height(Surface) + height(Legend) == props.height`\n\nFor now Legend is just overlapping.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/fxtwg1k7/1/\n Thanks @xile611!\nIt works fine now.\nYour approach of calculating height for `Legend` is a bit tricky, but it works ;)\n\nBefore your commits I have solved problem another way similar to what `react-dimensions` does with a few additions (recalculating dimensions in wrapper's componentDidUpdate and rerender children only if it changed):\nhttps://github.com/digidem/react-dimensions/pull/12/files\n I mentioned that if I pass specific `wrapperStyle` to `Legend` (whatever?), the chart will not show:\n`wrapperStyle={{ fontSize: '12px', bottom : '10px' }}/>`\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/fxtwg1k7/2/\n\nIt happens due assumption that such attributes like bottom, top ... will be numbers, not strings.\nNot so serious, but for now I think it may be fixed by changing PropType of `wrapperStyle` from object to shape.\n The problem is still exists for PieChart. @xile611 Could you fix it in next version please?\n Sure:\n[http://jsfiddle.net/xtned4bj/3/](http://jsfiddle.net/xtned4bj/3/)\n  I just mentioned that `shallowCompare` method is totally useless for current version.\nI slightly changed `pureRender` decorator to store information about results of `shouldComponentUpdate`.\n\n```\nwindow.perf = {};\nfunction shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n  var displayName = this.constructor.displayName;\n  if (!window.perf[displayName]) {\n    window.perf[displayName] = {\n      yes: 0,\n      no: 0\n    }\n  }\n\n  var result = shallowCompare(this, nextProps, nextState);\n  if (result) {\n    window.perf[displayName].yes += 1;\n  } else {\n    window.perf[displayName].no += 1;\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nAfter render LineChart and mouseovering for a while I got results:\n\n```\nLine              yes: 1963      no: 1\nLayer             yes: 3527      no: 0\nAnimate           yes: 1971      no: 0\nCurve             yes: 2350      no: 0\nSurface           yes: 2346      no: 0\nCartesianGrid     yes: 391       no: 0\nCartesianAxis     yes: 782       no: 0\nLegend            yes: 782       no: 0\nTooltip           yes: 391       no: 0\nDefaultTooltip    yes: 391       no: 0\nDot               yes: 1579      no: 316\n```\n\nThe chart is almost totally rerender on any event yet it has the same data.\n\nFirst of all, functions created in render should be refactored, cause it totally breaks pureRender.\nMore info here: [https://medium.com/@esamatti/react-js-pure-render-performance-anti-pattern-fb88c101332f#.30axfnwr2](url)\n[http://benchling.engineering/performance-engineering-with-react/](url)\n\nI tried to use another approach for some components and it works much faster:\n\n```\nfunction notDeepEqual(a, b) {\n  return JSON.stringify(a) !== JSON.stringify(b);\n}\n```\n\n...but I don't think that's a good solution.\nguess we should find better way to deal with that problem...\n Thanks, @arcthur.\n\nYeah, it work faster now. \nActually `isEqual` from `lodash` is yet another way to perform deep comparison. In terms of performance, this approach is pretty expensive.\n\nThe problem is not only for tooltip, but in managing state in common sense.\nEvery time LineChart is rerendering, it creates a bunch of new objects for `children`:\n\n```\nconst items = findAllByType(children, Line);\n\nlet xAxisMap = this.getAxisMap('xAxis', items);\nlet yAxisMap = this.getAxisMap('yAxis', items);\nconst offset = this.getOffset(xAxisMap, yAxisMap);\n\nxAxisMap = this.getFormatAxisMap(xAxisMap, offset, 'xAxis');\nyAxisMap = this.getFormatAxisMap(yAxisMap, offset, 'yAxis');\n\n```\n\nI think it would be better to store such auxiliary objects (like axisMaps and offset) to state, and perform shallow comparison for own LineChart props (nextProps) and children props (nextProps.children[].props) in componentWillReceiveProps. If that comparison will be false, we could recalculate these objects, otherwise just reuse previous state.\nThis approach will allow us to use shallowEqual check for other pure components.\n\nDeep comparison seems like a brute force to achieve some performance boost, but it hides problem rather than solves it.\nWhat do you think?\n  I'm using React 0.14.3.\nCould you please update the library to meet dependency version ?\n Current version support react 0.14.x.\nCan you provide error message?\n My error is:\n\n```\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY react@^0.14.0\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY react-dom@^0.14.0\n\u2514\u2500\u252c recharts@0.5.2\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY react@^0.14.0\n  \u2514\u2500\u2500 UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY react-dom@^0.14.0\nnpm WARN EPEERINVALID pure-render-decorator@0.2.0 requires a peer of react@^0.14.0 but none was installed.\nnpm WARN EPEERINVALID react-addons-shallow-compare@0.14.7 requires a peer of react@^0.14.7 but none was installed.\nnpm WARN EPEERINVALID react-addons-transition-group@0.14.7 requires a peer of react@^0.14.7 but none was installed.\nnpm WARN EPEERINVALID react-smooth@0.0.7 requires a peer of react@^0.14.0 but none was installed.\nnpm WARN EPEERINVALID react-smooth@0.0.7 requires a peer of react-dom@^0.14.0 but none was installed.\nnpm WARN EPEERINVALID recharts@0.5.2 requires a peer of react@^0.14.0 but none was installed.\nnpm WARN EPEERINVALID recharts@0.5.2 requires a peer of react-dom@^0.14.0 but none was installed.\n```\n It seems like you specify exact version of react or react-aadons-*:\n    \"react\": \"0.14.3\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"0.14.3\"\n\nTry to add caret like so\n    \"react\": \"^0.14.3\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^0.14.3\"\n\nIf not, please share your dependencies sections of `package.json`\n Thank all. Just my mistake :D. It works fine now.\n @checkraiser what was the solution?\n @checkraiser How do you fix it?\n @Ohar: As i remember, we should remove the react dependency from recharts, and use react depdency independently. \n I resolved this issue saying **requires a peer of react@>=0.14.0 but none was installed.** by uninstalling the react and react-dom and then locally install the react@0.14.0 and react-dom@0.14.0..\r\nafter this, I was able to install my module which had react@>=0.14.0 added as \"peerDependencies\": {\r\n    \"react\": \">=0.14.0\"\r\n  },.\r\nI uninstalled and installed the react with the latest version again, It worked for me. I had the same problem wasted few hrs. after upgrading NODE and NPM it worked. also try using PowerShell  A few options:\n`ResizableContainer`, `AutoResizeContainer`, `ResponsiveContainer`\n +1 for `ResponsiveContainer`\n  I've got the following error when tried to import recharts:\n\n```\nModule parse failed: D:\\...\\node_modules\\recharts\\src\\index.js Line 1: Unexpected token\nYou may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.\n| import 'ima.js-babel6-polyfill';\n| import 'core-js/es6/math';\n| import Surface from './container/Surface';\n```\n\nI think it happens because you have `\"main\": \"src/index.js\"` in package.json instead of `\"lib/index.js\"`.\n Agree. \nJust mentioned other libraries use `jsnext:main` field in package.json to specify entry point for sources with es6 modules (in our case `src/index.js`), but seems like it can be handled by rollup only. Should check it first...\n > seems like it can be handled by rollup only\n\nYeah, unfortunately webpack v1 (I'm not sure about v2) doesn't handle es6 modules :(\n\n> Just mentioned other libraries use jsnext:main field in package.json to specify entry point for sources with es6 modules (in our case src/index.js)\n\nFor instance, react-route use it like [this](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/package.json#L15). So it would be great to make it the same way.\n  Awesome work,\nAre there any plans to make charts adapt to the container size on resize? or is it a concern of the container component?\n  Would just like to say this library seems awesome.\nGreat job!\n Indeed! I want to reinforce that feeling :) Awesome work, folks!\n  ### recharts/recharts now has a Chat Room on Gitter\n\n@arcthur has just created a chat room.
