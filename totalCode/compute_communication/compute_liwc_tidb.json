LGTM  Added syntax like select /*+ TIDB_SMJ(t1, t2) */ ... which indicates within this select block, t1,t2 will be joining with merge join; if needed, a sort will be appended in case of no order provided by child operators. The hint matching only matches table name and alias like in MySQL.\r\n\r\nIt will try to generate different plans according to join keys. Say a = b and c = d it will try both merge on a/b (ASC or DESC), c/d (ASC or DESC) and pick a plan with lowest cost along side other operator cost evaluation.\r\nThe merge join operator itself do a streamline iteration caching same key rows for both sides for look-back cross product. If a single key count is larger than memory size, it then will OOM. \r\n\r\nOn presence of merge hint, join reorder will be turned off. @ilovesoup \r\nYour git config should set the same email as github.  LGTM @mtunique Good Job!\r\n@coocood @tiancaiamao PTAL LGTM  @arthuryangcs Thanks for your PR! Please address the comments and resolve the conflict.

LGTM\r\nGood Job! LGTM  LGTM LGTM Please fix conflicting.  LGTM\r\nThank you for your PR!  LGTM\r\nThank you for your PR! Sorry for the delay, there are many PRs conflicting on typeinfer files.\r\nMerging each one makes other PRs conflicting, so we have to queue the PRs.\r\n when this PR is ready to merge, we will notify you to resolve conflicts.  Please fix CI.  @framlog Thanks for your PR!\r\nPlease sign the CLA. LGTM\r\nGood job! @framlog Feel free to send us a PR to make sqrt() better. :)  Thanks @zzl0 \r\n\r\nNow we must use `golang.org/x/net/context` uniformly, like our other projects do.\r\nUsing standard `context` seems to be caused by auto package import here,  /cc @shenli   Good idea!  @biolee Thanks for your PR!\r\nPlease add some unit test.  @maxwell92 please sign the CLA. LGTM Thank you @maxwell92   @zcfrank1st What is `occ`? OCC: Optimistic concurrency control. @shenli \r\n\r\nTiDB is designed for large database (more than thousands of millions of rows) and conflict is rare.\r\nYou may need to queue transactions if the contention is really high. @zcfrank1st   @neoguojing \r\nThank you for your report anyway!\r\n @neoguojing Could you show me the result of `tidb-server -V`? @neoguojing We will fix this soon. @neoguojing Please try the latest master.  @snail2swift Thanks for your feedback!\r\nHow many rows are there in t1?\r\nIs there any error when you run `Delete from t1 where date='2017-02-06`?\r\nDDL statement will run in sequence, so the statement may be waiting for the previous statement to finish. @snail2swift \r\nYou can try the branch in the [PR](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/2786) . @snail2swift \r\n1. TiDB use a batch way (1024 rows per batch) to build index for existing. So 160 million rows will take some time.\r\n2. The PR mentioned by zimulala will fix \" Information schema is changed.\" error.\r\n3. In the current implementation of TiDB, we only allow one active DDL worker in a TiDB cluster. May be we will improve this in the future. @snail2swift Please try the latest master or binary.  @xiamw2000 Could you please provide your navicat version and platform? Could you try the latest navicat?  TiDB support chinese comments, but may be it has compatibility problem with navicat.  @ziyouchutuwenwu Thanks for your feedback!\r\n\"USING (constraint_schema, constraint_name)\" is not supported now. We will work on it.  Thank you for your report!\r\nWe will take a look at it.  @snail2swift \r\nWe don't support large transaction.\r\nYou can limit the count in a delete statement or use `truncate table`.  @snail2swift  We don't support load data without `local` field. You can change the statement like this ` load data local infile '/tmp/std_pro_iver_cha_rso_event.txt' into table std_pro_iver_cha_rso_event fields TERMINATED by '|';`. @snail2swift  Could you show me the result of tidb-server -V ? @snail2swift Start some MySQL clients need to add `--local-infile=1` option.  The start MySQL client command like `mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4000`.  @winkmichael Thanks for your feedback!\r\nCould you send me the log of tidb-server? The sets statements missing a `*`, should be `/*!` instead of `/!`.  @winkmichael Could you please provide more information?\r\nDo you try to import a database with name 'mysql'? @winkmichael Could you please show me the error log of tidb-server.  May I get the githash of tikv/tidb/pd? It's re-produced in a local cluster of single pd/tikv/tidb node\r\n10.2.0.233 ~/hhkbp2/table_missing/tidb.log\r\nPTAL Close issue because this problem can't be re-produced.  LGTM LGTM  @hzxjtx Thanks for your feedback. \r\nWe have never tested tpc-h on TiDB. We will check it out.  @vadimtk Thanks for your feedback!\r\nTiDB support serializable isolation level. But its behavior is a little different from MySQL. TiDB does not has global lock when you update rows. We use row-level optimistic lock to resolve write conflict. When two session updating the same row, one of them will success and the other one will meet write conflict and retry the whole transaction automatically.\r\n\r\nIn your case, you can use \"select for ... update\" to prevent write skew. There is one thing you should notice. We also use optimistic lock to detect conflict at the commit stage. Unlike update/delete/insert, SelectForUpdate statement will not be retried automatically. The client will receive an error with message \"can not retry select for update statement\" and it should decide retry the statement or not.\r\n\r\n Hi @vadimtk ,\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the isolation level we are providing should be [Snapshot Isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_isolation), you may also refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/a9cfe1342c88c6f8b1fb4939dea39fd4cba95d1e/TiDB_FAQ.md#does-tidb-have-acid-semantics). In some cases, users can use _SELECT ... FOR UPDATE_ to  explicitly specify the rows that need to be locked to avoid write skew.\r\n\r\nIf we want to support Serializable Isolation, we have to introduce table lock or range lock, which will affect the system's concurrent performance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we might provide configurable different isolation levels, allowing users to balance isolation level and performance according to their own situation. Good idea. Thank you @vadimtk \r\nWould you like to send a PR to return an error?  @wangpeibin713 Thanks for your report! We will fix it.  tpcc1000 test:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2017/02/28 10:01:13 conn.go:333: [error] lastCmd \ufffd\r\nEINGESEESE, runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference, goroutine 7235352

Hi,all, \r\n      This PR is for [issues_2623](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/2623). @disksing @coocood PTAL The rest LGTM. PTAL @hhkbp2  LGTM @hhkbp2 PTAL LGTM @hhkbp2 PTAL  @ThreeBearsDan Thanks for your feedback! We will fix this.  Thanks for reporting! \r\n@siddontang PTAL Hi @rystsov \r\n\r\nSeem that the leader can't be elected for a long time., could you give me all your TiKV logs.   Hi @rystsov \r\n\r\nI have used your case and reproduce the problem. This is caused that your test client connects the TiDB in 10.0.0.7, but this TiDB can't connect to other PDs and TiKVs in 10.0.0.5 and 10.0.0.6. After a long time retry, TiDB will return the test client a timeout error, then the test client will connect another TiDB and works. In my machine, the unavailable time is about 1m30s. \r\n\r\nTiDB is stateless, only PD and TiKV have the leader concept because of Raft. When the partition occurs, the new leader will be elected at about 20s, which is within the expected range. So now we need to let TiDB return error immediately or not retry too many times when we know the TiDB can't provide services. /cc @coocood \r\n  If we don't want the tidb-server run ddl jobs, we can use this parameter `-run-ddl false` to disable it. @GregoryIan @iamxy PTAL  @biolee Please run `make parser` first. It's because $HOME/tidb is not in $GOPATH. When you run 'make parser', the parser would be generated in current directory which in your case is $HOME/tidb, but this directory is not $GOPATH, and go compiler couldn't find this file.  @simingli Thanks for your feedback!\r\nIt seems that tidb-server could not get data from tikv-server. Could you show us your tikv-server's log? @siddontang @BusyJay PTAL @simingli How many tikv-server instance do you deployed? It seems that there is something wrong with the instance on 10.2.1.103. Could your show me the logs of this instance? Hi @simingli \r\n\r\nDoes `2017/02/14 16:13:49.939 server.rs:179: [WARN] remove store connection for store` occur too many times?  @simingli It seems that the tikv on 10.2.1.101 could not contact with the tikv on 10.2.1.102. It may be related with firewall. Could you shutdown your firewall or check the rules?

Old row value is required for translating to MySQL binlog. @GregoryIan @zimulala PTAL LGTM\r\n@zimulala   @catroot \r\nThank you for your report.\r\n\r\nThose two DDL statements can be supported soon.\r\nBut for modifing the length of a varchar column, we can only support increasing the length. @catroot \r\nThank you for your advice.\r\n\r\nI think returning error is the right behavior for the not supported feature.\r\nMySQL also returns an error when there is data longer than the specified length.\r\n\r\nThe error message should be more specific, we will improve that. @catroot \r\nWe hope we can support those DDL operations too, but if the DDL operation requires checking every row in the table, it would be difficult to implement.\r\n\r\nSo my sugguestion is that during development phase, schema changes frequently, you can just use MySQL, when schema is settled down, you can switch to TiDB seamlessly. @catroot \r\n\r\nCurrently, we only support online DDL change, when you add a column or index, the table is not locked, can still be written and read.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is that when we are checking every row in the table, new rows may be inserted, which may exceed the new length.\r\n\r\nWe do have the plan to support it, but not in the next few months, but when more users asking for this feature, we will put it on a higher priority. @catroot \r\nWhen ALTER TABLE returns successfully, users will expect all rows in the table have the limited length, returning a row longer than the limit may result in more serious errors.\r\n\r\nOne way to solve the problem is that we can truncate the column value when reading it.\r\n\r\nBut this can be only applied when strict SQL mode is not set.\r\n\r\nIn strict SQL mode, every row must be less than the new length or the DDL fails. @catroot \r\nAccording to MySQL docuement\r\n```\r\nThis conversion may result in alteration of data. For example, if you shorten a string column, values may be truncated. \r\nTo prevent the operation from succeeding if conversions to the new data type would result in loss of data, enable strict SQL mode before using ALTER TABLE (see Section 6.1.8, \u201cServer SQL Modes\u201d).\r\n```\r\n\r\nStrict SQL mode is used to prevent alteration of data, so checking every row is required. > Those two DDL statements can be supported soon.\r\n\r\nWe support it now, you can try the latest master code. @catroot  @catroot Could you show me the result of `tidb-server -V` ? > Those two DDL statements can be supported soon.\r\n> But for modifying the length of a varchar column, we can only support increasing the length.\r\n\r\nAre sure your case is in line with the second point?\r\n @catroot  Could you show me the statement of `Create table`? @catroot  Please make sure that the process you are using is the latest binary process. \r\nBTW, the `drop default` statement should be \"ALTER TABLE `payment_type` ALTER column `name` DROP DEFAULT;\" Yep, we will support the field of `column` optional soon.\r\nThis statement of `ALTER TABLE payment_type DROP COLUMN name CASCADE` is not supported yet.

Fixed in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/2591  Hi @yuekui2 \r\n\r\nPD will balance data to other TiKV when the data size exceeds a threshold. Assume your TiKV's capacity is 500GB, and the default `min-balance-diff-ratio` is 0.01, so you should insert at lease 5GB data, then PD will begin to move the data to the empty TiKV. \r\n\r\nIf you want to test balance, you can:\r\n\r\n+ Start TiKV with `--capacity` with a little value, like `1GB`. \r\n+ Change `min-balance-diff-ratio` in PD config file to 0.001 or more less and start PD.\r\n+ Use `pd-ctl` to change `min-balance-diff-ratio` dynamically. \r\n We should add the details to FAQ. @shenli @siddontang  Yes, it's because of the data moving.\r\n \r\nThe reason of \"force\" data moving itself is very slow is the limit of PD, which can be configured too. By default it's very slow, because we don't want to make any impact for online transactions.  We will boost the moving and rebalancing speed after RC2. Currently it depends on  https://github.com/pingcap/tikv/pull/1561 \r\n\r\n> More over, let us say capacity is 10G, ratio is 0.1, and 3 tikv instances with data of 4GB each. After adding a new tikv instance, will it evenly re-balance to ~3GB each?\r\n\r\nYes Hi @yuekui2 \r\n\r\nYou can use `store` in `pd-ctl` to see the current TiKV cluster information. It is more clear than checking the db folder directly. \r\n\r\nFor the `min-balance-diff-ratio`, assume we have two TiKV, both capacity is 1TB, one data used size is S1 and the other is S2, if `S1 / 1TB - S2 / 1TB < min-balance-diff-ratio`, PD will consider starting balance, of course, the real balance algorithm is more complex.  The default balance seems slow, and it is strange that why 1 has only 1340 now? @huachaohuang \r\n\r\n@yuekui2  We have been improving the balance, will release a version next week. Because we balance according to storage ratio for now, we should balance the region count.\r\nThe next version will remove some restrictions and configurations, and will be more intuitive. fixed by https://github.com/pingcap/pd/pull/506  Thank you for your report @catroot \r\nLooks like we need to add an empty table_constraints. Is that right? @shenli  @catroot We will add this table into tidb's information_schema. @catroot Thanks! @catroot Please try the latest master or the latest binary.  Sorry, there is no way to do that. Interesting, PD supported a separate etcd cluster in the very earlier versions, it's too complex for users to deploy one more component, so we embedded etcd to PD.  `UnknownSystemVar` contains unused format placeholder for the variable name.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nUnknownSystemVar  = terror.ClassVariable.New(CodeUnknownSystemVar, \"unknown system variable '%s'\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fixes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMySQL [test]> SELECT @@whatever_not_a_variable_in_system;\r\nERROR 1193 (HY000): unknown system variable '%!s(MISSING)'\r\n``` LGTM @andelf please sign the CLA LGTM @andelf Please sign the CLA.  @kaiwu May I have all the argument of your mydumper command? @kaiwu When use myload to load data, please add -q 1 in command line.

Well, your case is pretty seldom, because (select 'x' from dual) will only return 'x'. Most times a `In` subquery should return different records. We can do constant folding for this case, but I think it is very tricky. @kaiwu  Index look up Join is very inefficient for distributed computing. So we always use hash join. If the table in `In` subquery is always small, we can do index look-up join, this is in our roadmap.   @zyguan Good Job! That's just what i meaned. @zyguan Please resolve the conflict.

LGTM\r\nPTAL @coocood  @Tratar Please solve the conflict.  @zyguan According to MySQL [Set](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set.html) doc, each member could be represented by a binary value. We use integer to store set value. For example:\r\nSET('a','b','c','d')\r\nSET Member\tDecimal Value\tBinary Value\r\n'a'\t1\t0001\r\n'b'\t2\t0010\r\n'c'\t4\t0100\r\n'd'\t8\t1000\r\nIf a column has value ('a,d'), we will convert it to 1001, which is 9. So You can convert the first argument to binary and use bit operation to check if it is in the second argument without converting the second argument from number to string and comparing strings. @zyguan There is no cheap way to do this. But binary_value(str) only need to be called once. You do not have to compute it for each row. @zyguan I think it is better to convert the first argument to binary value in the planning stage, not in the executing stage. @zyguan May be you can create a new issue and improve this in another PR.

You can refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/master/TiDB_FAQ.md#why-is-the-ddl-statement-so-slow-when-using-tidb) doc for the reason. If you have only one tidb-server, you could set the --lease to 0. And the speed of DDL statement will be fast. @zxsciro Thanks for your report. This is a bug, and I will fix it. @zxsciro There are two things we should do.\r\n1. Check if the default value is valid before running the job.\r\n2. When meet fatal error, we should cancel the ddl job.\r\n\r\n@zimulala Will fix it. If you are interested in this, you can send us a PR. :) @zxsciro Yes, this is a bug. If it happens, the job will keep trying and affect the execution of other DDL jobs. You need to restart the TiDB to resolve it. \r\nThe right way to handle this is to cancel the DDL job when we meet this error. Do you want to send a PR to us? @zxsciro I'm sorry. It needs to restart TiKV too. Fixing this bug requires some background knowledge. I will fix it. @zxsciro  This bug is fixed. You can try the latest master code. @zxsciro  This bug has two things we should do.\r\n1. Check if the default value is valid before running the job.\r\n2. When meet fatal error, we should cancel the ddl job.\r\n\r\nNow we have only done the second thing. We are doing the first thing.\r\n @zxsciro This bug is fixed now. You can try the latest master code. @zxsciro If you have any problems\uff0cyou can open it again.  @idlesummerbreeze Try this: go test -check.f TestAggregation  @idlesummerbreeze information_schema is a virtual table which exists only in the memory of tidb-server.\r\nFor most of sql statements, we need to refer to schema/table/index/column information when we building query plans. We keep all those info in the memory for performance consideration. So we do not need to store those data as normal tables, we could get what we need from the memory. I am writing a document and it will be release in this week. I will keep you updated.  @silentred I think it is OK to change L22 from '+=' to '='.  @silentred Thanks for your PR!

Thanks very much!  @abdulrahmantkhalifa \r\nThank you for your willing to contribute.\r\nBut I'm sorry, we don't have the plan to support Redis API.\r\nSupporting a new Database API is useful, but it is a long-term commitment, which requires a lot of work on implementation,  documentation, and testing, and most importantly, it makes our existing code much more complicated, increases maintenance cost.\r\n\r\nThe most welcomed contribution is bug-fix, but that requires understanding the project.\r\nWe will be impressed if a contributor can do it without much help.\r\n @abdulrahmantkhalifa \r\nSorry, I misunderstood your issue.\r\n\r\nRedisDB is not an embeded storage engine, I'm not sure if it should be implemented as localstore.  @abdulrahmantkhalifa \r\nFor benchmark tests, you can edit `bench_test.go` to use the new engine, and run \r\n```\r\ngo test -run=none -bench=.\r\n``` \r\non project directory.\r\nBut I guess local store on remote Redis engine will run much slower. @abdulrahmantkhalifa \r\nWhen we run `go test` vendor is not used.\r\nTry this command\r\n```\r\nGOPATH=$(pwd)/_vendor:$GOPATH go test -bench=. -run=none\r\n``` @abdulrahmantkhalifa \r\nGood job to implement the redis store!\r\nI'm sorry we can't accept this feature right now.\r\nThank you for your understanding.  @hyj0 Thanks for your feedback! \r\nThe document you mentioned is out of date. I will send you an updated document for builtin function this week.  @skybook888 Thanks for your feedback! \r\nWe haven't implemented log/log2/log10 in TiDB. Would you please send us a PR to add those functions? TiDB supports those functions now, so I close this issue.\r\nIf you find something wrong with those functions, feel free to reopen this issue.\r\n@skybook888   @idlesummerbreeze Please use `make` to build the project. Do not use `go build`. Should we add it to FAQ or put parser.go in the repo? @shenli  @idlesummerbreeze Do you put tidb dir in GOPATH?\r\nFrom your error log, it seems that there is no parser.go in parser dir. Could you should me the file list in parser package? @idlesummerbreeze Could you show me your GOPATH and the absolute path of your TiDB source code?\r\nPlease make sure that TiDB's source code is in your GOPATH.  @a6802739 Thanks for your PR!\r\nYou can use git squash command or We can squash your commits when merging your PR. @a6802739 You also need to add bin function syntax in parser package. I will send you a document to describe how to do this. @a6802739 \r\nI think we better use standard library to implement this function.\r\n```\r\nfmt.Sprintf(\"%b\", n)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nstrconv.FormatInt(n, 2)\r\n``` @a6802739 \r\nI tried to run `select bin(-1)` on MySQL, the result is `1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111`\r\n\r\nI seem like a negative integer will be converted to unsigned interger first.\r\n\r\nSo the stdlib function we should use is `strconv.FormatUint`. @a6802739 \r\n```\r\nx := int64(-1)\r\nfmt.Printf(\"%b\", uint64(x))\r\n``` @a6802739  \r\nYou can search keyword `builtin` in PR list, find a PR that adds a new builtin function, see what is needed to add a new function. @a6802739 \r\nPlease make sure test is passed before push a commit.

It is already fixed. @hyj0 We will fix it now. @hyj0 It will be fixed in this PR: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/2181 @hyj0 Please try the latest master code. @hyj0 It is related to the field type. We return the result of schema() in string but set a wrong field type.   In this [PR](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/2181), we set it to the right type. @hyj0 If everything is OK, I will close the issue.  Handle #1936.\r\nThis is for compatibility with previous version. So it is the first step, the second is remove the assignment to the job's arguments. PTAL @GregoryIan @coocood @tiancaiamao @shenli  LGTM @GregoryIan PTAL  Looks like benchyou is a good tool for benching. See: https://github.com/XeLabs/benchyou @ch-lgs You can use sysbench to bench TiDB.  Test circle ci. LGTM  @ch-lgs Compare with proxy, TiDB has horizontal scalability, online schema changes, consistent distributed transactions. @ch-lgs I think TiDB has the following advantages against MySQL cluster: \r\n\r\n-  You can deploy TiDB cluster across data centers. We use raft to replicate data between replica. In this scenario, even the whole data center is down, your data is also safe and your service is still on.\r\n\r\n- TiDB could handle complex query better. Our optimizer is suitable for distributed computing.\r\n\r\n- Adding or removing node into/from TiDB cluster is very easy.\r\n\r\n- TiDB supports real distributed transaction. \r\n\r\n- TiDB is easy to deploy and maintain.  @ch-lgs We are going to release RC1 in the next week. GA will be released early in the next year (may be around Chinese New Year).  @nnordrum Thanks for your suggestion.\r\nI am agree with you and view is on our plan. But it will not be included in the GA version, because of time.  Thank you for your valuable advice. @sjmudd \r\nI added a todo label to this issue. \r\nWe are adding more and more documents, they are coming soon \ud83d\ude04 \r\nWe will let you know of any further related documents. @sjmudd I guess you need this doc: https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/master/op-guide/docker-deployment.md#multi-nodes-deployment Thanks for your report @sjmudd \r\n\r\nThe multiple docker deployment document is here https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/master/op-guide/docker-deployment.md, seem that we should let user find cluster deployment with binary and docker more easily in the quick start. /cc @shenli \r\n\r\nAdding/Removing PD/TiKV/TiDB node is easy, see https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/master/op-guide/binary-deployment.md#addremove-node-dynamically, but now the guide has not been completed, we will improve it and add examples later.  Cool @AkihiroSuda \r\n\r\nI think we can try it in CI and test first. @iamxy   Hi @will835559313 , thanks for your report. \r\n\r\nI see that you deploy whole TiDB components in one machine, but it seems that your machine has a high load and the TiDB cluster can't supply normal service.\r\n\r\nThe standalone deployment is only for user first try, you can do some simple operations, but if you want to do more test and benchmark, I suggest deploying TiDB cluster in multi machines :-) \r\n\r\n Hi @will835559313 \r\n\r\nSeem that you run PD + TiKV in one VM too, the load is still high. \r\nThe warning message `get timestamp too slow` is not serious, just shows that your TiDB getting TSO from PD slow (maybe network slow, or machine load high, etc..), but the cluster can still work well, you can even ignore this waring if possible. \r\n\r\nWhat I care more is `InfomationSchema is out of date`, this error is much serious, which means your TiKV is very busy and can't work. Do you meet this error again? \r\n\r\nBtw, we prefer using more powerful machines to test the cluster, see https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/master/op-guide/recommendation.md. \r\n\r\n @zimulala Please check the git version of the binary we published and verify whether it use a version with bug ? It's not friendly to user but not a bug. And It's more correct. Now this be resolved after #2094 #2110 @tiancaiamao   Add sequence in binlog.TableMutation to preserve the original mutation order. @iamxy @GregoryIan PTAL LGTM  @overvenus  Thanks for your report. @ivancxj \r\nPTAL @overvenus  @huachaohuang PTAL There are some error log in pd's log.

It will be fixed soon.\n @gqf2008 We fixed this bug. Please try the latest master.\n hi, @gqf2008 \r\nThe error log `ERROR : Information schema is out of date` says TiDB can't load the schema within a lease. To solve this, you can try to add a command line argument `-lease 10s` when TiDB start.\r\n\r\nBy the way, this seems to be a resource consuming test, I run it under my laptop and it eat up the whole memory. So, you'd better use TiKV, deploy them separately to get the best performance. TiDB is stateless, if CPU is its bottleneck, we can deploy multiple TiDB instance in the real use cases.\r\n\r\nAs for this case, high CPU occupation of TiDB just make the test slower, but the test should not fail. You can try to increase lease value first. The default lease of TiDB is 1s, which is not suit for serious use case.  @leaxoy Thanks for your suggestion. \nWe do not have plan to publish to homebrew. We encourage users deploy TiDB cluster on Linux. \nIf you are interested in this, could you help us to do this?\n  @keithyau We do not support str_to_date now.  Please refer to the [doc](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn/blob/master/op-guide/mysql-compatibility.md#\u5185\u5efa\u51fd\u6570). We will implement it soon.\n  @keithyau It depends on the schema and your hardware.\nWe do not recommend use mysqldump  to import large data. Compared with MySQL, TiDB has higher latency. So use single thread to import data will be slow. \nTiDB could reach higher throughput that MySQL. We usually use mydumper/myloader to migrate data from MySQL to TiDB.

I will update those tests. Hope it could be done in this week.\n Hi @tboerger, you can still use TiDB as an embed database. TiDB acts as MySQL server by listening on unix socket or network socket. To making things simple and clean, users should use any of MySQL drivers.\n Yes. @Unknwon  @mjmfighter  We do not intend to be an embedded database. So there is no solution.  @flike \n'parser.go' is generated by 'make parser' command.\nWe recently updated our parser generator to `github.com/pingcap/goyacc`.\nHave you tried run 'make' command again? It will regenerate the parser.\n   Sometimes we want to debug internal data structures,. we need a simple way to get internal information.\n We have inspectkv tools. @zimulala \n Yep\uff0cbut we only have some simple functions like `show DDL info` now. It's better to list the specific requirements, so that we can gradually realize it in the inspectkv tools. \n We don't use debugger at all, it's hard to debug a distributed system with a debugger. Log and distributed tracing tools are very helpful. You can try the IDE for golang from jetbrain. It could analyze interface and its implementations in realtime.

It works. But we do not satisfied with the speed. \nWe are improving the performance of TiDB.  You can try the latest master. If you meet any problem, please raise an issue or send us a PR.\n\nBTW: We encourage describing issue in English.\n @geekard I change the title to English. Hope you don't mind. :)\nPlease let us know if you meet any problem.\n If you use TiKV as storage engine, I recommend you deploy TiDB/TiKV on machines with SSD disk. \n May I have your Zabbix version? @geekard \n Thanks for your report. We will fix it later.\n @geekard Sorry for the late reply. It is a bug in our parser. We miss \"grant all privileges\" syntax. It is fixed in this PR: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/1417\n\nBTW:  You should add quote mark for username and host. For example:\ngrant all privileges on zabbix.\\* to 'zabbix'@'localhost' identified by 'password';\n @geekard There is a few query with subquery and join which may run slow in TiDB.  We are working on impoving them. \nIf there is any performance improvement. I will let you know.\nMay I have your zabbix verson? I will test it on my machine.\n @geekard Thanks!\n @geekard  We add a new sql optimizer in TiDB. The performance benefits a lot from it. \nThe new optimizer is not finished yet, so it is not the default sql optimizer. You can enable it by passing an argument to tidb-server.\n\"docker run --name tidb-server -d -p 4000:4000 pingcap/tidb:latest   --newplan=1\"\nOn my machine, displaying 'Status of zabbix' costs less than one second. Please try the latest master.\n @geekard Thanks for your trying.\nTiDB does not support partition/view/procedures. \nFor a distributed database, we do not need explicit partition.\nImplement view and procedures will bring some problems. So We are not sure whether we will support them.\n\nCould you show me TiDB's error log for the following problem?\n\n> % mysqlimport --local --fields-terminated-by=, --fields-enclosed-by=\"'\" --fields-escaped-by=/ -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4000 -u root zabbix_server valuemaps.txt\n> mysqlimport: Error: 1105 line 1 column 36 near \";\"\n @geekard Thanks!\n\nI will fix the following bug.\n\n> [warning] compiling /!40101 set @@character_set_database=binary */;, error: line 1 column 36 near \";\"\n\nAfter reading [MySQL's document about partition](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-overview.html) I have an idea. Maybe we could ignore the PARTITION keyword, it will do no harm.\nTiDB will automatically partition data into many slices. I will have a try.\n Hi @geekard:\n We just supported the \"Load data\" command in the master branch.\n  @lordk911 In one word, TiDB is an OLTP database and hawq/gpdb is OLAP database. \nTo handle large dataset, TiDB supports mpp. But we will focus on OLTP now and only support simple OLAP function.\n\nPS: We encourage describing issue in English. So people from all the world could read your issue.  \n  @huangpeilong Thanks for your report!\nTiDB is a pure go project. You can use any method which is work for go to debug it.\nFor example [GDB](https://golang.org/doc/gdb).\n I'm not familiar with liteIDE, but [Delve](https://github.com/derekparker/delve) should work.\nMaybe you can try it on command line:\n\n```\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb\nln -s _vendor/vendor vendor\ndlv test .\nb tidb_test.go:168\nr\nc\n```\n We are developing TiDB on linux or mac. And we haven't test it on windows. It may works on windows, but i am not sure. And you are welcome to make TiDB work on windows. \n You can build the tidb-server first by \"make server\". It will create a binary file tidb-server in the directory tidb-server. Then you can debug it. @huangpeilong \n We use vendor to solve golang's dependency. When running \"make server\", it will add soft link for vendor directory. Seems it does not work on Windows. See: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/Makefile#L138 \n\nWe suggest running TiDB on Linux/Mac and do not guarantee all the things work on Windows.\nCould you send us a PR to fix it?\n PR is short for Pull Request. @huangpeilong \nIt means sending us a patch for a feature or bug.\n @huangpeilong We updated pingcap/pd repo, but did not update pingcap/tidb repo. It seems that your tidb-server is built with pd in GOPTAH, not in vendor directory. Please try this solution:\nRollback pingcap/pd in your GOPATH to commit version 3fe05c948c17bdd18fc2cc7acf62e699f20b0583 \n\nI will update tidb's vendor and fix this problem soon.\n  Since we've already launched the beta, there must be some guys who want to have a try, if we provide a binary distro and some handy scripts, that would be easier for others to use.\n - [x]  Linux / OS X binary package, tar.gz\n- [ ]  Debian package .deb, support apt-get\n- [ ]  CentOS / Fedora package, .rpm\n- [ ]  Docker image\n Should also consider rpm package for Centos and Fedora.\n @overvenus Great to hear that!

In most common scenario, TiDB will be deployed together with [TiKV](https://github.com/pingcap/tikv) and [PD](https://github.com/pingcap/pd). So I think it is not enough to just package TiDB. We use docker to make deploy easier.\nI am not familiar with software packaging. Will it be a good solution for this scenario?\n > Will TiKV and PB be part of tidb main binary ? if it is not part of same binary that is ok too.\n\nTiDB is a SQL engine with pluggable storage engine. It can work with local storage engine (such as goleveldb) or distributed storage engine (such as [TiKV](https://github.com/pingcap/tikv), Hbase). TiKV is a distributed KV engine written in rust. It is the best choice for TiDB. We will use TiKV as storage engine for TiDB in production environment. TiDB and TiKV will be deployed as separated process, not in the same binary. [PD](https://github.com/pingcap/tikv) acts as the administration node for TiKV. We also have a admin tool to config and deploy TiDB/TiKV/PD.\n\nSo our Ti storage solution contains three components. I think docker is a better solution. Especially TiKV depends on [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb) which depends on gcc/clang with C++11 support, gflags, snappy and so on. Docker will make the deployment easier.\n @tjyang \nThank you for your advice.\nSupporting multiple OS is good, but it requires more development and testing resource.\nCurrently, we only support Linux, and Docker is the recommended way to deploy our system.\nWe will consider native packaging solution when we need to support multiple OS.\n  pass mysqltest and remove visitor design pattern\n  @elffikk Thanks for your report!\nMay I have your mysqldump version? And your dumped file.\nIt seems that the log is not only part of the panic output log. Can you show me more?\n  @tjyang Thanks for your feedback!\nVitess is a MySQL sharding solution. It runs as a MySQL proxy. So you need to put MySQL server behind vitess. It does not support distributed transactions.\nTiDB is a brand new distributed database which support mysql protocol and syntax. It is a MySQL drop-in replacement. You can enjoy horizontal scalability without losing distributed transactions.\n @tjyang OK! Thanks for your report.

One session will get id range 1~1000, the other session will get id range 1001~2000. So for the second session, it will use ids from 1001.\nIn brief, TiDB guarantee allocate increment ids but not continuous increment ids.\nSo I guess you insert each row with a unique session?\n May I see your schema and SQL statement?\n For each table we have a unique auto_id counter. Its type is int64. So I guess it is OK.\nOr we can shrink the batch size. \n Unfortunately it is a private attribute :( https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/meta/autoid/autoid.go#L29\n  @coocood @zimulala PTAL\n I think you should do TypeInfer for each function.\n @zxylvlp +1\n@zyguan Please refer: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/optimizer/typeinferer.go#L253\n Well done!\nLGTM\n LGTM\n PTAL\n  In case when executed statements exceeds max int32, the cursor becomes a negative value.\n @nieyy @shenli PTAL\n LGTM\n  In bootstrap stage, ps may be not well initialized.

Please add an unit test.\n @losas There is a test case in session_test.go. https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/session_test.go#L746\n\n Your can compose a similar test case. You need to do something to make getPassword() throw error. I take a look at the code and find that if you set a value to session(or ctx), ExecRestrictedSQL() will return error. getPassword() will call ExecRestrictedSQL. So I think it is what we need.\nhttps://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/session.go#L266\n\nHope this helps.

And some of the features are already supported by TiDB such as ACID transaction, Query data from the past. \nBut currently we will focus on OLTP. Automatic Indexing and Schemaless are not on our roadmap.\n TiDB support online schema change. DBAs can modify schema and index without downtime. I think DBA managed schema (including index) is more suitable for enterprise usage. \nSelf-tuning is an attractive feature, but it may bring more uncertainty. For example automatic indexing may cause more space usage and slow down insert/update/delete operations. And schemaless is convenient sometimes but it may also cause error-prone codes.\n\nSo it is not on our plan now. But TiDB is involving rapidly. We will keep eyes on Concourse and learn from it. Maybe we will provide similar feature in the future. Thanks!\n  Thanks for your feedback! @AkihiroSuda \nIn TiDB's design, we  have a load balancer between client and tidb node. https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/docs/architecture.png\n\nYou can use a load balancer such as LVS or HAProxy to connect to TiDB cluster.\n  @nieyy Good idea. \nYes, we have plan to do that. But we haven't started yet.\nAnd we are happy to  discuss the design :)\n @nieyy Glad to hear that. Currently we are working on optimizing query plan (condition push down, parallel executing and even more). Obviously we need more and more help to make TiDB better. And welcome to join the technical party.\n  @teodor-pripoae Thanks for your report. We will work on this.\n Great!\nI go through TiDB source code and make sure that we return the same error code as MySQL for duplicate entry error (1062). So I suspect that gorm judge error no only by error code.\n @teodor-pripoae We find there is a bug in gorm. It ignores error of db.Commit(). See https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm/blob/master/scope.go#L383\nIn TiDB duplicate entry is checked at commit stage, so the error is logged at TiDB log but ignored by gorm.\nWe are going to send a PR to gorm.\n\nThanks!\n @teodor-pripoae It should be fixed. Please update your gorm and check again. Thanks.\n @teodor-pripoae That pr will not work.\nTiDB use lazy check for unique index. https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/kv/kv.go#L21\nThe job is finished at commit stage by the storage layer for performance consideration(We want to check duplication in a batch way). \nThe interface between sql layer and storage layer is not rich enough to pass information such as index name and original key data (we only got encoded key at storage layer). So we do not get enough information about which key is duplicate at the place where the error rise.\n\nWe will figure out how to show rich information in the error message recently. Thanks!\n @teodor-pripoae We find a way to solve this. See the PR above please.\n  Thanks for your report. @hhkbp2 \nIt's a dependency issue. You may run \"make update\" to fix it. We will remove HBase dependency or using godeps to manage dependency later.\n  LGTM\n LGTM and thanks for your contribution @c-wind !\n LGTM\n@c-wind  Thanks very much!\n  I think it's easier to understand it by a simple example.\nTake a look at\nhttps://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/executor/prepared.go#L50\n\nThe `paramMarkerExtractor` visitor extracts parameter markers ('?') in a query statement.\nWhen a node call its `Accept` method, every element will be `Enter` and `Leave` once, so the visitor can do something about it. For this example, it collect parameter marker.\n  @nieyy Thanks for your report.\nWe are writing documents for Tidb. KV encoding/decoding is on the schedule. I think it won't be long.\n Hi @nieyy ,\nYou are right about the 3 CFs. They are indeed created and used by Themis. Please refer https://github.com/XiaoMi/themis and https://github.com/pingcap/go-themis for more details.\n Hi @nieyy ,\nIn brief, `util/codec` provides a series of functions that can encode values into mem-comparable `[]byte`. How structured data in RMDBS are transformed to key-value pairs are mainly in package `table/tables` and `kv`. You may trace function calls to `codec` functions to get the clue. : )\n  Currently, interfaces in kv and store package are too complicated and disordered. It is very hard to implement a new storage engine for TiDB.\n\nI plan to make it easier with following steps:\n1. Simplify local store and hbase store. Storages should implement as less interfaces as possible.\n2. Refine interfaces. Distinguish interfaces that should be completed by storages from those are already complete in kv.\n3. Write a guide document.\n  Please do \"make update\" to update your dependency. Then make again.\n please `rm -rf  /tmp/tidb` then run again. \n I think this panic is probably due to the `\"listen tcp :4001: bind: address already in use\"`. In that case, server creation will fail. You need to make sure no other thread is using port `4001` because the test suite will take up this port.\n  @orangeyts TiDB depends on golang. So I think TiDB can run if you setup your golang environment properly on Windows. \n OK! @orangeyts \nPlease feel free to raise an issue if you encounter any problem.\n @orangeyts `GOPATH` is your workspace path. It should be set uniformly across all go projects in your machine. Please reference [this](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) doc for more details. Once you have setup your `GOPATH`, you can put `tidb` in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/pingcap/`.\n  @sllt Thanks very much.\nLGTM\n LGTM\nThanks! @sllt \n  @hhkbp2  Thanks very much.\n@coocood  @zimulala  PTAL\n @hhkbp2 Thank you very much, please format the file you modified with 'go fmt`, otherwise, the Travis CI build would fail.\n @hhkbp2 The existing test cases are copied from `expression/date_arith_test.go` and the function is implemented in `expression/data_arith.go`. The reason why this is not working right now is that `evaluater.go` didn't migrate the old code. \n\nYou can reference the old implement to make test cases pass with out changing it.\n\nIn TiDB, we enforce strict mode, so when data is truncated, it returns error instead of warning.\n @hhkbp2 The old `expression`, `plan/plans`, 'stmt/stmts' package has limited capability for optimization, and it can not be improved due to the design problem, but it supports all types of statements.\nThe new `optimizer/plan`, `executor` package has better support for optimization, but supports limited type of statements, we are supporting more statement on new plan, but for the statements we han't supported in new plan, we need to run it in the old way.\nSo there are a lot of duplicate code right now.\nWhen new plan supports all the statements, old 'expression`,`plan/plans`,`stmt/stmts` package can be abandoned.\n @hhkbp2 Any updates?\n PTAL @coocood @siddontang \n LGTM\n LGTM\nWell done!\n LGTM\n  @keithyau \nThere are a few docs in tidb/docs.\nhttps://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/docs/QUICKSTART.md\nhttps://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/docs/HBASE_QUICKSTART.md\nhttps://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md\n @keithyau May I have your golang version?

Would you please checkout this branch and check if it is ok?\nThanks!\n  LGTM\n LGTM\n Thanks @roger-lijian \n  2015/12/14 22:04:49 session.go:395: [error] Syntax error: SELECT name, type FROM mysql.proc WHERE Db='test'\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 session.go:396: [error] Error occurs at [schema:2]table mysql.proc does not exist.\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 conn.go:240: [error] dispatch error /Users/shenli/workspace/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/infoschema/infoschema.go:109: [schema:2]table mysql.proc does not exist\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 conn.go:241: [error] cmd: SELECT name, type FROM mysql.proc WHERE Db='test'\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 tidb.go:136: [warning] compiling SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db='test', error: line 1 column 6 near \"PROCEDURE\"\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 session.go:395: [error] Syntax error: SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db='test'\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 session.go:396: [error] Error occurs at line 1 column 6 near \"PROCEDURE\".\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 conn.go:240: [error] dispatch error line 1 column 6 near \"PROCEDURE\"\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 conn.go:241: [error] cmd: SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db='test'\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 tidb.go:136: [warning] compiling SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db='test', error: line 1 column 6 near \"PROCEDURE\"\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 session.go:395: [error] Syntax error: SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db='test'\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 session.go:396: [error] Error occurs at line 1 column 6 near \"PROCEDURE\".\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 conn.go:240: [error] dispatch error line 1 column 6 near \"PROCEDURE\"\n2015/12/14 22:04:49 conn.go:241: [error] cmd: SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db='test'\n2015/12/14 22:05:22 tidb.go:136: [warning] compiling SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db='test1', error: line 1 column 6 near \"PROCEDURE\"\n2015/12/14 22:05:22 session.go:395: [error] Syntax error: SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db='test1'\n2015/12/14 22:05:22 session.go:396: [error] Error occurs at line 1 column 6 near \"PROCEDURE\".\n2015/12/14 22:05:22 conn.go:240: [error] dispatch error line 1 column 6 near \"PROCEDURE\"\n2015/12/14 22:05:22 conn.go:241: [error] cmd: SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db='test1'\n 2015/12/14 22:12:36 conn.go:240: [error] dispatch error /Users/shenli/workspace/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/expression/binop.go:124: eval Tables_in_test = \"t1\" && Table_type != \"VIEW\" err: eval Tables_in_test = \"t1\" err: unknown field tables_in_test\n2015/12/14 22:12:36 conn.go:241: [error] cmd: SHOW FULL TABLES FROM `test` WHERE `Tables_in_test` = 't1' AND Table_type != 'VIEW'\n Can we close this issue?\n Reopen the issue, Thanks @AkihiroSuda \n @AkihiroSuda Are you working on this issue ?\n @AkihiroSuda I am agree with you.

Actually snapshot use the Iterator interface, not memdb.\n @xwb1989 If you need any help, Please let me know. Thanks for contributing.\nLooking forward your PR.\n @xwb1989 You are right.

CI failed\n @c4pt0r \nPlease take a look.\n @insionng Thanks for your PR.\n\nThere are some additional things need to do:\n1 For making tidb, u need do things as follows:\n1.1 godep\n`godep` is to get godep tool(`https://github.com/tools/godep`) which is used for easy building without getting dependency packages.\n\n1.2 parser\n`parser` is to get goyacc and golex package, generate `parser/parser.go` and `parser/scanner.go` which are needed by tidb building.\nIn your make.cmd, u have done this, but also need some work like in `tidb/Makefile` to generate `parser/scanner.go`\uff1a\n`golex -o parser/scanner.go parser/scanner.l`\n\n1.3 build\nGodep go build\n\n1.4 test\nGodep go test ./...\n\n2 For making interpreter, u need do things as follows:\n2.1 add `ldflags` go build option[nice to haves]\nLDFLAGS += -X \"github.com/pingcap/tidb/util/printer.TiDBBuildTS=$(shell date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %I:%M:%S')\"\nLDFLAGS += -X \"github.com/pingcap/tidb/util/printer.TiDBGitHash=$(shell git rev-parse HEAD)\"\nThe ldflags is very useful for us to check and fix bugs.\nThe correct interpreter output looks like as follows:\n\n```\nWelcome to the TiDB.\nVersion:\nGit Commit Hash: bf97f61c450912a5c1f4cfba44bb11297fa7876f\nUTC Build Time:  20150913214037\n\ntidb>\n```\n\n2.2 build\nGodep go build -ldflags \"-X github.com/pingcap/tidb/util/printer.TiDBBuildTS=%TiDBBuildTS% -X github.com/pingcap/tidb/util/printer.TiDBGitHash=%TiDBGitHash%\"\nTiDBBuildTS and TiDBGitHash variables are set in above 2.1\n\nSo u can see above, maybe some more work need to do in make.cmd.\nAnd also, for unix/mac users, i think it is better to install make tool.\nThanks again, looking forward to your update :)\n Well done. Looks like we don't need make.sh.\nJust keep make.cmd is fine. We could still use make instead of make.sh.\nCould you please remove make.sh. Then we will merge this PR.\nThanks. @insionng \n LGTM\n LGTM. Thank you @insionng \n  Thanks @cznic \n\nWe can execute `create table if not exists t (c1 int);` in MySQL command shell, so we support CommaOpt here. \n\nMaybe we can remove the `;` at first before parsing? @shenli  \n Sorry for my fault. @cznic ,  I am wrong.\n Comma is not allowed, I think too. \n LGTM  \n@siddontang I think the CommaOpt should not be here. The parser parse text into statement list, and ';' will be treated as separator between statements. So it is not necessary to add ';' at the end of create statement rule.\nThanks a lot! @cznic \n LGTM\n\nWow!

Thanks!\n Hi @lunny \n\nWe create a branch to fix the panic, could you help us to check with it? \n\nThe branch is https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/tree/siddontang/fix-driver-panic\n @shenli is fixing it. \nBtw, there seems no panic? \n TiDB support \"select for  update\". But there are tiny difference between TiDB and MySQL.\nBecause TiDB use Optimistic concurrency control.\n\nThere are some details in Wikipedia:\nOptimistic concurrency control (OCC) is a concurrency control method applied to transactional systems such as relational database management systems and software transactional memory. OCC assumes that multiple transactions can frequently complete without interfering with each other. While running, transactions use data resources without acquiring locks on those resources. Before committing, each transaction verifies that no other transaction has modified the data it has read. If the check reveals conflicting modifications, the committing transaction rolls back and can be restarted.[1] Optimistic concurrency control was first proposed by H.T. Kung.[2]\n\nOCC is generally used in environments with low data contention. When conflicts are rare, transactions can complete without the expense of managing locks and without having transactions wait for other transactions' locks to clear, leading to higher throughput than other concurrency control methods. However, if contention for data resources is frequent, the cost of repeatedly restarting transactions hurts performance significantly; it is commonly thought that other concurrency control methods have better performance under these conditions. However, locking-based (\"pessimistic\") methods also can deliver poor performance because locking can drastically limit effective concurrency even when deadlocks are avoided.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 OCC phases\n2 Web usage\n2.1 Examples\n3 See also\n4 References\n5 External links\nOCC phases[edit]\n\nThis section does not cite any references or sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2010)\nMore specifically, OCC transactions involve these phases:\n\nBegin: Record a timestamp marking the transaction's beginning.\nModify: Read database values, and tentatively write changes.\nValidate: Check whether other transactions have modified data that this transaction has used (read or written). This includes transactions that completed after this transaction's start time, and optionally, transactions that are still active at validation time.\nCommit/Rollback: If there is no conflict, make all changes take effect. If there is a conflict, resolve it, typically by aborting the transaction, although other resolution schemes are possible. Care must be taken to avoid a TOCTTOU bug, particularly if this phase and the previous one are not performed as a single atomic operation.\n @lunny User may retry transaction when commit \"select for update\" failed.\n  Thanks for your attention.

We'll try to reproduce and fix it.\n Thanks for your report @lunny @Unknwon\nI checked TiDB code and fixed a few bugs today, but still can not pass go-xorm test. \nThere are two things I want to discuss with you.\n\nThe first one is a potential bug in https://github.com/go-xorm/tidb/blob/master/tidb_driver.go#L42.\ntidb_driver use params[1] as DbName, but it maybe \"./tidb\". I see some sql statement in the log that select column name in some table where the dbname=\"./tidb\". For example:\n\"[xorm] [debug] 2015/09/07 21:23:48.572562 [time] SELECT `TABLE_NAME` from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.`TABLES` WHERE `TABLE_SCHEMA`=? and `TABLE_NAME`=? - args [./tidb userinfo] - query took: 367238ns\".\nI modified a few code and fixed the \"Duplicate column name\" error.\n  40         fs := strings.Split(params[1], \"/\")\n  41         dbName := fs[len(fs)-1]\n  42         uri := &core.Uri{\n  43                 DbType: DBType,\n  44                 DbName: dbName,\n  45         }\n  46 \nI try to push my code to a new branch in go-xorm but get permission denied error.\n\nThe second one is about auto_increment column.\nIn TiDB we only guarantee that auto_increment column value is increasing. But I find a test case in https://github.com/go-xorm/tests/blob/master/base.go#L94 which assume the value of auto_increment id.\nI checked the insert statements. Those statements do not set id column explicitly. I also checked table content in TiDB, the ids are auto increment but no one in [7, 8, 9]. So the case failed.\ntidb> select \\* from userinfo;\n+------+-------------+------------+---------------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+\n| id   | username    | departname | created             | detail_id | height | avatar | is_man |\n+------+-------------+------------+---------------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+\n| 1001 | xiaolunwen2 | dev        | 2015-09-07 20:51:33 | 1         | 1.78   |     | 1      |\n| 1002 | xlw         | dev        | 2015-09-07 20:51:33 | 0         | 0      |        | 0      |\n| 1003 | xlw2        | dev        | 2015-09-07 20:51:33 | 0         | 0      |        | 0      |\n| 1004 | xlw11       | dev        | 2015-09-07 20:51:33 | 0         | 0      |        | 0      |\n| 1005 | xlw22       | dev        | 2015-09-07 20:51:33 | 0         | 0      |        | 0      |\n| 1006 | 1xlw        | dev        | 2015-09-07 20:51:33 | 0         | 0      |        | 0      |\n| 1007 | 1xlw2       | dev        | 2015-09-07 20:51:33 | 0         | 0      |        | 0      |\n| 1008 | 1xlw11      | dev        | 2015-09-07 20:51:33 | 0         | 0      |        | 0      |\n| 1009 | 1xlw22      | dev        | 2015-09-07 20:51:33 | 0         | 0      |        | 0      |\n| 1010 | xlw3        | dev        | 2015-09-07 20:51:33 | 0         | 0      |        | 0      |\n+------+-------------+------------+---------------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+\n For performance consideration, we choose an auto increment id assigning algorithm as this:\nGet the start_number from global storage. And update global stored start number to a new number which is start_number + 1000.  So we get a batch of auto ids and do not need to access global storage before run out of these ids. Then we can assign and increase global-uniq id for auto_increment column.\n\nAll the auto increment id related codes for a table share the same start_number. In this case, I think 1~1000 is assigned before inserting column \"id\".  So column \"id\" inserting gets the start_number 1001.\nI will check logs and provide more information.\n @Unknwon  May I see your code? \nI find lunny update tidb_driver.go to solve adding an existing column problem. https://github.com/go-xorm/tidb/blob/master/tidb_driver.go\n  Make syntax log easy to read.\n\nhttps://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/25\n LGTM\n PTAL @qiuyesuifeng \n LGTM\n  pass gofmt\n yep.\n It's my next pr.\n LGTM\n @xiang90 ^_^\n LGTM\n  Thanks @Unknwon \n\nAnd @xiang90 is right, keep them into separate commits:\n1. change\n2. godep\n\nThe correct step is:\ncd tidb\ngodep restore\ngodep save ./...\n\nCould you fix it ? @Unknwon Thanks.\n @Unknwon this PR introduced too much dependencies, can you remove the depedency of \"golang.org/x/net/html/charset\", all we need is a map from charset name to encoding. \nHow about copy the code in https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/html/charset/table.go\n  Hello Unknwon,\n    \"1:9\" means there is an error near line 1 and column 9. \n     For your error log, there is a compile error in \"use gogs.tidb\" near the dot (the 9th character).

\"github.com/pingcap/tidb/util/printer.TiDBGitHash=$(shell git rev-parse HEAD)\"\n\nDoes that sound ok?   @fuxiaohei \n  Thank you for your contribution.\n\nBeing able to change the address and having the option to turn it off is great,  but since TiDB is under heavy development, having Debug set to true by default would be more convenient.\n\nI also noticed that the PR is sent from your master branch, we recommand that when opening a PR, create a topic branch and make changes on that branch, it's easier for your forked repo to keep in sync with upstream.\n LGTM\n LGTM\n  @l2x Please sign the CLA.\n  LGTM\n LGTM\n  Could you fix this issue ?\nCurrently we are using Linux and Mac OS X.\n Does TiDB works on windows now?  @fuxiaohei \n  Good job!\nLGTM\n LGTM\n LGTM\n  parser.go and scanner.go are generated code.\n @xiang90 I agree.\n LGTM\n LGTM\n", "text_all_count": 28878, "text_word_token": ["disksing", "PTAL", "coocood", "PTAL", "LGTM", "LGTM", "yuanwhy", "Thanks", "for",

Thanks for the review.

Maybe you should add go 1.5 ~ 1.8 in [CI](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/.travis.yml) to avoid such issue also.  ```go\r\n// See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-functions.html#function_make-set\r\nfunc (b *builtinMakeSetSig) eval(row []types.Datum) (d string, err error) {\r\n\tvar bitMask int\r\n\tvar s []string\r\n\r\n\tswitch maskValue := row[0].(type) {\r\n\tcase int:\r\n\t\tbitMask = maskValue\r\n\tdefault:\r\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"row[0] must be a 'int'\")\r\n\t\treturn \"\", errors.New(\"row[0] must be a 'int'\")\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tfor index, value := range row[1:] {\r\n\t\tswitch valueValue := value.(type) {\r\n\t\tcase string:\r\n\t\t\tif (value != \"\") && (index&bitMask != 0) {\r\n\t\t\t\ts = append(s, valueValue)\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\td = strings.Join(s, \",\")\r\n\treturn\r\n}\r\n``` [![CLA assistant check](https://cla-assistant.io/pull/badge/signed)](https://cla-assistant.io/pingcap/tidb?pullRequest=2825) <br/>All committers have signed the CLA.  fix a typo from 'convertion' to 'conversion' in line 24 [![CLA assistant check](https://cla-assistant.io/pull/badge/signed)](https://cla-assistant.io/pingcap/tidb?pullRequest=2814) <br/>All committers have signed the CLA.

What did you do?\r\nI wanna get the information of foreign key by `information_schema`'s table which store the information of FK. But the table about FK in `information_schema` is empty. Then other way to get FK information is by command of `show create table`. U know this is very hard to parse in this way. There is no comma between two FK when using command `show create table`. A bug?\r\n\r\n2. What did you expect to see?\r\nSo I hope that Tidb can support that store the FK information in `information_schema`. Thx very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. What did you see instead?\r\nThe table about FK in  `information_schema` is empty.  Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI was testing a 3-nodes deployment of a TiDB cluster with default settings and observed a situation when TiDB stoped serving requests for 2 minutes 40 seconds. It happened when a leader got separated from the peers. The unavailable window is too wide so I believe that it a bug rather than an expected behavior.\r\n\r\nThe version of the TiDB is\r\n\r\n    rystsov@acceptor1:/mnt/perseus/tikv$ ./tidb-latest-linux-amd64/bin/pd-server --version\r\n    Git Commit Hash: f5744d7b52aa4793b84cfdcd4efae1fc9a9bac6b\r\n    UTC Build Time:  2017-02-17 09:18:31\r\n    \r\n    rystsov@acceptor1:/mnt/perseus/tikv$ ./tidb-latest-linux-amd64/bin/tikv-server --version\r\n    Git Commit Hash: eb185b3babc476080306fef7c05b7673c1342455\r\n    UTC Build Time:  2017-02-17 08:12:57\r\n    Rustc Version:   1.17.0-nightly (ba7cf7cc5 2017-02-11)\r\n    \r\n    rystsov@acceptor1:/mnt/perseus/tikv$ ./tidb-latest-linux-amd64/bin/tidb-server -V\r\n    Git Commit Hash: a8d185d8cb8485e1a124919d0df8b10a16bc6e40\r\n    UTC Build Time:  2017-02-17 08:50:53\r\n\r\nThe client app opened a connection to each of the nodes and was continuously running the following loop per each of them:\r\n\r\n 1. read a value by a key\r\n 2. if the wasn't set then set it to 0\r\n 3. increment the value\r\n 4. write it back\r\n 5. increment a number of successful iterations\r\n 6. repeat the loop\r\n\r\nEach connection used its own key to avoid collision.

After a long time retry, TiDB will return the test client a timeout error, then the test client will connect another TiDB and works.\r\n\r\nIt isn't 100% correct. My data shows that all cluster becomes unavailable so there is no other TiDB to connect to.\r\n\r\nThe test application opened 3 connections to each TiDB of the custer and was testing them independently (measuring the rate of successful operations per connection). After I isolated the first node (I called it a leader because the success rate for that node was higher than for the rest nodes) the rate dropped to zero for the whole cluster and it took more than 2 minutes to recover:\r\n\r\n<pre>86  445 195 126 124\r\n87  474 214 132 128\r\n88  19  8   5   6\r\n89  0   0   0   0\r\n...\r\n247 0   0   0   0\r\n248 29  0   0   29\r\n249 237 0   138 99\r\n250 289 0   179 110\r\n251 314 0   197 117</pre>\r\n\r\nThe first column is number of seconds since the beginning of the experiment, the second is the number of successful read-inc-write iterations per all cluster per last second.

Tidb is Work.  binlog makes some changes, need to be updated together, so I tag a DNM label  Another dip on my way with TiDB:\r\n```ALTER TABLE authors MODIFY name varchar(100) NULL```\r\nTiDB says:\r\n`[ddl:203]unsupported modify column`\r\n\r\nThus, i can't modify fields?\r\n\r\nAnd another one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE payments ALTER date_applied DROP DEFAULT;\r\n```\r\nTiDB reports error:\r\nline 1 column 7 near \" `date_applied` DROP DEFAULT\" (total length 62)\r\n\r\n If it's totally impossible to shrink the lenght of varchar, pls report back 0 altered, instead of rising exception.\r\nBetter to log info about unsupported shrinking for varchars. Returning error will broke things in orm, that relies on mysql features, and mysql can shrink varchar fields. So this error will raise some unexpected and unhandled errors in orm.\r\n\r\nPS\r\nI hope, CHANGE COLUMN ddl will be also supported:\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE `payments`\r\n\tCHANGE COLUMN `name` `name` VARCHAR(155) NOT NULL;\r\n``` Project lifetime usually requires updates and improvements, Schema must not be static.\r\nOften, schema changes requires not only checking every row, but in case of indexed column it requires rebuid all column indexes. If you talking about difficulties for iterating rows in db, pls tell me, what db is for? This is base db feature - to iterate rows, filter them and aggregate their data. There must be no problem with this at all. \r\nA db with static schema is not the one i'm looking for. It's much better to find the way to apply schema changes at petabyte db in a piece of second. The solution is to use information_schema as information about the schema.\r\nSince column altered - schema will contain new lenght and new inserts must meet this property.\r\nWe don't need to achieve goal for every row contain data strongly limited to the schema, operating with part of data defined in schema is enought. Later, on resharding, optimizing or other write operations data will be shrinked according to the schema, no need to enforce this at the ALTER level. IMHO.\r\n If db on_the_fly truncates fileds data according to the schema lenght - no one can select something longer than schema defines.\r\nThus, with truncating even in strict SQL mode the lenght will always meet.\r\nBad way to give away untruncated data. Bad way to store untruncated data.\r\nThus, speed improvement can be achieved with this way. No need to digg all data to truncate them at their place. This can be a very expensive job. This job can be left to the optimize or repair table query. In case of preventing truncation of data - agree. Binary distribution doesn't contain this fix yet? Or this is something different one?\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE `payment_type` MODIFY `name` varchar(100) NULL\r\n[ddl:203]unsupported modify column\r\n``` ./tidb-server -V\r\nGit Commit Hash: 96e8ab6128ad4f2a9b936290d975936f18851e0f\r\nUTC Build Time:  2017-02-13 06:10:08\r\n I suppose this restriction will be for strict sql mode.\r\nFor my case the field lenght equals.\r\nSQL restrictions are default:\r\n`STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION`\r\nRemoving STRICT_TRANS_TABLES from restrictions had no effect on this. ```\r\nCREATE TABLE `payment_type` (\r\n\t`id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\r\n\t`name` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\r\n\t`provider_label` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\r\n\t`descr` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\r\n\tPRIMARY KEY (`id`)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, \r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE `payment_type`\tALTER `name` DROP DEFAULT;\r\n```\r\nDoest't work.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nsomehow `modify` statement got working...\r\nNow, the \r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE `payment_type`\tCHANGE COLUMN `name` `name` VARCHAR(101) NOT NULL default '' AFTER `id`;\r\n```\r\nDoesn't, but \r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE `payment_type`\tCHANGE COLUMN `name` `name` VARCHAR(101) NOT NULL default '';\r\n```\r\nWorks.

What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\n\r\nI am testing out TiDB. As described in the doc, I used 6 machines, 1tidb, 3 pd, and 3 tikv. Things work greatly when adding and querying data. I added ~10M number of records into the system. But when I tried to do horizontal scaling by adding 2 more tikv instances, there is no data moving from other tikv instances. I wait several hours and still no data moved. Then I tried to delete a tikv store using pd-ctrl tool, data starts to move to one of the newly added tikv, but the other newly added tikv still gets no data.\r\n\r\nFor reference, I also tried to add PD and remove it, and things work well. so does adding tidb.\r\n\r\n2. What did you expect to see?\r\nAfter adding 2 more tikv instances, should the system automatically re-balance the data cross all the tikv instances?\r\n\r\n3. What did you see instead?\r\nNo data being moved to the new tikv instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\nI downloaded the latest binary directly from github.\r\n\r\n Clarify, I use the way of checking the sst files under tikv#/db folder to decide if there is data re-balanced over. Just wonder the underlying reason to use such a design choice. Why not just try to evenly distribute data cross all available tikv instances instead, like Cassandra. \r\n\r\nI set min-balance-diff-ratio to a very small value (0.000001) using pd-ctl, and the entire disk is 1TB. Yet, I still did not see the data moved to the empty tikv. NOTE that my previous \"force\" data moving by deleting a tikv is still ongoing. Could this be the cause? The \"force\" data moving itself is very slow, the db folder size is about 5GB, <1GB actually moved to another machine after several hours. \r\n\r\nMore over, let us say capacity is 10G, ratio is 0.1, and 3 tikv instances with data of 4GB each. After adding a new tikv instance, will it evenly re-balance to ~3GB each?\r\n\r\nThanks. The re-balance did eventually reach, but very very slow, taking >58h for my data set.\r\n2017-02-03 14:03:57.528554864 -0800 PST\r\nid regions\r\n1  3026\r\n4  2936\r\n5  2414\r\n17293  94\r\n3907515  94\r\n\r\n2017-02-05 12:43:57.506226421 -0800 PST\r\nid regions\r\n1  1340\r\n4  2400\r\n17293  2643\r\n3907515  2695 BTW, the data size on the re-balanced instances are between 1.5GB ~ 2GB, based on the info returned by http://xxx:2379/pd/api/v1/stores  pymysql.err.ProgrammingError: (1146, \"Table 'information_schema.table_constraints' doesn't exist\")\r\n\r\nWill the information_schema updated to contain the necessary tables?\r\n\r\nThese orm uses several tables from information_schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\n cat mysql.py |grep information_schema\r\n        if case_sensitive: sql = 'SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables ' \\\r\n        else: sql = 'SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables ' \\\r\n        if case_sensitive: sql = 'SELECT index_name FROM information_schema.statistics ' \\\r\n        else: sql = 'SELECT index_name FROM information_schema.statistics ' \\\r\n        if case_sensitive: sql = 'SELECT constraint_name FROM information_schema.table_constraints ' \\\r\n        else: sql = 'SELECT constraint_name FROM information_schema.table_constraints ' \\\r\n\r\n```\r\nOnly information_schema.table_constraints missed in tidb.\r\n\r\n According to [this document](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/table-constraints-table.html) it will be perfect to fill this table with appropriate values.\r\nBecause ponyorm uses this data to determine tables relation.

I saw the second travis check was hanging a few days ago. However, I'm a little busy recently :(\r\nI meant to merge the master to trigger the CI tonight but found that you've already done that.  Does tidb support mysql procedure? any roadmap?  I think it's because we always use `-1` as the prec arg of `strconv.AppendFloat` [here](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/server/util.go#L330).\r\n\r\nTo fix it, we need to know the real prec first.

Guys please review. Thanks guys for your replies. Done.  Hi, @shenli @coocood \r\n\r\nI implemented `FIND_IN_SET` function wanted by #2244. However, I'm still unable to optimize the function according to the official doc:\r\n\r\n> If the first argument is a constant string and the second is a column of type SET, the FIND_IN_SET() function is optimized to use bit arithmetic.\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Set struct {\r\n\tName  string\r\n\tValue uint64\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI see a set can be represented as a uint64, but how could I map _a constant string_ to its binary value? Would you please give me some advices? @shenli I know we can check if the given string is a member of a set by doing things like \"binary_value(str) & strlst.value != 0\". However, I wonder if there is any cheap way to build the 'binary_value' function. @shenli I see this optimization occurs while writing result set. So I need either eval  'binary_value(str)' before 'FIND_IN_SET' and use its result as the first arg or eval 'binary_value(str)' on the first call of 'FIND_IN_SET' and save the result somewhere so that we can reuse it. I haven't looked deep enough. Am I right? or which is the right way? @shenli Got it!  This is the last builtin function wanted by #112 :) I see It's already been in the\r\n`ReservedKeyWord`@https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/parser/parser.y#L2079\r\nand\r\n`reservedKws`@https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/parser/parser_test.go#L51\r\n\r\nIs there any thing else I should do? @shenli   `DateArithInterval` will prevent its inner interval expression from being evaluated, which leads to incorrect results for function calls like `adddate('2011-11-11', least(1,2))`.\r\n\r\nHere is the original logic:\r\n```go\r\nfunc builtinDateArith(args []types.Datum, ctx context.Context) (d types.Datum, err error) {\r\n\t// Op is used for distinguishing date_add and date_sub.\r\n\t// args[0] -> Op\r\n\t// args[1] -> Date\r\n\t// args[2] -> DateArithInterval\r\n\t// health check for date and interval\r\n\tif args[1].IsNull() {\r\n\t\treturn d, nil\r\n\t}\r\n\tnodeDate := args[1]\r\n\tnodeInterval := args[2].GetInterface().(ast.DateArithInterval)\r\n\tnodeIntervalIntervalDatum := nodeInterval.Interval.GetDatum()\r\n\tif nodeIntervalIntervalDatum.IsNull() {\r\n\t\treturn d, nil\r\n\t}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`nodeInterval.Interval` may be a `FuncCallExpr` that not be evaluated by `FoldConstant` (because `DateArithInterval` is not a `ScalarFunction`).\r\n\r\nThus, `nodeIntervalIntervalDatum.IsNull()` returns `true` for aforementioned function call.\r\n\r\nThis PR can solve the issue by disabling the `DateArithInterval`. Is there any better solution? @shenli Not at all. Happy new year :)  Hi, @shenli , here is the LEAST function wanted by #112 , PTAL :) Thanks @ngaut ! this is the simplest function to implement since there is already a GREATEST function implementation.\r\n\r\nI'm working on INTERVAL(), however, there is still a problem. eg:\r\n```\r\nSELECT DATE_ADD('2016-12-31',INTERVAL INTERVAL(1,1) DAY)\r\n```\r\nwill return ```NULL``` instead of  ```2017-01-01``` :(\r\n\r\nI'll try to solve this as soon as possible. @shenli :smile:   I have a host(4core,2GB memory,100GB disk) to run tidb,method like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn/blob/master/op-guide/binary-deployment.md#%E5%8D%95%E8%8A%82%E7%82%B9%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2\r\n\r\nmy test like this:\r\n\r\nsysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-table-engine=innodb --oltp-table-size=1000000  --num-threads=4  --mysql-host=192.168.2.183 --mysql-user='root' --mysql-password='' --mysql-port=4000 --mysql-db='test' prepare\r\n\r\nthis statement is OK.but when I do this:\r\n\r\nsysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-table-engine=innodb --oltp-table-size=1000000  --num-threads=4  --mysql-host=192.168.2.183 --mysql-user='root' --mysql-password='' --mysql-port=4000 --mysql-db='test' run\r\n\r\nit throwed some error like this:\r\n\r\nsysbench 0.4.12:  multi-threaded system evaluation benchmark\r\n\r\nRunning the test with following options:\r\nNumber of threads: 4\r\n\r\nDoing OLTP test.\r\nRunning mixed OLTP test\r\nUsing Special distribution (12 iterations,  1 pct of values are returned in 75 pct cases)\r\nUsing \"BEGIN\" for starting transactions\r\nUsing auto_inc on the id column\r\nMaximum number of requests for OLTP test is limited to 10000\r\nThreads started!\r\nALERT: failed to execute mysql_stmt_execute(): Err1105 Malform packet error\r\nFATAL: database error, exiting...\r\nALERT: failed to execute mysql_stmt_execute(): Err1105 Malform packet error\r\nFATAL: database error, exiting...\r\nALERT: failed to execute mysql_stmt_execute(): Err1105 Malform packet error\r\nFATAL: database error, exiting...\r\nALERT: failed to execute mysql_stmt_execute(): Err1105 Malform packet error\r\nFATAL: database error, exiting...\r\nDone.\r\n\r\nhow to slove this problem?

Also, I found the following behavior. Could you please give me some advice?\r\n\r\n1. What did you do?\r\n```\r\ntidb> SELECT DATE_ADD('2008-01-02', INTERVAL(1, 1) DAY);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

I could resolve these conflicts by the following modification\r\n``` diff\r\ndiff --git a/parser/parser.y b/parser/parser.y\r\nindex 5f7e03e3..016cd49a 100644\r\n--- a/parser/parser.y\r\n+++ b/parser/parser.y\r\n@@ -720,6 +720,9 @@ import (\r\n %precedence lowerThanSQLCache\r\n %precedence sqlCache sqlNoCache\r\n \r\n+%precedence lowerThanIntervalKeyword\r\n+%precedence interval\r\n+\r\n %precedence lowerThanSetKeyword\r\n %precedence set\r\n \r\n@@ -2445,6 +2448,7 @@ FunctionNameConflict:\r\n |\t\"UTC_DATE\"\r\n |\t\"CURRENT_DATE\"\r\n |\t\"VERSION\"\r\n+|\t\"INTERVAL\" %prec lowerThanIntervalKeyword\r\n \r\n FunctionCallConflict:\r\n \tFunctionNameConflict '(' ExpressionListOpt ')'\r\ndiff --git a/parser/parser_test.go b/parser/parser_test.go\r\nindex fc32b3b0..5ca5fbf4 100644\r\n--- a/parser/parser_test.go\r\n+++ b/parser/parser_test.go\r\n@@ -526,6 +526,9 @@ func (s *testParserSuite) TestBuiltin(c *C) {\r\n \r\n \t\t{\"SELECT LEAST(1, 2, 3);\", true},\r\n \r\n+\t\t{\"SELECT INTERVAL(1, 0, 1, 2)\", true},\r\n+\t\t{\"SELECT DATE_ADD('2008-01-02', INTERVAL INTERVAL(1, 0, 1) DAY);\", true},\r\n+\r\n \t\t// Information Functions\r\n \t\t{\"SELECT DATABASE();\", true},\r\n \t\t{\"SELECT SCHEMA();\", true},\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt can pass the test case, however, I'm still not very sure I did the right thing.

It seems that the behavior of tidb (errno) is inconsistent with the mysql, although the error message is clear enough. Does it matter in some cases?\r\n\r\n1.

In my case, I set LDFLAGS=-L/lib/path long time age. So `make server` reports error with flag package. \r\nDo you think it should be `LDFLAGS = ` instead of `+=` at https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/Makefile#L22 ?  Tried to support the function rpad. It goes alright with `make gotest` and `make server`. The rpad query works with my build on mac.

LGTM  Compared with MySQL Cluster,what's the advantage of TiDB? What I mean is not the mysql cluster with proxy,but mysql cluster that MySQL official provides. Thank you for your answer.And i want to know when TiDB can release stable version.  Apologies if I'm just blind and not seeing it, but I see that Views are not supported \"because they cannot be implemented well in distributed scenario.\"\r\n\r\nIs it documented somewhere what the difficulties are with the unsupported features? I feel like this would be important so if somebody has an idea on how to solve the problem, maybe even partially, they know what the known hurdles are. Or maybe something could be optimized in a another way (e.g. try and clump data on fewer nodes, instead of all spread out, so the view would be less expensive).  The [Quick Start](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/docs/QUICKSTART.md) page shows you how to run TiDB via docker on a single container, but real-life usage is going to need us to run this on more than one node (otherwise we might as well just use MySQL).\r\n\r\nIt would be quite nice if you can provide an example setup with TiDB split over several docker containers. \r\n* That allows us to check the exact required configuration needed in a more realistic setup.\r\n* I would expect that it should then be reasonably straight forward to add another node and see how TiDB behaves when such a node is added\r\n* Further more simulating failure of a node should be straightforward with this setup just by stopping one of the containers.\r\n\r\nFor such a test case storage is not really important. This is just for testing but it gives a newcomer an easier way to start to trying out TiDB in a throw-away environment. Docker 1.13 ([RC available](https://github.com/docker/docker/releases)) supports built-in \"Docker Compose on Swarm-mode\" feature\r\nhttps://blog.nimbleci.com/2016/11/17/whats-coming-in-docker-1-13/#deploy-stacks-from-a-docker-compose-file\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we can use TiDB with that feature  I deploy tidb on centos7 all in one node by reading this article https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/master/op-guide/binary-deployment.md#standalone-cluster-deployment\r\n\r\nI got a warning : get timestamp too slow\r\ntow error : [error] [ddl] SetValidity, schema validity is false, lastSuccTS:387990267072086017\r\n\r\n\r\nand when I use mysql client to connect tidb import some data than mysqldump from mysql , I got this error: ERROR 1105 (HY000) at line 420 in file: '/server/software/sdb_b2c_members.sql': InfomationSchema is out of date.\r\n\r\nthis is the log from pd\r\n\r\n2016/11/25 17:19:53 tso.go:122: [warning] clock offset: 201.859059ms, prev: 2016-11-25 17:19:52.868617921 +0800 CST, now: 2016-11-25 17:19:53.07047698 +0800 CST\r\n2016/11/25 17:19:53 tso.go:122: [warning] clock offset: 491.182246ms, prev: 2016-11-25 17:19:53.07047698 +0800 CST, now: 2016-11-25 17:19:53.561659226 +0800 CST\r\n2016/11/25 17:19:53 tso.go:126: [warning] invalid physical timestamp, prev: 2016-11-25 17:19:53.561659226 +0800 CST, now: 2016-11-25 17:19:53.561900752 +0800 CST, re-update later\r\n2016-11-25 17:19:53.680096 W | etcdserver: apply entries took too long [146.04305ms for 1 entries]\r\n2016-11-25 17:19:53.710747 W | etcdserver: avoid queries with large range/delete range!\r\n2016-11-25 17:20:00.761738 W | etcdserver: apply entries took too long [118.253557ms for 1 entries]\r\n2016-11-25 17:20:00.761773 W | etcdserver: avoid queries with large range/delete range!\r\n2016-11-25 17:20:00.938928 W | etcdserver: apply entries took too long [171.67921ms for 1 entries]\r\n2016-11-25 17:20:00.938951 W | etcdserver: avoid queries with large range/delete range!\r\n2016-11-25 17:20:08.578604 W | etcdserver: apply entries took too long [156.535257ms for 1 entries]\r\n2016-11-25 17:20:08.578634 W | etcdserver: avoid queries with large range/delete range!\r\n2016/11/25 17:20:08 tso.go:122: [warning] clock offset: 361.082481ms, prev: 2016-11-25 17:20:08.211681046 +0800 CST, now: 2016-11-25 17:20:08.572763527 +0800 CST\r\n2016-11-25 17:20:12.073173 W | etcdserver: apply entries took too long [25.271654ms for 1 entries]\r\n2016-11-25 17:20:12.073198 W | etcdserver: avoid queries with large range/delete range!\r\n2016/11/25 17:20:23 conn.go:75: [error] read request message err EOF\r\n2016-11-25 17:20:26.627528 W | etcdserver: apply entries took too long [64.413632ms for 1 entries]\r\n2016/11/25 17:20:26 tso.go:122: [warning] clock offset: 184.163556ms, prev: 2016-11-25 17:20:26.409493309 +0800 CST, now: 2016-11-25 17:20:26.593656865 +0800 CST\r\n2016-11-25 17:20:26.627659 W | etcdserver: avoid queries with large range/delete range!\r\n2016/11/25 17:20:29 tso.go:126: [warning] invalid physical timestamp, prev: 2016-11-25 17:20:29.535929191 +0800 CST, now: 2016-11-25 17:20:29.53600628 +0800 CST, re-update later\r\n2016/11/25 17:20:29 tso.go:126: [warning] invalid physical timestamp, prev: 2016-11-25 17:20:29.657106527 +0800 CST, now: 2016-11-25 17:20:29.657619445 +0800 CST, re-update later\r\n2016-11-25 17:20:34.402114 W | etcdserver: apply entries took too long [297.675748ms for 1 entries]\r\n2016-11-25 17:20:34.402151 W | etcdserver: avoid queries with large range/delete range!\r\n2016/11/25 17:20:34 util.go:202: [warning] txn runs too slow, resp: &{cluster_id:2037210783374497686 member_id:13195394291058371180 revision:674 raft_term:2  true [response_put:<header:<revision:674 > > ]}, err: <nil>, cost: 1.838928603s\r\n2016/11/25 17:20:34 tso.go:122: [warning] clock offset: 2.061606613s, prev: 2016-11-25 17:20:32.459558159 +0800 CST, now: 2016-11-25 17:20:34.521164772 +0800 CST\r\n\r\n\r\nI see the log string like '2016/11/25 17:25:15 leader.go:195: [info] PD cluster leader pd is ready to serve '  in the pd log many times\r\n\r\nwhat does it mean? please help me thank you for help me.\r\nWhen I use 3 virtual machines( every virtual machines has 4 cores and 2G ram) to deploy tidb, I also got that problem.  what should I do ?\r\n ok,thank you.\r\nI will try do a test on aliyun use 6 ecs machine(4 cores, 16G ram)  LGTM  standalone-cluster-deployment is success\r\nbut multi-nodes-deployment is fail\r\nMy step:\r\n\r\n\r\n|Name|Host IP|Services|\r\n|----|-------|--------|\r\n|node1|192.168.50.171|PD1, TiKV1, TiDB|\r\n|node2|192.168.50.172|PD2, TiKV2|\r\n|node3|192.168.50.173|PD3, TiKV3|\r\n\r\n1.

A convenient command in MySQL is CHECKSUM TABLE <tablename> and this command is not currently supported by TiDB.\n\nAdding it would make it easy to confirm if the data loaded in from an external source matches or not.\n\nExample I did something like:\n\n`$ ssh mysqlhost sudo mysqldump test SomeTable | mysql -h tidbhost -P 4000 -u root -D test`\n\nMySQL 5.6:\n\n```\nroot@mysqlhost [test]> checksum table SomeTable;\n+-----------+------------+\n| Table     | Checksum   |\n+-----------+------------+\n| SomeTable | 2867272629 |\n+-----------+------------+\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\n```\n\nTiDB:\n\n```\nroot@tidbhost [test]> checksum table SomeTable;\nERROR 1105 (HY000): line 0 column 8 near \" table SomeTable\"\nroot@tidbhost [test]> \n```\n\nSo providing some sort of CHECKSUM table command would be great.\n  I think we can support `SHOW MASTER STATUS` in order to make TiDB more friendly to be synchronized.\n\nUse scenario:\nWhile we deploy TiDB-Binlog,  we can do like blew:\n1. deploy pump and cistern component to persist Binlog.\n2. use  [myDumper](https://github.com/maxbube/mydumper) to dump TiDB data, schema, meta to file at one time point\n3. read metadata file to get dump point **max ts over all TiDBs**, then use the ts start drainer to sync binlog to target db.\n\n[[myDumper](https://github.com/maxbube/mydumper)] How to dump data?\n\n```\n1. Connect db\n2. FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK\n3. START TRANSACTION /!40108 WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT\n4. SHOW MASTER STATUS\n5. Create child threads\n       [child thread]\n      1.

Another follow up question: Is there a plan to implement a way to start the server without using the binary, so it can be a fully embedded solution?

What did you see instead?\n   Errors reported from liteIDE informs that \u201cFail to start the process\u201d\n @shenli But when I press 'F5' and try to debug the project , the IDE reports  \"16:43:56 debug: not find execute file in path C:/Users/Hplong/Documents/projects/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb\" , which means I don't have the .exe file of the project. Now I can run the parser_test.go and tidb_test.go through the liteIDE, but I just can not debug the code step by step . Should I create a new empty project, and then  copy the tidb project files in it, invoking the functions in *_test.go? Or do you have any other suggestion?\n @ngaut Ok, I am trying to debug it on windows.\n@shenli Now I use the \"make server\" under the TiDB dictionary, and it reports\n\"C:\\Users\\Hplong\\Documents\\projects\\go\\src\\github.com\\pingcap\\tidb>make server\n[Parser]\nParse table entries: 420495 of 1042566, x 16 bits == 840990 bytes\nParse table entries: 420495 of 1042566, x 16 bits == 840990 bytes\n[Build]\ngodep: No Godeps found (or in any parent directory)\n[Install]\ngodep: No Godeps found (or in any parent directory)\n[Test]\ngodep: No Godeps found (or in any parent directory)\n[Done]\"\nAnd there is only a \"main.go\" file under tidb-server dictionary, I can not find the binary file in tidb-server, so it's still not working now.

Not sure if your team decided on how to release tidb native package for different OS.\n\nI like to propose using [Jeninkin project's packaging framework](https://github.com/jenkinsci/packaging). \n\nThis my effort on [packaging gogs](https://github.com/tjyang/gogspkg) using the same packaging framework for Go supported OS. it will be pushed back into https://github.com/gogits/packaging\n > We haven't considered about packaging. In most common scenario, TiDB will be deployed together with TiKV and PD. \n\nSorry, I haven't use golang to create tidb binary by myself yet. Will TiKV and PB be part of tidb main binary ? if it is not part of same binary that is ok too. \n\n> Will it be a good solution for this scenario?\n\nYes, I think so. I think Jenkins' packaging framework is flexible enough and it is battle tested. Also it is designed for CI/CD.  One just need to change the target from jenkins.war to tidb related files.\nOne concern I have is the license compatibility. \n > So our Ti storage solution contains three components. I think docker is a better solution. Especially TiKV depends on RocksDB which depends on gcc/clang with C++11 support, gflags, snappy and so on. Docker will make the deployment easier.\n\nJenekin's packaging frame work has [docker packaging solution](https://github.com/jenkinsci/packaging/tree/master/docker) also.  docker is just one of ways to deliver software. Agree docker is good but not every one is using or have to use docker.  It is good to have a software support native package format for  different OS.\n > Thank you for your advice.\n\nSorry, I may sounded my providing advice. This is just a need from a potential user.  Currently my work place is not  one of the docker users. We deploy software using yum or apt-get into production Linux systems, not docker.\n\nAlso PinCAP doesn't have to do the whole native packaging stuff yourselves. People want the native tidb package will contribute and test too. \n\nFor me, I will create rpm for my tidb testing purpose. I like to see how well gogs work with tidb.\n\nThanks for your time and listening.\n  [![CLA assistant check](https://cla-assistant.io/pull/badge/not_signed)](https://cla-assistant.io/pingcap/tidb?pullRequest=1179) <br/>Thank you for your submission, we really appreciate it.

All perfschema tables support `SELECT` operations, but some tables support different operations, such as, `setup_timers` table support `UPDATE` only, `events_xxx` tables support `TRUNCATE` only, how to code w/ memory tables?\n2. How to use `table.Table` interface to simulate `UPDATE` operation?\n LGTM\uff0cafter discussed w/ @shenli , I will add another special memory table for events_xxx tables once the instrumentation efficiency is really a problem.\n  Support `INSERT` operation for `setup_actors` & `setup_objects`, other tables are `UPDATE` only.\n PTAL @shenli @qiuyesuifeng \n  when i download the latest code from master branch, and execute make command:\n\nit reports error like this:\n\nstore/hbase/kv.go:207: too many arguments in call to oracles.NewRemoteOracle\ngodep: go exit status 2\n\ncould you guys shed some light on this?\n @shenli it solved after executing \"make update\"\n\nThanks\n  Require an explicit usage of int64 for `MinInt64` as constant.\n\n```\noptimizer\\plan\\range.go:467: constant -9223372036854775808 overflows int\noptimizer\\plan\\range.go:484: constant -9223372036854775808 overflows int\noptimizer\\plan\\range.go:486: constant 9223372036854775807 overflows int\n```\n\nThis fixes compilation on systems where `int` doesn't default to int64.\n @coocood done :)\n  This essentially allows users of the \"tidb\" driver insteadof the mysql protocol\nto decide on their own if they want to use the string form of a `mysql.Time`\nor prefer working with the internal `time.Time` object, which should also reduce a tiny bit\nof overhead for these cases.\n\nSince mysql.Time.String() only access the time.Time object and doesn't depend\non any other internal data at the moment, this should be safe.\n @coocood \nseems like I missed that `fsp` part, and im unsure how important it is, \nsince you do not really need this information: \nyou can get up to nanosecond precision and anyways know how you defined the column\nschema-wise.\nSo using `time.Time` would actually be more flexible for you.\n\nfor `mysql.Date` and `mysql.Time` it should not matter, since the needed information is\nstored in the `time.Time` object regardless of the underlying implementation.\n\nIs there anything unclear or something I'm missing or \nmaybe even an implementation, which allows the same flexibility with more functionality?\n @coocood \nthe reasoning behind this is flexibility:\nif the driver outputs a `string`, I have to parse it manually each time. \n(which includes overhead of time -> string -> time)\n\nIf the driver outputs a `time`, I can decide whether I want to scan it into a `Time` or a `string`,\nor perform any conversion or time specific function to it.\n\nIf the precision is so important, which I do not really see for any practical project,\nanother solution would be to just return a `mysql.Time`, which allows a similar\namount of flexibility but would probably require a manual call of `.String()` since `.Scan` \nwon't support these cases.\n\nIs that something you think would be better?\n Adapting the behavior of mysqls driver is also a possibility, I'll look into it soon.\n @coocood implemented and working\n  hard to split into 2 PRs for `SELECT` only, revised support for `SELECT` functions:\n1. using goleveldb instead of map only for concurrent considerations (INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE/TRUNCATE).\n2. code refactoring.\n Really appreciate ur careful review and quick response.\n  Code refactoring:\n1. remove the implementation from `plan/plans`.\n2. add `perfschema/const.go` and `perfschema/common/go`\n\nPTAL, @shenli @coocood \n  I refactored the code and added INSERT support, unfortunately the `SELECT` returned garbled characters, I got a headache today and can't find out what happened so far.\n\n@qiuyesuifeng @shenli @coocood , please review first since this PR is a little bit big, I will continue working on fixing it.\n Thanks @coocood @shenli , I have solved the garbled characters problem, will split this PR and open several new PRs.\n  Is this feature done or any alternative\uff1f  All `performance_schema` tables created FOR `SELECT` only.\n  Authentication passed when given any username with an empty password.\n Sorry, i don't know how to do this.\n is that ok?\n  In the process of testing TPCC, I find a bug.

If I'm using mysql, I get the following error:\n\n```\nNo error for first insert\n\n(Error 1062: Duplicate entry 'fooaaa@gmail.com' for key 'uix_accounts_email')\n[2016-01-04 05:52:52]\nError: Error in second insert, Error 1062: Duplicate entry 'fooaaa@gmail.com' for key 'uix_accounts_email'\nexit status 1\n```\n\nIf I'm using tidb: \n\n```\nNo error for first insert\nNo error for second insert\n```\n\nLogs:\n\n```\n2016/01/04 03:53:43 session.go:393: [warning] session:{\n  \"currDBName\": \"testdb\",\n  \"sid\": 3\n}, err:[kv:3]key already exist\n2016/01/04 03:53:43 conn.go:240: [error] dispatch error [kv:3]key already exist\n/opt/goworkspace/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/kv/union_store.go:179:\n/opt/goworkspace/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/store/localstore/txn.go:88:\n/opt/goworkspace/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/store/localstore/txn.go:111:\n/opt/goworkspace/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/session.go:175:\n/opt/goworkspace/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/tidb.go:181:\n/opt/goworkspace/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/session.go:394:\n/opt/goworkspace/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/tidb-server/server/conn.go:367: , conn: 192.168.99.1:50566, status: 2, charset: utf8, user: root, lastInsertId: 2\n2016/01/04 03:53:43 conn.go:241: [error] cmd: COMMIT\n2016/01/04 03:53:43 server.go:156: [info] close conn: 192.168.99.1:50566, status: 2, charset: utf8, user: root, lastInsertId: 2\n```\n Thank you very much for your quick answer ! If it is an easy fix I'll be glad to help with a PR.\n\nI think something is wrong with the wire response and gorm is not detecting it.\n Yes. It is fixed. Thank you ! But it doesn't say which key is duplicate. It will be difficult to debug which key is the problem.\n\nWill it work after [this PR](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/631) will be merged ? \n\n```\nNo error for first insert\nError: Error in second insert, Error 1062: key already exist\nexit status 1\n```\n Thank you !\n  Hi,\n\nI would like to find a start point to contribute some code. This start point should be a stable version of source code, which is better to be recent enough(to minimize the effort of merging PR back in future). I check out the master branch with currently latest commit(d64166c), but it fails to build through with errors like:\n\n``` shell\n$ make\ngo get github.com/tools/godep\ngo get github.com/pingcap/go-hbase\ngo get github.com/pingcap/go-themis\ngo get github.com/ngaut/tso/client\ngo get github.com/qiuyesuifeng/goyacc\ngo get github.com/qiuyesuifeng/golex\ngoyacc -o /dev/null -xegen temp_parser_file parser/parser.y\nParse table entries: 323944 of 831792, x 16 bits == 647888 bytes\ngoyacc -o parser/parser.go -xe temp_parser_file parser/parser.y 2>&1 | egrep \"(shift|reduce)/reduce\" | awk '{print} END {if (NR > 0) {print \"Find conflict in parser.y.

Is there any dev workflow that should be followed?\n @ngaut @qiuyesuifeng Thank you both for the quick answer. The problem solved.\n  add txn.Rollback on txn error\n  I find interface **Visitor** was defined in three go files.\n\n``` c\nast.go (tidb\\ast):type Visitor interface {\nplan.go (tidb\\optimizer\\plan):type Visitor interface {\nvisitor.go (tidb\\expression):type Visitor interface {\n```\n\nIn particular, the definitions in plan.go and ast.go are exactly the same.\n\n``` go\ntype Visitor interface {\n    // Enter is called before children nodes are visited.\n    // The returned node must be the same type as the input node n.\n    // skipChildren returns true means children nodes should be skipped,\n    // this is useful when work is done in Enter and there is no need to visit children.\n    Enter(n Node) (node Node, skipChildren bool)\n    // Leave is called after children nodes have been visited.\n    // The returned node's type can be different from the input node if it is a ExprNode,\n    // Non-expression node must be the same type as the input node n.\n    // ok returns false to stop visiting.\n    Leave(n Node) (node Node, ok bool)\n}\n```\n\nwhat's the meaning of this interface?

I have reformatted these code and it passes checks now.\n\nIt's somewhat tricky to handle all the type castings and return type variations. I change a few test cases to adjust the behavior a little bit.\nPlease note, there are a few points where the behavior differs from mysql:\n\n#### 1. type cast from float string to interval\n\nIn mysql:\n\n``` text\nmysql> select adddate(\"2011-11-11 10:10:10\", 19.88);\n+---------------------------------------+\n| adddate(\"2011-11-11 10:10:10\", 19.88) |\n+---------------------------------------+\n| 2011-12-01 10:10:10                   |\n+---------------------------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> select adddate(\"2011-11-11 10:10:10\", \"19.88\");       \n+-----------------------------------------+\n| adddate(\"2011-11-11 10:10:10\", \"19.88\") |\n+-----------------------------------------+\n| 2011-11-30 10:10:10                     |\n+-----------------------------------------+\n1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)\n```\n\nSince casting float to int will round the float value, but casting string to int (which contains a float value) will truncate the float value. I couldn't find a existing function in `types` package will do this exact conversion. So, in this PR, both cases hehave the same and return `2011-12-01 10:10:10`.\n\n#### 2. loose conversion from string to int\n\nIn mysql, it supports a loose conversion from string to int, so we get:\n\n``` text\n\nmysql> select adddate(\"2011-11-11 10:10:10\", \"10,11\"); \n+-----------------------------------------+\n| adddate(\"2011-11-11 10:10:10\", \"10,11\") |\n+-----------------------------------------+\n| 2011-11-21 10:10:10                     |\n+-----------------------------------------+\n1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> select adddate(\"2011-11-11 10:10:10\", \"10-11\");\n+-----------------------------------------+\n| adddate(\"2011-11-11 10:10:10\", \"10-11\") |\n+-----------------------------------------+\n| 2011-11-21 10:10:10                     |\n+-----------------------------------------+\n1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)\n```\n\nIn this PR, the above cases are reported as errors because `types.Convert()` doesn't support this kind of loose conversion.\n @coocood \nYes, I notice it mentions that strict mode on conversion is required in the source code, so loose conversion from string to int should be prohibited on purpose.\n\nI don't quite understand the evolvement/history of copying code from `expression/date_arith_test.go` to `evaluator_test.go`. Could you help to elaborate it? It looks like that both `expression/date_arith.go` and `evaluator.go` have some codes works for similar functionality. Why duplicate?\n @ngaut Referring to the code in `expression/date_arith.go` (thank @coocood for the above comments), I modify the code of this PR so that all the test cases remain still as `expression/date_arith_test.go`. All test cases go through OK now. And behaviors mentioned above keep the same with mysql, including the parsing of `\"19.88\"`, `\"10,11\"`, `\"10-11\"` for day interval.\n  Wondering if i can debug myself for the support of PHP applications. If any guide/blog post for hello world is appreciated.\n sorry to be trouble maker.. just ..\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/659311/11831752/7a9f7fe4-a3ec-11e5-9490-845d6533a333.png)\n\ni tried a go get command success, but make fail\n ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/659311/11831815/1e6335b2-a3ed-11e5-920f-42df323f4c76.png)\n Does it support mac ?\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/659311/11831942/78869560-a3ee-11e5-96bf-46c1ab89f353.png)\n i just download it this morning with the quickstart guide, so it probably is latest.\n\noutput too long,just capture errors\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/659311/11832261/900b6500-a3f1-11e5-8e99-b0342be35b44.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/659311/11832258/8998f23c-a3f1-11e5-8896-29608aeaed7d.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/659311/11832270/a9345514-a3f1-11e5-8be8-311228867445.png)\n yes, can compile on Mac now.\n  I find tidb support built-in function substring, but don't support substr. substr is used very frequently\nIn Oracle and MySQL projects. \nWe can find the description of substr in MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual in url:\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-functions.html#function_substr\nwhich said:\nSUBSTR() is a synonym for SUBSTRING().\n\nThis patch is to support substr.

Most spatial databases allow representing simple geometric objects such as points, lines and polygons. Some spatial databases handle more complex structures such as 3D objects, topological coverages, linear networks, and TINs. While typical databases are designed to manage various numeric and character types of data, additional functionality needs to be added for databases to process spatial data types efficiently. These are typically called geometry or feature. The Open Geospatial Consortium created the Simple Features specification and sets standards for adding spatial functionality to database systems.\n```\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_database\n https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/geo-support/python/ \nNow days, we built social apps with geospatial query and store data. We also store and query JSON format.   MySQL 5.7 added JSON support, Better spatial support, They were good for modern DEV needed.\n Any milestone for this feature. Geospatial and realtime?

But for version before 4.0, `make` fail to use modified PATH to search these commands godep/golex/goyacc/golint, which are installed in GOPATH/bin. So we need to specify these commands with full path.\n\nIt passes tests under `make` 4.0(Debian Linux), 3.81, 4.1(Mac OS X).\n @shenli It's fixed. I forgot that GOPATH could contain multiple paths.\n  Hi,\n\nI follow the instructions in `docs/QUICKSTART.md`:\n\n``` shell\ngit clone https://github.com/pingcap/tidb.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb\nmake\n```\n\nbut fail to build the project. After executing command `make`, it reports errors like:\n\n``` text\ngo get github.com/tools/godep\ngo get github.com/pingcap/go-hbase\ngo get github.com/pingcap/go-themis\ngo get github.com/ngaut/tso/client\ngo get github.com/qiuyesuifeng/goyacc\ngo get github.com/qiuyesuifeng/golex\ngoyacc -o /dev/null -xegen temp_parser_file parser/parser.y; \\\n    goyacc -o parser/parser.go -xe temp_parser_file parser/parser.y 2>&1 | egrep \"(shift|reduce)/reduce\" | awk '{print} END {if (NR > 0) {print \"Find conflict in parser.y.

After I add `$GOPATH/bin` to `PATH`, the error is gone now.\n\nI think putting this prerequisite for `PATH` in docs would be better. Or ensuring the `PATH` contains `$GOPATH/bin` in Makefile at the very first of the build process.\n Add this code into the head part of `Makefile` should work(to avoid manually setting PATH, no need of #614)\n\n``` makefile\nexport PATH := $(GOPATH)/bin:$(PATH)\n```\n\nPlease notice that the default `make` program(version 3.81) in Mac OS X is too old and fail to find `golex`/`goyacc` correctly using variable `PATH`(probably a bug).  To make the above line of code work correctly, you need to upgrade its version or install `make` from homebrew(which contains latest version 4.1 `make`, installed with prefix `g`).\n @ngaut Sure.

Any implementation of this interface should be able to work with UnionStore.\n\nCurrently there are two `MemBuffer` implementations:\n- `memDbBuffer` using `memdb` from `goleveldb`\n- `btreeBuffer` using `btree` from `memkv` \n\nAdd some micro-benchmark comparing performance of the two implementations:\n\n```\nBenchmarkBTreeBufferSequential-8           1    1353185830 ns/op    225864832 B/op  13500988 allocs/op\nBenchmarkBTreeBufferRandom-8               1    1705782034 ns/op    219036992 B/op  13011734 allocs/op\nBenchmarkMemDbBufferSequential-8          10     148360815 ns/op    13759944 B/op          5 allocs/op\nBenchmarkMemDbBufferRandom-8               5     237867121 ns/op    15811740 B/op          9 allocs/op\nBenchmarkBTreeIter-8                     100      16262683 ns/op     1600144 B/op     100002 allocs/op\nBenchmarkMemDbIter-8                     100      13160985 ns/op         245 B/op          3 allocs/op\nBenchmarkBTreeCreation-8            20000000           100 ns/op          72 B/op          2 allocs/op\nBenchmarkMemDbCreation-8               10000        249574 ns/op     1059780 B/op          8 allocs/op\n```\n\nMemDbBuffer is faster and an educated guess is because it pre-allocates a big chunk of memory.\n\nThere is another try with a modified version of memdb(removing all locking instructions, it's not being used in multi-thread environment) but the performance improvement is trivial, therefore it's not included in this PR.\n\nRight now UnionStore is still using memdb as the storage engine.\n Squashed all commits into one and updated function names and comments.\n  Current kv_test `checkSeek` is not complete. For non-existing key seeking, it only covers the case that seeking key is larger the max key and the expected behavior is to have an invalid iterator returned; but the case that the non-existing seeking key is between existing keys is not covered and their current behaviors are just inverse:\n- seek beyond maximum: an invalid iterator is returned, this has already been tested.\n- seek between existing keys: a valid iterator is returned which has been positioned at the key that is the smallest one larger than the seeking key. This the the test case added by this PR.\n\nThis PR has not changed any kv implementation but just added test cases to reveal this behavior.\n  I see in the func CreateTableStmt.Exec(), CreateTableStmt.IfNotExists member  not pass to ddl.CreateTable(), so the sql \"create table if not exist\" will not work. \n yeah, Create database, it works, but I mean the create table .\n I saw this, but notice the CreateTableStmt.IfNotExists not pass to sessionctx.GetDomain(ctx).DDL().CreateTable(ctx, s.Ident.Full(ctx), s.Cols, s.Constraints), so the error never be ddl.ErrExists,\n ok, I will fix it..it is easy.\n @shenli :) you are right. but is it correctly? I mean in mysql, if I wanna replace my table definition, I can just use \"create table\", and tidb return error when it was duplicated anyway.\n I know what you mean, and It is diffrent from mysql, So I get confused..\n no, if you use \"create table test xxx\", and the table test is already existed, mysql will replace it, tidb is diffrent, but you don't have to follow mysql, because I think tidb is more safe in this way.\n sorry, my test code drop it before I create it, you are right...\n  Possibly related to #88. \n\nRunning 64 bit Linux with Go 1.5\n\n```\n$ go get -u github.com/pingcap/tidb\n# github.com/pingcap/tidb/parser\n../../../github.com/pingcap/tidb/parser/yy_parser.go:17: undefined: yyLexer\n../../../github.com/pingcap/tidb/parser/yy_parser.go:18: undefined: yyParse\n```\n\nI also manually used `go get` for `github.com/qiuyesuifeng/golex` and `github.com/qiuyesuifeng/goyacc`. It didn't help. \n\nI'm following the information [here](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md).

Didn't know it was needed ;-).It works now - thank you :-). \n\nPerhaps the use of the `Makefile` should be documented at `USAGE.md` as well?\n  Shall maximum retry limit be configurable by user or hard-coded? Also, I found this post might be helpful to implement the backoff: http://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html \n Sounds good for me.

For example, something like: \n\n``` SQL\nSELECT * FROM scores ORDER BY points DESC LIMIT 5 SUBSCRIBE\n```\n\nwould return the top 5 scores the first time it is called, but it would also continue returning results to the calling function (Goroutine?) whenever the result changes. \n\nTo unsubscribe from this notification, you could later send:\n\n``` SQL\nSELECT * FROM scores ORDER BY points DESC LIMIT 5 UNSUBSCRIBE\n```\n\nEven more flexible would be a way to receive JSON updates to your API:\n\n``` SQL\nSELECT * FROM scores ORDER BY points DESC LIMIT 5 SUBSCRIBE JSON  `http://localhost:8000/update-score`\n```\n\nThoughts?\n shame you didn't put this into some kind of todo list, even if longer term. I think you will regret it down the line.\n  When following the examples in README.md , we found the mysql cmd will use the current system name as user name to connect to the server. When It's not root, users will get the access denied error and be confused.\n\nUpdate the mysql cmd in README.md to make it clear.\n  Is there any test code which could be used to test these time functions? If someone adds support for a time funtion, how to make sure the newly added function is working?\n @ngaut The tests for mysql would be some good reference. I'm looking for some test codes like unit tests in TiDB to test these time functions, so that newly added time functions could be tested before submitted to the main branch.\n May I suggest that `unix_timestamp()` is a critical function that should be supported, especially in light of `from_unixtime()` already being implemented.\r\n\r\nThe current lack of both `unix_timestamp()` and `tiemstampdiff()` makes it very difficult to do timestamp comparisons. @shenli thank you -- `unix_timestamp()` works! [omnidb](https://github.com/OmniDB/OmniDB) can be handy, but it fails to login tidb because it executes a `SELECT TIMEDIFF(NOW(), UTC_TIMESTAMP())` right after authentication and function `utc_timestamp()` is not supported yet, expect tidb to improve and benefit the eco  @shenli Not at all, I will do it later. @ngaut yes, i confirm the fix 395a9c6129239f27d007aee10309531d4a718f86  solves the issue raised earlier, omnidb client can login to Tidb and function `UTC_TIMESTAMP` works just fine, THANKS guys !  pls add ponyorm for python to the list  2015/09/19 21:39:04 session.go:235: [error] Syntax error: /\\* mysql-connector-java-5.1.35 ( Revision: 5fb9c5849535c13917c2cf9baaece6ef9693ef27 ) */SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name ='language' OR Variable_name = 'net_write_timeout' OR Variable_name = 'interactive_timeout' OR Variable_name = 'wait_timeout' OR Variable_name = 'character_set_client' OR Variable_name = 'character_set_connection' OR Variable_name = 'character_set' OR Variable_name = 'character_set_server' OR Variable_name = 'tx_isolation' OR Variable_name = 'transaction_isolation' OR Variable_name = 'character_set_results' OR Variable_name = 'timezone' OR Variable_name = 'time_zone' OR Variable_name = 'system_time_zone' OR Variable_name = 'lower_case_table_names' OR Variable_name = 'max_allowed_packet' OR Variable_name = 'net_buffer_length' OR Variable_name = 'sql_mode' OR Variable_name = 'query_cache_type' OR Variable_name = 'query_cache_size' OR Variable_name = 'license' OR Variable_name = 'init_connect'\n Passed, thanks.\nI got more errors:\n\n## 2015/09/19 22:52:40 conn.go:257: [error] cmd: -- MySQL dump 10.13  Distrib 5.5.34, for Linux (x86_64)\n\n-- Host: localhost    Database: icar_qa\n\n---\n\n-- Server version   5.5.34-log\n/*!40101 SET @OLD_CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT=@@CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT */;\n\nSeems you didn't ignore comments.\n  > Written in Go\n> Enjoy TiDB as much as we love Go.

When `RowIterFunc` returns `(false, nil)`, `plan.Do` returns immediately.\n The \"extra\" goroutine in `driver.go` is only a performance optimization. It is not necessary to do it that way. However, it enables to produce a result set in parallel/concurrently to consuming it.\n Of course. That's why the channel is buffered with a limited number of items. I think it's 1000 rows. IOW, _\"fetching all rows before return to user\"_ does not apply. At most 1000 additional rows _may_ get fetched in paralell to what the user/client already consumed. And the constant, 1000, can be tuned to a lower value probably without any serious performance degradartion.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's completely your decision how to design things.

This is my first week at work after vacations and a lot of issues accumulated meanwhile.\n\nMaybe there's some chance through this weekend, but I cannot really promise anything, so please don't be disappointed when that opportunity fails (family, etc.).\n @coocood I'll try to get rid of the S/R conflicts one parser state at time. Your task will be to review and carefully test those changes, ok?\n\nI have to say that I have never before worked with a language which mixes identifiers and keywords and that whoever of the MySQL authors came with that idea introduced a lot of trouble for the grammar writers. I'm not sure if I can resolve all the conflicts :-1: \n  SGTM\n  It seems that [parser.y](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/8920a55dab883c1ca064b978fe88aea28ef6c29b/parser/parser.y) has several shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts.\n\nS/R conflicts are _sometimes_ expected and/or acceptable, but I don't think this applies in this case. R/R conflicts, on the other hand, are almost never okay.\n\nThe current state of the grammar with all of the conflicts means that there are valid sentences, part of the intended-to-parse language, which will parse incorrectly or not at all because the grammar is ambiguous and does not reflect the proper language.\n\nI suggest to get rid of _all_ conflicts in `parser.y` and, above that, perhaps use the `-cr` goyacc flag to verify reducibility of all grammar productions.\n  Hi,\nwhen running the tests I get a failure:\n\n```\nFAIL: time_test.go:292: testTimeSuite.TestCodec\n\ntime_test.go:305:\n    c.Assert(t.String(), Not(Equals), t1.String())\n... obtained string = \"2010-10-10 10:11:11\"\n... expected string = \"2010-10-10 10:11:11\n```\n\nI think the problem is that the tested timezone is equal to my local timezone while it is assumed to be different.\n `Europe/Rome` which is equivalent to the tested `Europe/Berlin`.\n Yep, it works now.\nThanks for the fast fix!\n  Thanks!\n  When I try to delete, it panic.\n\n```\n[xorm] [info]  2015/09/08 09:35:50.145837 [sql] DELETE FROM `userinfo` WHERE `id` = ?

Please put that file somewhere. The repository root is possibly a convenient place.\n- I suggest to use a distinct name for the QL license file, like, for example `QL-LICENSE`, to not confuse the TIDB and QL licenses. In such case the QL copyright comments in source code should probably be updated to s/LICENSE/QL-LICENSE/.\n- The util/format.go is not copyright `ql authors`, but `strutil authors`. I suggest to use the name `STRUTIL-LICENSE` and put the copy of that [license](https://github.com/cznic/strutil/blob/1eb03e3cc9d345307a45ec82bd3016cde4bd4464/LICENSE) in either the repo root or in the `util` directory.\n\nI suggest to reopen this issue or fill a new one as a reminder to solve these final nits.\n\nThank you very much for your kind cooperation.\n @c4pt0r I see no problem with that approach.\n @qiuyesuifeng I think PR #74 , already merged, did the same.\n  This repository publishes code copied from and/or based on copyrighted 3rd party code published under specific licenses; without fulfilling the terms defined in those licenses. Particularly, the original license comments in the original files were removed and replaced by a license claim of the infringing party. That's not acceptable. Also, it's just silly, as the original licenses _permit_ to use/modify/republish or even sell the code without having to pay anything to the authors of the original code.\n\n**Examples**\n- [format.go](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/82ee778d9b1592b877e8895af8fb1dbc474c3cbd/util/format/format.go) contains verbatim copies of parts of code originaly published in [strutil.go](https://github.com/cznic/strutil/blob/1eb03e3cc9d345307a45ec82bd3016cde4bd4464/strutil.go).\n- [btree.go](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/82ee778d9b1592b877e8895af8fb1dbc474c3cbd/kv/memkv/btree.go) contains verbatim copies of parts of code originaly published in [btree.go](https://github.com/cznic/ql/blob/9c77931b60c6317f94de402268bbc3e8334b71f4/btree.go).\n- Many files found in the [plan directory](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/tree/82ee778d9b1592b877e8895af8fb1dbc474c3cbd/plan) contain code clearly derived and/or parts sometimes verbatim copied from code originally published in [plan.go](https://github.com/cznic/ql/blob/9c77931b60c6317f94de402268bbc3e8334b71f4/plan.go).\n\nIn only minutes, I was able to found tens of similar additional copyright infringements. Also, this repository now has 100+ of forks and every single fork has the same copyright issue.\n\nIn essence, this project is an adaption/extension of the [QL](https://github.com/cznic/ql) project for other SQL syntax and features, including alternative back-ends. (Which is, in sum, an amazing achievement - sincere congratulations.)\n\nTo the owners, maintainers of this repository: Please let me know your thoughts/plans/intentions related to this issue.
